Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's First Quarter 2014 

 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Jon Cappon, Manager of Investor 
Relations at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Jon Cappon
 
Thank you, Operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our first quarter earnings release, which is available on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website and we anticipate 
filing our first q
uarter 10
-
Q with the SEC later today day which will be 
available on our website at that time and as well. Joining me on the call 
today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Maxted, 
Chief Exploration Officer; and Greg Dunlevy, Chief F
inancial Officer.
 
Following our prepared comments, we will have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Consistent with prior calls, I request that participants to ask only 
one primary question and then one follow
-
up question. This will help ensure 
we get to all wh

to get to within our 45 minutes timeframe, please contact me later today.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based o
n our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measure
s are important in looking at the 
Company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our 
financi
al statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Andy.

hand understanding of our operations and the local context in which we 
work. This effort was a valuable exercise that confirmed for the reasons I 
came to Kosmos. First, we have a world class exploration team with big 
technical 
expertise and a disciplined approach to identifying maturing and 
high

hareholders; namely building production and 
reserves in Ghana and delivering exploration success through our industry 
leading portfolio.

have a solid balance sheet that gives us the 
ability to fund the drilling of our 
exploration portfolio as well as our development projects in Ghana.
 


 

performance; our second inning exploration portfolio; our financial strength; 

quarter operating performa
nce. This was a solid quarter financially and with 
good operational performance in Ghana. The FPSO had high uptime in the 
Jubilee Field produce at a rate of approximately 102,000 barrels of oil per 
day sales through the quarter.
 
This production, combined w
ith lower cost in most areas delivered strong 
bottom line results. During my recent trip to Ghana I toured the FPSO, the 
gas processing plant and the related pipeline infrastructure. I also met with 

y belief that all 
parties involved recognize importance of resolving the gas handling 
challenge. The Jubilee partners and the government of Ghana view the 

various stakeholders to a
ddress this challenge. Greg will discuss our 
quarterly results and future guidance in more detail shortly.
 
Turning to exploration, we reached TD at our FA
-
1 well offshore Morocco late 
last week. This was the first test of our second inning exploration port
folio 
but unfortunately failed to find hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. 
Importantly the well was drilled on time and on budget, demonstrating our 
operational readiness to execute our exploration program. In addition, as a 
result of our farm out the f
inancial cost is negligible.
 
In a few minutes, Brian will give you a full update on the well and how we 
believe the results improve our chances of opening the Agadir Basin. I 
believe we have and continue to build a second inning exploration portfolio 
with 

valuation of our recent 3D seismic programs as we mature prospects of 
drilling stage in Morocco, Mauritania, Suriname and Ireland. The next well 
will be on the Ghana prospect offshore camp Ess
aouira which we plan to 
spud late this year.
 
Turning to our financials trend; a strong balance sheet and robust liquidity is 
a key part of our business strategy as it enables us to fund our exploration 
program and development projects. Following an amendme
nt and extension 
of our reserve base loan, we now have total corporate liquidity at quarter 
end of $1.5 billion. This puts Kosmos in its strongest financial position ever 
as we start the second inning. With Jubilee generating considerable cash 
flow on our 
existing liquidity, we continue to differentiate ourselves from 
many of our peers as self
-
funded explorer.
 


b
uild production and reserves in Ghana and deliver exploration success. We 
must put the best people in the right jobs. We started this process at my 
appointment, which enabled Brian to focus solely on exploration at CEXO. 

anges to strengthen my leadership 
team and better align the organization to deliver the second inning. This 
action will result in a small charge but the change is not about cost

exploration program.
 

things. Greg?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you, Andy and good morning to all. In my prepared co
mments this 
morning I will review our financial results for the first quarter and then 
provide a brief update on our expectation and guidance for the remainder of 
the year. Overall financial performance for the first quarter was strong and 
better than anal
yst expectations. Oil revenue was $213 million and we 
recognized net income of $75 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Included in 
these results is a benefit to net income of 24 million related to farm down of 

ploration licenses in Morocco to 
BP.
 
Absent this, adjusted net income would be about $51 million or $0.13 per 
diluted share. Cost related performance was good in the quarter with 
production expense, exploration expense, G&A interest expense and DD&A, 
all s

offset lower oil prices and slightly lower oil sales volumes in the current 
quarter. Production expense was 16 million or slightly more than $8 per 
barrel sold with no work over operations 
conduction during the quarter. 
Exploration expense of $13 million for the quarter included only the initial 
cost for the March startup of a large 3D seismic program in offshore Morocco 
and the cost of advancement of various exploration based initiatives.
 
G
&A cost came in lower than previously expected, affected by non
-
recurring 
and temporal items. Interest expense benefited from the amendment and 
restatement of our RBL facility this quarter, and DD&A was favorably 
impacted by the addition of proved reserves
 
at the end of last year, resulting 
from positive Phase 1A development and the field performance at Jubilee.
 
Tax expense was slightly higher than guidance, reflecting higher taxable 
income associated with better than expected oil prices at lower expenses i
n 
Ghana. Total corporate liquidity as Andy mentioned was approximately $1.5 
billion at the end of the quarter. The increase to the head of [ph] this 
quarter the increase over year end primarily due to amendment and 

Included in our liquidity are cash 
and cash equivalents of $528 million after reflecting repayment of $100 
million in debt during the current quarter.
 

2014. Our expected investme
nt program remains approximately $575 
million with around 70% or $400 million of this targeted for activity in Ghana 
and the remaining allocated to exploration activities. Consistent with 
previous production guidance, we anticipate selling a total eight ca
rgos of 
crude oil from Jubilee net to Kosmos through 2014, two of which occurred in 
the first quarter averaging nearly 970,000 barrels of oil each.
 
On the cost side, we anticipate yearly production expense in the range of 
$11 to $12 per barrel, inclusive o
f work over expenses including a water 
injected well later this year. G&A costs for the year are expected to be 
slightly down from full year 2013 and DD&A should average around $25 per 
barrel sold. 2014 exploration investments, based on our current CapEx 
g
uidance are expected to be approximately $175 million and they used as a 
proxy for exploration expense. Exploration expense is driven by seismic 
survey and well timing as a majority of this cost is associated with these 
activities. Also included is spendin
g related seismic processing and 
interpretation activities across our portfolio, as well as funds for potential 
new exploration opportunities.
 
Our current crude oil hedge position totals 10.7 million barrels with 
approximately 4.5 million barrels 
remaining in 2014 and the balance 
associated to 2015 and 2016 hedging. We expect to increase both our 2015 
and 2016 positions over time. Bearing in mind the challenge of giving 
guidance on Texas we project total tax expense for the year to equate to 
around
 
$22 million per lifting consistent with 2013 average assuming rent oil 
prices remain around $100 per barrel, though with higher price realizations 
in the first quarter this year we exceeded this number.
 
I will now turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks Greg. Our FA
-
1 well in the Foum Assaka block offshore Morocco 

abandoned after failing to encounter commercial hydrocarbons. This well 
was our first in a series of play
-
opening
 
exploration wells designed to unlock 
the Agadir Basin. FA
-
1 was drilled to test the salt diapir play concept and 
targeted possible lower Cretaceous sands in a structural
-
stratigraphic trap. 
This is one of several the first and independent play types and f
airways 
contained within three contiguous licenses operated by Kosmos, which 
together totaled nearly 25,000 square kilometers and capture the core of the 
Agadir Basin petroleum system.
 
Importantly, FA
-
1 encountered good oil and gas shows while drilling and
 
in 
core samples suggesting the presence of a working petroleum system. This 
also provided key well to seismic calibration information, which will enable 

analysis, in particular, the as
sessment of charge in reservoir play risks, as 
well as the evaluation and ranking of trap types.
 
Additionally, a 4,300 square kilometer 3D seismic program in the Essaouira 
Tarhazoute Offshore blocks is ongoing and should be completed late in the 
second qua
rter. This survey will provide Kosmos with continuous 3D seismic 
coverage as to wear the license in the north through the Tarhazoute license 
to our Foum Assaka license in the south. Drilling in the Essaouira license is 
slated to start next year with Tarhaz
oute potentially in 2016.
 
Further south in the Western Sahara our offshore Cap Boujdour position 
covers the Aaiun Basin, a potentially giant unexplored hydrocarbon province 
with very significant exploration prospectively, supported by performing 
indicators
 
of a working petroleum system, both direct and indirect including 
reservoir in charge. A number of play types and fairways have been defined 
based on 2D and 3D seismic within this very large license which covers 
nearly 30,000 square kilometers and these i
nclude full traps, hanging wall 
slope anticlines, and toe thrust structures. This has resulted in us delivering 
a number of drill ready prospects ranging in size from 500 million barrels to 
over 1 billion barrels.
 
Operational planning is underway ahead of 
our planned exploration at of the 
Gargaa prospect beginning the fourth quarter of this year. Gargaa is a very 
large prospect in the P&E [ph] of greater than 1 billion barrels. Elsewhere in 
our portfolio is the large 2D and 3D seismic surveys we acquired in
 
2012 and 
2013 and now at various stages of processing in its interpretation. Our 
offshore Mauritania position includes three licenses, covering an area of over 

seismic volumes acquired l
ast year and the early results are extremely 
encouraging with both structural and combined structural
-
stratigraphic ways 

later this year ahead of 2015.
 
In Suriname, we have two of
fshore blocks coming in and covering an area of 

3D survey in 2012 and acquired around 1,400 square wide kilometers of 2D 
last year. We now received the final 3D process products and o
ur geo
-
fiscal 
interpretation and mapping along with geological studies of identified 
multiple hydrocarbon plays and fairways, which has substantial exploration 

 
On the Porcupine 
trough offshore Ireland, where we have three blocks 
totaling approximately 2,600 square kilometers but presently interpreting 
the fast
-
track 3D seismic acquired last year, while we wait the final process 
versus we expected later in 2014. Again earlier tech
nical work is very 
encouraging and leads and prospects are currently being defined and further 
identified.
 
Following completion of our evaluation we expect to commence a farm
-
out 
effort here to secure additional partners towards the end of the year ahead 
o

our second inning with self
-
funded frontier exploration strategy enabling us 
to build a transformation portfolio time at opportunities. Our new venture 
initiatives are focused o
n building a portfolio with the size, potential and 
balance to deliver success in the near to medium term and ensure 
sustainable growth through organic success of the drill bit in the long term.
 
Each of the exploration opportunities captured to
-
date offers
 
multibillion 
barrels resource potential. Prospects are being matured for drilling, partners 
being secured and rigs have been contracted for our multi
-
well multiyear 
game changing exploration program which is now underway. Based on the 
strong progress we a
re making in regard to generating new ideas, accessing 
opportunities, securing partners, maturing prospects for drilling and ensuring 
operational readiness, as well as the recent organizational structure, I am 
moreover confident that our exploration strate
gy will deliver 
transformational value for Kosmos going forward.

Thank you, (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of 
Ed Westlak
e with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ed Westlake

Credit Suisse
 
Just the I guess some exploration questions obviously and then I guess 

going to very early
. But just in terms of the oil and gas shows I guess this 
was lower Cretaceous I think as a target. Any shows in any other zones.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Brian, will you take it.
 
Brian Maxted
 

evaluat
ion of the information as you can appreciate at a very early stage, 
but the shows we encountered actually were in the, we believe in the early 
part of the cretaceous section. We did encounter some shows higher up in 
the well but the main shows were above t
he salt well TD in the salt of the 

standpoint with the results. The one thing I did want to walk away from, 

observe
rs and commentators on the area had indicated charges to the key 
risk in this basin. We actually believe that reservoir was more of a key risk 

encouraged by the fact that we, it 

demonstrated the presence of multiple oil and gas source rocks in the basin 
with this well resolved. And so from a, from the perspective of ultimately 

you k

diversity, deliberately to ensure that we have sufficient chances to unlock 
the basin and Foum Assaka One just tested one of those opportunities which 
was a salt play.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credi
t Suisse
 
And then I mean I guess you mentioned reservoir was one of the key risks. 
Just maybe walk through a little bit of what you saw relative to the reservoir 
quality.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, I mean I think understanding in a salt basin, where salt is actively
 

understand the structural and stratigraphic interplay between the salt 
movement and the provenance and distribution, the sedimentation of the 

omething we have to understand here 

delta systems out here were active from the Jurassic up through to the 
present day actually. So we got targets from the lower part of the Te
rtiary 

options here to be working with. Our focus at the moment is on improving 
our reservoir prediction models for the multiple targets that we have.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
And I
 
guess in the Gulf of Mexico, you go to these, these visualization rooms 


you say movement that need

one well in here but you know how many wells do you think it will take to 

sort part of the optimal ability to target these wells mo
re effectively.
 
Andy Inglis
 

farm out and we considered that a minimum three well program was 
appropriate for this basin and we farmed out to our partner, energy 
partners, and on 

looking at a huge area and depending on the results of those early wells, the 
basin may well require more wells to try and unlock it, and of course other 
operators are also operating in the basin as 

going to get adequately tested here over the next two or three years.
 
Ed Westlake

Credit Suisse
 
Okay, and then just one final. Do you think operators will share data or still 
too commercial to do that?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes

Our next question comes of the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Ryan Todd

Deutsche Bank
 
A couple of questions. First on Jubilee, I know you referenced Andrew the 
chan
ce to visit in country over there Ghana resilient talk with the various 
parties about the gas solution. Can you give us any more commentary on 

any changes in view, if there is any c
hange in view on the capacity of the 
reservoir that continue to receive the current rate of gas injection?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, now, I think the guidance is unchanged I think in terms of when we 
think the permanent solution will be implied. I think it is by ye
arend and 
then having sort of seen the state of completion when I was out there and 

between when we are today and year end in terms of the ability to reservoir 
to continue to ta
ke that and performance is really strong through the first 
four months of year. And to mitigate that, we are looking at alternative 
solutions which range from short term flaring to bypass around the gas plant 

 
world is changed in that sense.
 

solution, around yearend. I think the only other thing to sort of note is the 



for the cargo so far this year. So in terms of our ability to ultimately fund our 

getting to the perman
ent solution, which will then allow us to ramp up 
production and see the full capacity from the FPSO.
 
Ryan Todd 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 

--
 
I guess 
to listen a sense of the bypass, it requires some a
mount of construction of 
capital spend or something like that. Is it safe to assume that 
--
 
is there an 


art 

 
Andy Inglis
 
No, the bypass is actually very simple thing. I think if I get it right, I think 
the inlet of the part of the plant and the explore life of the plant I think are 
about sort of 

connection up in front of the plan that is revolving to enable it to happen. So 

time line. The real driver of that sc
hedule is getting the offshore pipeline 

then the bypass might well be a credible option.
 
Ryan Todd 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay and then I guess if I get to ask one more on exploration. I a
ppreciate 
the update that you gave on some of seismic programs you have going on in 
the various basins. It looks like you could potentially have drilling in four 
different basins going on in 2015. Is that fair? And is there anything 
--
 
as 

 

looking at prospects across your various portfolios, has anything looked 
particularly interesting, possibly moved up forward in the portfolio and could 
we really see drilling in four different regions 
next year?
 
Andy Inglis
 

absolutely that we could see drilling four basins in 2015, which again I think 


Brian give you little bit of flavor of that.
 
Brian Maxted
 


of this year and to drill Gargaa 
to begin with. But then into next year, the plan is to ensure that we have a 
pipeline of top quality prospects to drill with that rig. And I think 
--
 
I am 
absolutely delighted. Frontier exploration, when many projects are p
icked up 
on the basis of concepts, geologic concepts often times with not a lot of 


moving towards the drilli
ng stage. I would have least got good opportunities 
which can justify drilling. The key for us of course is will be high grading 
those and drilling best first which we are now moving towards been able to 

ferent blocks.
 
So lots of optionality in this portfolio, all of which are giant positions and 



 
a different part of the basin to the recent Tullow efforts 
who are important to us. We deliberately went out board looking for the 
major cretaceous funds.
 
As you know, we shot our 2D there and immediately went to shoot 3D on 
the back of the results of the
 
2D. And has 3D has confirmed what we saw in 

-
 
we are getting very encouraged 

--
 
not only a percent of those. 

ly before we get to 
the drilling stage.
 
Suriname is maturating very nicely. And then Ireland is little bit further 
behind just because the timing on the 3D. So very encouraged by the 

but 
combined as a portfolio, very, very difficult to go and build the portfolio in 
this industry today at the quality that we have.
 
Ryan Todd 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 

enough in terms of 
--
 
I know you have the Atwood rig. Are there any other 

months?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I think if we have successes, our business model close for accelerated 
appraisal. So one can expect that 
in a case of success that it will lead to 

coming. So that will take care of the exploration program, the kind of size 
that you indicated earlier in your question.
 
Operator
 
Our next
 
question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond 
James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov

Raymond James

and December 31st?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No.
 
Pavel Mol

The well will actually be drilled through year end into the first quarter. So it 
will be the first quarter at the earliest.

Raymond James
 
Okay, understood. Has anything changed in relation to the timetable for 
starting up the 10 project?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, nothing has changed still. So a 2016 start up.
 
Pavel Molchanov 
-
 
Raymond James
 
Okay. I guess any clarity on when
 
during the year, first half, second half, are 
still too early?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah. I think, we would 
--
 
I think internally, from a Kosmos perspective, it 
would be toward the second half of 2016.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foote,
 
Clarkson. Please 
proceed with your questions. Mr. Foote has disconnected. Our next question 
comes from the line of Anish Kapadia with TPH. Please proceed with your 
questions
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH
 
Just wanted to ask Andrew a question on biggest fracking [ph]
. Kind of 
looking back over the years, with share prices being somewhat disappointing 
since the IPO, just kind of thinking about where the stock is trading now? 
And you talked about a more radial strategy, such as sell down of all or parts 
of Jubilee, Kind
 
of thinking that NOCs are probably likely to pay a little more 
than where 
--
 

other reasons. And also on the exploration side of the strategy, any thoughts 
if 
--
 
any changes over there. It kind of 
looks like exploration becoming 
looking more difficult in this market with higher cost wells. Total industry 
success rates have come down and discoveries have become more difficult 
to commercialize. So I am just wondering kind of overall thoughts on 
strate
gy. Second question is kind of going back to Morocco and exploration 
risks. We always thought you were talking about reservoirs being the key to 
risk in Morocco and now in temp wells cretaceous in Morocco with no default 
reservoirs found, just wondering wh
at makes you confident going forward 
that you will be able to find reservoirs, and now only reservoirs but high 
quality reservoir for commercial development. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 

ll 
come with broader strategic questions. Brian goes up first.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes. Anish, yeah I mean I think the reservoir prediction for us right now 
based on results of the second one is the key challenge that we face in 
marketing this basin. There is cle
ar evidence from in board geology and from 
onshore that there has been a major debt depositional, series of depositional 
events through time into this basin. And as we project that off shore and 
extrapolate, we can tie in to from a geometry standpoint in t
erms of overall 
sequences and what appear to be reservoir geometries into a deeper water 

there is 
-
 
both the basement in terms of its entirety, multiple reservoir 
fairways, we go
t into a salt diapir play in the first well in a mini basin which 
appears as though it may have been bypassed. All that means is the sand is 
somewhere else. The small amount of sand that we did get was actually 


finding thick reservoirs. So we just need to keep working it. We got a new 
3D coming in over a big part of our acreage. We have to go back and 
recalibrate based on these well results and work it from there, but I still 
remain
 
optimistic that a basin of this size should have reservoir systems in it 

 
Andy Inglis
 
Sort of coming back to the question the strategy, what differentiates Kosmos 
today as a frontier explorer is that it has a source, reliable source of cash 

in terms of our peer g

developed, as a resource. We see further opportunities to grow that 
resource, convergence of reserves to production and beyond the projects 
that are currently sanctioned.
 
So as you sort of look at the 

see, us focusing on that and the price from that, is significant today, which is 
why in Jubilee and the Gargaa asset remains an important part of the 

at we can do to 
demonstrate that value to the market.
 



BP days, the rigor and 
discipline with which we explore the focus of the technical work, it is about 


s 
and therefore have the ability to have a big impact on the Company.
 


I hope Brian has given you a se
nse of the growth in our prospectivity that 


the progress that we made on that and the confidence we have
 
about the

to make sure we drill the best right well next and Boilers is a good option for 


es during the interpretation. But

Clarkson
 

nd I apologize about the disconnection. A question on 
Mauritania. At 90% right now, can you give us a sense of the timing, the 
ultimate size working interest that you want to get down to and any other 
things about the complexion of the working interest as 
it unfolds, the timing 
and ultimate size I guess are interesting to me.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes Brian, yes, I think the model that you saw us execute in regards to 
format in Morocco is what we would hope that we would be able to achieve 
in Mauritania as well. So t
hat would have us coming down to you know 35% 
40% range and depending on partners and bringing in some highly capable, 
financially capable partners with us alongside just ahead of the drilling. So 
we would look at 
-
 
the interpretation is moving forward at 
a pretty rapid 
pace and I hope during the second week and the second half of the year we 
would go into the market with the opportunity as a farm out.
 
Brian Foote

Clarkson
 

interpretation 
of the 3D seismic is ongoing, but as it relates to the bubble charts that you 
guys put out, so hopefully the size of the bubbles, have they increased? Has 
the probability of successes increased in your mind? How do things relate in 
terms of 
X and Y axis if you give some advice?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good point. The bubble chart 
--
 
in more reflects the maturity of the assets 
within the portfolio than it does with overall portfolio of drilling a lead 
prospect inventory if you like because pre
-
3D many of 
the leads are based 
on limited amounts of seismic data. But I would anticipate the Mauritanian 

ranking and therefore get onto the drill schedule for next year and beyond 
and
 
hope would have multiple prospects in Mauritania in that class.
 
Brian Foote 
-
 
Clarkson
 
And just one more if may. I know the original BP joint venture was discussed 
as being up $240 million. How much have you expended thus far under that 
and does that $240
 
million remain?
 
Brian Maxted

well carry which 
was the minimum exploration program. It does extend beyond that in the 
event of success. So again variant formats very important for us and each
 
mentioned on the call earlier, the higher cost of the exploration business 
these days, managing that through a successful format in the business 
model is very important for us.

whether the major shareholders were i
ntimately involved and whether they 
gave you any time scale or any view on their time scales and their patience 
for delivery?
 
Andy Inglis
 

straight forward question to answer. And 
look no, in terms of time scale,

Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale.

Just some quick ones fo
r me. With the sands that you saw Brian in the FA 
well, could you characterize 
--
 
the mortgage showed that they were 
reasonable but not think enough but could you describe them a little bit 
more?
 
Brian Maxted
 
They were sands that clearly 
--
 
we were not in 
the half of the main 
distributor fairways. So they were a peripheral sand systems. But the 
important thing was one, they indicate the sand is getting into basin; two 
that is going somewhere else and as my point earlier, we really need to 
understand the int
erplay between the salt movement and the deposition of 
these reservoir systems to properly predict, best predict, where the thick 
sequences, reservoir sequences sit relevant to the more marginals one which 
is what we encountered in FA1.

Okay. Next one for me is on the restructuring, are you moving close to Old 
Navy? Are you going down few floors? In your Dallas offices? What are you 
doing?
 
Andy Inglis
 

 
less layers and then more focused on the things that actually drive value. 


through that based on focused on
 
new ventures and expanding portfolio, 
very strong focus on the prospectivity of the acreage that we have today and 

through the drill over the next two or three years. Same of sor
t of focus in 
Ghana now. It is about the production, but it is about how do we expand the 

grow.
 

year

really, this just sort of getting back to a much more simple organization and 


s more agile and more competitive as a result. 
Anish mentioned you know, it is competitive world out there in terms of 
access and we need to be agile to respond. So this is not anything other 
than actually ensuring that we have the right organization, the 
best people 
in the right roles to deliver what I believe is distinctive and world class 
strategy.

With respect to what you just said 
--
 
in a short cycle time world, do you 
think you need to have your portfolio geared up so t
here have more 
opportunities within reason in terms of seeking prospects?

let me pass it over to Brian.
 
Brian Maxted

usually on the

etween focus and diversity. And in the frontier 


portfolio. Our strategy as you know is focused in concentrating p
ortfolio and 
rifle shot exploration as we call it, deliberate, because we know that frontier 
basins are not easy to open up. And therefore, I think we distinguish 
ourselves by ensuring that we place a lot of good talent and capability at a 
few challenges, 

because that then dilutes the organization, it results in poorer work, it 
results in shot gun exploration, it results in failure.
 

tfolio 
approach and I believe that, 150% in it. We, as Andy mentioned, we do 
have an active new venture program. We are incredibly selective and there 
are things in the pipeline that are moving towards, hopefully capture. So I 
do expect to build the portfo
lio a little bit here. And then as Andy also 
pointed out, then the conversation is around high grading it and we will 
continue to do that. So, one or two more projects maybe, but I'm really 

y 

we are active in that regard.

ins to gain drilling o
pportunities. And 
then it is about having gained access early at high equity positions than 
being able to farm

down and then leverage that into our business model. So 
it is about the discipline of applying that and not getting distracted by other 
things. A

Welcome to Kosmos Energy's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. Just a 
reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, let me turn the call 
over to Andy Inglis, Vice President of Finance and Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release which is available on 
the investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website. We have also 
published a presentation this morning that
 
we plan to refer to during today's 
call which is also available on our website. We anticipate filing our 10
-
K for 
2016 with the SEC later today. Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Maxted, Chief Explor
ation 
Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with the forward
-
looking stat
ements have been outlined in 
the earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain the non
-
GAAP financial measures in our 
discussion. Management believes such measures are important in looking at 
the Company's historical and future perf
ormance; and these are commonly 
referred
-
to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to and 
should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial 
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our SEC 
filings.
 
At this time I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal and good morning, everyone. Amid a challenging macro 
environment, 2016 was a successful year for Kosmos. We accomplished all 
of our key objectives because we entered the down
turn in a strong financial 
position and stayed disciplined in the execution of our strategy. This financial 
strength and business discipline is what differentiates Kosmos from other 
exploration companies and ultimately enabled the successful farm
-
out of ou
r 
Mauritania and Senegal assets.
 
Before we discuss the benefits of the BP farm
-
out, I would like to begin by 
highlighting our achievements in 2016. In Ghana, we effectively managed 
the Jubilee turret issue identified early last year, the impact of which is
 
largely cash flow neutral as a result of the insurance coverages we have in 
place. The TEN fields began oil production on schedule in August. With TEN 
online, we became free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter through the 
combination of increasing pr
oduction and decreasing CapEx, a trend we 
expect to continue in 2017.
 
In Mauritania/Senegal, we completed appraisal drilling of the Tortue 
discovery and successfully drilled the Teranga exploration well in Senegal. To 
date, we've discovered a gross Pmean r
esource, approximately 25 trillion 
cubic feet of natural gas and de
-
risked at least an additional 25 trillion cubic 
feet of gas along the inboard trend.
 
In the basin as a whole, we've now defined resource potential in more than 
25 billion barrels of oil eq
uivalent which could make this basin comparable in 
scale to Mozambique but with liquids potential. [Indiscernible] during the 
drilling continues to support our charge model which predicts the presence 
of liquids in the outboard part of our acreage. During 
the farm
-
out process, 
several super majors peer
-
reviewed our work and came to the same 
conclusions, supporting our view of the basin's quality and potential.
 

maturing opportunities with 
the focus on de
-
risked, proven oil provinces. In 
Suriname's Block 42 we farmed out to Hess, who were involved in the Liza 
discovery offshore Guyana and bring significant regional technical knowledge 
which should assist in our exploration and drilling progr
am expected to begin 
in 2018.
 
Across our Sao Tome acreage, we have partnered with Galp to provide 
important relationships and aboveground capability ahead of drilling.
 
I will now turn to the impact of the BP transaction which marks a turning 
point for the 
Company. Last week we announced the completion of the 
transaction in Senegal following completion in Mauritania in early January. 
The Kosmos/BP partnership in Mauritania and Senegal combines the 
expertise of two world
-
class companies. Kosmos brings an indu
stry
-
leading 
record of successful deepwater exploration to the partnership, while BP 
brings deepwater development experience as well as LNG production and 
marketing expertise. Importantly, both companies are strategically aligned 
on the vision for the forw
ard exploration plan in the Tortue gas project.
 
The BP deal is important to Kosmos for several reasons. First, it 
demonstrates that our strategy is working. Since Kosmos was formed in 
2003, the industry has undergone considerable change. But the one thing 
that remains the same is our unwavering commitment to our strategy, 
growing the business organically through successful frontier exploration and 
commercialization of our discoveries.
 
This strategy remains as relevant today as ever. The best assets in both 
the 
onshore and offshore will continue to attract capital and deliver returns. The 
fixed consideration alone represents a minimum 2.5 times return on 
invested capital in approximately 2 years. But we believe the real value lies 
in our 30% retained interest
 
which could be maximized under this long term 
partnership. Second, the partnership with BP accelerates an exploration 
program in 2017 and 2018 that offers perhaps the largest organic growth 
opportunity on a relative basis in the industry. And their work i
s fully carried 
under our deal with BP.
 
The chart on slide 3 shows the 2017 and 2018 global deepwater drill
-
out by 
company, based on independent third
-
party data from Richmond Energy 
Partners. According to this data, Kosmos alone is testing the fourth most
 
resource potential on a net basis over 2017 and 2018. To put this in context, 
the only companies that are testing more net resource are super majors and 
our net resource to be tested is more than 37 other explorers combined.
 
Slide 4 shows the exploration 
potential to be tested on a relative basis for 
companies with less than $40 billion in market cap. As you can see, the 
potential impact of this high
-
grade exploration program result in Kosmos 
testing net resource more than 2 times any E&P company less than
 
$40 
billion in market cap. Each of these high
-
quality prospects has the potential 
to significantly impact the future of the Company. And we plan to resume 
drilling next quarter which is why we're so excited about the exploration 
program.
 
Third, the transa
ction defines a clear path to production diversification for 
Kosmos through the Tortue development. Our primary reason for partnering 
with BP is their strategic alignment on the pace of development. With Tortue 
targeting first gas in 2021, Kosmos expects t
o have a third world
-
class asset 
generating substantial cash flow which will bring significant benefit to both 
countries as well. Lastly, the transaction enhances our already strong 
financial position, ensuring that we have the financial capability to 
comm
ercialize future discoveries. As a result of the terms we agreed, our 
portion of exploration, appraisal and development costs are expected to be 
largely carried over the next several years in Mauritania and Senegal. So 

one of the few E&Ps generating 
significant free cash flow at $50 a barrel.
 
I'll now cover these last two points in more detail before turning the call over 
to Brian, who will discuss our exploration program in greater depth. As I 
mentioned, one of the prim
ary rationales for partnering with BP is their 
strategic alignment with our vision of delivering early revenue in Tortue, 

near
-
shore FLNG concept that Kosmos previously developed which
 
can 
deliver a breakeven of less than $5 per MCF. In addition to being one of the 
lowest
-
cost LNG projects globally, this scheme accelerates first gas and 
offers the opportunity to scale up quickly as demand for LNG grows.
 
In just over two months in signin
g the deal, work across all dimensions of 
the project has accelerated considerably and the transition with BP is going 
very well. Given the importance of the project to BP, they already have 
approximately 75 people working on the project. With the right 
or
ganizational capability in place, the partnership is focused on reaching 
several key milestones in 2017 through a full activity set, shown on slide 5, 
that should enable a final investment decision in 2018.
 
In the first quarter of this year, the partnershi
p is focused on completing the 

continuing to evaluate industry FLNG solutions for the midstream 
infrastructure and expect a decision to be made during the second quarter. 
Also durin
g the second quarter, after drilling our initial exploration well in the 
outboard, we plan to construct a drill sand test on the Tortue to confirm our 
view of reservoir connectivity, well deliverability and gas composition.
 
Following the DST, we expect to 
begin the front
-
end engineering and design 

parallel for sanction are the signing of the intergovernmental corporation 
agreement or ICA which will be followed by the unitization ag
reement in gas 
marketing. We expect the ICA to be signed before major capital spending 
begins, starting with FEED.
 
On the gas marketing side, we're in ongoing discussion with both BP, who 
has offered to buy the gas, as well as other parties. And I expect t
hese 
discussions to be included before we reach FID. Given the size of the first 
phase, the low
-
cost basins and the demand we've seen to date, we do not 
see this as an impediment to FID, unlike many other LNG projects.
 
So in summary, we have a simple align
ed partnership that's working well. 

cost
-
competitive project on an industry
-
leading timeline.
 
At this time, I will transition to discussing our strong financial position and 
robu
st liquidity which are fundamentally underpinned by our Ghana assets. 
As a result of growing Ghana production in our BP farm
-
out, we plan to 
deliver free cash flow of approximately $250 million in 2017 at $50 per 
barrel which is unique compared to many of 
our peers. At Jubilee, revised 
operating procedures are working and our insurance coverage continues to 
mitigate any financial impact. The FPSO turret remediation work is 
progressing and the vessel is expected to be spread more than its current 
heading wit
hin the next few days. It should allow the tugboats currently 
required to hold the vessel on a fixed heading to be removed, simplifying 
operations and decreasing cost.
 
In the second phase the partnership is continuing to evaluate options to 
select the opti
mal long term orientation of the vessel and discussions are 
ongoing within the partnership to optimize any shutdown. We believe these 
assets will lead to a significant reduction in duration of the shutdown in 
2017. Even with the remediation work ongoing, f
ield performance has been 
strong with recent metered production around 120,000 barrels of oil per 
day, after the Jubilee partnership procured a second dynamically positioned 
shuttle tanker for increased offloading efficiency.
 
On TEN, after 
achieving first oil in August 2016, our oil production and water 
injection systems have been commissioned. And commissioning of the gas 
compression and injection systems are ongoing. Earlier this year, the 
capacity of the FPSO was successfully tested at an
 
average rate of over 
80,000 barrels of oil per day during a 24
-
hour flow test. Production testing 
and initial results on the 11 wells at TEN suggest 2P reserve estimates both 
the Ntomme and Enyenra fields are in line with previously guided 
expectations of
 
around 250 million barrels gross. And, indeed, the primary 
driver of our reserve replacement was receiving additional 1P reserve credit 
at TEN.
 
Due to certain issues with managing pressure in the Enyenra reservoir, 
because no new wells can be drilled unti
l after the previously disclosed 
ITLOS ruling, the operator has elected to manage the existing wells in a 
conservative manner. However, the partnership is currently evaluating ways 
to increase oil production during the year and ITLOS' ruling is now expecte
d 
around the end of September, after which we plan to resume drilling and 
increase field production.
 
I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our upcoming exploration 
program. Brian?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks Andy. Our primary objective this year is to 
deliver a company
-
making ALLL and/or liquids
-
rich gas discovery. In my commentary this 
morning, I'd like to discuss in more detail the drivers behind our exploration 
program and the specifics around the exploration targets in our upcoming 
drilling program 
in both Mauritania and Senegal. After this, I will conclude 
with a short update on Suriname.
 
However, before proceeding further, I would like to take a moment to briefly 
add my exploration perspective to Andy's opening comments. The clarity of 
our explorat
ion plan, the quality of our process, the capability of our people 
and our discipline in execution, including patience, persistence and 
performance over the last several years, is now paying off. Since we formed 
the Company 13 years ago, we've played a key
 
role in unlocking two of the 
three Cretaceous petroleum systems which have been opened by the 
industry in our geography, the South Atlantic margin. And now we have 
carefully assembled a new, large, high
-
graded exploration portfolio which 
includes a strate
gic presence in both of the current proven cretaceous 
exploration hotspots at Mauritania/Senegal and Guyana/Suriname, as well 
as positions us to open up the next space.
 
Our position as a leading global deepwater explorer is underpinned by the 
size and qual

couple of years. In aggregate, the prospects to be drilled amount to over 15 
billion barrels of oil equivalent of gross unrisked potential. They include 
some of the largest prospects to be dri
lled by the industry anywhere in the 
world during this time. Now let me turn to the drivers behind our second
-
phase exploration drilling program in Mauritania and Senegal. As you will see 
shortly, this independent oil well program is scheduled to start nex
t quarter 
and continue into 2018. And we will utilize the remaining time on the current 
Atwood Achiever contract. Final sequencing may be optimized and is subject 
to final approvals.
 
As you know, the first exploration drilling phase, through 2015 and into 
early 
2016, tested the inboard sloped channel trend of the Senegal River and 
made three gas finds, including Tortue, Marsouin and Teranga. Since this 
time, our technical focus has been firstly integrating the newly available 
information; and, in particular
, the well results and sample analysis to refine 
our charge model.
 
This is designed to both reconcile well outcomes and observations, as well as 
also provide us with a predictive tool going forward as we begin our second 
phase of explorations. Alongside ou
r calibrated AVO capability, this should 
enable us to better predict hydrocarbon phase as well as presence.
 
Slide 6 of the presentation summarizes our current charge model which is 
the key driver for the ranking of prospects. The map image on the right of 
the slide summarizes the Cretaceous petroleum system that includes, in 
particular, consolidated, common
-
risk segments that depict the likelihood of 
encountering oil or liquids with the condensate gas ratio greater than the 
economic minimum of 50 barrels pe
r million standard cubic feet. The darker 
green indicates a higher chance of liquids. The key takeaways is that based 
on this current chart model, we consider that there is a good chance that we 
will be able to find liquid or liquids
-
rich gas in the upcomi
ng exploration 
drilling campaign.
 
The model continues to contemplate three key source rocks. These include, 
from oldest to youngest, a deeper, regionally dominant source which we 
have previously referred to as the Apto
-
Barremian, but we now interpret to 
be
 
Neocomian and Valanginian; and then the shallower Albian and 
Cenomanian
-
Turonian sources. Although sensitive to a number of 
assumptions, the work we have undertaken suggests, on the basis of these 
three oil source systems, that it is the interplay of five
 
principal processes 
which determines the distribution of hydrocarbon fade. Furthermore, it is the 
different interplay in different areas between these processes which makes 
each of our prospects independent.
 
While time does not allow us to discuss the con
trols and consequences of 
each in detail, the five processes are, one, source presence and facies; two, 
overpressure; three, the timing of hydrocarbon generation and ultimate 
maturity; four, the fractionation of fluid during vertical migration; as well as 
the fifth which involves either the mixing of hydrocarbons from the deepest 
source with or direct charging from 
--
 
of reservoirs from those oil
-
 
and 
liquids
-
rich hydrocarbons generated by the two shallower sources.
 
The charge model explains that the lean g
as found to date along the in
-
board slope channel trend is a function of a number of factors related to the 
deeper charge system from which it is sourced. These include source facies 
dilution, i.e., more gas prone due to the presence of the Senegal River 
d
epocenter; the generation and late cracking of gas due to its deep burial 
and high maturity; substantial amounts of overpressure which caused 
extended vertical migration through breaching of multiple sealed reservoir 
pairs leading to a fractionation or dry
ing of gas; and no oil
-
limited 
enrichment of fluids with oil or liquids, given the immaturity of the shallow 
source on this trend.
 
Similarly, the model explains that the presence of oil along the basin and 
flanks, both to the north in Mauritania and south 
in Senegal, is related to a 
combination of the presence of the two oil
-
prone along with the shore 
younger source rocks and limited exposures to the deeper source rock.
 
Not surprisingly, therefore, the model suggests that, firstly, for the same 
reasons, the
 
best chance of finding oil and/or liquids
-
rich gas is in Northern 
Mauritania with the risk also decreasing south as we go into Senegal. The 
model also suggests that we will have a moderate to good chance, of 1 in 3 
to 2 in 3, of finding oil or liquid
-
rich
 
gas along the outboard flanks of the 
Senegal and Nouakchott River depositional systems in the base of both fan 
fairways.
 
This is due to the perceived presence of more oil
-
prone and oil
-
mature facies 
in the deeper Neocomian to Valanginian source, related t
o a more marine 
depositional environment and less oil facies dilution by the river depocenters 
as well as the shallower depth of burial, respectively. Also important is the 
likelihood of less fractionation due to reduced vertical separation between 
the sou
rce rocks and the overlying Cenomanian and Albian reservoirs.
 
So to summarize, we have done a lot of work on the charge over the last 
nine months and now feel we have a tool which indicates that the likelihood 
of finding significant oil and liquids on our 
blocks is actually quite good.
 

key prospects on each of the four independent basin floor fan fairways. In 
this regard, once ongoing operations are complete, we will have acquired 
o
ver 30,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic offshore Mauritania and 
Senegal.
 
In Senegal, processing of the outboard survey acquired in early 2016 is 
sufficiently advanced to fully define the Yakaar prospect, formerly referred to 
as Teranga West and select a
 
well location to test it. The Yakaar prospect in 
Northern Senegal is shown on slide 7 and this will be drilled first, in the 
second quarter of this year.
 
This base of slope fan is 40 kilometers west and 500 meters downdip of the
 
Teranga discovery. This is
 
a low
-
risk, approximately 15 Tcfe prospect located 
on the southwest flank of the Senegal River depocenter. It comprises 
stacked, amalgamated Cenomanian clastic reservoirs in a combination 
structural stratigraphic trend charged from the deeper oil
-
prone, o
il
-
mature 
Neocomian to Valanginian source segment. It has strong, calibrated AVO 
support which displays excellent reservoir trap conformance.
 
Importantly from a charge point of view, this location is both closer to the 
deeper source and has access to the y
ounger Albian source which we know 
from Teranga 1 is oil
-
mature in this region. The interaction of these two 
source rocks and the timing of generation will be key to determining a liquid 
content in this well.
 
As I previously mentioned, we believe the liqui
ds economic cut
-
off is a CGR 
of approximately 50 barrels per million cubic feet. So our 15 Tcf discovery 
with the 50 CGR would yield a 750 million barrel liquid discovery. At 100 
barrels per million cubic feet, it would yield 1.5 billion barrels. Following
 
the 
first well, as presently scheduled, the drill ship will then undertake a drill 
stem test on Tortue, after which we plan to move to the Requin prospect in 
southern Mauritania in the third quarter, as shown on slide 8.
 
The prospect is well imaged on cur
rent 2D seismic at the present time. And 
the drilling location will be selected after analyzing the recently completed 
3D. Requin is a 5 to 10 Tcfe prospect with a liquid component of between 
250 million and 1 billion barrels of oil [Technical Difficulty] 
liquids. It is 
located further inboard than the other prospects on the west flank of the 
Senegal River depocenter, approximately 30 kilometers northwest of the 
Tortue discovery. It comprises, again, an amalgamated Cenomanian and 
Albian clastic reservoirs i
n a combination track with a major structural 
component, charged from the deeper Neocomian to Valanginian source 
system. It again displays strong calibrated AVO support for the presence of 
hydrocarbons.
 
Following Requin, we plan to move to the Lamantin pro
spect in the fourth 
quarter. On slide 9, you can see more information on the Lamantin prospect, 
located approximately 150 kilometers northwest of the Chinguetti oilfield in 
northern Mauritania.
 
Lamantin, we judge, is a 2 billion to 3 billion barrel oil equ
ivalent prospect. It 
is also base of slope fan and comprises stacked amalgamated Campanian 
clastic reservoirs in a combination trap, charged from the adjacent and 
underlying CT and Albian oil
-
prone, oil
-
mature source systems. The prospect 
is well
-
defined o
n 2D at the present time, with good AVO support and 
conformance to the reservoir and the track. In our experience, we expect 
the prospect's definition to only improve with the addition of new 3D 
seismic. Also, given Lamantin lies in the heart of the proven
 
CT and Albian 
source kitchens, this is our lowest
-
risk black oil prospect.
 
Lastly, Requin Tigre, a prospect in Senegal, is shown on slide 10. This very 
large, base of slope fan is approximately 40 kilometers from the Tortue 
discovery. It is a 60 Tcfe pros
pect with a liquid component between 3 billion 
and 6 billion barrels. Requin Tigre Is located in the West Bank of the Senegal 
River depocenter and comprises stacked, amalgamated Cenomanian and 
underlying Albian clastic reservoirs in a combination structura
l stratigraphic 
trap; charged, again, from the deeper, more oil
-
prone, oil
-
mature 
Neocomian to Valanginian source segment.
 
As with the other prospects, Requin Tigre displays strong calibrated AVO 
support with excellent reservoir/trap conformance on the new
 
seismic which 

optimal drilling location. But given the scale of the prospect and the 
presence of multiple reservoir targets, additional seismic processing time is 
required. We the
refore expect this well to spud last in our four
-
well 
sequence towards the end of the year.
 
As I mentioned, these four independent prospects are some of the largest 
and most anticipated prospects to be drilled by the industry in recent 
memory. And 

drilling, offshore Mauritania and Senegal.
 
Lastly, turning to Suriname on slide 11, here we have completed a large 3D 
seismic survey of the Block 42 and a portion of Block 45 and processing 
inter
pretation is now ongoing. Encouragingly, the multi
-
billion
-
barrel 
potential originally identified on regional 2D seismic appears to be confirmed 
on the new 3D seismic. We have the already defined and ready
-
to
-
drill 
Anapai prospect in Block 45 that's highli
ghted on the seismic image.
 
In addition, a combination structural stratigraphic track such as Aurora 
which involve top
-
of
-
Cretaceous reservoirs charged from CT and/or Albian 
source rocks, are visible in Block 42. These are along trend of and on the 
same pl
ay fairway as the basin opening in commercial Liza find, as well as 
the Payara discovery recently made in the adjacent Stabroek Block in 
Guyana. Very early production with the new 3D seismic are extremely, 
encouraging and we anticipate evaluating, maturing
 
and ranking these 
prospects as well as selecting and renting a well to drill next year, subject to 
partner alignment.
 
So to summarize, from an exploration standpoint, this Company has not 
been better positioned for organic value growth through the drill b
it since 
2007, the year we found the Jubilee field with the Mahogany 1 well in Tano 
Basin in offshore Ghana. We have a proven, differentiated exploration 
strategy. We have a truly world
-

cusp of commencing a tra
nsformational, multi
-
well, multi
-
year, high
-
impact 
exploration drilling program.
 
I will now turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results and 
guidance for 2017.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thanks, Brian. At the end of the fourth quarter, Kosmos had total cor
porate 
liquidity of over $1.2 billion as we became free cash flow positive with the 
delivery of the TEN field. This includes $617 million of undrawn availability 
on our reserve based lending facility or RBL; $400 million of undrawn 
availability on our revo
lving credit facility; and $194 million of available 
cash. So we entered 2017 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. 
And as Andy mentioned, we expect to generate approximately $250 million 
in free cash flow at $50 oil this year.
 
We expect to u
se that free cash flow to pay down a portion of the 
borrowings on our RBL and create additional headroom to further fund 
exploration success and continue our strong organic growth. In fact, this 
year we have already received $162 million in cash proceeds f
rom the 
closing of the BP farm
-
out in Mauritania; and expect to receive 
approximately $60 million in further consideration in the first quarter from 
the closing of the Senegal transaction. As a result, we plan to repay $150 
million under our RBL during the
 
first quarter.
 
So now I will turn to the results for the quarter and the full year. We finished 
the year with seven crude oil liftings, three of which occurred in the fourth 
quarter, in line with our revised guidance issued on the third quarter 
conference
 
call. This generated full
-
year 2016 oil revenues of $310 million, 
excluding $188 million of derivative settlements. When you add our revenue 
to our settled hedges, it reflects a realized price of approximately $73.76 per 
barrel in 2016.
 
Full
-
year revenues
 
were down compared to 2015 as a result of lower 
realized oil prices, as well as downtime and reduced production related to 
the Jubilee turret bearing issue. LOPI insurance proceeds of $75 million 
through November of 2016 partially mitigated the revenue lo
ss compared to 
the prior year. As of 2016 year
-
end, Kosmos has net approved claims of $91 
million against our LOPI and H&M policies with $87 million of cash received 
to date which demonstrates that the process is working well with our 
insurance companies.
 
For 2016 we generated a net loss of $284 million or $0.74 per diluted share 
and in the fourth quarter generated a net loss of $57 million or $0.15 per 
diluted share. Adjusting for the impact of one
-
time items that affect 
comparability, the Company generate
d a net loss of $100 million or $0.26 
per diluted share for the full year of 2016 and a net loss of $6 million or 
$0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter.
 
On the cost side, operating expense for the fourth quarter was $44 million or 
$14.75 per barrel
 
versus $30 million or $10.50 per barrel in the fourth 
quarter of 2015. For the quarter, this included approximately $47 million of 
regular operating expense and $8 million associated with the revised 
operating procedures, offset by $12 million in insuranc
e recoveries. The 
fourth quarter included a full quarter of TEN operating expense which is 
higher than Jubilee as a result of the fact that the FPSO is leased and the 
lease cost is included in operating expense.
 
Exploration expense of $76 million for the f
ourth quarter included 
approximately $44 million of costs associated with the stacking of the 
Atwood Achiever; as well as $31 million in seismic, geologic and geophysical 
costs primarily related to Mauritania and Senegal. This resulted in full
-
year 
2016 ex
ploration expense of $202 million.
 
General and administrative expenses were $28 million during the fourth 
quarter, an 8% decrease compared to the same period in 2015. Full
-
year 
general and administrative expenses of $88 million were down 36% from 
2015 expe
nse of $137 million, the result of proactive cost management and 
reduced equity
-
based compensation expense.
 
Depletion and depreciation expense for the quarter was $74 million or 
$25.08 per barrel. This was an increase from the $15.98 per barrel in the 
four
th quarter of 2015, primarily attributable to realizing the first TEN lifting 
which has a higher depletion rate than Jubilee and drove the blended rate 
higher, a trend that should continue into 2017.
 
Taxes decreased in 2016, largely as a result of lower oi
l pricing. It is 
important to note that our deferred taxes fluctuated over the year, based on 
mark
-
to
-
market value of the hedges, making it very difficult to predict our 
overall tax position. This will again be the case going forward in 2017.
 
We continue t
o maintain our strong hedge position and currently our oil 
hedges total approximately 11 million barrels, with approximately 7 million 
barrels hedged in 2017 and 4 million barrels hedged in 2018. Our 2017 
hedging program reduces commodity price exposure fo
r approximately 65% 
of 2017 production, with average floor prices of approximately $59 per 
barrel of Brent. The Company's robust hedging program remains a key 
component of our strategy to protect our cash flows, balance sheet and 
liquidity.
 
At this time, I
'd like to transition to our expectations for 2017. During 2017 
we anticipate selling 11 cargos, net, to Kosmos, including eight cargos from 
Jubilee and three from TEN. This lifting schedule reflects our view of a 
significant reduction in required field do
wntime for the second phase of the 
Jubilee FPSO turret remediation work. For TEN, we expect three cargoes in 
2017, one per quarter, starting in the second quarter which is consistent 
with operator gross production guidance for the year.
 
Also on the revenue
 
side, we anticipate receiving LOPI proceeds of 
approximately $70 million during the first half of 2017, including 
approximately $50 million of proceeds in the first quarter based on our 
current production forecasts.
 
On the cost side, we anticipate total p
roduction operating expense for 2017 
to average approximately $18.50 per barrel which includes both Jubilee and 
TEN as well as the revised operating procedures at Jubilee. Including the 
impact of anticipated insurance reimbursements for Jubilee, we expect 
total 
operating expense to average approximately $15 per barrel in 2017.
 
G&A costs for 2017 are expected to be approximately $100 million with 
approximately 55% cash
-
based and 45% allocated to non
-
cash, stock
-
based 
compensation expense. We expect that DD&A
 
should average around $25 
per barrel as we depreciate more TEN barrels which have a higher per
-
barrel 
cost and move the blended rate higher.
 
Exploration expense during the first quarter is expected to include 
approximately $100 million of costs related to
 
the warm stacking of the 
Atwood Achiever and the cancellation of our rig extension. On a regular 
quarterly basis, we expect to have approximately $25 million per quarter of 
ongoing non
-
dry hole exploration expense related to seismic and geophysical 
and ge
ological work. During the year, we also expect net interest expense to 
increase; the result of less interest capitalization, after TEN commenced 
production last year.
 
Bearing in mind the challenge of giving guidance on taxes, assuming Brent 
remains at $50 
per barrel, we anticipate cash taxes will be higher than 2016 
levels while the deferred component will vary, driven by the mark
-
to
-
market 
position of our hedges. Overall, we expect taxes to be approximately $6 per 
barrel on average for 2017, assuming a $50
 
Brent price deck, of which 
approximately 60% is current. This excludes any deferred taxes associated 
with the mark
-
to
-
market position of our hedges.
 
With regard to our $175 million capital program, as we described earlier this 
year, $75 million is earmark
ed for Ghana, the majority of which will be spent 
on Jubilee. And $100 million is earmarked for planned exploration activities 
including new ventures, seismic acquisition and geological and geophysical 
technical fees.
 
So, as we execute our strategy, we're 
committed to maintaining the strength 
of our balance sheet and creating value for our shareholders through the 
cycle. Kosmos remains in a strong financial position and we will continue to 
focus on the disciplined execution of our strategy, both from an ope
rational 
and a capital allocation perspective.
 
So with that, that concludes our remarks. And now, operator, we would like 
to open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the 
line of Brendan 
Warn with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Just first question 
--
 
and I'll have a follow
-
up after it 
--
 
probably more to 
Brian. I appreciate a lot of new detail on slide 6 and 7. Could you just talk 
throu
gh for me, as an engineer, more putting a lot of this detail into, call it, 
probabilities of the geological chance of success for your first prospect that 
you've got award of on 3D seismic over? And then I'll leave it for a follow
-
up.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes, the
 
geologic chance of success on Yakaar we consider to be a very, very 
high chance of success. It's a base of slope fan that's downdip; it's downdip 
off the Teranga discovery which, although it's 30 kilometers away, we see a 
good seismic continuity and there
fore good calibration. So the AVO is 
calibrated. As you know, the AVO is not able to just, in itself, determine the 
difference between oil or liquids and gas.
 
So, depending on the deeper source rock to be, one, more in an oil facies as 
you come out of the 
main delta; and, two, being more oil mature; and, 
three, being closer to the Albian/Cenomanian reservoirs and therefore 
suffering less fractionation. The longer the distance 
--
 
and that's shown on 
those slides 
--
 
the distance below Teranga, as an example, 
is 3 kilometers 
from the [Technical Difficulty] to the reservoir. In Yakaar, it's just 2 
kilometers which is less of a distance for fractionation and drying of the gas.
 
And then the final point is it's in an area that's got access to the mature, oil
-
prone 
Albian source rock that we saw in the deeper part of the Teranga 1 
well which, as you may recall, had a gas condensate ratio of 167. And the 
Cenomanian had a gas condensate ratio of 30. So to get to 50 is not asking 
a lot. And the geological setup of the Y
akaar prospect is quite different from 
Teranga which is why we believe that we've got a decent chance of finding 
oil 
--
 
or liquids and/or oil in Yakaar. And then with the AVO, we think it's a 
very low
-
risk prospect, in and of itself, in terms of the discov
ery of anything.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Are you willing to give your, call it, either your own personal view or your 
corporate view on the probability, firstly, of be it dry gas or a liquids
-
rich 
discovery, obviously being two different numbers? Having built up, hav
ing 
Albian as full disclosure 
--
?
 
Brian Maxted
 
I think, look, if you look at the risk segments on the charge prediction map 
which suggests it's in that range 
--
 
1 in 3, to 2 in 3 or slightly greater; 1 in 
3, to 2 in 3 
--
 
I think we feel good about that. Th
at's a decent chance. I 
wouldn't go beyond what that suggests. But I think that 1 or 2 out of 3 
chance of finding a commercial liquids discovery is as good as we can refine 
it, based on the model as it sits today which is not calibrated, outside of the 
slo
pe trend and the oil discoveries to the north and south of us.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Okay. Then in follow
-
up, my question relates more to the free cash flows or 
cash flows. I appreciate the guidance you have given. At $50 a barrel, 
generation of $250 million, I jus
t wonder what the sensitivity of that is for 
every, call it, additional $10 
--
 
or what is it at $70 a barrel? Just for 
calibration of model.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Brendan, it's Andy. So for an additional $10, if you went from $50 to $60, 
it's around additional $75 m
illion of free cash flow.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Ed Westlake
 
I guess this is more sort of a commercial question. Each of these prospects 
that you've identified, i
f you have the right gas/oil ratio, would clearly be 
large enough to develop. Maybe 
--
 
there is perhaps two questions here. 
Maybe on the first one, if, say, they do prove to be gassier, at what point 
does it make sense to go instead of with FLNG, but to mo
ve to like a full LNG 
development? That's the first question and then a follow
-
on.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Why don't I 
--
? I'll take that. I think what's interesting to me is the 
competitive nature of FLNG versus an onshore scheme. We think today that 
the fundamentals
 
of the way in which FLNG can be modularized, the way the 
capital spending can be matched to the growth of LNG demand, means that 
FLNG is actually competitive with a big onshore scheme.
 
So, I think, as you start to think about the commercial approach to it
 
is 
fundamentally the way to move a gas project to ensure that it's the lowest
-
cost gas around and we have an FLNG scheme today which absolutely does 
that. I think we can expand that scheme from an initial phase of around 5 
million tons to 10 million tons,
 
Tortue growth.
 
If you had additional gas in the future discoveries, you could continue with 
the same approach which I believe will continue to be very cost competitive. 
And it allows you to take that modular approach to be able to build it to the 
future d
emand. So I don't think this is simply a question of offshore versus 
onshore. It's actually a question of what is the lowest
-
cost way of doing it. 
And I think today, I fundamentally believe the advances that are being made 
on FLNG 
--
 
it is a cost
-
competiti
ve approach. And it may well be the 
enduring cost
-
competitive approach.
 
Ed Westlake
 
And then so you do get enough oil, I guess maybe 0.5 billion barrels, 
typically would support an FPSO. Any early idea of where you think the 
breakeven is? It may be very ea
rly to answer that. But obviously the prolific 
gas fields have low gas breakevens. I'm just wondering what your thoughts 
are, at this point, on the oil side.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well, I think what we've said 
--
 
and again I think it's early days yet, so we 
need to 
be sort of careful about being too proscriptive. But we've looked at 
what we believe is an economic liquids yield at the current oil price. And we 
believe it's around $50 barrel 
--
 
50
-
barrel CGR. So we believe, therefore, the 
liquids targets that we see in
 
the prospects we've described are economic to 
develop in the current price environment.
 
Ed Westlake
 
Using the strip kind of price.
 
Andy Inglis
 

--
 
look, I think 
you know 
--
 
and the point 
about all of that is you go back to 
--
 
it's a slide 
that we've shown you many times in the past. But Kosmos' strategy was 
always about targeting things that were economic and provided a healthy 
return in a $35 to $50 world. Nothing has changed. Why does it
 
work? It's 
because entered early, good fiscal terms; and these are world
-
class 
prospects. If you put that together, it gives you efficiencies around the 
development scheme.
 
And I think that's a point that I really want to emphasize today is that Brian 
has
 
showed you four world
-
class prospects. These are large; and, therefore, 
through scale, have natural development efficiencies. And I think that's the 

on. These are very differentiate
d in terms of the scale and, therefore, the 
quality.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia with Tudor 
Pickering. Please proceed with your question.
 
Anish Kapadia
 
A couple of questions from me, first of all, just looking at your st
ock price, 
where it's trading relative to when you did the deal, just really a few percent 
higher than back then. Just wondering are you thinking about essentially 
share buybacks, given the market is not appreciating the deal, the size of 
the exploration p
rospects you are seeing this year? Is that one area that you 
would consider over the course of this year?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I'm not in the mindset of share buybacks today. I think our fundamental 
belief is that we believe we're going to be successful with the ex
ploration 

financial position to be able to follow up with the appraisal and development 
programs that would follow.
 
We believe, actually, very strongly that the value in the deal is 
in the 30% 
that we retained. And I think our strength as a Company comes from our 
ability to be able to have the financial firepower to be able to stick with that 

We believe that
 

therefore, having a balance sheet that allows us to pursue that success and 
not be compromised because we can't pay our way is critical.
 
So I don't anticipate share buybacks being the use of capita
l versus the 
opportunity to be able to invest in the success from the exploration program.
 
Anish Kapadia
 
Okay. And the second question, on Morocco 
--
 
I was wondering if you could 
give an update on your views on the Moroccan exploration acreage that you 
hav
e and any update on the drilling carry with BP.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Brian will pick that question up.
 
Brian Maxted
 

--
 
just last day or so 
--
 
started a new 3D seismic 
program off the Sahara, large 3D, nearly 10,000 square kilometers.
 
And in 
the middle of the year we will be shooting another 3,000 or so in our 

initial drilling in Morocco and Sahara a couple years ago to shoot the seismic 
and pursue new ideas, pri
ncipally in the outboard parts of those two 

 
Anish Kapadia
 
And the drilling carry from BP, though, is still in place?
 
Andy Inglis
 
BP have exited Morocco. And in lieu of that exit, they provided us with a
 
consideration to enable the exploration to continue there.
 
Anish Kapadia
 
And one quick follow
-
on, could you give what the cash flow impact would be 
if you did, in fact, have the full 12
-
week shutdown on Jubilee? What impact 
would that have on your current
 
free cash flow guidance?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I think that the best way to look at that is to see it as a process where we 
now have the vessel spread moored and we have made a lot of progress on 
that. We believe it will be finished within the next three or four da
ys. At that 
point, we're going to evaluate what is the right long term solution to the 
heading of the vessel.
 

back and ensuring that we do have the fatigue life that will give us 
the life
-
of
-
field. And there are several ways of doing that. And we need to come 
through with the right long term solution that enables us to deliver that 
outcome for both ourselves as a partnership and the government.
 
So I think it's too early to actually
 
determine what the length of the 
shutdown is going to be. Tullow have clearly talked about a shutdown of up 
to 12 weeks. We've taken the view that it could be shorter. And I think 
within the two numbers, there would be a cash flow impact. But it's not 
sig

 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One 
Securities. Please proceed with your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Just looking at the exploration program set up over 
the next several 
quarters, Brian, still expecting something around 80 days to drill the first 
well?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes. We've historically said 2 to 3 months; and then in the kind of 60
-
 
to 90
-
day range. We expect these wells to be relatively straightforward
. We've got 
pretty good control now, we believe, on the seismic in terms of both depth 
prediction and pressure prediction. So hopefully there won't be too many 
drilling issues, but in that range.

And lastly, looking at things more globally, 
we have been hearing a lot about 
rising costs from many of the shale operators over the last several weeks. 
And could you discuss current expected exploration development cost from 
the deepwater projects perspective? I imagine the global deepwater projects
 
maybe don't see much of an increase at all or maybe nothing at all. Could 
you talk about things from that perspective?
 
Andy Inglis
 

we're actually in a cycle in the deepwater w
here we still have significant 
oversupply of capacity across all dimensions; whether it's deepwater drilling 

different world. And we have a world also where the cycle time is cle
arly 
different.
 
If you start to think about the current price environment we have been 
through, the cycle time of the big projects is typically three years, once you 
approve a project and once it gets into production. And so as we go through 
the current pr
ice cycle, all of those projects are, quote, now coming to an 
end; and therefore actually supply, the oversupply of capacity of the 
industry is growing currently rather than diminishing.
 
So I think we're actually still on a downward trend in terms of costs
, rather 
than at a rising trend. And it has always been the same. It's about the cycle 
time of projects. The cycle time of the well that is, in a matter of days, in the 
lower 48 is very different from the multiyear projects that are occurring in 
the deepwa

in deepwater; whereas, as you say, the reverse could be occurring in the 
lower 48.

Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. 
Please proceed wi
th your question.
 
John Herrlin
 
I just have a quick one for Brian. For the five factors you gave, what do you 
think is more critical, the depositional situation or the timing/vertical 
fractionation?
 
Brian Maxted
 

world here, dealing with 
multiple processes that are interacting together. So the weighting and bias 
of each of those processes is, at this point in the development of the model 
-
-
 
and it is calibration which is still obviously quite early. It's difficult 
to 
predict. And that's why we try to move away from the individual source 
rocks and articulating those to one of consolidating the picture into simple, 
1
-
in
-
3, 1
-
in
-
2 and 1
-
in
-
1 chance of finding liquids beyond 50 barrels an MCF.
 
As you move out into the 
-
-
 
as you move north into Mauritania and as you 
move south into Senegal, the influence of the shallower source rocks 
switching on is significant, we believe; particularly in northern Mauritania, 
where you are dealing with essentially intra
-
formational reser
voirs within the 
upper Cretaceous and the Cenomanian through the Campanian. And there 
we've got, I think, a really good chance of finding liquids because of the 
contribution of those two source rocks and because those areas are being 
higher in the stratigr
aphy and more remote from the deeper source that's in 
a gas facies and gas maturity. And obviously, the examples there are 
Chinguetti and SNE.
 
As we move outboard on the Senegal and the Nouakchott River system, 
facies is important. And I mentioned in my sc
ript that it's based on 
--
 
the 
model is based on a number of assumptions. We have an outboard well and 
a deep
-
sea drilling project well that's got really good oil facies within the 
deeper Valanginian, Neocomian
-
Valanginian section. And then inboard, of 
cou
rse, we know that gas is sourced from that same reservoir.
 

-
prone facies 

the maturity now, given the calibration that
 
we have.
 
So if it was one thing, I would say it's the source facies process and driver 
which will be key which is going to be aided by the fact that that source rock 
is close to the Cenomanian and Albian reservoirs; and, therefore, hopefully 
less fraction
ation is occurring.
 
John Herrlin
 
Was this something that you had a lot of discussions with, when you had the 
data room open?
 
Brian Maxted
 
It is, actually. As you know, we had three super majors in the data room. 
And what you are shown here is very much 
the consensus that came out of 
both our own work and the detailed technical discussions we had with all of 
the super majors, who were obviously very focused on finding liquids in this 
basin as well. And I would say there was a general consensus around the 

oil source rocks. We do have an oil field to the north and an oilfield to the 
south of us. And we do have gases which suggest there is an oil component 
in the system.
 
So based o
n all of that, the question is where is the sweet spots for oil? And 
we believe that math is probably going to end up, in general terms, a good 
depiction of the distribution of liquid content in this basin. Obviously, it will 
be subject to, in detail local
ly, refinement as we put more holes into the 
petroleum system.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton with RBC. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Brian, really with respect to that last comment in terms of the 
distribution of 
the liquids and that is where you are seeing the value; how do you see the 
value of liquids or the discovery of further gas impacting on the Tortue 
development? Because you are starting with a field that straddles the 
border. I would have t
hought you would start with something easier, 
particularly given that there is potentially a substantial 60 Tcf gas prospect 
in a single country just to the south.
 
So how can you present slide 5 and say, well, we hope to find something 
completely different
 
that would surely ultimately change the timings that 
you present in slide 5?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Al, I'll let Andy answer that question. I would say it has been a major 
discussion point internally, with the governments and with all the data room 
attendees, inclu
ding BP. So I'll let Andy answer that.
 
Andy Inglis
 
And I think it's a conversation that, as Brian said, that we've had with the 
farmanees and with the government. Simply said is is that Tortue is a world
-
class gas discovery. It is very LNG friendly because
 
it has the right amount 
of liquids, but not too much. It has massive well rates in terms of the quality 
of the reservoir. It's in the thickest part of the depositional zone because it's 
in the core of the river system. And that will benefit from that.
 
So 
it is the ideal LNG gas project. And we think that if we were to find 
additional gas, as it comes with additional liquids, with sort of liquid stripping 
gas will actually be probably the way forward; and, therefore, those projects 
probably wouldn't be expo
rting gas. You would be using the gas to recharge 
the reservoir.
 
So we've had the debate with both governments. Both governments are fully 
behind an early gas development. They are fully behind a gas development 
that can be delivered in 2021. And Tortue ca
n absolutely do that. So we 
don't see any bifurcation in agendas between the countries if we find 
additional resources.
 
I think what we will find is additional projects being done in parallel, 
potentially an oil project and maybe a liquid stripping project
 
in another 
country. Who knows? But the fact that Tortue will anchor an LNG 
development that enables early gas in 2021 is absolutely the agenda of the 
partnership with BP and the agenda of both governments.
 
Al Stanton
 
So you are quietly confident you have 
two Mozambiques, rather than the 
Mozambique and the Tanzania?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I know; I'm confident that what we have 
--
 
and I'm confident in what we 
have is, we have a low
-
cost LNG project today that is cost competitive; and, 
therefore, is gas that is absolut
ely going to move forward. I'm confident in 
that. I am also confident there will be follow
-
up projects that will involve 
liquids and/or black oil. That's what I'm confident about.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymo
nd 
James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
So the fact that FID on the LNG development is not expected until next year 
--
 
is that partly to enable an integrated resource development, should you 
find liquids over the next 12 months?
 
Andy I
nglis
 

subsurface appraised. We need further work with the DST to ensure that we 
have the gas composition nailed which then allows FEED to start in the third 
quarter which is typically
 
a six
-
month process that would allow us to be in a 
position to demonstrate commerciality, mid
-
2018 which would then allow 
the FID decision to be made. So this is being driven by the timeline to do the 
engineering necessary to get to FID, not anything else
.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. But if you were to make a liquids discovery, as you are anticipating, 
would there be, at least theoretically, the possibility of integrating the two 
development cycles into one? Or would they be treated completely 
separately?
 
Andy I
nglis
 
Pavel, today, the way that we would see it is they would be separate 
developments, geologic 
--
 
geographically, they are separate. Geologically, 
they would probably separate, at different pressure regimes. And they 
probably have different drivers arou
nd liquids versus gas. And as I said in 
the answer to Al's question, you have in Tortue a gas resource which is very 
well disposed towards an LNG development. And we have a very credible, 
low
-
cost scheme that enables that to go forward.
 
I think thereafter,
 
you then have to think about how you would do a black oil 
maybe in parallel with it. And then, if you know, you had a rich liquids gas 
discovery, how you optimize the liquids recovery from that, you certainly 
wouldn't be exporting gas. So those are very d
ifferent schemes. And I think 
you should see them as separate projects which will run in a sequence, but 
probably parallel overlap between them.
 
Yes and then maybe I'd follow up. Maybe one of the reasons we decided to 
farm down at this stage was to bring i
n a development partner like BP that 
has the capability of doing projects of this scale in parallel; and, clearly, the 
ability for us, as a 30% share with the balance sheet strength, is that we can 
move along with that. That was part of the whole strategy.
 
Now is the right 
time to enable us to be at a credible working interest that allows us to move 
forward with multiple projects.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Neil 
Mehta
 
Just more housekeeping questions, to start off. I Wanted to confirm that you 
said you'd expect and 11 Ghana liftings, net to Kosmos. I believe in the 
January presentation, you had said 10 liftings, net to Kosmos. So just want 
to confirm. And then wha
t changed?
 
Tom Chambers
 
It is 11 cargos. And obviously, we've had some more time. We factored in 
the 10 operations; and what we think Tullow with a shorter shutdown, in our 
view, on Jubilee. So that gives us 11 cargos.
 
Neil Mehta
 
And then you rattled off s
ome numbers in the beginning about production 
levels at Jubilee and TEN, thus far in the first quarter. Can you go through 
that again? There was some trade press about some of the downtime at 
Jubilee, in particular. But it sounds like you guys are running 
okay.
 
Andy Inglis
 
I'm not sure what trade press you are referring to, Neil. But in the first 
quarter we have been going through a process of ensuring that we deliver 
the spread mooring project. That project is very close to being finished, a 
matter of days
 
away. While we have been doing that, you are clearly 
working at the aft of the vessel which has interrupted some of the 
offloading. So that's probably the up
-
and
-
down that you have been reading 
in the trade press; nothing that wasn't planned.
 
And actually
, the most important thing out of it is that when we have had 
periods where we have had stable access to the offloading, with the two 
shuttle tankers which gives you 
--
 
it removes the constraint on the 
offloading, the production level has been very high, u
p to the 120,000
-
barrel
-
a
-
day number that I talked about which is the FPSO vessel. So clearly 
reservoir working well, vessel working well and we have been working on 
ensuring that we get the spread mooring done. That has obviously caused 
some downtime on t
he production levels while we have been doing that.
 
Neil Mehta
 
And then the last housekeeping question for me is 
--
 
I guess in 2018, we 
should expect FID at Tortue. What percentage of the asset do you need to 
have committed from a marketing standpoint befo
re it's ultimately 
sanctioned? And the gas market is oversupplied, but I think there are some 
idiosyncratic things about the fass that make you more comfortable around 
your ability to market the assets. So can you talk about that?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Well, I 
think you know 
--
 
you need to think about 
--
 
I'll just make two 
big points. The first is with the development scheme that we have, we have 
an incremental phasing of the buildup of the LNG capacity; an initial vessel 
gives you around 2.5 million tons. The s
econd 
--
 
which would be 2021 
--
 
a 
second vessel, probably about 18 months to 2 years later, builds that up to 
around 5. So you're not putting a lot of LNG on the market in one go, point 
one.
 
The second point is part of bringing BP to the table was not only
 
do they 
have the deepwater expertise, the LNG development expertise, they also 
have a very large LNG portfolio. And so, therefore, they are a credible buyer 
of the incremental production. And that was one of the things that attracted 
them to the project w
as they are looking for new sources of gas. You are 
probably 
--
 
as you are well aware, that they bought the Mozambique gas 
recently.
 
So I firmly believe, as I said in my remarks, that I don't see the marketing 

 
here and the ratable buildup of 
those quantities to be an issue. The fundamental issue is ensuring that you 
have the lowest
-

the $5 per MCF FOB. So I feel good about the marketing of the gas and 
it 
will not be an impediment to the pace at which the project moves forward.

Good day everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's First Quarter 2018 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Jamie Buckland, Vice President of 
Investor Relations at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Jamie Buckland
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to you all for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued a release regarding our fourth quarter earnings, which is 
available on the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com Web site. We 
anticipate filing
 
our 10
-
Q for the first quarter with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call inc
ludes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in 
our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction
 
with, the information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie and good morning and afternoon, everyone. Kosmos is a 
well
-
capitalized, pure play deep water company, with growing production, a 
pipeline f development opportunities and a balanced exploration portfolio. In 
February, we set out Kosmos's strategy for creating value over the near, 
medium and long term. There ar
e four key areas that support and enable us 
grow and I'm pleased that we've made strong progress on each of them in 
the first quarter.
 
First, an increasingly diverse portfolio of high margin production assets 
delivering growth; second, the world scale low 
cost comparatively positioned 
gas project being developed by BP, which is progressing towards FID late 
this year and provides the next phase of growth for Kosmos. Third, a 
sustainable exploration program with a balanced and proven emerging and 
frontier bas
in opportunities offering multiple catalysts in 2018, 2019 and 
beyond and finally a disciplined and conservative approach to financing with 
a strong balance sheet and significant available liquidity which supports the 
execution of our strategy.
 
Starting wi
th production, our high margin assets in Ghana and Equatorial 
Guinea continue to deliver growth. The 3P reserves of these assets underpin 
the core value of Kosmos with significant room for additional upside.
 
In Ghana, first quarter production was offsettin
g Kosmos lifting two net 
cargos as expected with an operating cash margin of over 40 per barrel. At 
Jubilee, gross production averaged approximately 63,800 barrels of oil per 
day. The first quarter Turret Remediation Program or TRP shutdown was 
accomplishe
d as planned. However, the shutdown of the gas processing train 
lasted longer, which restricted oil volumes during this period.
 
The shutdown has benefited future oil production as adjustments made to 
the facilities subsequently allowed for increased gas th
roughput and 
consequently higher oil volumes. Post shutdown, daily production reached to 
almost 110,000 barrels of oil per day. With the successful completion of the 
first phase of the TRP, the operator expects the second phase to commence 
in May. We antic
ipate oil productions to be offline around two weeks as a 
consequence of this shutdown.
 
Furthermore, we anticipate gas system being shut
-
in for slightly longer to 
complete non
-
turret related maintenance similar to the first quarter. We still 
expect the rot
ation of the vessel to take place around the end of the year 
with minimal impact to production in 2018. As a result, we still expect seven 
cargos from Jubilee and with two cargos in each of the next three remaining 
quarters.
 
At TEN, production is growing t
owards the FPSO nameplate capacity of 
80,000 barrels of oil per day and that reached approximately 68,600 barrels 
of oil per day growth during the first quarter. First quarter production was 
nearly 23% higher than the full year 2017 average and during the 
quarter 
achieved a peak level of approximately 72,750 gross barrels of oil per day. 
The focus is clearly intended to growing production across Jubilee and TEN, 
with drilling now resumed.
 
In March, the most conventional drill ship arrived in Ghana and comme
nced 
operations drilling two wells including one at TEN and one at Jubilee. The rig 
will then begin completions work with the first well Ntomme
-
5 at TEN 
scheduled to be placed on production in early July. In 2018, the partnership 
plans to drill and complet
e four produces including two each at Jubilee and 
TEN and complete a water injection at Jubilee.
 
Furthermore, the partnership is in discussions on the addition of a second 
drilling rig in Ghana which could arrive in the field as early as October and 
contri
bute to increase production volumes in 2019.
 
The Equatorial Guinea assets that we acquired in late 2017 are performing 
strongly and our partnership with Trident Energy is working well. Gross field 
production averaged over 47,000 barrels of oil per day duri
ng the quarter, 
exceeding our 43,000 barrel per day 2018 forecast and 37,000 barrel per 
day acquisition assumption.
 
Strong production resulted in two lifting's net to Kosmos above our stated 
guidance with a robust cash for cash margin. This high margin pro
duction 
has delivered meaningful cash distribution to Kosmos already, approximately 
88 million from deal closed at the end of April or nearly 38% of our 231 
million purchase price. With this performance we see payback being reduced 
to just over one year do
wn from approximately three years of the time of 
acquisition less than six months ago.
 
Operationally, production optimization work is on track planning for the first 
phase of Electrical Submersible Pump or ESP installation to increase lift 
capacities under
way and the work program it scheduled to commence in the 
fourth quarter of 2018. The FP projects are expected to generate higher 
hours of more than 100% with production volume impact expected to be 
seen from 2019 onwards.
 
Finally during the quarter we rece
ived government ratification of the 
surrounding exploration blocks and PSEs negotiated last year, which I'll 
discuss further in my remarks on our exploration program.
 
Next I would discuss Tortue on low cost competitively positioned LNG project 
by Cretaceou
s in Mauritania and Senegal, which we are developing alongside 
BP, who is the operator. Tortue's innovative near
-
shore LNG project will 
scale at around 10 million tons per annum. FID of the first 2.5 million ton 
phase is expected around the end of the year
. Since we reported our first 
quarter result the project has remained considerable progress.
 
The agreement of the ICA in early February and they will feed to commence 
in earnest and all the major contracts have now been awarded including the 
subsea infrast
ructure, FLNG vessel, FPSO vessel and hub terminal of 
Breakwater. The liquefaction unit to be used in Tortue phase 1 is similar to 
the [indiscernible] which commenced LNG production in mid
-
March for 
Briancon [ph].
 
Additionally, for the gas marketing we hav
e issued requests for proposals to 
a short listed group of potential buyers including all major traders and end 
users. The project continues to gain momentum and remains on track to 
reach FID around year end.
 
In parallel with phase 1, the partnership is ev
aluating concepts for additional 
phases to expand the capacity of Tortue from around 2.5 million to around 
10 million tons per annum by the middle part of the decade or sooner. This 
work is ongoing and aimed at providing the most efficient liquefaction 
opt
ions which can leverage existing infrastructure of the near
-
shore 
development and provide economies of scale.
 
We're aiming to grow the gas delivered from Tortue in the early 2020s, 
when leading forecasters expect LNG demand to outpace supply given the 
low 
inventory of world scale Greenfield projects ready for sanction. This 
should be a good time to bring gas to market allowing us to deliver 
attractive project economics for the partnership.
 
I'll now turn to exploration where our growing portfolio 
provides a 
sustainable exploration program comprised of a balanced mix of 
opportunities in proven emerging and frontier basins, offering multiple 
catalysts in 2018, 2019 and beyond. Our proven basin activities focused in 
the Rio Muni basin Equatorial Guine
a is under explore the basin, has suffered 
a dearth of exploration activity following the discovery of the Ceiba and 
Okume fields by members of the current Kosmos team 20 years ago.
 
As part of the 2017 acquisition, we entered into an agreement with the 
gov
ernment to acquire blocks SW and 21surrounding Ceiba and Okume. We 
see two distinct opportunities to leverage our basin knowledge; first, step 
out exploration along the eastern part of our blocks, this provide short cycle, 
highly economic time back opportu
nities to grow production utilizing spare 
capacity and the interesting Ceiba and Okume production facilities. Second, 
in the West there are opportunities for standalone Greenfield exploration 
which provides a potential for an extension of the basin floor f
anfare way to 
exploring offshore Sao Tome.
 
In the first quarter we focus our activity on maturing these areas for drilling 
in 2019, we command seismic acquisition this month and I expect to begin 
processing the data shortly. Early in the second quarter we 
expanded our 
position by farming into Block EG
-
24, located out board of our existing 
position for 40% participating interest. By entering this block we have now 
capture the entirety of the Rio Muni basin play from the near
-
shore 
producing assets of Ceiba a
nd Okume through the in board slope channel 
fairways and all the way to the basin forefronts in eh out board of our Sao 
Tome acreage.
 
We know there's a working petroleum system in the region as our blocks is 
surrounded by [indiscernible] Sao Tome and Princ
ipe to the west and 
producing fields at Ceiba and Okume to the east. We're excited by the many 
opportunities and it's proven play but under explored petroleum system.
 
Within emerging basins we have a key presence in each of the two recently 
opened giant sc
ale Cretaceous oil and gas petroleum systems off shore 
Mauritania and Senegal and Senegal and Guinea and Suriname. In Suriname 
we're drilling two test this year to evaluate the first of up to five 3D seismic 
defined independent prospects across our two blo
cks which in aggregate of 
multi
-
billion dollar oil potential.
 
Anapai located in Block 45, is our first well in the basin and is testing a 
combination structural stratigraphic trap. While operations are currently 
ongoing and we anticipate communicating resu
lts to the market later this 
month. This will be followed by a well in Block 42, which is which is expected 
to start in the third quarter either on the Late Cretaceous Aurora or Apetina 
trends both offer potential extensions at least that type stratigraphi
c place in 
Guinea and the partnership is continuing its technical evaluation in order to 
finalize the first prospect.
 
In Mauritania and Senegal we're taking the time to integrate data obtained 
from our 2017, '18 drilling program with a view to initiating a
 
third 
exploration campaign in 2019. We anticipate this will focus on exploration 
appraisal in support of potential further gas hubs in southern Mauritania and 
northern Senegal as well as continuing to search for liquids. We remain 
excited about the signif
icant remaining potential in the basin and we'll 
update the market later in the year on the 2019 program.
 
Turning now to Frontier basins where we have two major opportunities to 
our current portfolio that were actively maturing to a drill ready status. Fir
st 
is Sao Tome, we bolstered our already large position with the addition of two 
blocks 10 and 30, which we acquired as part of our BP Kosmos alliance in 
West Africa. These bolt on acquisitions solidify our position in the out board 
Rio Muni basin and allo
wed us to capture significant amounts of this frontier 
region.
 
In addition to the 16,000 square kilometer seismic acquisition program last 
year, we expect to acquire seismic over blocks 10 and 30 starting later this 
year. Initial exploration drilling in Sa
o Tome remains on target for 2019.
 
Similarly offshore at Cote D'Ivoire in partnership with B.P. we were awarded 
five blocks at the start of 2017 covering approximately 16,000 square 
kilometers on aggregate. A 3D seismic survey commenced in March. The 
proce
ssing is expected sport initial drilling of wells in 2020.
 
So in conclusion, Kosmos has a balanced portfolio of production, 
development and exploration with multiple sources of growth in all three of 
these areas. 2018 continues to be an active and importan
t year for Kosmos 
with two wells in Suriname and five in Tortue and continuing strong 
performance expected from our producing assets in Ghana and Equatorial 
Guinea.
 
Looking further ahead to 2019, we already have clear line assigned to 
numerous major cataly
sts with exploration wells planned across our proven 
emerging and frontier portfolio in Equatorial Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal 
and Sao Tome and Principe as well as the potential for a follow on appraisal 
drilling on the back of success.
 
Over a multi
-
yea
r period we will high grade two to three high impact 
exploration wells a year which we can execute as a result of the strength of 
the portfolio we have already built and the new venture activity we continue 
to pursue both in alliance with BP and on our own
. We remain focused on 
executing this activity in a financially prudent manner and we will continue 
to ensure we have the balance sheet strength and liquidity going forward to 
manage our business and create value for our shareholders.
 
At this time I will n
ow turn the call over to Tom.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thank you and morning everyone. As I highlighted on our call in February, 
although commodity prices have recently improved our commitment to full 
cycle returns, financial strength and robust liquidity remains unch
anged. Our 
business generates free cash flow at oil prices as low as $50 per barrel and if 
current oil prices persist we expect to generate significant free cash flow 
throughout the rest of the year.
 
At the end of the quarter we had 1.3 billion of total co
rporate liquidity 
including capacity on our reserves based lending facility and revolving credit 
facilities as well as available cash. As previously announced during the 
quarter we completed the renegotiation of our RBL, which resulted in the 
borrowing bas
e increasing to $1.5 billion, up from approximately $1.3 billion 
as a consequence of incorporating our EG assets in the base.
 
It now also includes an accordion feature which allows the borrowing base to 
expand by up to $500 million if the existing finances
 
institutions increase 
their commitments or if new commitments are added.The RBL maturity is 
now been extended from 2021 to 2025. Our $400 million, revolving credit 
facility remains undrawn and we expect to refinance it later this year before 
it matures in
 
November.
 
Maintain an active and consistent hedging program continues to play an 
important role in the financial strategy of the company. Currently we have 
8.4 million barrels hedged at an average floor of $54.79 per barrel in 2018 
and 10.5 million barrel
s hedged at an average floor of $53.33 in 2019.
 
Kosmos' consistent fiscal prudent balance sheet strength and commitment to 
pursuing growth in service of increasing the economic value of the company 
remain key differentiators compared to many of our peers. 
We plan to 
continue living within our means and using our strong free cash flow to 
execute our growth plans.
 
Now I'll turn to the results for the quarter. We finished the first quarter with 
two crude oil lifting's, one each from Jubilee and TEN in line wit
h our 
guidance, generating oil revenues of $127 million or $65.77 per barrel 
excluding derivative settlements.
 
First quarter oil revenues were up compared to the same quarter of 2017 as 
a result of higher oil prices, factoring in approximately $20 million 
of cash 
payments on our hedges lowers our realized pricing at Ghana to $55.56 per 
barrel.
 
For the first quarter we generated a net loss of $50 million or $0.13 per 
diluted share. Adjusting for the impact of onetime items that affect the 
comparability inclu
ding $38 million mark to market hedging loss, the 
company generated a net loss of $23 million or $0.06 per diluted share.
 
On the cost side, operating expense for the first quarter was $47 million or 
$24.18 per barrel versus $46 million or $15.75 per barrel
 
in the fourth 
quarter of 2017. The higher cost was a result of one last cargo lifted in the 
first quarter versus the previous quarter.
 
Also first quarter operating expense included approximately $5 million or 
$2.40 per barrel of expense associated with Ju
bilee work over's that there 
were accelerated into the first quarter. For the full year we are still 
forecasting a rate in the range of $14 to$17 per barrel.
 
Exploration expense of $21 million for the first quarter was primarily related 
to ongoing seismic 
and geologic and geo physical cost in Sao Tome, 
Mauritania and Cote de Ivore is expected to increase in the next two 
quarters as Equatorial Guinea seismic survey commences.
 
General and administrative expenses were $20 million during the first 
quarter, up c
ompared to the same period in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 
2017, driven primarily by the loss of the ability to charge our certain cost 
associated with the transfer of our operatorship of the Tortue redevelopment 
project to BP.
 
Depletion and depreciation
 
expense for the quarter was $54 million or 
$20.07 per barrel, an increase from the prior year period, but in line with 
their guidance. This increase is a result of the heavier weighing of 10 cargos 
to the total number of cargos in the current quarter comp
ared to the prior 
year quarter. With two Jubilee cargoes per quarter for the rest of the year, 
the rate should be well within the range for our full year guidance.
 
Taxes were a benefit of $23 million for the quarter. For Ghana and the US, 
we're 
expecting full year positive pretax income and tax expense. The first 
quarter benefit is expected to reverse in Q2 and Q3 as Ghana pretax income 
goes from loss to positive income.
 
In Equatorial Guinea strong production during the quarter resulted in the 
pa
rtnership lifting four cargoes or two net cargoes to our 50% interest, 
generating net revenues of $123 million or $65.53 per barrel.
 
Operating expense per barrel during the quarter was $13.75. DD&A was 
$28.73 per barrel, comprised of $14.38 cents of normal
 
DD&A and $14.34 of 
basis difference amortization. Both operating expense and DD&A included 
cost associated with their overlook position at the quarter, taxes were 
$13.20 per barrel, slightly higher than our annual guidance due to higher oil 
prices versus 
guidance which was based on $60 brand.
 
As Andy noted, our EG operations generate significant cash flow which 
resulted in an approximately 65 million of cash distributions to Kosmos in 
the quarter and 88 million of cumulative cash distributions from deal cl
osed 
through April. This is a significant portion of the $231 million acquisition 
price we paid last year and is direct evidence of the attractiveness of this 
transaction as the payback timing continues to decrease.
 
Looking to our guidance for the rest of 
the year , our 2018 production 
guidance as Andy indicated of 11 cargos net to Kosmos including seven from 
Jubilee and four from TEN remains unchanged. For each of the remaining 
quarters in 2018, we anticipate lifting two cargos from Jubilee and one from 
TE
N.
 
In today's earnings release we've provided our full year 2018 guidance, 
which remains unchanged from our previous call.
 
With that that concludes our prepared remarks and now operator, we would 
like to open the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Ses

Operator
 
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question
-
and
-
answer session. 
[Operator Instructions
 
The first question comes from the line of Richard tell us from Capital One 
Services. Proceed with your question please.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks. Good mor
ning, Andy a nice quarter. When you look at EG 
production off to a strong start in 2018, I know you mentioned in the 
opening remarks about the plans for drilling in 2019, but should we look for 
further production increases this year given the well optimiza
tion work in 
progress on the assets and she took over and with the upside to the outlook 
of the 43,000 barrel a day forecast for the full year.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, thanks for the question Rich. Look we triggered off to a good start, 
47,000 barrels in the fir
st quarter was obvious ahead of the full year 
guidance that we gave you, which I think will demonstrate I think the 
opportunity that there is in the assets that we acquired. The next phase of 
work is obviously to increase the lift capacity, which is instal
ling the ESP's as 
I discussed. That going to really start in the beginning of the fourth quarter, 
so the production impact from that is really going to be by year end and 
then into 2019. Whereas you said you haven't got the combination of the 
impact of ESP
's and the impact of potential success with input drilling or tie
-
backs. So, in summary you know off to a good start, clear plans to continue 
to grow with activity underway that will impact 2019 and beyond. As we got 
up 2018, we are sticking with our guida
nce. You know we haven't changed 
the guidance. We need to stay another quarter under our belt and then I 
think when we come forward with the 2Q results, we'll obviously give you 
another set of guidance. But, you know what you should take out of those 
comme
nts is, we are really pleased with the work today and it's more than 
just the production, I think it's the integration now of the production of the 
opportunities to enhance through well work and the opportunity now to look 
at the expression at the base. An
d on the Block 24 addition, is also another 
important piece in our puzzle.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Okay and then just moving on to the expiration side with your well along in 
Suriname, has your team able to gather any additional learning's from some 
of the recent w
ells drilled in that area Suriname, Guinea including the recent 
unsuccessful well by Exxon and its partners?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, look this is an emerging bank since there's going to be a mix of 
success in Suriname. My understanding of the Exxon well is they 
were 
testing as sort of an active part of the play which was clearly unsuccessful. 
When we look at our opportunities and block 42, we've got a couple of 
opportunities in the Aurora and the upper China trends. Both of those are 
down there and there are now 
I guess, so the least of turbo price and 
obviously with us being part of the consulate and we are able to leverage of 
their knowledge 
-
 
have a success, significant success that they had in on 
lease or on the stable block. So, yeah I think we are building o
ur knowledge 
base and we continue to be right positive about the opportunities we have in 
45 and 47.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thank you and just one last one for Tom I believe. Could you give an 
overview on the process Tom, to move say from the equity message for EG
 
overtime?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yeah, well what we are doing right now is we are working to give that to the 
normal accounting or which is a fortune accounting and get away from 
equity math of accountings. We are in the process, we hope to have it done 
alter this 
year; I'll give you some more information as we get through along. 
But that is the goal to get back to our normal proportional consolidated 
accounting.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Alright that's all for me, Thank you.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Alright, thanks Richard.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Bob Morris
 
Yeah, Richard asked both of my questions, so I am good. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Oh, yeah, great minds think alike. Thanks Bob.
 
Bob Morris
 
Certainly.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. 
Please proceed.
 
Charles Meade
 
Good morning, we are dealing a team there, or afternoon as may be. I 
wanted to ask you 
-
 
going back to your comments about Ghana and the 
possi
bility of bringing in a second rig towards the end of the year. Can you 
frame up for us, what the next couple of years could look like there in 
specifically I am wondering to 
-
 
there's obvious chance to ramp up the TEN 
complex, but what other opportunities
 
beyond getting TEN to that facility 
capacity? Whether there are opportunities out there to grow volumes there?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, hi Charles, Andy Inglis. Well, if you look at Ghana today I think the 
fundamental point id because of the restriction on drill
ing because of the lost 
price tax and actually the delight for the fulfilled development approval done 
Jubilee, both fields are well constrained today. So, actually adding additional 
wells actually is the thing that is going to drive up production. We've g
ot the 
opportunity to get both fields up the closed main place capacity which is a 
120,000 bopd and 80,000 bopd on TEN. And then with full well capacity as it 
works tax beyond that is really the next thing. And when we are testing 
Jubilee beyond 120, you k
now in the region of 125 and we believe that the 
chances to move TEN beyond the 80,000 name plate capacity. So, really the 
objective is how do we get to the 
-
 
that sweet spot where we got reliable 
production, without the main play capacity or slightly beyo
nd. And, we have 
the well stock that can be dependent, so that where the growth is going to 
come from.
 
Charles Meade
 
Got it, that's helpful detail, thank you. And then if I could ask on question on 
Tortue, has it been anything you've seen in any of the fie
ld work that has 
gone on so far that has evolved you view on how quickly you are going to 
ramp your project up? I think you touched on this a bit perhaps in your 
prepared comments?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, look you know I think everything that seems today remains p
ositive. I 
think the near
-
shore development approach that we're taking provides a 
really cost competitive low cost scheme. We established a necessary 
infrastructure for that with phase I, which use the girl out of fashion 
technology and that is the phase I
 
scheme that is two and half million tons 
per annum. The work that we are doing now with BP is to look at the 
concept that can grow the productions of the full sort of 10 million ton per 
annum, potential of the recent space or somewhere around that number 
and 
what is the optimized way to do that. You know we are going to be using 
that as our initial approach, we put in the infrastructure where we've got a 
very cost competitive base from that. So, how do we grow from there? So, 
now there is nothing sort of i
n the fee that is closing of any questions. I 
think it's really forced to fight that we've got the starting point and I think 
the challenge for us in ourselves in BP now is to ensure that we've got the 
right concept for the full build out of this project. 
And of course having 
established that in the near
-
shore concept you can then apply it to the South 
potentially and trying the discovery or to other discoveries that we would 
have. So, I think that to me is sort of the upside of this is and then you got 
the
 
real opportunity to design one and build many. And we've proven the 
concept through the work that we had done today with BP and we're now 
into field which is all about getting the detail like which enables us to be 
around the end of the year and first gas
 
at the end of 2021.
 
Charles Meade
 
That's helpful context. Thank you, Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Right, thanks Charles.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of David Round from BMO. Please 
proceed.
 
David Round
 
Hi guys. Can you say anything about the range
 
of outcomes for production 
from the [indiscernible] development well and I guess like around TEN? Can 
you just give us kind of a update on hydro performance to the reservoir 
there? You know, you obviously look strong from where we are sitting, but 
may be 
on an individual row based have you seen any decline from through 
there? And then just back apart from that development well, is it going to 
speak straight into the production? Is it going to be a one plus one or is it in 
the case of allowing you to better
 
manage how hard your plates pulling on 
the other wells?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Alright thanks David, lots of good questions there. I think you should think 
about Sao Tome 5, what we should think about is, it has the potential you 
know, to get us on an instantaneous 
rate basis close to the nameplate 
capacity of TEN, yeah. So don't want to do individual well predictions, but I 
think you can do the math for yourself, I think we'll get as close to that on a 
10 years rate basis. So, it is additive and it is tactful to est
ablishing that 
phase. But clearly to reliably producing that level, we want some additional 
well cover and a math obviously a process of bringing a 
-
 
assigning a second 
well and allowing the depletion of that, allowing you to give cover. Okay.
 
David Round
 
Okay, alright I got it. And one 
-
 
just may be one, Tom mentioned it briefly 
and appreciate you want the business to be robust at low oil prices, but I 
guess looking since your last update, we had probably had $10 added to the 
old price, so, what point do y
ou start to think about project the work, 
passing the $55, $60 per well environment rather than sealing the 50?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, I think another good question. I think well the mindset of Kosmos, 
from the day it was found it was all about being at the low
 
end of cost curve. 
Because the low end of the cost curve is easily competitive and you can 
move forward, you know lowest cost supply will always win. I think we have 
all of the projects we have under development today as delicate Tortue and 
it's close to 
the place of two and three. It is fundamentally a low cost source 
of supply and we are not worrying about the old price and move forward 
with those, it's about optimizing it and getting the right concept that we can 
repeat. Similarly in the expiration proo
f earlier we are targeting things that 
work at the low end of the cost curve. So, I don't think you're saying is 
changing our mindset around the threshold of what we would develop or 
not. Because I think fundamentally we've always said that we are going to
 
be at that low end of the cost curve. So, it has not changed our mindset, 
clearly make right bugger opportunity but we got to have things that are 
good for all seasons at the low end of the cost curve and that's the way we 
build the strategy of the compan
y.
 
David Round
 
Got it, okay, thanks Andrew.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks David.

Our next call comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. 
Please proceed.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for taking the question guys. On hedging you've been, least 50% 
h
edged I think over the past couple of years with Brent well into 70's? Is 
that making you more likely to weigh on hedges or perhaps is it kind of the 
upside effect?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Hi Pavel, this is Tom, I'll take that. You know right now, given were our 
pric
es are, we are kind of taking a little bit of break. But, it doesn't change 
our overall philosophy because what the philosophy is, is to protect the 
downside but being able to partake in some of the upside, not all of the 
upside but some of the upside. Rig
ht now, it's a little bit difficult with were 
prices are, in given the accreditation of the current to get some of the upside 
on. So, we are watching it very closely, but we haven't changed our overall 
hedging philosophy.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, and kind of 
along those lines as we watched pop rising and even to 
some extent the back end of the curve move up, any pressure on offer cost 
either the rigs themselves or any of the ancillary components that you guys 
might be observing?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yeah, in a broad b
right sense Pavel, I'm saying no. You know, if you look at 
the two big areas of cost for us, you're looking at the rig market, the six end 
rigs, you know they are all still trying to explore out. And I think my view is 
that's going to remain the case for a
 
number of years. When we look at the 
construction arena, I still think there's never been a better time to build 
infrastructure that will be at a point where yards have significant and used 
capacity and therefore it's great time to sort of lay in capital 
for the long 
term. And, I think that is the census we spoke at the end of the moment and 
it's important too, as it will take advantage of that while it's there. But, we 
don't see an impending end to that as we think about our projects.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay
, appreciate it.

Alright, thanks Pavel.

Our next question comes from the line of Elwin Thomas with Exane [ph]. 
Please proceed. Mr. Thomas your line is live.
 
Elwin Thomas
 
Sorry, I think I was muted. Just to ensure now, can I just 
ask you further 
questions on managing downside risks? So, if the well is becoming dry how 
many independent of the process do you have? Or maybe you can just give 
some color around some of the potential wells you have around there and 
eventually what comes 
out you can take away and when you could get back 
starting in that region? And, if you can just re
-
visit, yeah, the [indiscernible] 
how do you think we should think about commerciality there since times go 
and possible linking of Tortue a later day? Thank 
you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, that's great Elwin. Yeah, sure now, that was probably up the sleeves 
you have 30 or 4 to 5, independent tests with probably four of those within 
Block 42. You know, there are fundamental sort of different play type's 
plastic componen
ts and I think we got both of those in Block 42. And then 
we got sort of different reservoir settings in terms of the age of reservoir 
and then we have different prospect risk when it gets into structure. So I 
think we significant prospectivity in 42 and w
e are clearly at the stage of 
identifying of all that on science mix. But we see 
-
 
fundamentally we see at 
least four tests that we would look to make that is truly independent. And I 
think the challenge we've got at the main menu is taking the right thing
s to 
start and as we talk. And then once you drill back more knowledge, but we 
remain excited about that. I mean and I have failure in 18, you know no 
doubt, we would take a time out, think about what we learnt and then come 
back to just as we have done in
 
Teranga, Senegal. And look from my 
perspective, the great thing about portfolio we talked today, is that we got 
real quality through choice now. We are not driven by rig schedules, we are 
not driven by having to create news, we are never driven by doing t
he right 
work and ensuring that we are drilling enough drill beds, cross beds across 
the portfolio and high grading those. So, that's my mindset today and I think 
in 2019, sort of excess riches, and what we want to do is to make sure that 
we are drilling t
hings that's not cut. So, if we actually fell it, we'd step back, 
there are up sleeve, there are independent tests, we'd have to get back and 
examine them and then decide will they fit in the order.

On the Yakaar we've got a 
significant resource in the hub that combines 
Yakaar and Taranga. You know the next step is appraisal, and we anticipate 
that the appraise the well in 2019, we still have to sort of agreement with 
the government etcetera. And then to my mind you start thin
k about ford 
activity of that, I think you got a piece of work which takes the full 
development of a Tortue, as you know. And then I think with that concept in 
place, you would then look at how you can apply the same technology that 
near show development a
nd apply it to the Yakkar, Taranga. Plenty of 
resource there, what we need to so is ensure that we can continue to 
leverage it and create another truly cost competitive source of gas.

Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Dann from Victory Capital 
Holdings RS. Please proceed with your question.
 
Tyler Dann
 
Good morning everybody thanks for taking my question. I was 
-
 
my question 
is about EG and you provided in your Press Re
lease, the details of what it 
would like when you were proportionally consolidating the asset on EBITDA 
perspective? Could you help me with cash flow from operations and also 
CapEx please?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yeah, hi Tyler. We don't have all of that, this is Tom
, we can get back to you 
offline. Right now, it's self
-
funding from a capital perspective and from a 
cash flow, we can help you to have that word kind of offline, because it's not 
straight forward.
 
Andy Inglis
 
I think I was a couple of months away from acc
ounting that way, Tyler. So, I 
think the rather than give full caster date for capital and cash I think 
probably the best thing to do is walk you through the lines, and show you 
were our thinking is. But, probably you should that offline.
 
Tyler Dann
 
Okay, 
great, we'll refer to that, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Niki Kouzmanov from Jefferies. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Niki Kouzmanov
 
Good morning, good afternoon. Andy and Tom, may be 
just a quick question 
on financing, you talked about the I guess the refining RCF before 
November, want to just know do you actually need to refine that are you 
also looking to refine the senior notes, that the pie has shown after that? 
And on Equatorial G
uinea, most of the questions were answered, but I was 
just wondering is there any maintenance that we need to think of before the 
year end, and plus test driving your guidance for example 43 to 47, thank 
you?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well Tom will do the finance and I'
ll back to you Nicki on EG.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Okay, Niki on the RCF, no, we don't really have to do it, as I said we've got a 
$5.5 million recording feature on the RBL. We'd like to have the spirit of 
capacity though, so and it doesn't cost us very much, we hav
en't drilled very 
much, we've reduced the commitment fee last time we renewed it. So, we'll 
probably look at renewing it, it's a low cost facility for us and it provides us 
somewhere to certain capacity. In terms of the high yield notes, the high 
yield not
es, started last year, they were cargoed for the first time as they 
are pretty expensive. Beside is, they call auction drops a bit, so we are 
looking at that. We are in no hurry, because those notes don't mature till 
202. So, you know we are looking at the
 
foundation, what the market is 
doing and trying to tie in that a bit better and given what the needs we 
might have from the overall business. So, what I'm nearly paid hurry to re
-
finance, mid callers know it's refined and so it's not such as at this point
 
in 
time.
 
Niki Kouzmanov
 
Got it, thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Just on EG Niki, you know there's no unusual planned maintenance on the 
assets. So, no, just a slow repeat to what I said is, we'd change the 
guidance when we know more. We've got a strong start to 
the yearend first 
quarter, we got second quarter under our bowl and then we can move 
forward. But, there is no anything that sort of adding significant plan 
maintenance for the same.
 
Niki Kouzmanov
 
Understood, thank you, Andy. Thank you, Chamber.

Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Good morning guys and congrats to you on your strong Q4 results. The first 
question is just on Brent sending you a $75 bureau, so it's a t
wo part, the 
first is can you remind us again what the sensitivity is that will change in 
Brent? And then if we would hold the $75 bare level how much excess free 
cash flow are we talking about at the company?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Tom will take by for those norms.
 
Tom Chambers
 
So, Neil what I would say is the first hand if you look at cash flow, free cash 
flow, we have 
-
 
w could forecast a range between a 100 million to 200 
million of free cash flow if prizes hold from here. In terms of $5 move in and 
cash on hand, 
I don't have that up yet. We can get that back through Jamie 
or Reese to you about.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Okay, that's a $100 million to $200 million of free cash flow that?
 
Tom Chambers
 
At current price rate.
 
Neil Mehta
 
At current price rate, correct got it. And, so
rry go head?
 
Tom Chambers
 
No, go ahead.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Oh, that's great. And so the follow
-
up is just, if you get into 2019 the spend 
this year is $300 million for capital spend. Can you just talk about the 
moving pieces as we get into '19? How we should be th
inking about, at least 
at a high level, paralytic level, thinking about CapEx in '19 and '20?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Okay, I'll give my sentence as pretty ambitious we are not giving guidance 
on CapEx. But let's look at the moving parts, good, okay?
 
Neil Mehta
 
Yeah.
 
Andy Inglis
 
So, what you are looking down the 
-
 
we ran a sort of one rig program as it 
were through 
-
 
let's just say three quarters. And then the potential of the 
second rig you know it's like another quarter. So, you felt sort of four 
quarters of rig, I 
think you may have a little more rig activity in 2019. The 
question is how long we run the sequence of two rigs? Yeah and I think we 
have not made that decision yet but it could be a little more than probably 
one rig for four quarters. That's one dynamic. 
When you look at the 
development work on Tortue and you look at the expiration work in 
Mauritania, it's going to go 
-
 
we're still working under the BP carry. So, in 
essence sort of no change there. And then really it's the level of wells in 
addition that w
e would pursue outside of that, so really number of wells, say 
terminally numbers of wells actual Guinea. We're clearly drilling two wells in 
the Suriname this year. So, you know we've had a relatively heavy sizing 
program, so you know I don't share signif
icant uptake in that and to my 
mind it's all going to be about you know apology through choices. So, I think 
we will have options by but it's driving the hydrating of that sort of believing 
within that flame. So, I think when you look at the moving parts y
ou can 
see, actually sort of not a lot of difference really as we sort of plan. And it's 
not being driven by the brand prizes, it's being driven by quite doing the 
right thing. I think we have drilling opportunities in Ghana, the most 
important thing is to
 
build the required well capacity that those facilities plus 
a margin but not beyond that. And actually doing a value of the two rigs is 
good, because you clearly are at the benefit of the production area. And 
within expiation we'll have choices to make, b
ut we are going to be hard as 
to bare those choices. And you know as Tom said, in the current world, we 
are delivering $100 million to $200 million of cash.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Yeah, thanks for providing that early look, I appreciate it.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Alright, thanks Neil.

Our final question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein 
Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Thanks for getting me in at the end. The question on Suriname if Anapai 
ends before the first of 
June, you are kind of guiding to the end of May, and 
your next wells are third quarter spud what's driving that time gap? Is it 
optionality around further logging or well testing or is it finalizing which 
prospect to drill?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, it's the latter 
Bob, it is finalizing the final prospects. So, you know two 
question, and we've been very hard edged you know 
-
 
I think I've given you 
a little bit of teller that we see you know moved for tests, pulling up to four 
tests in Block 42. Important thing is the
 
sort of the you know stop the right 
one and we got work to do, that we are currently progressing with our 
partners, with great input from Chevron and from Hess on picking the right 
thing first. So, all that work is quite ongoing as we speak and it will be
 
ready 
and enable us to spot the brilliant at the beginning of the third quarter. So, I 
did think that this is the time to do it right if I was sort of simplify to a punch 
line and I think that's important for the discipline to the way in which we 
approach
 
expiration.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And who covers the rig cost in that month? Is that the partnership?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, no the rig will go off chart.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Okay, gotcha and then a quick follow
-
up. In terms of Mauritania and Senegal 
unitization 
proceedings, can you give us an update on that and how it ties in 
to FID as we approach the end of the year?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, so there is quite a formality, the ICA set out the basic quality 
parameters. So, how unitization would be done, and as you know i
t's by 
complete agreement, 30
-
30 start etcetera and in five years to the first re
-
termination time line. So, all the key parameters have been put in place in 
that inter
-
 
governmental propagate agreement. We then we need to convert 
that into a unit agreemen
t and works are going on that. I don't 
-
 
with all the 
key stuffs done now it's about getting all the detail done. But there is 
nothing sort of out there that would add into supply, that's going to be on 
the critical path.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And that's because th
e volumetric don't matter which is on which side of the 
boarder, it's just really a 
-
 
that will happen latter at redetermination down 
the road.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, so what the ICA did is, it set out the parameter which is it's 50
-
50 
from the start, five year
s in, you determine. So all of that's been done, okay, 
so you're not into a unitization conversation, what you're into is a unit 
agreement that captures all of the intent of that ICA, all that work's been 
done up front.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Great, that's clear. Th
anks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good question Bob because that's very clear that that's the basis on which 
we're working, so it's not a unitization negotiation, it's actually the 
codification if they were writing it down into an agreement.
 
Bob Brackett
 
That's great beca
use unitization 
-
 
I've been stuck in unitizations in the past 
and 
-
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, which is 
-
 
yeah, I would say it's a great point. We've done it a 
different way, we've agreed the big things up front as the process to try to 
-
 
that was a big 
breakthrough here is you agree the big things up front and 
the methodology and now in the back of that you can then convert into an 
agreement, so yeah, that was a good top line question. So I think that's an 
important part of the way we do process.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Second Quarter 2014 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Jon Cappon, Manager of Investor 
Relations at Kosmos Energy.
 
Jon 
Cappon
 
Thank you, Operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release, which is available 
on the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website and we anticipate 
filing our second quarter 10
-
Q with the SEC later today, which will be 
available on our website at that time and as well.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer and Greg Dunlevy, Chief Financial Officer.
 
Following our prepared comments, we w
ill have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Consistent with prior calls, I request that participants to ask only 
one primary question and then one follow
-
up question. This will help ensure 

t able 
to get to within our 45
-
minute timeframe, please contact me later today.
 
Before we get started, I would like to mention that this conference call 
includes certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current 
expectations. The risks associated wit
h forward
-
looking statements have 
been outlined in the earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historic
al and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and i
ncluded in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Jon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Going through my 
remarks today, there were three topics I want to touch on before handing 
the call o
ver to Greg for the financials. First, our solid second quarter 
operating performance. Second, progress on execution of our business plan, 
and third, our continued financial strength.
 
During the quarter, we delivered solid results due to strong production 
at 
Jubilee as well as sound operational execution. Production from the Jubilee 
field remained above expectations producing at a gross rate of over 104,000 
barrels of oil per day sales through the quarter. This in production was 
underpinned by our ability t
o flare a limited volume of gas on the FPSO.
 
In my visits to Ghana during the second quarter, I reviewed firsthand the 
production infrastructure related to our Jubilee operation, both the FPSO 
offshore and the Ghana National Gas Company's construction of i
ts gas 
processing plant and associated pipeline infrastructure. I remain confident 
that all parties involve recognize the importance of resolving the challenge of 
handling the associated gas, which is limiting oil production from the field. 
With this align
ment, the Jubilee partners and the government of Ghana are 
working alongside the various stakeholders with the objective of resolving 
this issue around year
-
end.
 
Shifting from operations to the delivery of our business plan, we continue to 
work closely wit
h co
-
venture partners in Ghana to address both, the TEN 
development and MTA appraisal program. The TEN project is around 30% 
complete and remains on budget and on track to deliver first oil in the 
second half of 2016.
 
Today, we have drilled 8 of the 10 wel
ls planned to be operational with first 
oil and the remaining two wells should be drilled by year
-
end. All major 
contracts are in place, the conversion of the TEN FPSO is ongoing and the 
subsea installation is scheduled to begin next year.
 
Our MTA appraisa
l program also remains on track. We expect to complete 
our appraisal of Mahogany, Teak and Akasa discoveries by year
-
end, 
providing the opportunity to advance these assets towards development 
beginning in 2013.
 
Turning now to exploration, I believe we have
 
and are continuing to build 
the Second Inning exploration portfolio with the potential to create 
tremendous shareholder value. First, Cap Boujdour, we remain encouraged 
by the significant potential of our Cap Boujdour acreage, a potentially giant 
unexplor
ed hydrocarbon province with substantial exploration prospectivity.
 
Several play fairways have been defined within the basin and we have 
identified multiple prospects within each fairway ranging in size from 0.5 
billion barrels to more than 1 billion barre
ls of oil equivalent.
 
Gargaa will be the first of these prospects to be tested. It's a very large 
structure with a mean reserve size of over 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
Operational planning is underway and we plan to spud the well in the late in 
t
he fourth quarter using the Atwood Achiever drillship. The Achiever is 
currently scheduled for delivery later this month to begin our plan 90
-
day 
mobilization to northwest Africa.
 
Second, Mauritania, last year we acquired both, 2D and 3D seismic across 
off
shore acreage position. Interpretation of these seismic volumes has 
continued yield encouraging results, including well
-
defined channel systems 
and AVO supported features with seismic conformance disruption.
 
Most importantly, our acreage is down dip of a p
roven hydrocarbon system. 
As a result, we've high
-
graded the number of well
-
defined prospects moving 
Mauritania forward in our drilling schedule. We expect to seek a partner later 
this year ahead of spudding our first exploration well in Mauritania in mid
-
2015.
 
Third, Agadir Basin, offshore Northern Morocco, we recently completed a 
large 3D survey providing continuous seismic coverage across the three 
adjacent licenses that together cover the core part of the Agadir Basin. The 
seismic will be incorporated i
nto already robust data set ahead of an 
exploration well planned for the second half of 2015.
 
Finally, let me remind you of our financial strength. We have a strong 
balance sheet and robust liquidity. Both are key components of our strategy 
to prepare for 
an exploration success. Our business model is built on the 
principle of being a self
-
funded explorer with expected cash flow from Ghana 
able to completely fund our ongoing Ghana developments as well as planned 
exploration program.
 
Our financial strategy ha
s created strong corporate liquidity of around $1.9 
billion after our recent high
-
yield bond offering. We are in the strongest 
financial position in the company's history at exactly the right time and we 
are building momentum to drill out our Second Inning
 
exploration portfolio.
 
In conclusion, we remain focused on what creates the most value for our 
shareholders, building production and reserves in Ghana, delivering 
exploration success through our industry
-
leading portfolio and maintaining 
our financial str
ength. Jubilee, TEN and MTA are the foundation stones of our 
self
-
funded exploration strategy. They are well
-
defined world
-
class resources 
with significant potential.
 
As the saying goes big fields get bigger and we believe there is a lot more 
value to be c
reated in will Ghana. Our Second Inning exploration program 
continues to gather momentum. It is high upside potential with three player 
inning test planned in 2015. Cap Boujdour, Mauritania and the Agadir Basin, 
each of which could unlock a multi
-
billion b
arrel play fairway. Finally, we 
have the financial strength and the right team in place to execute our plan 
and deliver success.
 
I would now like to turn the call over to, Greg, to update you on the financial 
side of things. Greg?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. In my prepared comments this 
morning, I will review our financial results for the second quarter and then 
provide a brief update on our expectations and guidance for the remainder 
of the year.
 
Overall financial perform
ance for the second quarter was strong based on 
the sale of our third Jubilee cargo and results were therefore generally ahead 
of analysts' expectations. Oil revenue was $328 million, generating income 
of $57 million or $0.15 per share. Included in these r
esults are the 
previously announced non
-
cash derivatives mark
-
to
-
market charge of nearly 
$22 million and a restructuring charge of approximately $12 million. Absent 
these, net income would have been approximately $82 million or $0.22 per 
share.
 
Cost relate
d performance was solid in the quarter, with production expense, 
exploration expense, G&A and DD&A, all showing improved performance in 
last year's quarter. Production expense was $23 million or slightly less than 
$8 per barrel sold, with no workover opera
tions conducted during this 
quarter.
 
Exploration expense was $24 million in the quarter, includes nearly $3 
million for the FA
-
1 well in Morocco, demonstrating the benefit of the well 
carry. The balance was associated with seismic costs for two large offsh
ore 
3D programs. One is still underway at quarter end and costs related to 
advancing various exploration
-
based initiatives.
 
G&A cost of $32 million represents a decrease from last year and a slight 
increase over the first quarter, which was positively affe
cted by several 
unusual items. Depletion and depreciation of approximately $24 per barrel 
continue to be favorably impacted with the addition of proved Jubilee 
reserves at the end of last year.
 
Tax expense of $81 million is a result of higher revenues asso
ciated with 
having both, being third cargo in the quarter and higher oil prices. We 
expect the non
-
cash mark
-
to
-
market charge related to commodity 
derivatives to very quarter
-
to
-
quarter with the recent quarter's charge 
associated with an approximate $5 per
 
barrel increase in increase in rental 
prices during the second quarter.
 
Having successfully completed inaugural high yield offering, total corporate 
liquidity is approximately $1.9 billion as of June 30
th
, pro forma for the high 
yield transaction. Includi
ng in liquidity at quarter end are unrestricted cash 
and cash equivalents of $622 million.
 
At this time, I would like to transition to our expectations for the remainder 
of 2014. Our forecasted investment program remains at approximately $575 
million, with
 
around 70% or $400 million of this targeting for activity in 
Ghana, and the remaining allocated to exploration activities. Just over half of 
the Ghana's spend is directed to TEN development with the rest targeted 
toward ongoing Jubilee Phase 1A developmen
t and MTA appraisal.
 
Included in the exploration spend are initial cost for the Gargaa exploration 
well scheduled to spud late this year. We sold five cargos of Jubilee oil in the 
first half of 2014, but have nonetheless retained our annual sales forecast 
at 
a total of eight cargos, net to Kosmos during the year. This is based on the 
fields' operators 2014 production forecast of 100,000 barrels of oil per day.
 
During the second quarter, our lifting has averaged $970,000 barrels each. 
On the cost side, we an
ticipate yearly production expense in the range of 
$10 to $12 per barrel, inclusive of workover expenses. There is a workover 
operations planned in the third quarter.
 
G&A cost for the year is expected remain slightly down from full year 2013 
levels, DD&A s
hould average around or just under $25 per barrel. 2014 
exploration investments based on our current CapEx guidance are expected 
to be approximately $175 million and we have used as a proxy for 
exploration expense.
 
Interest expense should increase to refle
ct the cost of the recent $300 
million notes offering. This note offering was an opportunity to locking long
-
term capital at historically low cost. Our hedge position at the end of the 
quarter totaled $10.2 million barrels with around 3 million barrels rem
aining 
in 2014 and the balance directed toward 2015 and 2016.
 
As part of our ongoing price risk management, we expect to add to our 2015 
and 2016 positions. Bearing in mind the challenge of giving guide on tax as 
well as recent high oil prices that are sup
porting higher revenues we project 
per quarter tax expense to be approximately $25 million per lift.
 
Thank you, now operator we would like to open the call for questions
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We will now be conduction a question a
nd answer session. 
(Operator Instructions) Thank you. First question comes from the line of Ed 
Westlake with Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Yes. Good morning. You mentioned that one of the things for the
 
second half 
of the year was MTA appraisal. Maybe just if there's been any updated sort 
of reserve estimates for the MTA sort of blocks and what you are hoping to 
get out of the appraisal program for the second half of the year. Thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Hi
, Ed. It's Andy. I think, we talked data MTAs is having a resource size 
of somewhere around 75 million barrels and I think that estimate remains 
good. The work that we have done so far this year and additional well that 
we drilled sort of underpins I think
 
more in two
-
thirds of that bit of work to 
finish off to put together the development plan that will underpin the full 75 
million barrels, but the [work] as we said is going to plan.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Right. Then as you have drilled any of the 10
 
wells in the development plan, 
I mean, any updates in terms of obviously get extra information as well in 
even development wells? Any changes to TEN based on the wells that you 
have drilled?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. Actually what I would say is actually 8 of the 1
0 wells that we would 
have on production at the beginning. I think all I would say is, with the data 
from those wells, we are confident that that wells stock will fill the FPSO, so 
if you like that initial gain that you get from having the trees really cer
tainly 
bearing fruit.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Then obviously far way or to the south of your acreage that the (Inaudible) 
well was announced, dry this morning. I mean, any geological read across? 
It seems like it's relatively far away from where you wo
uld be drilling.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Yes. It is. If you remember, I think what they were targeting, I think it it's a 
Jurassic carbonate. It's a very different play, where we are obviously 
outboard. This is cretaceous target, which we are chasing here, so very 
deepwater prospect, so very diff
erent, so I think there is absolutely no read 
across.

Thanks you. The next question is from the line of Anish Kapadia of TPH. 
Please proceed with your question.

Hi. Good afternoon. Just the first question on the exploration side, it's 
interesting Mauritania being prioritized, but just looking at Ireland, one of 
your partners recently put out [CPR] by some of the preliminary seismic 
data that was out there for I
reland, which showed greater probability of gas 
and also the oil leads as they put out that were relatively small. I was 
wondering if you could discuss your interpretation of the data you are seeing 
today and your confidence in terms of moving forward on I
reland.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. This is an independent study, so it's not one that we were involved in, 
so I would say a couple of things. You know, the first is funding your 
exploration that was always a phase risk. I would say this was a new 
knowledge. The phas
e risk remains. We are clearly targeting oil and actually, 
the most direct analog for us would Dunquin well, which is the Exxon Mobil, 
which was drilled I think around a year ago and it had all shows in the 
cretaceous. In terms of hard fact, I think that's
 
the thing that I would 
probably put up mirror against that study.

Bit more of a question, I mean, being at 
-
 
for few months now, I was 
wondering if you envisaged any significant changes in strategy and also 
what do you see to close the
 
gap between the equity market valuation 
Kosmos and as well as your view of the value of the assets.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Okay. We could spend all day, Anish. That's a big question. I think the 
things that are important, I would point out are following which i
s, I have 
been at the [home] as you say just under six months now. The thing that 
struck me most is that time period is the quality of our exploration portfolio 
and the progress we made in maturing that whether it would be in the 
Western Sahara, whether it
 
would be the Agadir Basin to the North, 
Mauritania, Ireland and Surinam, you know, this is a world
-
class portfolio 
and I remain stronger in that view than actually when I joined. That's the 
first I would make.
 
I think, in terms of the valuation gap going 
forward, I think we clearly have 
to deliver on our promises in terms of Ghana, which is still about reserves 
and about production. I think, this year we have done that. I think, we will 
continue to do that. The plans are very clear and the progress is bein
g made 
in line with those plans.
 
Then, I think, the second big issue then clearly is the valuation around the 
exploration portfolio. It's quite difficult to do. It's in the eye of the beholder, 
but from our perspective it will be about being able now throu
gh 2015, 2016 
and 2017 deliver in aggregate three to four wells per year, each of which 
has significant prospectivity in terms of opening up a play fairway.
 
I believe there is a significant value gap, but that can only be delivered I 
think through demonstr
ating the delivery of that exploration portfolio, so 
that remains the core strategy. The company has a world
-
class asset in 
Ghana. It's self
-
funded both the Ghana development and exploration 
program and continuing to grow. That cash flow is clearly the fir
st step.
 
Then second step now is to embark on the drill out of a world
-
class portfolio 
in the Second Inning and that has really start to continuous program with 
the arrival of Achiever and the spudding of the first well, Gargaa offshore 
Western Sahara.

I was just wondering, in this market clearly there is a very negative view 
from the equity marketing in terms of exploration should allow you to 
actually pick up exploration opportunities relatively cheap. Are you looking 
to maybe utilize 
a very strong balance sheet and further enhance that 
exploration portfolio in the coming months or so take advantage of that 
value gap?
 
Andy Inglis
 
It's a great question, Anish, but I think if I get it back to the core strategy, 
Kosmos is a very rigorous e
xploration company and this is all quality 
through choice. We have opened up significant acreage positions in the 
areas that I have talked about earlier. We have done the work in terms of 
the 2D leading to the 3D, leading to high quality prospect ability t
o farm out 
those, drill at very low cost.
 
We need to be very careful about buying something in the market at higher 
value and lower cost. We obviously scan the horizon continuously of 
opportunities out there and if we see something from within our portfoli
o, 
then we would do that, but that's the market today and it should also give 
you a sense of the quality that we think we have versus what other people 
have, so no. It's very challenged. We are looking at it very hard, but we are 
setting a pretty high bar 
in terms of, it has to be better than what we have 
today.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Anish, this is Greg. We do have a lot of liquidity, but liquidity is there for 
strategic reasons as part of maturing the company, funding sources and to 
be ready for success. We do look
 
at a lot of things out there, but as you 
know the record for exploration has not been good the last year
-
and
-
a
-
half 
and in large part we think there's just not a lot of things that we have looked 
in other people's portfolios, so we are going to go back to
 
we do hear issues 
a lot which is discipline and we are not going to pursue things just because 
we have money. We are only going to pursue them, because they had, in 
our view, significant shareholder value potential.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Al Stanton with RBC. Please

Al Stanton

Yes. Good morning folks. You mentioned a couple of times that you are 
self
-
funded through the near
-
term, so I was wondering if you could provide any 
guidance on where CapEx development and exploration spending are going 
next year. I am assuming, both are going to be up year
-
on
-
year. As part of 
that, I was wondering, Greg, wh
ether you would say that you are refinanced 
or you are refinancing.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Well, let me answer. We have, if you want to call it refinanced. We have 
extending maturities considerably this year as we have looked to mature a 
capital structure as the com
pany and we are maturing, one, because we are 
growing as company. We continue to grow in, but two we are preparing for 
exploration success. That is an as an integral part of our business strategy 
and to be ready for it is critical to us. We are not as read
y in 2007, when we 
discovered Jubilee. We will be ready at this time around.
 
In terms of CapEx for next year, I think the significant change will be that 
TEN will pick next year in CapEx spend among the partnership, so I would 
expect 2015 CapEx to be up so
mewhat on the back of TEN, but I would 
expect exploration to be in the same neighborhood. Obviously, I am talking 
about exploration and I am excluding any success based CapEx from that.

On the exploration spend, is there any assumption tha
t you didn't drill with 
the current stake. Obviously, there is Mauritania, former plant, but also you 
got a big second Ireland.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
What's your assumption on exploration stakes?
 
Al Stanton 
-
 
RBC
 
Our strategy has been clear that we do before we dri
ll, but after we do our 
3D. We seek a partner here to come into the blocks as we did in Morocco 
with the both, BP in the North and Mediterranean capital we drew license. 
It's fundamental part of our strategy is it's an organic
-
driven model, so we 
will seek
 
to bring in partners in our internal planning we assume ground floor 
formats even though historically we received significant promotes from our 
format initiatives and we generally called on average target levels in the 
third to a half
-
ish, in that range.

Okay, Thanks. With the well that you will be drilling at year end,
 
offshore 
Morocco, have you incorporated the new seismic you have just acquired or is 
this still too early?
 
Andy Inglis
 

prospects. The Gargaa is fully described and actually what 
we have very 
high quality data set up across Gargaa and really the additional 3D that we 
would shop there is about actually the extension of that play and what would 
be following on exploration success, so the amount of success we would then 
be able to inc
orporate on it.
 
John Herrlin

Society Generale
 
Okay. With the Canadian gas, you mentioned at the end of fourth quarter 
you then think you will have to step up next year for oil volumes with 
greater gas takeaway or with the initiation of gas take away?
 
And
y Inglis
 
Yes. That's right. In a way that I think about it is, so to say that it is going to 
be around. I talked about by the around year end we will start, I think, to 
move gas At that point you got well capacity of the FPSO with an excess of 
the core FPS
O may imply to 120. It's down 125 already, probably with a 
little more, so you can probably re
-
use reasonably quick ramp up to at least 
the 125 level and the ability probably to do a little better than, so that's the 
way you should think about sort for the
 
2015 production.

Thanks for taking the question guys. To ask about kind of unpleasant topic, 
but Ghana is obviously not in the upper

in the vicinity at least of a public 
health crisis in West Africa. I was wondering whether you received any 
instructions or directives fro
m the local regulators about moving personnel 
or equipment or anything like that associated with health issue.
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. It's is an important question. We are clearly monitoring situation very 
closely. We are obviously in contacts with the health aut
horities in Ghana 
and today there will no cases recorded. We have in place full contingency 
plans if they were to be an issue, so it's something as you say which is huge 
unfortunate, but so far Ghana has not been impacted but we have very 
robust plans in p
lace should not be an issue.

Okay. Then let me switch gears to ask you about hedge being mentioned 
that your starting at looking to hedge all the way out to 2016, given that 
brand is in pretty significant backwardation I gue
ss how you thinking about 
sort of modeling that in another word how long would you agree to go on 
your hedges out 18 to 24 months?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. We actually have hedge I mean 2016 ready 2 million barrels. We intend 
to look at hedging as insurance or def
ensive tools so what we do is we put 
puts in place generally around $85 up to $90 we sale a call spread on the 
upside just to recover some of the cost to put.
 
If you look at it more practical in terms, we are selling some of the far 
upside in place for the
 
higher upside it return for buying some floors 
underneath it. By designed, the strategy is expected give us very low cost 
and less oil prices really went up substantially generally north of 115.

Please go ahead with your question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Hi. I had just a question regarding the rig 
contract. I mean, your contract for 
the Achiever provides you a lot of flexibility in case of success. What I am 
trying to understand is, how you plan to utilize the rig given that you have 
already given two rigs to three slots to Freeport for drilling off
shore Morocco 
in 2015. Should we assume the remaining slots to be with you for Morocco, 
Mauritania drilling or are you looking for some more subletting or being 
more opportunistic in farming opportunities in West Africa?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. I think you should 
regard. The whole purpose of having the Achiever is 
first to be in control of our destiny. It's a high
-
quality rig and it's one which 
we believe will be both, safe and efficient. As you say, we found out two 
slots.
 
As we look across '15, '16 and '17, there
 
are probably 11 slots in total to be 
found out, which means it gives the opportunity to drill three for slightly 
more efficient potentially four. We have a prospectivity across Morocco, 
Mauritania, Ireland, Surinam to fully underpin that, so this is about
 
us 
retaining the discipline and showing the we can use our rig to our best 
advantage across our portfolio. The two are absolutely synced up in terms of 
the number we have available and we wells we plan to drill and the quality 
of the portfolio.

Good morning, gentlemen. Most of my primary questions have been 
answered, but just 
follow
-
up on Mauritania. Then lot of colors were result 
-
 
just any change of thinking or latest thinking about your targeted play 

 
Andy Inglis
 
Again, I think, it's very different target. I guess, it's 
cretaceous, it's outboard 
and I will just come back to the word design that I used in the my remarks. 
You know this has been baking in the oven for some time. Last year it was 
2D and 3D. We got encouraging results from that 3D.
 
We got very well
-
defined cha
nnel systems and it's AVO supported with 
seismic [conformance] structure, so we feel we develop very strong 
prospectivity. This is our first re
-
entry back into the West Africa transform 
margin, but it's well underpinned now with the seismic work that we ha
ve 
done. As a result, we feel this is a very high quality prospect, so that's why 
we have moved it forward in our drilling schedule.

Greetings and welcome to the Kosmos Energy Second Quarter 2018 
Earnings Call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being 
recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Jamie Buckland. Please go 
ahead.
 
Jamie 
Buckland
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to you all for joining us today.
 
This morning, we issued a press release regarding our second quarter 
earnings, and an additional release on the acquisition of Deep Gulf Energy, 
both releases are available on the In
vestors page of the kosmosenergy.com 
website. We have also included a slide presentation on the acquisition to 

Kosmos website. We anticipate filing our 10
-
Q for the second quarter
 
with 
the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer.
 

certain forward
-
looking 
statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management bel
ieves such measures are important in looking at the 

referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information contai
ned in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie, and good morning and afternoon, everyone.
 
Today, we announced the acquisition of D



quarter, starting with production.
 
Our high
-
margin assets in Ghana and E
quatorial Guinea performed well in 
the second quarter, delivering four cargos net to Kosmos as expected.
 
In Ghana, gross production at Jubilee averaged approximately 68,000 
barrels of oil per day for the quarter. The turret remediation of the FPSO was 
comp
leted successfully during a planned two
-
week shutdown. We still expect 
the rotation of the vessel to occur around the end of the year with minimal 
impact to production in 2018. With remediation work complete, Jubilee is 
now producing consistently over a 10
0,000 barrels of oil per day.
 
With drilling resumed in Ghana, we expect to bring two new producer wells 
on line in Jubilee later this year, one in the third quarter and one in the 
fourth quarter. We expect these additional wells to deliver around 20,000 to
 
25,000 barrels of oil per day, helping to arrest any declines in existing well 
stock and increase production towards the FPSO nameplate capacity of 
120,000 barrels of oil per day. In total, we still expect 7 cargos in Jubilee in 
the year with 2 cargos in 
each of the next two quarters.
 
At TEN, production average approximately 61,500 barrels of oil per day for 
the quarter. Two wells are to be drilled and completed by year
-
end at TEN. 
The first Ntomme well has been drilled and came on line today. A second 
wel
l is expected to start production around the end of the year. Combined 
we expect the additional TEN wells to deliver around 15,000 to 20,000 
barrels of oil per day, resulting in production rising towards the FPSO 
nameplate capacity of 80,000 around the end
 
of the year. The FPSO was 
previously being tested at rates above the 80,000
-
barrel of oil per day 
capacity. We will test it in 2019 as additional wells come on stream.
 
The partnership has now approved the second rig in Ghana, and we expect 
the rig to arri
ve early in the fourth quarter. The second rate will be used for 
completions with the current run rate set up for drilling more wells in 2019. 
Taking advantage of low rig rates in the current environment enables the 
partnership to accelerate the addition o
f new wells in Ghana, increasing 
production towards FPSO capacity sooner and allowing the capacity of the 
FPSOs to be tested.
 
Finally, Kosmos was successful in its arbitration against Tullow concerning a 
dispute related to the West Leo rig contract. As a r
esult start, Kosmos is not 

the ruling stipulated the Kosmos will receive around $14 million for 
reimbursement costs and legal fees.
 
In Equatorial Guinea, gross field production a
veraged over 46,000 barrels of 
oil per day during the quarter, exceeding our 43,000
-
barrel per day 2018 
forecast and 37,000
-
barrel per day acquisition assumption. We have owned 
the assets now for just over a half a year and still deriving a track record, s
o 
have left our full guidance the same.
 
The strong production at Equatorial Guinea resulted in cash distributions of 
$55 million in the quarter. Year
-
to
-
date through cash distributions totaled 
$148 million or approximately 64% of the purchase price. At oil
 
prices, the 
payback on the asset is expected to be around one year. Looking forward, 
well stock to install electric submersible pumps or ESPs in Equatorial Guinea 
should begin in the fourth quarter. These are expected to support current 
production rates a
head of near
-
field and infill drilling in 2019.
 
Next, I would like to move to development and Tortue in particular. The 
Tortue project continues to make good progress. And BP mentioned on their 
earnings call last week, we expect FID around the end of the y
ear. FEED is 

several parties including two supermajors and an international commodity 
trading house. Importantly, the bids include financial offers for the NOC, 
which means the financing 
for partners should not impact the timing of FID. 
A remaining item ahead of FID is the harmonization of any non
-
PSA fiscal 
terms. With the ICA signed earlier this year, these discussions are taking 

arket on these 
discussions through the rest of the year.
 
I will now turn to exploration in Suriname in particular. We have one 
remaining test in 2018, drilling the Pontoenoe prospect in Block 42 with 
partners Hess and Chevron. Pontoenoe is the first of upt
o three independent 
prospects in Block 42 and is a similar play time to the Turbot and Longtail 
discoveries located approximately 70 kilometers to the west in Guyana. The 
well is expected to spud around mid
-
August and drilling should take around 
60 days. S
o, in summary, the business continued to perform well during the 
second quarter, and we remain on track to deliver $100 million to $200 
million of net cash flow this year.
 

acquisition D

next step in the evolution of Kosmos to becoming a full
-
cycle of E&P with the 
acquisition of Deep Gulf Energy or DGE from First Reserve for $1.225 billion. 
DGE is a leading deep water company in 
the Gulf of Mexico with attractive 
assets and a strong track record of success. The purchase price is comprised 
of $925 million in cash, funded by existing credit facility and $300 million in 
Kosmos equity issued to First Reserve. Closing is expected by th
e end of the 
third quarter.
 
The acquisition creates a platform for growth in the Gulf of Mexico adding 
approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production, an 80 
million barrels of oil equivalent estimated 2P reserves, with an estimated 
re
serves to production ratio of 8.8. The reserves have a low retirement 
obligation of approximately $100 million undiscounted.
 

through the transaction. Kosmos began life as a pure 
play explorer, 
achieving major success in Ghana, with a discovery of the Jubilee and TEN 
fields. In 2011, via IPOed the Company as the exploration
-
led E&P with cash 
flow from Jubilee and TEN fields. Our resource base was expanded by 
exploration success in 
Mauritania and Senegal, where we discovered 40 Tcf 
of gas gross which has been partially monetized through the BP farm
-
out.
 
As I mentioned earlier, the first phase of development of this gas Tortue is 
headed to FID around year end 2018. Over the last four 
years, our 
production has doubled with the developments at TEN fields, which started 
production in 2016, and the late 2017 acquisition of Ceiba and Okume field 
in Equatorial Guinea.
 
Combined production across Ghana and Equatorial Guinea is approximately 
45
,000 barrels of oil per day net to Kosmos. The acquisition of DGE, creates 
a larger company with greater scale and substantial free cash flow. The 
highly complementary nature of the DGE assets provides Kosmos with a 
balance of short
-
cycle growth opportunit
ies, alongside our existing medium 
and longer term projects.
 
The enhanced production and cash flow profile of combined Company 
enables us to pay a dividend starting in first quarter of 2019. Most 
importantly, the transaction is consistent with the 

the day Kosmos started business, an Atlantic Margin focus that leverages 
our differentiated deepwater skill set, reducing high margin resources from 
low cost efficient exploration and development. Since inception, we have 
executed t
his strategy with a consistent focus on disciplined capital 
allocation and a strong balance sheet.
 
Turning to slide two. This is a highly attractive, immediately accretive entry 
point in the Gulf of Mexico. 2018 estimated cash flow per share is expected

Turning to slide three. Many of you are familiar with DGE. A leading 
deepwater Gulf of Mexico Company with a material oil wei
ghted reserves and 
production base focused on tying back to existing infrastructure. They are 
proven operator with an excellent safety record. Their highly experienced 
management team, brings over 20 years of Deepwater Gulf of Mexico 
experience on average 
and a record of value creation in the basin. The 

flow. There is also attractive organic growth potential from infill drilling of 
existing fields on production to utilize spare facil
ities capacity and from an 
inventory of over 50 million barrels of oil equivalent for the next five 
prospects.
 
Most importantly, DGE has a low

cycle exploration strategy with 
success coming from 15 of 19 wells drilled since 2012, delivering fir
st 
production from these discoveries in just 18 months on average.
 

are lot of attractive opportunities that can be pursued from this new 

able production and 
reserves growth is illustrated on slide four. Between 2013 and 2017, they 
grew production from our 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to over 
18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at a compound annual growth rate 
of over 40%. Ov
er the same time period, the team grew 2P reserves from 
just under 40 to around 85 million barrels equivalent at over a 20% 
compound annual growth rate.
 

under investment in DGE. We beli
eve in the right hands with this 
management team and growth capital available for the right opportunities, 
the DGE assets will be a major growth driver for Kosmos over many years to 

 
Now, turning to slide five,

an attractive deal for Kosmos, starting with the 
Gulf of Mexico. So, why 
invest in the Gulf of Mexico now? The Gulf of Mexico is world class basin with 
a huge amount of discovered and yet to be discovered resources across a 
number of play times. There are two fundamental reasons why now is the 
right time
 
for Kosmos to enter the Gulf of Mexico, attractive economics and 
lack of competition.
 
On the economics, the Gulf of Mexico provides a highly competitive source of 
supply. The chart on the left shows a full
-
cycle NPV
-
10 WTI breakevens of 

ompares them to the leading shale basins in North 

in the very best onshore shale plays.
 
In terms of competition, the basin has become more accessible as many 
companies have exited
 
to focus onshore. The chart on the right shows the 
changing landscape and historic activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico over the 
last ten years. During that period, the composition has changed 
dramatically. The lease sale participant pool has shrunk by m
ore than 60% 
and lease sale bidding is down by more than 85%. This sharp decrease has 
lead to large and mid caps who have left the basin to chase the shale plays.
 
At the same time, Gulf of Mexico production has grown steadily as majors 
remained consistentl
y active and continued to sanction cost competitive 
projects helped by a sustained deflation and supply cost in contrast to shale. 
The attrition of independents created an opportunity for private equity who 
made a number of investments in Gulf of Mexico th
at are now nearing the 
end of their fun ten
-
years, as such do not have access to the necessary 
funding for further growth opportunities. The growth opportunities from 

been for many ye
ars. A large number of leases grounded 10 years ago, 
coming up for relinquishment creating tremendous opportunities. Given the 
changing industry structure, we believe there are also significant inorganic 
opportunities for Kosmos to pursue, serving as a con
solidator of choice to 
the high
-
quality, capital starved assets. The attractive economics and 
changing competitive dynamic mean that now is a right time to enter this 
prolific basin, which is rich in opportunity and ripe for the consolidation.
 
Turning to s
lide seven, which along with slide eight, shows the strength of 
the combination. With the addition of Gulf of Mexico, we remain focused on 
the deepwater conjugate margins of the Atlantic. The DGE assets help to 
diversify production and create a new platfor
m for growth that will leverage 

 
When I joined Kosmos in 2014, year
-
end production from our single 
producing asset in Ghana was around $23,000 barrels of oils per day. Over 
the last four years, that production has doubled
 
with the addition of TEN and 
Equatorial Guinea. Through the acquisition of DGE and the ongoing 
performance of our existing portfolio, we expect to double production and 
EBITDAX again over the next four years.
 
As shown on slide eight, this deal substantial
ly increases our scale and 
diversifies our reserves and production base. The chart on the left shows our 
2P reserves increase by around 40% from around 200 to 280 million barrels 
of oil equivalent. Chart on the right shows production increasing by around 
5
0% to 70,000 barrels of oil pro forma with around a third of that production 
coming from the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Turning to slide nine and most importantly, this transaction is immediately 
accretive to shareholders with minimum dilution. The assets are being 
a
cquired at a 2018, EV to EBITDAX multiple of 3.4 times compared to 
Kosmos at a consensus multiple of 6.4 times. On an EV to 2P reserve basis, 
the assets have been acquired for approximately $15 per barrel while 

tely $21 per barrel.
 
2018 estimated cash flow per share is expected to increase by 
approximately 35% on a pro forma basis. Strong cash flow generation 
underpinned by growing and balanced production supports capital return to 
shareholders in the form of div
idend.
 
Turning to slide nine. Kosmos has already managed its balance sheet 
conservatively with disciplined capital allocation, the critical part of executing 
our strategy. As many of you are aware, Kosmos has only drilled 11 frontier 
wells, in its 14
-
year 
history, with a 30% commercial success rate, 
discovering around 1.5 billion barrels of oil gross and around 42 TCF of gas 
gross. This is in contrast to many of our peers.
 
With the addition of the DGE assets, our approach to capital allocation will 
not chan
ge. At the end of 2Q, our net debt
-
to
-
EBITDAX was around 1.6 
times, which increased around 2.2 times, taking account the transaction. As 
a result of this deal, we expect our combined assets to generate substantial 
free cash flow, allowing us to begin to ra
pidly delever, by the end of this 
year, to around 1.7 times and through 2019 closing at around 1.2 times at 
year
-
end 2019, well below where we were before this transaction.
 

-
cycle E&P, 
a compa
ny with a portfolio rich in opportunity, covering short, medium and 
longer cycle projects. Starting at the top of the slide and following the 
arrows. We have a significant production base with the opportunity to grow 
production and utilize spare facility c
apacity in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and 
now the Gulf of Mexico through high rates of return, well work projects and 
infill drilling.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea, existing infrastructure and 
strong exploration portfolios offer infrastructure

led exploration potential and 
provide the opportunity to further drive short

cycle production growth.
 
In Mauritania and Senegal, our world

opportunity to deliver low

generation for decades to come.
 


potent
ial for longer cycle, world
-
class upscale discovery. And lastly, through 
maintaining a solid financial foundation, we are well
-
positioned for 
deepwater consolidation, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico.
 
So, turning to slide 12. This deal is all about susta
inable production and free 
cash flow growth, which underpins shareholder returns. Our strong high
-
margin production growth, diversified cash flow and disciplined focus on 
capital allocation enables us to commence a dividend. We intend to pay an 
annual divi
dend of $0.17 per share, paid quarterly starting in the first 
quarter of 2019. The dividend payment is expect to increase over time, in 

 
So, turning to the last slide. In summary, we believe this highly attractive 
transactio
n positions Kosmos as a premier, Atlantic Margin, deepwater E&P. 
The acquisition creates greater scale and provides growth in production and 
sustainable cash flow. DGE enhances our world
-
class asset base, by adding 
high
-
margin production and short

frastructure
-
led exploration to our 
portfolio of world scale developments and frontier exploration. The 
acquisition creates a new platform for growth by enhancing our skill set and 
our balance sheet provides the financial liquidity for future growth 
opport
unities. And finally, we have the financial strength to execute through 
the cycle, ensuring our ability to fund growth, delever and return capital to 
shareholders.

Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line David Round with 
BMO Capital Markets.
 
David Round
 

looks like a good deal. 
So, perhaps you could just address some of the 
pushback guys had around how you are actually able to get the deal done 
and agreed on these terms. And then, just the second one, probably looking 
at slide seven here, you put some production growth targets ou
t there. Can I 
just understand where the majority of the growth is coming from? Is it 
legacy Kosmos or is it new assets? And follow
-
on is, how material could the 
Gulf of Mexico be?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, getting the deal done. I think, we were very credible coun
terparty for 
First Reserve. And as you see from the announcement, they turned around, 
$300 million of Kosmos stock as part of the deal. And I think, our ability to 
put a cash and stock offer on the table, and actually for them to believe in 
the combination
 
going forward was an important part of this. So, it was a 
competitive process. But, we were able to position ourselves, I think, as a 
company that they believed in, and actually the management team believed 
in. Key part of this transaction is not only ass
ets but there is a great track 
record of execution within the DGE management team. And they are excited 

been capital
-

oppor
tunity now to take this up is very similar to where we were with the 
Hess deal. You could ask the same question on Hess deal. How we were able 

and actually being something that
 
particularly the DGE example of the 
management team wants to be part of.
 
So, I think turning to your second question really around where is production 

we talked about, which is in
 
an asset sense, I talked today about growth I 
Ghana from the infill drilling, filling the facilities. That program is well 

got a great start to obviously produce at a higher level t



drilling in 2019 that will provide growth over that time period, plus we will 
start the infrastruct

resource. So, there is growth in Ghana, there is growth in EARNINGS, and 
then there is growth in the Gulf of Mexico across exactly the dimensions. 
There is additional infill wells in the existing assets th
at will increase 
production. There is a strong portfolio of prospects to drill and with success 
tie back.
 

growth across those three areas. And therefore how large could the Gulf of
 
Mexico become, I think that is 
--
 

around the GoM, but embedded in those numbers where we say, we have 

piece of that, just as EG and jus
t as Ghana. And actually, we have the ability 
win because we have a strong set of opportunities. And I think the 

done in a really disciplined way. So, this is about taking the best of 
what we 


-
10 
WTI, full
-
cycle breakeven of $35. And some of that capital went in hat much 
higher oil price than whe
re we are today. So, the ability to replicate that 
model is going to provide some really strong returns in the business, and 
actually the high margin barrels, lifting costing to $10. So, absolutely 
consistent with the assets in the Ghana and EG have a lift
ing of cost around 
$50. They tried off Brent; obviously, DGE trades off WTI, $10 in cost, same 
cash margins.

think, we just felt it was the right time, which is the second sort of the part 
of the story. There has been a big industrial shift there. The mid caps have 
essentially gone now and sort of diverting their investment s
trategies to

are you really going to rely on the DGE people and expertise going forward

The next question is from the line of Rafal Gutaj with Bank of America of 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Rafal Gutaj
 
Two questions, please. First one, slide seven where you have the new

how much the new DGE assets contribute to that guidance on a standalone 
basis. And then, just in terms of the incremental CapEx step

the next two years but you mentioned these assets have been stocked as

mind ba

So, I just wondered if the new 
distribution policy was a way of hitting the 
brakes on exploration ideas or should we expect that status quo to continue 
in 2019 and 2020 on exploration at the same rate?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good questions, Rafal. I will go from the back and reverse forward. Look,
 
this is about stepping forward to getting into a more balanced growth 
platform. And I think I talked at length in the presentation about getting the 
balance right. I think that we are evolving to a company that has a strong 
set of well work infill drillin

different today, great sort of opportunities around infrastructure.

years getting int
o the right basins. We are very anxious to drill the first well 

followed by an incredible acreage position in Sao Tome. We captured the 
whole play. And we will high grade the opportuniti
es in that to drill the best 



 
in each basin. And it is going to be a continuation of rifle shot explorations, 
as I said in my remarks, 11 frontier opening wells, and that will continue.
 
So, I think, this is really about getting to the point where you have those 
balance of opportunitie
s, you can allocate capital well, and you can grow,

and pay a dividend, which I 
think is what the market wants to see is the discipline around that. But went 
off to the races on the frontier exploration, with th
e great portfolio, high

The next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Alliance Bernstein. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Bob Brackett
 
I have a question on the use of hedges. If your goal post of deal is to 
delever, is there a desire to 
use hedges to lock in cash flow to sort of avoid 
any risk from the commodity prices cycle?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Thanks, Bob. I will ask 
--
 
Tom is with me. Tom can pick that up.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yes, Bob. We will continue to 
--
 
right now in 2019, there is 
--
 
about 
20% of 
the production is currently hedged. We will take that up to more of our 
typical around two
-
thirds and use our typical three
-
way color type strategy 
to lock in some of that price as well as the cash flow. So, it is very consistent 

done our own production.
 
Andy Inglis
 

 
Bob Brackett
 
And then, if I think on the strategy, what I hear from you is you saw an 
opportunity with a long dated PE fund that wanted to exit. You
 
took 
advantage of that. And you look for similar opportunities as well. In terms of 
what inbound, are things outside the Atlantic Margin or even things outside 

North Sea for examp
le.

cretaceous, but actually th



very complementary set of assets, both in the financial
 
attributes of it, but 
also fundamentally in the nature and scale of the opportunity set.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And in terms of the near
-
term, I should probably think about deleveraging 
being a primary use of cash flow, as opposed to the next deal. As you go 
furthe
r out, how would you prioritize capital around doing deals, or 
sustaining that dividend or reducing debt on the balance sheet?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well, again, I would say the first thing is the dividend. As we think 
--
 
before 
we do any capital allocation, the fir
st thing is the dividend. The same thing is 
to bring the leverage sort of obviously down within a sensible operating level 
and we sort of 
--
 
below 2 is a good number. And then, I think, we will then 
allocate capital efficiently across the business, in term
s of the organic 

find things that we can truly add value to. We believe there are some assets

Okay. A

out over the next several years? How 
much we have to address near term

addit

Richard Tullis
 
Okay. Just circling back to the acquisition landscape, in the Gulf of Mexico, I 

look for Kos

to two years?
 
Andy Inglis
 

need to look for things where we can find the right combination of what I 
recall hit str

those assets. And we can actually put together a deal where there is a 





going to be absolutely at edge about growing cash flow but at the 
same time 
the first protocol is returning to shareholders. I think within that frame, 


investors they may 
have found financial strength and they are additive to 

news for me is a point that I see the competition being low at the moment 
actually because the mid
-
caps who were really kind
 
of a big player in this 
world is kind of retreating. And the smaller players if you like PE ph] backed 
sort of not investing a lot of them in it. So, we have that dynamic where I 
think, do we take advantage of that competitive landscape through 
convention
al access, lease sales et cetera or do we do it by acquisition, it 
could be either.

development of future exploration success or for consolidation, if you can do 
more deals on the attractive terms that you announced today with DGE?
 
And so, I am just trying t
o understand a little bit 
--
 

express capital discipline, but why you feel the strong desire or need to pay 
a dividend, given the nature of your Company and the strong 
--
 
the unique 
nature being very successful and strong explorati
on company.
 
Andy Inglis
 

from purely having one source of value growth for shareholders which was 

balance
 
between sources of growth, as I described from the upside in 
Ghana, EG and now Gulf of Mexico from high quality infill well work, the 
shorter cycle, the great development opportunities that we have in Tortue, 
and then frontier exploration. So, I think we 
have built a company now that 
has greater scale, that has the ability to sustain cash flow growth across 
those opportunities. And as part of that, I believe it is a great signal to the 
market to demonstrate that actually a cash return from that cash flow 
g
rowth is important. And it will set a dynamic within the Company where we 
will allocate capital with great discipline as a result. So, I think this is sort of 
a double whammy. It benefits shareholders, because they are getting a 
return; it benefits us to d
emonstrate that we can grow the Company, we can 
do it in a disciplined way, and we can do it sustainably for the long
-
term. 
And I think we have built the portfolio to do that.
 

done
 
the deal and not announced the dividend, every single one of you 
would have asked the question about when you are going to pay a dividend. 

talked about that evolution, we are at th
at point of time where this is 
something that I think is a very sound thing to do strategically.
 
Bob Morris
 
I appreciate that. And I have no doubt in your ability to be disciplined. In 
that regard, is there a yield level that you are targeting in the divid
end that 
you expect to pay?
 
Andy Inglis
 

tied up, obviously at $0.17 per share and able to grow in line with Company 
performance. So, we are not going to forecast any yield predict

The next question is from the line of Al Stanton with RBC.

capabilities. I mean, you brought Trident in to do the Equatorial Guinea 
acquisition and developme
nt. What additional development capacity does 
this deal now give you?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. I think Trident was 
--
 


know, in the frontier
 

exploration phase, bringing supermajor at a beginning and then leverage 
their skills as it were for doing multibillion projects, example being Tortue 
works really well. EG was actually about the ability to enh
ance production 
and Trident and Perenco [ph] team super job on some of the ESP world, the 

be sort of the leading the exploration side of it which is the exploration side 
of it, whi
ch is the ILX side of it and then, the infill drilling side of it.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico what we have in DGE is that combination of 


m around the Gulf of 



that 

we can take that capability and with the success exploration, ILX 
exploration, in Equatorial Guinea, we can leverage those skills in EG. So, 
there is a lot more synergy in the skill sets t
han you might imagine.
 
Al Stanton
 
And the second question is on exploration. I think this is a good deal. I think 
having more reserve structure, cash flow, debt capacity all that sort of thing 
is a good thing. But, I do feel fact here today that you are ta
lking down to 
wildcat exploration, the fact that you are now a company doing 70,000 
barrels a day and you are doing no more drilling than you were when you 
were at 25,000 barrels a company, I think some of the other people have 
asked that question slightly
 
more polite way. But, I do get this feeling that 
you are deemphasizing some of your wildcat exploration. Would you try and 
talk me out for that?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. I would, Al, because

you always ask great 
questions. Look, I t

grading the portfolio. And 
we I think from day one in Kosmos, we d
ifferentiated ourselves in that. And 
none of that is going to change. And we believe we will continue to create 
world class opportunities in frontier basins that will command capital. None 
of that has changed. And just in my mind for the shareholders, they


and the cash flow. If we were successful with one of those frontier wells, we

Our final question is coming from the line of John 
Herrlin with Societe 
Generale.
 
John Herrlin
 
Just a quick one for me. Was this a data room situation? How this deal 
evolved or maybe sort of I missed it?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. That was explained John here. But yes, there was a competitive 
process, data rooms, an

Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie, and good morning and afternoon, everyone.
 
On our call last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Deep Gulf Energy 
and focused primarily on that transaction and what it meant for Kosmos. On 
the 10th of October
, we provide an operational and financial update to the 


quarter building a full cycle E&P and start to 
look forward to 2019.
 
Beginning with slide three, which shows the impact of the Equatorial Guinea 
and Gulf of Mexico acquisitions. They have transformed Kosmos into a full
-
cycle E&P, offering investors a platform with material production and cash 
flow, a b
alanced portfolio that delivers sustainable, high
-
return growth and a 
commitment to pay a dividend, commencing the first quarter of 2019. 
Kosmos is evolving at a rapid pace, maintaining the strength of our balance 
sheet through the cycle meant that we can 
be nimble when pursuing 
attractive opportunities and our disciplined focus on allocating capital meant 
we only went after the right opportunities. We have built a portfolio of high 
margin assets that generate significant cash flow, which we will redeploy 
i
nto high
-
return projects across our opportunity
-
rich portfolio, reduce debt 
and return capital to shareholders.
 
The production and EBITDAX charts on this slide illustrate the pace of this 
transformation. Pro forma production, EBITDAX for 2018 approximately
 
doubled 2017. Looking forward, we expect this growth to continue with an 
8% to 10% compound annual growth rate in production, and a 10% to 15% 
in EBITDAX from 2018 through 2021. This growth is being delivered while 

strategy, a focus on the Atlantic 
margin, a differentiated deepwater skill set, targeting high margin resources, 
a low cost efficient model and a strong balance sheet.
 
Turn to slide four. We now have a portfolio rich in opportunity across short, 
medium and
 
longer cycle projects, and we believe the quality and depth of 
these opportunities is a competitive advantage to Kosmos. Having multiple 
growth options requires a sharp focus on quality and strong discipline around 
capital allocation. This slide shows the
 
various avenues of growth across our 

later in the presentation.
 
Starting at the top of the slide, and following the arrows, we have a 
significant production base with the opport
unity to grow production and 
utilize spare facility capacity in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and now the Gulf of 
Mexico through high rate of return, well work projects and infill drilling.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea, existing infrastructure an
d 
strong exploration portfolios offer high rate of return infrastructure
-
led 
exploration potential and provide the opportunity to further drive short
-
cycle 
production growth.
 
In Mauritania and Senegal, our world
-
scale gas discoveries provide the 
opportunit
y to deliver low
-
cost developments, starting with the first hub at 
Tortue, with the potential to add others that will underpin sustainable cash 
generation for decades to come.
 

inclu

into Namibia, more on that later, provides future growth potential from 
longer cycle, world
-
class hub scale discoveries. And lastly, through 
maintaining a solid balance sheet, we are w
ell
-
positioned for further 
acquisitions, in particular deepwater consolidation in the Gulf of Mexico.
 

detail, looking at each of these activity sets. Slide five looks at production 
o
ptimization and exploitation, in particular well work and infill drilling. 
Production in Ghana continues to grow following a turret remediation work at 
Jubilee, with a two

during the third quarter. At Jubilee, production 
averaged approximately 94,300 barrels of oil per day gross for the quarter, 
delivering two cargoes net to Kosmos as expected.
 
One new producer well at Jubilee was brought online in the third quarter, 
with t
he second expected in the fourth quarter. Production from these wells 
together with enhancements to gas handling capacity is expected to increase 
Jubilee production towards the FPSO nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels 
of oil per day.
 
At TEN production av
eraged approximately 62,600 barrels of oil per day 
gross for the quarter, delivering one cargo net to Kosmos as expected. One 
new producer well at Ntomme came on line in August. Kosmos expects this 
well to support current production levels of approximately
 
65,000 to 70,000 
barrels of oil per day through the end of the year when a second new 
production well is expected to increase production towards the FPSO 
nameplate capacity. The TEN FPSO has previously been tested at rates 
above the 80,000 barrels of oil 
per day nameplate capacity, and we expect 
to further test it in 2019 as additional wells come on stream.
 
For the full
-
year 2018, we expect gross production of around 82,000 barrels 
of oil per day for Jubilee and around 65,500 barrels of oil per day for TEN
.
 
The partners approved a second rig in Ghana, which arrived in late 
September, the rig is operational and set up for a continuous completion 
program, which should enable the partnership to accelerate the addition of 
new wells in Ghana. The increased well 
capacity is expected to drive 
production towards FPSO capacity sooner, with the goal of maintaining gross 
production from Jubilee and TEN of 180,000 to 200,000 barrels of oil per day 
over the next three years.
 

s press release is the $58 
million impairment of the Wawa and Akasa fields. As we look to allocate 
capital to the best projects across our business, we have decided not to 

other hi
gher return opportunities we have in our portfolio. The $58 million 
impairment is a non

cash charge which should flow through the income 

reserves.
 

report that we achieved payback on our 
acquisition in less than 11 months. To
-
date, Kosmos has received 
approximately $214 million in dividends from the Kosmos

Trident joint 
venture, surpassing the $231 million purchase price when the transaction 
closed in
 
late November last year.
 
The Kosmos exploration team discovered the Ceiba and Okume fields in the 


team, we have 
an optimal partnership leveraging our respective strengths to 
maximize asset value.
 
Gross production in Equatorial Guinea averaged approximately 42, 600 
barrels of oil per day in third quarter with strong performance in the first half 
of the year. The 

guidance of 43,000 barrels of oil per day, averaging approximately 44,000 
barrels of oil per day.
 
At the end of October, the drilling rig and associated equipment arrived in 
the field to begin installat
ion of electrical submersible pump or ESP to 
increase artificial lift capacity.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico, recently acquired assets are performing well. At Odd 
Job, an infill well was brought on line in late September and connected to 
the Delta House Floating 
Production System, increasing well deliverability 
from the field. And additional Odd Job well was drilled in May, exceeding 
pre
-
drill resource estimates, and is expected to start production through the 
existing subsea infrastructure to Delta House by early
 
2020.
 
Gulf of Mexico production for both the third quarter and the period from the 
transaction close until the end of the quarter, averaged approximately 
24,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In October, most of our production 
in the Gulf of Mexico wa
s shut in by Hurricane Michael. Taking his down time 
into account, we expect production for the fourth quarter to average around 
24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
 
Turning to slide six, which covers our short cycle production growth 
opportunities th
rough infrastructure
-
led exploration. As part of the Gulf of 
Mexico transaction, Kosmos acquired a portfolio of short
-
cycle growth assets 
including a high
-
quality inventory of exploration prospects. The first of lease 
the Nearly Headless Nick prospect was 
drilled within weeks of the 
transaction closing. The well was successful, encountering 26 meters of net 
pay in the middle Miocene objective. Nearly Headless Nick is another subsea 
tieback oil discovery, which is expected to be brought online through the 
De
lta House facility in 2020, adding near
-
term reserves and production 
growth.
 
Early delivery of this short
-
term growth opportunity which was not included 
in the purchase price, highlights the value of this acquisition. Competition for 
basin access remains n
ear historical lows, and in August, we expanded our 
inventory as one of the most active participants in the Gulf of Mexico Lease 
Sale 251 with apparent high bids on seven deepwater blocks. As part of our 
strategy to expand our position in the Gulf of Mexic
o, in the third quarter, 
we incurred approximately $50 million of exploration expense to acquire 
seismic over new prospective areas and to re
-
license seismic over existing 
fields.
 
In Equatorial Guinea, during the third quarter Kosmos continued to acquire 
s
eismic over blocks, S, W, and EG

2019.
 
Turning to slide seven which lo
oks at our development portfolio with a 
particular focus on the Tortue project. The partnership has made significant 
progress towards FID for Phase 1. Led by BP, the FEED work for Phase 1 is 
substantially complete. The Unit Development Plan has been submit
ted to 

Mauritania and Senegal on the non
-
PSA fiscal terms for this cross border 
project. The project remains on track for Phase 1 FID around year
-
end 2018. 
With the non
-
PSA fiscal terms 
agreed, the partnership intends to submit the 
Declaration of Commerciality. The next step is for the governments to grant 
the Exclusive Exploitation Authorization which, would enable FID. In parallel, 
the partnership is progressing the LNG offtake agreemen
t.
 
Turning to slide eight which looks at our longer cycle exploration. Longer 
cycle frontier exploration remains a core part of our overall business, 
offering the potential for major hub scale discoveries which create future 

 
demonstrated in Ghana, Senegal and 
Mauritania.
 
In October 2018, Kosmos entered into a strategic exploration alliance with 
Shell to jointly explore in Southern West Africa. Initially, the alliance will 
focus on Namibia, where Kosmos has completed the farm
-

acreage in PEL 39, and Sao Tome & Principe where we have entered into 

blocks 5, 6, 11, and 12. As part of the alliance, the two companies will also 
jointly evaluate op
portunities in adjacent geographies. This alliance is 

complementary skillsets. Shell has deep expertise in carbonate plays, while 
Kosmos brings significant knowledge of the Cretace
ous in West Africa. 
Furthermore by working with Shell, Kosmos has a partner with the expertise 
to move exploration successes through the development stage efficiently.
 

and processi
ng seismic to build a sustainable prospect inventory for drilling 
in 2020 and beyond.
 

looking at the activity set Kosmos has planned, the capital budget for the 
year. I want to discu
ss the 2019 capital plan using the same four investment 
themes I used earlier. These activities and corresponding capital are the 
results of our focused and disciplined capital allocation process. The 
objective of this process is to prioritize capital to o
ur highest return 
opportunities, which deliver short and medium
-
term production and cash 
flow growth. Following this plan, we will ensure we have the financial ability 
to execute this activity set and return capital to shareholders.
 
Starting with productio
n optimization exploitation. We intend to drill the 
highest return wells to build the necessary well stock to push the capacity of 
the infrastructure. In 2019, this includes drilling in Ghana, Equatorial Guinea 
and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the next p
hase of ESP installations in 
Equatorial Guinea. Our activity set include 7 to 10 infill wells in Ghana, one 
infill well and ESP work in Equatorial Guinea, and four infill wells in Gulf of 
Mexico. In the Gulf, this includes wells at Tornado, Odd Job, Kodiak
 
and 
South Santa Cruz. Short
-
cycle production growth activities focused in the 
Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea. In the GoM, we plan to drill up to four 
infrastructure led exploration wells and in Equatorial Guinea we plan to drill 
one or two explorati
on wells and prospects that can be tied back to Ceiba 
and Okume infrastructure.
 
The Tortue activity in 2019 is primarily focused on Phase 1 development 
work, which will be carried out by BP. Additional capital will be allocated to 
the appraisal of these To
rtue and Yakaar where one well will be drilled at 
each field. The level of capital shown is net of the BP carrying.
 
Within longest cycle frontier year exploration, the 2019 budget includes 
exploration drilling in Mauritania in the Bir Allah area, where the
 
one
-
well 
program is designed to add resources to support a third potential LNG hub. 
The new ventures and seismic acquisition of processing program will 
continue through 2019, to enable a sustainable drilling program in 2020 and 
beyond.
 
In total, the 2019 
CapEx budget is expected to be between $500 million and 
$600 million and is biased towards short
-
cycle development and exploration 
project where we see the potential for near term production and cash flow 

ovided production and 
EBITDAX guidance for the year ahead.
 
As communicated at the time of the DGE transaction, our capital program is 
expected to deliver an 8% to 10% production and EBITDAX compound 
annual growth rate from 2018 through 2021 using the July 
26 Brent strip. 
Adjusting Brent strip pricing to $70 per barrel flat rises the EBITDAX growth 
range to 10% to 15%. For 2019, we expect net production to be in the 
range to 70,000 to 76,000 barrels of oil per day equivalent and EBITDAX in 
the range of $1.2 
billion to $1.3 billion at $70 Brent.
 
Turning to slide 11. Kosmos has always managed its balance sheet 
conservatively with disciplined capital allocation being critical enabler of 
strategy execution. With the addition of the Gulf of Mexico assets, our 
appr
oach to capital allocation is not changed. At the end of the second 
quarter, our net debt to EBITDAX was around 1.6 times. This increase 
around 2.2 times at the end of the third quarter, taking account of the Gulf 
of Mexico transaction. With increased prod
uction and disciplined capital 
allocation, we expect to generate substantial free cash flow, allowing us to 
rapidly delever. We forecast net debt to EBITDAX around 1.7 times at the 
end of this year, falling to around 1.2 times at the end of 2019, well belo
w 
the average level before the DGE acquisition.
 
So, in summary, turning to slide 12, the third quarter has been one a 
transition for Kosmos. Closing the Gulf of Mexico acquisition, integrating the 
assets and people and to the Kosmos organization, and ensur
ing we are 
positioned to take advantage of a high
-
quality portfolio across our growing 
business through a disciplined 2019 capital program. At Kosmos, we are 
focused on building the premier Atlantic margin deepwater E&P, a business 
that has increased in sc
ale and provides visible growth in production and 
sustainable cash flow, generates significant cash flow which we will redeploy 
into high return exploitation and short cycle exploration led exploration 
projects in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, this i
s combined with a 
portfolio of world scale developments and frontier exploration platform which 
has been enhanced by announcement today of the Shell alliance. And finally, 
we have the financial strength to execute our business plans through the 
cycle, ensu
ring our ability to fund growth, delever and return capital to 
shareholders, starting with the dividend in the first quarter of 2019.

Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman 
Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
 
Neil Mehta
 
The first question I have is, so thanks for providing this 2019, $1.2 billion to 
$1.3 billion of EBITDA, how do
es that translate to cash flow from operations? 

--
 
or back of the envelope, minus 500 to $550 million in CapEx implies 
something like a 14% free cash flow yield on the curre
nt stock. So, I want to 

cash flow from operations here.
 
Andy Inglis
 

good guidance from the deleveragin
g chart as well. So, if you kind of look at 
that and we sort of 
--
 
year
-
end 2018 at 1.7 sort of EBITDAX of around 1 
billion, if you took to the middle of the range of EBITDAX of 1.25, leverage 
around 1.2, you can see net debt is going to reduce by $200 mil
lion to $300 
million. So, I think your translation of the EBITDAX to cash flow, take CapEx, 

strong high
-

got significan
t free cash flow in 2019, which is one of the reasons why we 

 
Neil Mehta
 
And then, as we think about the return of capital to shareholders, you have 
implemented a dividend, how do you think about 
--
 
and given the 
liquidity of 

--
 

use of capital, but how do you think about dividend growth from the base of 
assets that you have now?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I think when we announced the intention to pay a div
idend with the last 
quarter, we talked about the growth in the dividend in line with the growth 


on. We wa
nt to demonstrate the production growth next year, demonstrate 
the growth in EBITDAX, and we will revisit the dividend in the light.. But, I 

announced DGE that we were setting up the c
ompany that could grow at 8% 
to 10% production, a 10% to 15% EBITDAX growth in $70 world. And 
clearly that creates the opportunity then to revisit the dividend.
 
Neil Mehta
 

terms 
of development in FID?
 
Andy Inglis
 
It was 
--
 



ly 
quite public is to finalize the fiscal agreement for the non
-


and Senegal. That is a key step for us now. So, it allows us to move forward 
and declare commerciality o
f the project. With that notice to the 
government, then the next step in administrative sense is for them to grant 

then free to move forward with FID which is ultimately actually ap
proving 



along in a very positive way



moving that along and getting DGE done up and runnin
g. But, I am very 
positive about both.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
Charles Meade
 
I wondered if you 
--
 
going back to that October 10th announcement, I 

ore you guys would like to say about that 
partner wells and result and what you saw there, and how it might affect 
your appetite, your enthusiasm? And two of the details that I picked up on 
that I felt were interesting, one, that you guys said that you did

commercial hydrocarbons, suggesting there was perhaps residuals there, 

to offer on a follow
-
up to that?
 
Andy Inglis
 

lked about that being 
sort of four tests in our acreage in Suriname. Pontoenoe was the second of 

Pontoenoe we tested one fairway; we have a second fairway to test on the 
western side which
 
is Aurora, which is both Cretaceous objective and a 
carbonate objective. So, the most important thing at the moment is that we 
take the learning and particularly the geophysics, the calibration of the 
geophysics across to test the Aurora fairway. And that



best prospect of the opportunities that exist in the Aurora fairway. And 
clearly,
 
there is potential, I think, to link both the test of the Cretaceous with 
the test of the carbonate. So, here is a lot of stuff to go through.
 
So, in summary, we still regard this as extremely prospective, as you say. 
We found evidence of a working hydroc
arbon source, which is key. The issue 
is really about individual prospect risk now and we need to make sure that 

we remain positive about it, but we also remain disciplined about i
t, to 
ensure that we are genuinely drilling the next best prospect.
 
Charles Meade
 

CapEx picture in the Gulf of Mexico for 2019, I recognize these assets are 
still relatively new to y


Gulf of Mexico piece for you is even bigger. So, I wondered if you cloud talk 
about how that 200 million o mix looks. And if 

now, when you might have a better feel for it?
 
Andy Inglis
 

--
 

grow our production in the Gulf of Mexico with very high return projects. So, 
we have the 
opportunity to grow the production from the existing fields 

taking account of the infrastructure that we have in place and ensure that 
we fully filled that infrastructure, both th
e subsea and then as ullage 

capitalize on that. So, these are really high rate of return projects because 
clearly the infrastructure is in place.
 
Then, as capital allocation to the short
-


majority of that 
--
 
four out of the five to six well are in the Gulf of Mexico. 
And I think as we look at that, we sort of see two things. T
he first is that 

Mexico, it was there because DGE had not been fully funded by First 
Reserve. And so, there was a very good opportunity set there that we could 
pick up straight away. 
And clearly, the success, immediate success of Nearly 
Headless Nick is an example of that.
 

W, S and EG

seismic over it. Even the stuff coming off the boat is a significant upgrade to 
the existing seismic set. So, we are quite excited about the ability to pursue 
those opportunities in 2019. And we are targ
eting 1 to 2 wells there. So, of 

-
quality return projects. And as a reminder, we had 
it in the DGE acquisition deck, but DGE if you look at the prospects, if you 
look at the track record of DGE, the infrastructure

led strategy tha
t they

10 at a WTI price of $35. So, that 
gives you some confidence of the quality of the returns we are getting from 
these assets. And then, of course, they are shot cycle. You would 
--
 
these 
things have been ti
ed back and about 18 months. Nearly Headless Nick is an 
example of that that will start up in early 2020. So, we will come back 


ve worked pretty hard over 
the last couple of months since everything closed to fully allocate capital to 
what we believe now is a really good portfolio. And the great thing about the 
Gulf of Mexico today is the competition is really low. So, we think this
 
is just 
the start of what it is we can do.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Rafal Gutaj with Bank of America of Merrill Lynch. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Rafal Gutaj
 
I just have two questions, please. Firstly, coming back to the CapEx 
guidance o
f 500 to $600 million, just so I understand it better, in terms of 
the extreme ends of that guidance, is that driven by scope oil price or are 
you potentially still expecting movements on inflation, cost inflation or 
deflation? And then, secondly, just thi
nking about exploration, and as you 
see yourselves, I guess, in 2017, you formed the alliance with BP and there 
was a lot of kind of momentum behind exploring Atlantic margin. And now 
we are looking at just 10% of your CapEx in a one frontier well being dr
illed 
in 2019. So, I guess the question is that 2019, a bit of an unusual year in 
the sense that you are restocking the hopper, and we should expect 
intensity to resume in 2020, or is this just 
--
 
this is a conscious shift away 
from being a frontier explor
er to a full cycle E&P?
 
Andy Inglis
 



e ability to deliver 
high rate return projects from existing fields, leveraging the infrastructure to 
do that, a great short cycle program, world

class projects in Tortue moving 

about
 
the strategy around how we execute. We formed the alliance with BP 


a world

o be followed by we believe the world

class project in Bir Allah 
because BP has those engineering and development skills to be able to do 




and then you got th

objective is to drill a couple of frontier wells each year. The great thing about 
it is that now as you sort of high grade cap


-
quality opportunities now with a 
portfolio that could probably support more wells, but it is about quality 
through choice. So, I think the announcement today of the Shell alli
ance is 
just reaffirmation as the important part of frontier exploration to Kosmos. 

 





very excited about the opportunities we hav
e now in Equatorial Guinea, our 

as we discussed earlier on the call, the opportunity to come back to 
Suriname in 2020. So, two high
-
quality tests for the year.
 
In terms of the CapEx

our rig rates are locked in as it were in 

across the industry to get very competitive rate

--
 

efficiency of execution. There could be few wells, if we were really successful 
with the input drilling in Ghana, there could be 
--
 
as you say, we h

precisely allocated the capital to Equatorial Guinea to be one or two wells, 
depending on the pace of which we want to move forward there. So, I think 
you should see that as credible bookends around the activity set

where 

ribed and the efficiency with which we execute.

Our next question is from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
As we look at the initial guidance for 2019. How much of the 
production 
benefit related to the 2019 spending kind of slips into 2020? I guess, what 

trying to get a picture of maybe some of this spending impacts 2020 more 
so than 2019?
 
Andy 
Inglis
 

Ghana, some of which will impact 2019, depending on the timing of 
completions, et cetera. You will see a runover rate into 2020. And the idea is 
to build the well stock in a 
program where you may build the well stock that 
sort of right 
--
 



 
there in Ghana, which 
will support 20 and potentially 2021. So, point one. And clearly, the capital 
and the expiration short
-
cycle in the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea, 
you will see the benefits of it in backend of 2020 and 2021and beyond. 
Typicall

-
month tieback. So, with a programmatic 

following years. So, this is all about high
-
quality return projects that support 

 
illustrated in the slides.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks, Andy. And not trying to lock in anything definitive of course, but 
how do you think spending sets up in the out years, 2020, 2021, based on 
the spending guidance for 2019, is it going to be something in si
milar range 
or does Tortue FID start to build on top of that, maybe give us some 
bookends for...
 
Andy Inglis
 

rig program in Ghana, which I think will take a break after that. So,
 
that will 

the carry when BP works its going through. You are probably going to see a 
slight increase in spending in that bucket. And then, you are probably going 
to see a reason
ably consistent short cycle exploration program. I think we 

to be 
--
 
as with everything in the CapEx, given the nature of the profile that 
we are delivering, it is going to be
 

to be 
--
 

the basis of the big moving parts, which is 
--
 



clearly less money with the carry going into the Tortue total project. But 
there will be in the outer years as the carry wears out. And of course, 
despite all of that, we are generating free cash flow after we paid the 
dividend. So, cle
arly, the first call on cash will be the dividend. And then, we 
have a great opportunity set of projects that we can fully fund.
 
Richard Tullis
 
And then, just lastly regarding M&A. I know you just spoke a little bit about 
the competition in the Gulf of Mex
ico being near historical lows. What level 
of asset dispositions could we see brought to the market over the next one 
to two years over the next 1 to 2 years in the Gulf of Mexico?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Just repeat the last part of the question. Your line just broke
 
up, Richard. 

 
Richard Tullis
 
What level of asset sales come into market 
--
 
assets come into market in the 
Gulf of Mexico, what level could we see over the next 1 to 2 years that you 
may take a look at?
 
Andy Inglis
 


that there are sort of 
--
 
there are couple of dynamics that are working in our 

which is sort of coming to sort of fund and time limits, and so 

create a flow. And then, I think you are seeing some high grading of 
portfolios from the majors as well. All of that is going to create opportunity. 
So, I think if I would sort of do it in a rather simplistic way, I think there is 
more than
 

absolute sense, we have the opportunity to grow the business organically, 
you can pick up acreage in lease sales, you can get into prospects. We have 
an existing strong portfolio. It has 
to compete with all of that. So, I just see 
the Gulf of Mexico as the right positive environment to do business where 
you can buy high margin barrels, good fiscal structure, low costs that deliver 
high rates of return. And we need to make sure as we look a
t the M&A world 
that we are disciplined around that.

Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Apologies if this is maybe a little basic, but if and when you reach FID on the 
T
ortue LNG development, how much would that add to your CapEx in 2019?
 
Andy Inglis
 

 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Right. So, would 2019 be a very small percentage of that? In other words, 
would it really be showing up in 2020?
 
Andy Inglis
 
It would show up in the out years depending on the pace of the spend. All I 
am saying is these are sized around that you got to get the S
-
curves right in 
terms of the phasing between years. But in 2019, our assumptions for the 
2019 capital for
ecast are that we FID around year end.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
And then just a quick scheduling question. Four prospects in the Gulf next 
year, is that going to be linear throughout the year across the quarters?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Look from a modeling 

I think

results. But, I think if you were to

if you wanted to model it, I would 
assume that.

Our next question is from Al Stan

Al Stanton
 

Namibia. But first of all, on Mauritania, can we just look at whose is paying 

ration appraisal wells and 
the Tortue Phase 1 development. I am assuming that Tortue Phase 1, 

how much of the other three wells are being carried by BP. And also, as a 
follow

on, whe

really for the reservoir engineers and then more about deliverability?
 
Andy Inglis
 
So, just going through the development carried by BP, in terms of the 
appraisal wells on Tortue East and the Yakaar


support 
--
 

how do you get to the right levels of deliverability with the optimum
 
well 
pattern and therefore very efficient with the capital. So, the benefits are I 


adding the resource d


program to get the best wells into the front end of the development. On 

do the concept work on 
Yakaar now. And then this will add resource and also give us better 
information on the overall well program that would support Yakaar.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Third Quarter 2014 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance 
and Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy. Please go ahead.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which is available on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com Web site and we anticipate 
f
iling our third quarter 10
-
Q with the SEC later today, which will be available 
on our Web site at that time as well.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; Brian Maxted, Chief Exploration Officer; and Greg Dunle
vy, Chief 
Financial Officer.
 
Following our prepared comments, we will have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Consistent with prior calls, I request that participants to ask only 
one primary question and then one follow
-
up question. This will help ensure 
we ge

able to get to within our 1
-
hour timeframe, please contact me later today.
 

certain forward
-
looking state
ments based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes
 
such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained i
n our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 

 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal, and thanks to everyone for joining us. So going through my 
remarks today, ther
e are three topics I want to emphasize. First, our 
continued progress and growing the production, cash flow and value of our 
Ghana assets. Second, the maturation and quality of our exploration 
portfolio and its discipline drill out. And third, our sound fi
nancial strength 
and low cost production, which we believe uniquely positions Kosmos in 

 
Starting with Ghana, we delivered solid results in the third quarter, due to 
continued strong production at Jubilee and sound operational exe
cution. 
Production for the Jubilee field remained above expectations, averaging 
gross production of 102,000 barrels of oil per day sales through the quarter 
and 103,000 barrels of oil per day sales through the first nine months of 
2014. This provides growi
ng confidence we can meet or slightly exceed our 
production target for the year.
 
In addition, significant progress was made in the quarter related to the 

associated pipeline infrastr
ucture. The gas processing plant is mechanically 
complete as well as the associated LPG loading facilities. The onshore gas 
export line was connected to the gas processing plant in the Aboadze power 
plant. Additionally, the offshore gas export line was suc
cessfully pressure 
tested. The government of Ghana and the Jubilee partners are focused on a 
safe and reliable start
-
up of the plant and still expect that to commence 
before year end.
 
Additionally, we continue to work closely with our field partners in Gha
na to 
progress both TEN developments and the MTA appraisal program. The TEN 
project is around 40% complete and remains on budget and on track to 
deliver first or in the second half of 2016. Eight of the ten wells planned to 
be online with first oil have al
ready been drilled and the ninth is currently 
being drilled further de
-
risking initial production. I recently visited the TEN 
FPSO in Singapore and a conversion is progressing well. Activity levels at 
TEN are expected to increase next year, as planned, wit
h additional well 
operations and subsea installation scheduled to begin.
 
MTA also remains on track with appraisal set to conclude at year end. Field 
level appraisal activities are being completed providing us the foundation on 
which to develop an integrate
d development plan for the greater Jubilee 
area which we plan to submit next year. Jubilee, TEN and MTA are the 
foundation of our self funded strategy. These are world
-
class resources with 
high margin barrels generating substantial cash flow. By 2017, we e
xpect 
gross Ghana production to double to 200,000 barrels per day creating 
significant value for all stakeholders.
 
Turning now to exploration. With the Atwood Achiever now in transit in 
Northwest Africa, we have reached a point of departure as we are set t
o 
begin our multi
-
well, multiyear drilling campaign designed to test our Second 
Inning exploration portfolio. After several years of significant technical work, 
we have matured the exploration portfolio and refined the prospectivity, 

 
high level of excitement within the company.
 
Additionally, we continue to build the portfolio with high quality new 
ventures including recent entries into Portugal and Senegal. Earlier this 
quarter, we provided the market with some granularity regarding t
he next 
fall, high quality drilling opportunities that will test key frontier and emerging 
basins across the Atlantic Margin. Over the next 18 months, we plan to test 
a combined 4 billion barrels of gross resource, over 2 billion net to Kosmos. 
Most import
antly, each of these prospects has significant follow
-
on 
prospectivity, which could be unlocked as a result of initial success. Brian will 
add some more detail on the exploration front in just a moment.
 
Finally, let me remind you of our financial strength,
 
which has become all 

and our liquidity robust, as both the key components in our strategy to 
prepare for and benefit from exploration success. Our business model is built 
on the pr
incipal of being a self
-
funded explorer with the high quality cash 
flow from Ghana able to fund our ongoing Ghana developments as well as 
our upcoming exploration program.
 
Additionally, we have a strong oil hedging program to ensure our cash flows 
are well
 
protected. Our financial strategy has created strong corporate 
liquidity of around $1.9 billion and net debt at the end of the quarter was 
$149 million. We are in the strongest financial position in the company's 
history at exactly the right time.
 
Two wee
ks ago, as part of our planned succession, we announced the 
retirement of Greg and the hiring of Tom Chambers as CFO. As one of 

things that make this company a special place, and we will 
be forever 
grateful for his many contributions to the business. Most importantly, he will 
leave Kosmos in a great financial position, which will allow us to continue to 
grow the value of the company. Greg will remain with Kosmos in an advisor 
role until hi
s retirement. Tom, as most of you already know, is a seasoned 
industry leader with vast experience in the international space. We look 
forward to him joining our team.
 
In conclusion, we remain focused on what creates the most value for our 
shareholders, co
ntinuing to build the value of our Ghana assets, delivering 
exploration success through our industry
-
leading portfolio and maintaining 
our financial strength.
 

Brian?
 
Brian F. M
axted
 
Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. As Andy mentioned earlier, we 
are on the cusp of drilling out our Second Inning portfolio and over the last 
quarter, we have continued to make substantial progress towards that goal. 

e assembled a world
-
class set of exploration 
opportunities with the potential to create tremendous shareholder value.
 
At its core, Kosmos is a deepwater Atlantic Margin exploration company. 
While the industry reduces its exposure to exploration in response
 
to 
disappointing results and financial worries, Kosmos is on the verge of 
executing a transformational exploration program. We are convinced that 
the exploration done the right way with our focus on high value, high volume 
barrels can deliver substantial 
shareholder returns. While this is a much 


 
Kosmos has not participated in industries largely on successful deepwater 
exploration activity along the Atla
ntic Margin in recent years, instead we 
have spent the last three years since our IPO leveraging the contrarian 
thoughts of our proven exploration team to create competitive advantage. 
Through first
-
mover initiatives, we have executed an industry
-
leading 
f
rontier and emerging basin strategy to identify, access, evaluate to mature 
for drilling a high quality exploration inventory.
 
As Andy mentioned earlier, this quarter we briefly marked on our recent 
exploration efforts, in particular our continued ability 
to build a high quality 
portfolio with the recent addition of Senegal and Portugal, as well as a 
review of our four high graded prospects to be drilled in the upcoming 
Atwood Achiever program. We highlighted the investment proposition of our 
high volume, h
igh value barrel approach. We articulated how the way we 
explore differentiates the company and in particular manages the 
exploration risk inherent in frontier and emerging basins to deliver success.
 
We demonstrated that Ghana was the outcome of a 
well
-
executed First 
Inning strategy and we showcased how we have carried our Second Inning 
strategy with precision to position the company for transformational success. 
This proven approach is manifested in the consistent nature and similar 
characteristics
 

positions are large enabling us to manage basin and play risks, particularly 
source and reservoir as well as capture large upside potential.
 
Our blocks offer multiple diverse plays and fairways as 
well as dependent 
leads and prospects enhancing our chance of high impact basin earning 
success and then ensuring that we have large de
-
risked follow on potential 
to deliver a super major scale hydrocarbon resource base. Secondly, as with 
our high grade Fi
rst Inning opportunities, the top prospects in each of our 
Second Inning frontier and emerging basins have high quality seismic 
attribute support for hydrocarbons, in particular ABL that is conforming 
and/or calibrated.
 
This ensures the prospects have an i
rreducible pre
-
drill risk thereby 
maximizing the chance of success. Indeed therefore, we believe we will be 
able to replicate the First Inning success rate and deliver top quartile 
exploration performance. And thirdly, as a first or early mover, we are abl
e 
to secure strong fiscal terms for each of our opportunities. This ensures that 
when we do have success, the barrels are valuable. Indeed, similar to 
Jubilee, the breakevens for our Second Inning portfolio are between $40 and 
$60 per barrel, which is very
 
important especially in a prevailing lower 
commodity price environment.
 
A key difference though between our First and Second Inning portfolios is a 
significant breaks potential. Let me now summarize the four prospects, 
which we plan to drill over the next
 
18 months. These prospects drill out 
over 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent gross on risk or over 2 billion barrels 
net and potentially de

the Al Khayr 
prospect.
 
The Al Khayr prospect, previously named Gargaa, is a very large anticlinal 
structure containing several stacked Cretaceous aged reservoir objectives 
with seismic amplitudes in AVO support for hydrocarbons. The Pmean 
resource of Al Kh
ayr is estimated at 1 billion barrels plus oil equivalent and if 
successful, we expect it to de
-
risk an inventory of over 11 billion barrels.
 
Our Morocco contracts are some of the best in Africa, so a successful basin 
and discovery here has the potential t

Kosmos retains operatorship as well as a working interest of 55% reflecting 
our confidence in this world
-
class exploration opportunity as well as our 
ability to self
-
fund a larger equity share. We expect the results for the C
B
-
1 
well to be available in the first quarter of 2015.
 
Immediately following Al Khayr is the Tortue prospect which straddles the 
Mauritania
-
Senegal border. As I mentioned earlier, we recently acquired 
acreage in Senegal adding two blocks to our exploration
 
portfolio that cover 
nearly 18,000 square kilometers and are contiguous with our existing 27,000 

these licenses based on the proprietary 3D seismic we acquired in Mauritania 
last 
year, as well as the existing 2D seismic which confirms the prospective 
trends continue to the south into Senegal.
 
We are now in the process of acquiring a 700,000 square kilometer 3D 

d 
Cretaceous aged reservoirs trapped in four
-
way dip closures. The technical 
advantage here is that this basin has proven source rocks and reservoirs and 
our AVO is calibrated. Tortue has estimated resources of around 2 billion 
barrels of oil equivalent an
d if successful, we expect the prospect will de
-
risk 
an additional inventory of over 3 billion barrels in similar prospects.
 
Within the AVO window, these leads and prospects display strong 
geophysical attributes which can form into both reservoir and trap 

top section for this prospect in the fourth quarter of this year and then 
expect to resume drilling operations after we complete operations on the Al 
Khayr prospect. Results on T
ortue were expected in second quarter of 2015.
 
After drilling Tortue, we have farmed out a rig slot. When the rig returns to 
us, we plan on drilling the Orca prospect in Mauritania. Recent well results 
just to the northeast of our acreage confirm both oil 
and gas condensate in 
Cretaceous aged reservoirs and we are excited by the technical read through 
into our acreage, as they help calibrate our exploration model. The Pmean of 
Orca is estimated at 300 million barrels of oil equivalent.
 
However, if successfu
l, we expect this well will de
-
risk an inventory of 
around 3 billion barrels of additional resource. We anticipate results for this 
well in the fourth quarter of 2015. We currently have a 90% working interest 
in Mauritania and a 60% working interest in Sen
egal and are currently in the 
process of farming down the Mauritania asset with offers expected later this 
quarter.
 
Lastly, we are planning on drilling the Anapai prospect in Suriname after 
Orca towards the end of next year. Here, we are targeting large Cr
etaceous 
aged fault and dip close structures with AVO support based on 3D seismic. 
Sources and reservoirs in the basin are proven by offsetting wells which 
further de

risk the prospectivity. The Pmean of Anapai is estimated at 700 
million barrels oil equiv

name but we do 
plan to jointly farmout a portion of the license early next year with the 
objective of learning our working interest. Results for this well are expected 
in early 2016.
 
Outside of these four key prospects, we are very focused on maturing our 
Morocco, Ireland and Portugal licenses for 2016 and 2017 drilling. 
Simultaneously, we continue to identify and access strategic opportunities 
that fit our criteria for medium to longer

opportunities.
 

just the size of the portfolio, but also the 
quality of the prospects we have generated and look forward to drilling this 
out next year and beyond. This exploration program, as you know, is 
underpinned by our strong financial position that ensures upon suc
cess we 
have the ability to maximize shareholder value.

financial results for the third quarter and then prov
ide a brief update on our 
expectations and guidance for the remainder of the year.
 
Overall, financial performance for the third quarter was strong. We lifted our 
sixth Jubilee cargo in early August and our seventh cargo commenced lifting 
on September 30 an
d was completed on October 1. As a result, roughly half 
of the revenue from this lifting was recognized in the third quarter with the 
remainder allocated to the fourth quarter.
 
Third quarter oil revenue was $137 million generating net income of 19 
million 
or $0.05 per share. Included in these results is the previously 
announced non
-
cash derivatives mark
-
to
-
market gain of 40 million.
 
Cost
-
related performance was solid in the quarter with production expense, 
exploration expense, G&A and DD&A all showing impro
ved performance to 

$0.10 per barrel sold in line with previous guidance.
 
Exploration expense of 21 million for the quarter includes partial seismic cost 
for three large offshore 3D pr
ograms, one still underway at quarter end and 
the cost related to advancing various exploration
-
based initiatives.
 
G&A costs was 35 million and depletion and depreciation was approximately 
$26 per barrel. Both have improved versus 2013 and remain in line w
ith 
previous guidance. Tax expense of 38 million is mostly deferred and in line 
with previous cargos this year on a per barrel or per cargo basis.
 
We expect the non
-
cash mark
-
to
-
market charge related to commodity 
derivatives to vary quarter
-
to
-
quarter with
 

attributed to the decrease in Brent oil prices during the third quarter.
 
Total corporate liquidity is approximately $1.9 billion including quarter 
ending cash and cash equivalents of 601 million. Net debt at the end of the 
quarte
r was $149 million which is a $267 million reduction over the past 12 
months.
 

2014. Our forecast and investment program remains at approximately $575 
million with around $400 mil
lion of this targeted for activity in Ghana and 
the remaining allocated to exploration activities.
 
Almost half of the Ghana spend is directed at the TEN development with the 
rest targeted towards ongoing Jubilee phase 1a development and MTA 
appraisal effor
ts. Included in the exploration spend are the initial costs for 
the Al Khayr exploration wells scheduled to spud late this year.
 
We have now sold seven cargos of Jubilee oil in 2014 and are maintaining 
our annual sales forecast at a total of eight cargos n
et to Kosmos during the 
year. This is based on the field operators 2014 full year production forecast 
of 100,000 barrels of oil per day. If we continue to produce ahead of 
guidance, there is a possibility of realizing a ninth cargo very late in the 
fourth 

 
Our 2014 cargos today have averaged 965,000 barrels each. As for full year 
cost estimates, we anticipate the following. Yearly production expense in the 
range of $10 to $12 per barrel inclusive of 
workover expense. We have two 
workovers planned in the fourth quarter, one of which was deferred from the 
third quarter.
 
G&A costs for the full year are expected to remain slightly down from full 
year 2013 levels. As previously indicated, DD&A should avera
ge around $25 
per barrel sold. Bearing in mind the challenge of giving guidance on taxes, 
we project per cargo tax expense to average approximately 25 million per 
lifting.
 
Our hedging position at the end of the quarter totaled 97 million barrels with 
aroun
d 1.5 million barrels remaining in 2014 and the balance directed 
towards 2015 and 2016. As part of our ongoing risk management program, 
we expect to add to our positions over time.
 

 
great years at Kosmos, I plan to retire in 2015. I have enjoyed my time here 
and I have been fortunate to have worked alongside so many truly great 
people. I fully believe in the future success of this company.
 
I want to thank all of you who have supporte
d the company and wish Tom 
Chambers, our new CFO, all the best. I have every confidence in him and 

leadership.
 
Thank you. Now, operator, we would like to open the call for questions.

Yes. Good morning. And before I ask, congrats to Greg. I guess not just 

across from the recent FAN well, I mean it seems quite far away in Senegal 
but is it the same hy

in the second quarter next year?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

 
Brian F. Maxted
 


ly on the Senegal River petroleum system and the 
river is to the north of that into Mauritania. There is a partial read through 
from a source rock standpoint. One of the interesting things about the FAN 
well is that we understand that there was potentially
 
multiple oils in that well 
suggesting more than one source rock, which we have long speculated 
about, which can only help to de
-
risk charge in the basin on that part of the 

in a 
different part of the margin. Theirs was a largely stereographic play. We 
are dominantly playing structural features in Mauritania and Northern 
Senegal, for example.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Right. Thank you, helpful. And then you mentioned I guess in t
he context of 
Senegal maybe that the AVO is calibrated. I mean obviously a lot of science 

of a gold rush and some failure as a result of that gold rush element. But 
maybe give 


perhaps where people have drilled with less information.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, and I think the first and to note in all
 
of our acreage that we got 


 

dominated play in the Sahara and Mauritania, Senegal and in Suriname as 
well, which is a little bit different from Jubilee, for example. And in fact th
e 

concept than the industry is actually playing further to the south. And so the 
positive news for us and something that we always look for as we explore in 
deepwater petroleum syst

and we have the benefit of that in Mauritania, in particular, where I think 

which are marginal or sub
-
commercial to be simply leaks 
on a deeper 
petroleum system, which we are going to be exploring. So the read through 

supports the exploration model we have in particular that we see extensive 
reservoir depo
sition at border of those wells, which was at the end of the 
day one of the key limiting factors to success and commercial success was 
the size of the reservoirs there as well as the size of the traps. We think 

age.
 
Ed Westlake

Credit Suisse
 
Clear. Just on the farmouts, are you seeing any change in appetite as 
obviously the oil prices pulled back and people are trying to sort of refocus 
their exploration activities?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

 
question and I would say overall there has been 

made the marketplace for a very high quality opportunity to even more 
competitive. And so we are seeing good strong interes

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche 
Bank. Please go ahead with your 
question.
 
Ryan Todd

Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe one follow
-
up question on the 
onshore gas processing plant. Your comments were very positive in terms of 

-
date. Can you maybe run 
throug
h what remains to be done before the plant can be up and running?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

for introducing gas to the plant. So the first step in that is to look at the 
flexible from the F
PSO to the offshore pipeline, the vessels in place to do 
that, the necessary permits are in place from the regulator of the Energy 

hooked up, you can then reorder the offshore pipeline. 
That will then get gas 
to the frontend of the plant and then clearly with gas there, you can then 
start the process of testing and commissioning that plant. So those are the 

commissi
oning protocols, you can then start to move gas from the plant to 
the power station at Aboadze. And then there will be a sort of sequence of 
steps that gradually ramps out of to match the generating capacity at 
Aboadze and to bring the plant up to the full
 
capacity.
 
Ryan Todd

Deutsche Bank
 


 
so everything is mechanically complete 

outstanding from a construction point of view?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
No. Clearly, as you go through 

 
as with any commissioning process, as you 
go through that, the whole purpose of the commissioning is it demonstrates 

ensure that that is the case. 

to start that process which will allow us to complete the testing protocols 
and the commissioning procedures.
 
Ryan Todd 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 

 
ask 
one, a higher
-
level view. It was good to see the additions of Senegal and 
Portugal in there. At one point in the past, you had targeted adding one to 
two additional basins a year, I think a pace that you guys have generally at 
least kept over the past
 
couple of years. Should we continue to expect you 
to add new basins at this pace or should we see that slowdown at some 
point? Is there a portfolio limit at one point of what you can effectively 
manage as a company?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 


program is going to be to a larger extend driven by two things. One is our 

last couple of years that despite a highly competitive 

able to do that largely because we going into places where other people 
have not historically been working. So I very much believe that our new 

term. How many
 
new ventures we do will also be quite dependent on the 
outcome of the exploration program on the current portfolio. And obviously 
the more success we have, the less new ventures that we might need to do 
in the short
-

alance both the outcome 
of the current program and the new venture opportunity set to essentially 


get
 
to a steady state situation given the timeout in exploration we previously 


 
Ryan Todd 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great. And maybe one last 
one on the drilling schedule. You talked to the 
four upcoming kind of high
-
impact wells that you have. If we were to see 
success at one of those wells early on in the program, would that change the 
timing of the Q? And would we maybe put some appraisal in 
there or do you 

circle back as necessary?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

Kosmos moving to a sustainable high
-
quality e
xploration drilling program 
and we believe we have the portfolio today to do it. And as you rightly 
quote, we believe we have the ability to continue to add to that to ensure 


in one of the early wells, I think we would move to a two
-
drill rig program 
that would allow us to not only appraise the opportunity but then follow up 
with the exploration, foll
ow
-
on success which is a key part of the portfolio 



sort of more 
continuous in its strategic execution, which is that we will continue to add 


parallel 
appraising and drilling out that exploration program and we have the 

fund through success and obviously this company is extremely well run 
financially and we have the got the ability
 
to both continue with the base 
exploration program and fund a second appraisal, if you like, string 

 
exploration appraisal string in any basin that we do happen to open up.

Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia with TPH. Please go

Hi. Other question, going back to Ghana again. This time last year at the 
Analyst Day, you talked about the rese
rves upside from Jubilee and also 
getting to 135,000 barrels a day in terms of the deep well site and capacity 

gas plant, you had a pretty good year from a reservoir perspective. An
d then 

thinking looking at 2015, what do you see in terms of reserve upside and 
production potential for Jubilee now?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Hi, Anish. Look, in terms of reserve upside, I thi
nk the key step in 2015 is 
going to be the delivery of a full field development plan for Jubilee and after 

work that were done on MTA to pull together a plan that recognizes bo
th the 
Jubilee potential and also MTA and ensures that there is the capacity in the 


MTA and we so
rt of figure out the right approach to debottlenecking that will 
allow us to do that. So I think in terms of the next sort of big step in reserve 

actually got the Greater Jubilee full f
ield development plan in place. But as 


production history into the Greater Jubilee full field developme

integrating MTA and that will then allow us to optimize both the reserves and 


piece of w
ork. And again, as we look forward to 2015 production, I think 


 
I think we 
should assume that if the gas debottlenecking is removed and the gas plant 
is reliable, we know that the FPSO will 
clearly run at 120,000 barrels a day 
production. We know we can probably do a little more than that. And as you 
start to think about forecast for next year, I think the only new thing that we 
should recognize is that there is the potential of a three
-
week 
shutdown 
which 

 
a planned shutdown of the FPSO next year, which could be up to 
three weeks. So I think those are the factors that you should take into 
account as you start to think about 2015 and clearly 2015 will be a year of 
demonstrating the reliabilit
y of the plant, seeing exactly what the FPSO can 

rollout.
 
Anish Kapadia

TPH
 
Thanks. I just had a follow up on just some of the tax benefits that you will 
be getting 
looking into 2015 from the further investment, step investment 
on TEN. Can you just 

 
just a word on how that tax benefit works in relation 

impact over there?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Sur

 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 


anything like that. So, any expenses incurred in the operatio
n of our 
business including amortization of the capital costs, which are amortized 
over a five
-
year period go against our corporate tax. So I know you probably 
cover Tullow, so you probably have talked to them a good bit about this. But 
in any case, you ad
vertise all of your capital costs over a five
-
year period so 
the cost of TEN will be amortized starting with the year of commencement of 
production over the ensuing five years and that will be a deductible item in a 
corporate tax return. Hopefully that hel
ps.

ngs something to the table on the exploration front 
in terms of capability, but more importantly bring de

capability and 
obviously in a company balance sheet at the development and production

Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for (indiscernible). A couple of questions. 
Just first one and just to remind me more for 2015, in the light of 

 
or in the 
potential of dry wells for your next three wells drilling, just sort of a dry well 

just in terms of their complexity or pressure raising in terms of designs, do 
you know what p

 
Brian F. Maxted
 

Based on the pre
-

straightforward drilling both in the 
Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal and indeed 

us and to the south of us with that respect both below the seabed and above 


dealing with straightforward wells. So I would be very hopeful but 

straightforward drilling program. In terms of write
-
offs in the event of 
unsuccessful exploration, let me 
let Greg touch on that.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Yes, I think your question was 2015, we will have a more robust exploration 
activity set in 2015 so there will be more costs. We do benefit from 
obviously the farmouts and hopefully ensuing farmouts that will be 
anno
unced after the Mauritania process and the Suriname process are 
concluded. I would expect expenditure for exploration activity or 
expenditures of a capital nature for explorations to be up significantly from 

 
I think I would wait until we 
have the final approved work programs and budgets from all the business 
units before we announce our capital program, which we normally do early 
next year.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two main ones on 
Jubilee. Firstly, could yo
u just update us on where things stand on the 

and crude liftings? And then just secondly, what is the latest on flaring 
permissions up until the gas processing facility is in full swi
ng? So where are 

 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Yes, sure, Rafal. On the strike, I think we need to make sure we keep this in 
proportion. There was a strike on the FPSO. This has been an ongoing 
dispute


continue, so no impact on production or from a safety perspective. On the 

y. I think the flaring permit that we 
have sort of run through the end of October. The conversation with Ghana 

pipeline. And clearly as that moves ahead and everything works, then th
ere 

the gas from the field. So, we need to see how that goes through in 

conversation. But to me, the most posi
tive part of the conversation is that 


doubt that if there an issue, we would come back and have a conversation 
with fl
aring.

slide presentation to accompany today's call are available on the Investors 
page of our
 
website. Joining me on call today to go through the material are 
Andy Inglis, Chairman and CEO; and Neal Shah, CFO.
 
During today's presentation, we will make forward
-
looking statements that 
refer to our estimates, plans, and expectations. Actual results a
nd outcomes 
could differ materially due to factors we note in this presentation and in our 
U.K. and SEC filings. Please refer to our annual report, stock exchange 
announcements, and SEC filings for more details. These documents are 
available on our website
.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie and good morning and afternoon to everyone. I'll start 
today's presentation with the highlights for the quarter before passing it over 
to Neal to talk through the financials. I th
en want to spend the bulk of the 
call talking about the Tortue project and the significant progress we've made 
this year and our plan for this quality asset going forward. Neal will then 
cover the balance sheet. I'll conclude the presentation before openin
g up to 
Q&A.
 
Turning to Slide 2; the key messages for the quarter. Kosmos delivered a 
robust operational performance in the quarter with production of around 
57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was slightly below our prior 
guidance largely due t
o the elevated storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico. 
However, production in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea was steady with both 
assets performing in line with expectations. This should allow us to deliver 
annual production in the range of 61,000 to 62,000 bar
rels of oil equivalent 
per day, near our initial guidance at the start of the year.
 
In Mauritania and Senegal, we've been working closely with BP and the NOC 
to optimize the Tortue project. I'll talk more about the project later in the 
presentation. It's a
 
world
-
class development that's progressing well, in an 
environment where many projects are getting deferred. Phase one remains 
on track for first gas in the first half of 2023, coinciding with the time the 
LNG market is expected to time. The optimization 
of phase two targeting an 
expansion to 5 million tons per annum simplifies the project by leveraging 
existing infrastructure from phase one, significantly reduces costs and 
boosts the overall project return.
 
With the prospect of enhanced future returns now
 
is not the optimal time to 
reduce our interest in the project, we've established a financing path which 
funds our capital obligations to first gas. And finally, we continue to 
strengthen the balance sheet. In September, we monetized our Frontier 
explorati
on portfolio to Shell for around $100 million in upfront cash 
consideration. We expect to receive the proceeds shortly. We've also put in 
place a five year Gulf of Mexico facility, which provides the company with 
additional liquidity and replaces our Gulf 
of Mexico prepayment facility. With 
the actions we've taken this year, we expect the base business generate free 
cash flow at current oil prices going forward.
 
Turning to Slide 3; as I mentioned on the previous slide, Kosmos delivered 
solid operational per
formance in Q3. In Ghana, net production around 
28,000 barrels of oil per day was in line with guidance. Jubilee continues to 
perform well with high reliability delivering gross production of around 
88,000 barrels of oil per day within the quarter. Uptime 
on facility was over 
98% for Q3, and now over 95% for the year so far. At TEN, gross production 
of around 50,000 barrels of oil per day was in line with guidance. Facility 
uptime at TEN was 98% in Q3 and 99% for the year so far. For the full year, 
we still
 
expect 10 cargoes to be delivered from Ghana. At Equatorial Guinea, 
net production of around 11,000 barrels of oil per day was in line with 
guidance and is expected to stay flat until drillings begins next year. We still 
expect 4.5 cargoes to be delivered
 
from EG.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico, net production was around 18,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day in the quarter, around 10%, lower than guidance 
reflecting the elevated hurricane activity. 2020 has seen one of the most 
active storms seasons in history, 
and as a result, our field [ph] has 17 days 
of downtime during the quarter, which is significantly higher than the six 
days of total downtime we typically forecast for a storm season. That said, 
the base production from our Gulf of Mexico assets is encoura
ging. The 
Tornado four injections [ph] well came online in late September and initial 
results have been positive.
 
We also expect to begin the Kodiak completion this month, and bring the 
well online early in 2021. In our ILX portfolio, we expect to spud the
 
Winterfell exploration well, previously named Monarch, this quarter, where 
the results are expected early next year. Stepping back, it's been a tough 
year operationally due to COVID, the Gulf of Mexico shutdowns in May and 
the increased level of Hurricane
 
activity. That said, with all of these 
challenges, full year production is still expected to come in at 61,000 to 
62,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day near our initial guidance at the start 
of the year. This highlights the quality and diversity of the
 
asset base, which 
enables Kosmos to be resilient in a low price environment.
 
With that, I'll hand over to Neal, who'll take you through the financials for 
the quarter.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thanks, Andy.
 
Turning to Slide 4, the key financial items for the quarter. I'
m not going to 
touch on every line item, as most are consistent with our annual guidance. 
Focusing on the key areas, as Andy mentioned, production of 57,000 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day was slightly below guidance due to the increased 
storm activity i
n the quarter. Excluding the impact of this elevated hurricane 
activity, the company would have been cash flow positive in the quarter. 
Realizations improved significantly, around twice as high in Q3 as compared 
with Q2. This was due to a combination of hi
gher oil prices, but also the 
normalization of the wide differentials we saw in Q2.
 
At present, we are currently selling oil across all three hubs at prices in line 
with the benchmarks. Total OpEx is continuing to trend lower, although not 
as low as we wou
ld like. Q3 was higher on a per barrel basis than guided, 
impacted by the lower production and higher ongoing operating costs related 
to COVID, such as mandatory two
-
week quarantine periods for workers 
going offshore. Looking at the year, total OpEx is exp
ected to be around 
20% lower than 2019 which reflects the continuing progress we are making. 
Our base business CapEx came in at $53 million in Q3 in line with 
expectations. In addition, there was $47 million of accrued CapEx in 
Mauritania and Senegal. This
 
is non
-
cash and we expect the carry of our 
capital obligations to extend to around the end of the year, with the small 
payment expected in the fourth quarter as a result of the progress achieved 
on Tortue phase one.
 
I'll now hand it back to Andy to give a
n update on activities in Mauritania 
and Senegal.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal.
 
Turning to Slide 5; I'd like to start with the progress made on the Tortue 
project this year. Over the past six months, the partnership of BP, Kosmos 
and NOCs of Senegal and Maurit
ania has worked hard to transform the 
project, reducing the capital cost and boosting the overall project returns. In 
that time period, the outlook for LNG has continued to improve, and the 
project looked set to deliver first gas at a time when LNG pricing
 
is expected 
to strengthen, a direct result of the many project deferrals in the US and 
internationally. In his recent annual energy forum, Wood Mackenzie 
presented the two charts on the slide. From the trough in 2020, Would Mac 
expects a much tighter LNG 
market over the coming years, driven by 
growing global demand and the deferral or cancellation of higher
-
cost LNG 
projects. 2020 is seeing the lowest LNG supply growth since 2014, with only 
5 million tons per annum and new liquefaction added this year.
 
As 
2020 demand has been roughly flat with 2019, even with the impact of 
COVID, spot LNG prices have already almost tripled from the lows in the 
second quarter. In addition, there have been no new LNG project FID in 
2020, the first time in almost 20 years that
 
has happened. As a result, Wood 
Mac expects the supply demand gap to open up around 2023, just as a 
Tortue project plans to lead the first gas and creating a positive backdrop for 
marketing the volumes associated with phase two. With a significantly 
enhan
ced project and improving LNG backdrop and a financing path 
established, we're more excited than ever about the project.
 
Turning to Slide 6, which shows the continuous progress we've made on 
Phase one of the project over the quarter. As BP planned in it's 
3Q results 
call two weeks ago, the partnership is working very, very hard and very well 
on Tortue phase one, with activity and all four key work streams now 
increasing after periods of lockdown joined Q2 and Q3. At the end of the 
year, phase one of the pro
ject is expected to be around 50% complete, with 
first gas on track for the first half of 2023.
 
Turning to Slide 7 which shows the optimization of the phase two project. 
This slide which also uses Wood Mac's data, compares the breakeven cost of 
Tortue phas
e two delivered into Asia, alongside other LNG projects. Using 
our latest cost estimate, which incorporates a significant reduction in capital 
of the project, Tortue phase two sits to the far left of the chart, where they 
delivered cost into Asia just over
 
$4 per MMBTu competing very favorably 
with other expansion projects in Wood Mac's analysis. Shipping into Europe 
has an even lower delivered costs, further demonstrating the 
competitiveness of the project. The optimization of phase two is targeting an 
exp
ansion of the scale of the overall development to 5 million tons per 
annum, the sweet spot deleveraging all the major infrastructure from phase 
one. For example, phase two will utilize spare capacity in the subsea 
infrastructure in phase one.
 
The processin
g capacity of the FPSO will be expanded without requiring a 
second facility. There's no need for a second gas export line from the FPSO 
to the hub terminal. As a result, we believe phase two will be the most 
competitive Brownfield LNG expansion project glo
bally. With the limited 
upstream capital requirements expected to be less than $1 billion gross the 
first gas [ph], we expect to be able to finance our net share of the phase two 
development [indiscernible] phase one cash flows.
 
Turning now to Slide 8, as 
I mentioned, we've established a financing path 
for a self
-
funded project that allows Kosmos to retain its current share of the 
project which when built out can deliver an expected return on remaining 
investment of approximately seven times. Kosmos's net c
apital for the first 
gas from 2021 through 2023 is forecast to be around $725 million, which 
can be seen on the chart on the upper right of Slide 8.
 
We're engaged with BP to sell the FPSO to an off
-
balance sheet Special 
Purpose Vehicle that the back 
cost has paid so far, or around $160 million 
net Kosmos. BP and Kosmos are in negotiations with the anticipated 
purchaser of the FPSO and we plan to close in the first quarter next year. 
The SPV will take on the future capital obligations of the FPSO, whic
h means 
another $160 million of Kosmos's future capital obligations will be 
transferred to and funded by the SPV. Kosmos also intends to refinance our 
National Oil Company loan with commercial banks in 2021, which is 
expected to see around $100 million dol
lars returned to Kosmos. The 
combination of these two activities is expected to fund Kosmos's obligations 
in 2021. The outstanding CapEx balance of approximately $300 million due 
in 2022 and 2023 is expected to be funded by direct investment in 
Mauritania 
and Senegal. Kosmos is turning discussions to secure this 
financing by mid
-
2021.
 
Today, Kosmos's development CapEx on the project has been funded by the 
BP development carry, and we expect the forward investment post
-
FPSO 
financing to be around $400 millio
n net to Kosmos. With phases one and two 
of Tortue expenses generate $150 million to $200 million per year net to 
Kosmos at a $5.50 gas price, the optimized project is expected to deliver a 
return on investment of approximately seven times, which is why we
're 
excited about moving the optimized project forward.
 
With that, I'll now hand back to Neal to run through the balance sheet and 
liquidity.
 
Neal Shah
 
Turning now to Slide 9. At the end of Q3, we announced total liquidity of 
around $650 million. Since the
n, we've successfully completed our RBL 
redetermination, where we agreed to a total borrowing base of $1.32 billion, 
which reduced liquidity to just under $500 million; this reduction was largely 
due to the bank suggesting there forward price deck [ph]. Th
is quarter, we 
expect to receive around $100 million of proceeds from the Shell transaction 
with key approvals already granted. We therefore expect the business to 
generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter.
 
Including the impact of the Shell
 
transaction, today we revised our base 
business CapEx guidance to $140 million to $150 million in 2020. This also 
reflects the acceleration of the Kodiak completion and the start of the drilling 
of the Winterfell ILX prospect in Q4. We expect Q4 Mauritani
a and Senegal 
accrued CapEx be flat with the third quarter. We've also closed the Gulf of 
Mexico facility in the third quarter, which refinanced the previous 
prepayments facility. This facility has $100 million accordion feature 
providing potentially addit
ional liquidity if required, ensuring that we have a 
solid financial position as we close out the year.
 
With that, I'll hand it back to Andy to wrap up.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal. And the final Slide 10; it has been and continues to be a 
challenging year fo
r the sector but it's important to step back and look at 
how our company competes today.
 
Cosmos has a high
-
quality portfolio of world
-
class conventional oil and gas 
assets, with strong ESG credentials. Our focus on offshore exploration, 
development and pro
duction along the Atlantic margin has not changed. We 
have three production hubs in Ghana, in the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial 
Guinea, as well as the world
-
scale LNG development with the first phase 
expect to be over 50% complete by year end, which now ha
s a clear 
financing path. In addition, the optimization of the second phase leverages 
existing infrastructure and delivers enhanced return. These advantage assets 
have low decline rates, brands or HLS price benchmarks and an overall 
carbon intensity that i
s significantly lower than the industry average.
 
As our recent TCFD report show, we're making the business decisions and 
capital choices to deliver shareholder value consistent with a lower carbon 
world. Given the low
-
cost nature of the assets and low decl
ine rates, these 
assets produce significant free cash flow even at low oil prices. We have a 
corporate free cash flow breakeven of approximately $35 per barrel Brent, 
we expect to generate free cash flow going forward at current oil prices into 
2021.
 
On th
e gas side, the phase development of Tortue, with first gas planned in 
the first half of 2023, is expected to generate a self
-
funded long term free 
cash flow stream to complement the cash generative oil assets in the 
portfolio today. On exploration, we con
tinue to hydrate the exploration 
portfolio with a focus on return. Our acquisitions in Equatorial Guinea and 
the Gulf of Mexico targeted opportunities, they created value through 
optimizing the existing production base and through infrastructure
-
lead 
explo
ration. We now build a hopper of IOX [ph] opportunities to cross 
Kosmos that we continue to hydrate. Success in exploration comes from 
having quality through choice. This means prioritizing proven bases, where 
we have a deep technical understanding, a larg
e resource portfolio and can 
leverage infrastructure.
 
And finally, we have a solid balance sheet to execute our plan. As Neal just 
outlined, we have ample liquidity, no near
-
term debt maturities and the 
business that is expected to generate cash and to jui
ce leverage.
 
Thank you. And I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the 
session for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Charles Meade with 
Johnson Rice. Please proceed with y
our question.
 
Charles Meade
 
Good morning, Andy, or afternoon, as it may be, and to Neal as well. Andy, I 
wanted to ask a question, I recognize that you're likely still working on the 
details of this sale leaseback, but I just wanted to explore a little bit
 
more 
what you are comfortable talking about and what you're not. As I was 
looking from the outside, it seemed like one of the challenges you had to 
address is that, obviously, a project finance would make sense for you. But 
it's not as clear that would ma
ke sense for your partner, BP. I'm curious, 
should we be thinking about this as that BP is also going to contribute their 
interest into the SPV? Or perhaps alternatively, is BP going to sponsor this 
SPV and it's going to be leveraging off their balance she
et?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Neal, why don't you pick that up?
 
Neal Shah
 
Yes, I think that we're still working through the process. But I think there's 
optionality for BP to do it in several different ways, to where they could 
participate in both sides of the transacti
on, to where if they'd benefit from 
the transaction, as well. And so, I'd say there's a couple of different ways 
that we could end up in terms of BP's participation.
 
Charles Meade
 
All right, we'll stay tuned on that. And then, one of the questions just to 
interpret your slot on the upper right on page eight. If you're putting this, it 
makes sense that you that you're doing this financing for the FPSO because 
that's where you can put the ring fence around the totaling operation with 
production, but is the ri
ght way to interpret this is that remaining $300 
million, that's all the other pieces like the subsea, FLNG and breakwater?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Now, the way to think about it, Charles, is just think about we're working 
and engaged with VP on the FPSO sale and leas
eback and as Neal said, they 
can choose how they participate in it. But, clearly, we're sitting alongside 
them at the moment in the negotiations with the preferred buyer of the 
FPSO. When it comes to the final $300 million, we have the ways in which 
we wou
ld actually secure that, it will be through some direct investment. 
And we're told 
--
 
we're looking at various options today as to how we do 
that. And clearly, what we're looking to do is find the most competitive way 
to secure that financing.
 
Charles Mead
e
 
Thanks for that added detail.
 
Operator
 
And our next question is from David Round with BMO Capital Markets. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
David Round
 
I got a couple both on and talk to. And then the thing 
--
 
the first one on 
phasing [ph], and 
I'll just clarify; you talked about a CapEx number, which 
was potentially quite a bit lower than some of the numbers out in the 
market. I just really wanted to understand how lockdown and you 
considered it a final estimate, or was there a bit of movement s
till to be 
expected in that number? And then, just on the direct investment for the 
balance of phase one funding, it sounds like you're leaving the door open for 
potentially a smaller farm out to potentially cover the balance of the CapEx, 
do you get the s
ense that there might be more appetite for a smaller stake 
in the program?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, David. Let me just say 
--
the phase two one first on the capital. We 
talked through the capital estimates. If you look to the first, Tortue phase 
one and capital 
first gas, we've forecast that at slightly over $4 billion. So if 
you do take out the FPSO, it gets around $3 billion, which is consistent with 
the numbers we've talked through. What's interesting about phase two 
though, is that it leverages all the pre
-
in
vestment that's gone into phase 
one. And as I noted in my remarks, we're leveraging the available capacity 
in the subsea infrastructure, rather than put a new facility in for expanding 
the gas throughput, you can do it off the back of the FPSO. There's no 
need 
for another gas export line from the FPSO to the initial processing.
 
And actually, we picked the sweet spot of 5 million tons per annum because 
it optimizes the use of that in infrastructure. And I think that's been the big 
breakthrough, working along
side BP was to reimagine how you get the most 
out of the next phase by fully utilizing the infrastructure and therefore, the 
minimum amount of CapEx. So, that's why the CapEx is so low, the CapEx to 
add that additional 2.5 million tons for the upstream pie
ce of that is, as I 
said in my remarks, slightly less than a billion dollars, and that's our current 
view. So I think, they move on to the next question of the current 
environment, I would say that from a sales perspective, yes, the current 
environment is 
being tough, there aren't many companies that have got the 
balance sheet today to be able to participate. But by the way, the current 
environment has allowed us to really sharpen the pencil with BP to come up 
with the right next 
--
 
the next phase, and I'm 
genuinely excited about the 
way in which we've managed to create the right project now. And as we all 
say, it's the right project at the right time. And it's incredibly efficient, the 
next phase, because of the pre
-
investment. So when you look at where we 
are, we clearly were faced with the choice almost to sell a piece of the 
infrastructure for $320 million, or do you sell a piece of the project and 
clearly for our shareholders today, the right decision is not to sell the 
project, but sell the infrastructu
re, yes.
 
Now going forward, there could be an opportunity in a time in the future to 
crystallize the right value. And then, a sell down is something we would 
consider. And I think if you're rightly saying, without the SO [ph] financing 
in place, a smaller 
piece of the project will be attracted, but what we're 
focused on at the moment is ensuring the financing path is delivered on time 
and we're well engaged in that today. And I'm clear now with BP we've got 
the right size of project, 5 million tons per annu
m, expanding to that level is 
the right project. And it's incredibly efficient, because you're leveraging all of 
the pre
-
investment. So, we've got a good project now.
 
David Round
 
Okay, that's very good. Can I just ask a really quick follow up? Presumably, 
this really compresses the build timetable as well for phase two, does it?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, it doesn't actually because you've still got some stuff to do, there will be 
an extra Brownfield project to put the additional gas processing on. So it 
doesn't all t
imewise shrink, but it does make it a simpler project. So I'd say 
the execution risk has gone down. The timeline is probably typical of what 
you'd expect. So we know, we've got work to do with BP to get all that 
sequencing done, and so on. But it's a much 
simpler project to execute, so 
that why it has lower execution risk.
 
David Round
 
That's great. Thanks a lot.
 
Operator
 
And our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Thanks for all the incremental 
color this morning. The first question is on the 
US elections and what impact does that have on the way you think about 
your Gulf of Mexico business? And as we size up the value of that business, 
how are you thinking about the moving pieces, particularly a
round federal 
leases?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neil. Elections and political transitions are not something new for 
Kosmos or for our industry. We lived through that process in all the 
countries that we operate in and what I'd say is that there's a couple of 
tru
isms. I think one is, if the quality of your assets is good, you can continue 
to compete irrespective of the government in power. And I think the second 
truism is, it's important to have an aligned agenda with the country and not 
actually being focused on 
the individual party in power. So what does that 
mean for the Gulf of Mexico? I think the first thing I would say is that while 
it's about a third of our current production, it has actually the lowest cost 
and lowest carbon intensity in our portfolio. The 
carbon intensity is around 
eight kilogram per pound [ph] which is significantly lower than the global 
averages and actually significantly lower than alternative oil production in 
the US.
 
I think the same thing is that we've clearly made a strong commitment
 
to 
the energy transition. And we're targeting carbon neutrality and our scope 
one and scope two by 2030. That will involve mitigation measures. And 
we've got some really interesting projects on the Gulf Coast. These are blue 
carbon projects focused on wet
land restoration. And actually they're they 
have carbon sinks, which store around 10 times the carbon on the terrestrial 
tropical forest. So I think the point there is to say that we believe we can be 
a solution to a problem rather than be an impediment. A
nd these are low 
cost projects. So, I believe that both the portfolio and the approach now 
where we can continue to be very competitive, because we've got low, cost 
low carbon assets, and we have some innovative low cost mitigation 
measures that will allow
 
us to deliver on our commitments. So actually, sort 
of nothing changes from our commitment on that side. When you look at it 
from a leasing perspective, I think that there's been a lot of rhetoric before, 
and I'm sure there'll be a lot of that rhetoric af
ter the election.
 
So, you know 
--
 
yes. You know, is there a risk that there's no new leasing on 
federal lands or waters? I think that remains an issue, the bond thing for 
others, we've got the offer of more than five years of future drilling 
opportunities,
 
and they're gone. So there's no immediate concern. So, I 
believe we've got a business, which is competitive today and actually, in a 
sense, we'll be more competitive going forward, because of the nature of the 
assets, and the way in which we're conducting
 
our business.
 
Neil Mehta
 
And just to clarify, you guys still have five years of drilling opportunity 
without requiring incremental federal lease. Right?
 
Andy Inglis
 
So, it's correct. And that's actually drilling, you know four prospects here, 
which is sor
t of probably more than we would anticipate actually.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Okay, great. And that the follow up question is just on your Brent 
breakevens, you talked about $35 a barrel? That's before growth CapEx. So 
how do you think about let's call it over the 
next three years, the level at 
which you cover your free cash flow, sustaining plus growth CapEx and how 
that evolves over time and then this might be a question for Neal? Just can 
you remind us what the sensitivity is to every dollar change in oil price? 
So 
we can sort of claim out what the free cash flow profile looks like at our oil 
deck?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, good question. Look, I think it's incredibly important. The free cash flow 
above $35, first target of paying down debt. And Neal will give you the 
numb
ers on sensitivity in a moment, the first call on capital but first call on 
cash flow. In terms of the growth opportunities, it will be focused on limited 
iOS projects, we have the first one of those in the wind sell opportunity and 
that sort of near less 
than $10 million net to us. The most I could see it, and 
we would need to see quite a sort of positive oil price is sort of up to $50 
million in gross projects. We've got plenty of competing projects for that at 
the moment. And, you got to see really drivi
ng that capital allocation 
decision. So, phenomenal focus on the free cash flow generated paying 
down there, and then it's going to be very limited, highlights opportunities; 
and I think it's sort of zero to $50 million would be the number that we'll be 
lo
oking at there.
 
Neal Shah
 
So to add on that, it's Neal. So around sort of $50 million will probably be 
the upper limit, at least in the short term on the iOS portfolio. But as you 
can imagine, given our exposure to oil prices, we're pretty levered. And the
 
general rule of thumb that we use is about around $100 million of free cash 
flow impact for every sort of $5 move in oil prices. Now there's some sort of 
offset into hedging etcetera, but we can generate a significant free cash flow 
from the base business
 
in a $45
-
ish world.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Cool. Thanks, guys.

And our next question is from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Thank you. I had a clarification question on phase two. So if I understood 
corr
ectly, phase one was about $4 billion, of which maybe a $1 billion must 
be FPSO. And you're saying phase two at slightly less than $1 billion? Is that 
net to Cosmos? Or is that gross for the whole expansion?
 
Andy Inglis
 
That's gross. So, let me just sort o
f talk you through the numbers Bob. So 
just slightly over $4 billion of which the FPSO is slightly over a $1 billion, so 
the rest of it the breakwater, which is a significant cost, right, which clearly, 
you're not billing [ph] on phase two, yes, the breakw
ater, the pipeline from 
the FPSO, to the breakwater to the inshore processing, which we're not 
doing on phase two. So, phase two is ultimately, you know, the cafe expand 
is for the expansion of the gas processing, which is a Brownfield project on 
the FPSO.
 
There's limited build out of the subsea, because that's got 
capacity. And then you're drilling some incremental wells. So, if you think 
about it there is significant capital efficiency by utilizing all of that 
infrastructure that you put into phase one.
 
B
ob Brackett
 
And to be clear, that makes a lot of sense. And this expansion takes you 
from say, 2.5 million tons per annum phase one adds another 2.5 million 
tons to get to the five. So it wasn't the 4 million ton per annum expansion 
that might have thought
 
about?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, exactly Bob. So what you've done is, and in essence the work that 
we've done over the last six months is to say look, how did you get the best 
project for the expansion. And, the obvious way to do that is to find the 
sweet spot tha
t enables you to sort of utilize all of that infrastructure you 
laid in. And when you do all of the concept work to optimize it between what 
have you got in the subsea, what have you got in the FPSO in terms of a 
deck, you can add gas processing to? What's
 
the limit on the gas export 
pipeline? You take all of that and optimize it? This is what you get.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Thanks for that. How should we think about fid for phase two timing wise?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, we're working with BP on that at the moment, but I wo
uld anticipate 
FID to be 2023.
 
Bob Brackett
 
So around the time of first gas?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Around the time of first gas of phase one.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Thanks for that.

And our next question is from Nikolas Stefanou with Renaissance Capital. 
Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Nikolas Stefanou
 
Hi guys, it's Nick here. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got a couple 
on Tortue, if I may, and then follow
-
up on TEN. So you've been talking 
about that free cash flow number of $150 million to $200 milli
on ton per 
annum for Tortue is [indiscernible]. But I was under the impression that that 
was under the old sort of like 
--
 
design of the projects which I was certain 
--
 
I think like a $6 million to $7 million ton per annum. How can you make the 
same amount
 
of cash at $5 million ton per annum? That's my first question. 
Second one is 
--
 
could you maybe talk a bit about how that [indiscernible] 
for $650 million now looks a bit higher on $700 million? Could you maybe 
talk a bit around that and 
--
 
I mean, if you
 
see any potential, maybe some 
like cost overruns? Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, thanks I'll take the second question and then Neal will continue the 
questions around the cash flows. We were thinking around in sort of 630 or 
something like that for phase one
 
of the capital phase one. Clearly the year 
has cost us some additional capital. You know, there's no other way of 
describing that. So you clearly got an additional year of project execution. 
And whilst we've optimized the project to reduce the impact of t
hat, there is 
a cost from the delay. So I think we're clear about that and obviously, the 
numbers we've represented today are our best estimate, as we speak, but 
with the project 50% complete. The risk of execution has gone down now 
and I think we've got a
 
very credible timeline as well, to be able to deliver 
the project. I don't feel that the schedule is under pressure, and therefore 
you've got the pressure on that capital number. Neal?
 
Neal Shah
 
Then just on the free cash flow bit, the $150 million to $20
0 million free 
cash flow bit is for sort of our current working interest. In the past, and I 
think maybe this where you might be sort of mixing we talked about $150 
million from 10% of the project of the expanded 10 million tonnes scheme. 
The numbers are s
imilar, but you've reduced. We're talking about half the 
scope of the project at our current working interest versus a larger project at 
a lower working interest and the numbers happen to be around the same.
 
Nikolas Stefanou
 
Okay. Just a quick follow up. F
or 10 million, that production was sequentially 
a bit low, and not by much, but in just a bit over 50,000 barrels per day. I 
was wondering, is it within 29 coming on stream, what's the reason about 
the decline? It's nothing that was on stream in August, ri
ght?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, look, the decline is ultimately around 
--
 
it will obviously have no drilling 
on the other reservoirs and the error the big contributor to the overall 
production level. So you are seeing some 
--
 
we saw an uptick, and then 
you're going 
to get some natural decline associated within NRA [ph]. And 
then actually reliable that has been good. The fields continue to perform. So 
yes, clearly, and nine offset some of that, but there will be ongoing decline 
because of the fact we've had no activit
y this year. We'll see about it next 
year, but not this year.
 
Nikolas Stefanou
 
Thank you.

Our next question is from James Hosie with Braclays. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
James Hosie
 
Hello, there. Hi. Just a couple of questions from me on t
he structure funding 
plan. First off is $100 million you're trying to get from the NSE financing 
because I also transfer and the rest of that money for the rest remain with 
Kosmos? Then just on the $300 million gap, is one option for that 
refinancing your 
RBL to incorporate for two years or are you thinking of 
other ways for getting that cash?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Neal, why don't you take those two?
 
Neal Shah
 
Yes, sir. On the NSE, financing, we've talked a bit about 
--
 
we talked with 
the banks about a number of diff
erent structures, in terms of where does 
that risk, ultimately sit and so we haven't finalized that whether they need 
some backstop at the end of the day. We will finalize through sort of the 
negotiations with the banks, but what's clear is sort of near th
ere's an 
appetite from the banks to support government projects in developing 
Africa. So, there's a good appetite in terms of pursuing that. Then on the MS 
--
 
the $300 million, we've left it sort of open for a number of reasons, 
because there are a couple 
of different options that we have. We do have 
the ability to put it within the RBL today. I do think there are other options 
that may be more attractive as we go down that route and have had 
discussions with a number of other interested parties. That is an
 
option, but 
it's one of the few that we're looking at.
 
James Hosie
 
Okay, thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Richard Tullis with Capital 
One. Please proceed with your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thank you. Good morning, Andy
 
and Neil. Standing with the same theme on 
the remaining $300 million investments for 2021 to 2023 for Phase 1, what 
will price realize the price could allow Kosmos to simply fund that 
development from cash flows? And is that still an option on the table e
ven at 
a $45 oil price?
 
Neal Shah
 
Yes, Richard, I'd say at $45 I think we could internally fund it out of cash 
flow but that said, I think we've been pretty clear and as Andy, you just 
mentioned, our priority in terms of the free cash flow is to use it 
to repay the 
debt and we've said for a while we will 
--
 
it's our plan and expectation to 
deliver a self
-
funded project. The FPSO sale
-
leaseback is step one of that, 
and like I said there's a number of ongoing discussions to secure the last bit 
and so while
 
it's certainly possible to fund it out of free cash flow, even in a 
$45 world, it's not our intention at the moment.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Okay, understood. Looking back at the planned refinancing with the National 
Oil Company loans, provide a quick overview of 
the mechanics there. What 
do you expect? Is the total balance increased by roughly $100 million and 
what would be the expected new term?
 
Neal Shah
 
Basically, today we have a loan with both the governments of Mauritania, as 
well as BP to cover their share o
f the capital. The goal or the objective of 
financing would be transfer that interest and the liability to the banks and 
sort of get Cosmos out of the middle. It's attractive competitive rates, I 
would say, and so we do, but the goal wouldn't be to make a 
profit or any 
P&L on it would just be a pure sort of transfer the economic interest both on 
the interest side and ourself.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Very good, thank you.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Second Quarter 2016 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance 
and Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy. Thank you. You may begin.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release, which is available 
on the Investors page at kosmosenergy.com website. We also antic
ipate 
filing our 10
-
Q with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
cert
ain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in our 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discus
sion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, th
e information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal and good morning everyone.
 
It's been a tough year and a half for t
he industry and for a lot of companies 
in our space. Lower oil prices and squeezed liquidity, forcing some 
companies out of business and others to dilute their investors to deleverage.
 
Only in this business environment we have the assets, balance sheet, 
ma
nagement at Kosmos differentiated themselves. Our strategy is designed 
to work in a low commodity price environment where we remain committed 
to its disciplined execution.
 
We are now at inflection point in the company's history with production and 
cash flo
w set to increase the same time as our committed CapEx declines. 
This combined with our exploration success and the opportunities created for 
us, positions Kosmos to be one of the most successful companies as we 
emerge from this commodity cycle.
 
As I go to
 
my remarks today, there are two key points I want to discuss. 
First, our Ghana asset remains a strong foundation in delivering our near 
term production and cash flow growth. And second, the quality of our 
exploration portfolio has never been better and Ko
smos is well positioned to 
live a value from both our discovery resource, as well as renew high quality 
opportunities our team has identified. Tom will then finish up with a review 
of our strong financial position and quarterly results.
 
Turning first to Gh
ana. Last quarter we provided an update on the status of 
the turret bearing Jubilee. I am pleased to say that since then we made 
considerable progress on addressing the issue. In a short term, the revised 
operating procedures are working as anticipated.
 
As
 
a reminder these procedures consist of the use of tug boats to ensure to 
FPSO remain statically positioned, as shuttle tanker to overflow the FPSO 
and the storage tanker to hold the production until the buyer's vessels arrive 
for transport to market. The 
partnership is now completed more than 25 off
-
loading for several tankers since implementation. We support the operators' 
second half 2016 gross production guidance of approximately 85,000 barrels 
of oil per day.
 
Furthermore, we recently announced that our
 
long term solution for the 
turret issue is identified and the Jubilee partnership is quickly moving 
towards implementation. After exploring a range of options, the partnership 
agreed to spread more in the FPSO with a CALM buoy as the optimal solution 
that
 
ensures the FPSO to maintain a 20
-
year effective life and is doubtful of 
loading, functionality with the least disruptions of oil production and gas 
export during the remediation work.
 
[The other plant] [ph] described in other vessel consist of several st
eps 
primarily allocated across three phases. The first phase of work involve the 
installation of stern anchoring system which means mechanically locking and 
repairing so that the FPSO can no longer rotate, followed by the insurance 
spread mooring of the ve
ssels current heading.
 
The first phase of work will eliminate the need for the tug boats totally being 
used by heading control and is expected to commence in September this 
year with completion anticipated by the end of 2016.
 
The second phase of work is ce
ntered on rotating the FPSO to its optimal 
heading and firmly spread mooring the vessel. This heading was selected by 
some of the analysis of the FPSO which confirm that rotating the FPSO 
through approximately 190 degrees where the weather hits the [bar] [
ph] of 
the FPSO would minimize the impact to the FPSO's useful life.
 
This phase is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017 and includes 
an 8 to 12 weeks shutdown. Following the completion of the spread mooring 
work program, we expect production 
to return to the levels achieved before 
the turret bearing issue occurred.
 
The final step for the FPSO remediation involves installation of an off
-
loading 
CALM buoy. The installation of buoy is expected to restore the full off
-
loading functionality and rem
oving the sample tanker storage tanker 
associated operating expense. Installation of CALM buoy is expected in the 
first half of 2018.
 
Despite the issue with the turret bearing, we believe our cash flow from and 
the value off the field is intact. Based on r
ecent discussions with our 
insurers, Kosmos does not expect these issues to have a significant long 
term financial impact on the company. We believe the impact to Kosmos is 
substantially mitigated through a combination of the reestablishment of field 
produ
ction and the coverage of the revenue short
-
fall additional cost by our 
LOPI and H&M policies.
 
We met with our insurers recently on both policies and have made good 
progress on the details of the claim process. Our LOPI insurance provided to 
the grid on th
e framework to ensure Kosmos for loss production on a 
monthly basis going forward to minimize the impact from reduced near
-
term 
production.
 
We're in final discussions on the benchmark production level from which 
we'll calculate lost production volumes for 
which we will receive 
compensation at $62 per barrel. We expect to file our first claim this month 
with payment anticipated to be received in late September pending the 
finalization of the framework details.
 
In addition, constructive discussions have conti
nued between the Jubilee 
Partnership and our H&M insurers. We expect to agree on the process and 
timings of payment in the third quarter this year. However, given the 
complexity of the claim, the number of parties involved, it could stretch into 
the fourth
 
quarter.
 
So in summary, revised operating proceeds have been implemented and 
we're working 
--
 
and are working as anticipated, allowing field production, 
offloading and export to continue.
 
Our long
-
term solution to the tariff barring issue has been 
identified and 
Jubilee Partnership is moving towards implementation and our cash flow 
from and the value of the Jubilee field remains intact.
 
Now moving on to TEN, our second major oil development in Ghana, the 
project remains on schedule and within budget
 
with eight out of 11 wells 
now completed with first oil expected shortly. A gradual ramp
-
up in oil 
productions towards the FPSO capacity of 80,000 barrels of oil per day is 
anticipated around the end of 2016 as the facility is complete, performance 
testin
g and well production levels are increased to optimal rates.
 
For operated guidance, average annualized production from TEN in 2016 is 
expected to be approximately 23,000 barrels of oil per day gross, which 
equates to approximately 55,000 barrels of oil per
 
day gross over the five 
months when the field is producing during 2016.
 
Associated gas from TEN is expected to be re
-
injected until gas export is 
enabled. While gas export was initially expected to commence 12 months 
after field start up, plans to acceler
ate gas export are currently under 
evaluation, allowing connection to existing gas infrastructure in early 2017.
 
So we're pleased with the progress the Ghana partnership has made in both 
advancing the solution to the Jubilee tariff barring issue and delive
ring the 
TEN project on time and on budget, both critical to growing the cash flow of 
Kosmos.
 
Now let me turn to exploration, where the quality of the prospectivity in our 
portfolio continues to improve with the addition of new data following our 
drilling 
success over the last year.
 
Across the portfolio, we're very much focused on finding oil as soon as 
possible and based on our early work, our overall prospectivity is growing 
and continues to be de
-
risk by additional industry proprietary data.
 
To that end,
 
we're pursuing to deliver this result. Firstly, in Mauritania and 
Senegal, we've continued to uncover new information which has confirmed 
our view of the basin's significant scale as well as liquids potential.
 
As you know, our first exploration phase, whi
ch was completed earlier this 
year, was designed to test the primary prospects on each of three inboard 
slope channel fairways to the Senegal river, including the central, northern 
and southern systems.
 
Respectively, the campaign as we've disclosed, result
ed in the finding of 
three significant fields, including Tortue, Marsouin and Teranga with a 100% 
success rate.
 
Together with the successful appraisal in delineation of Tortue by the 
Guembeul and Ahmeyim
-
2 wells, we've now delivered our goal of 
demonstrati
ng 15 Tcf of gas for our first phase development.
 
Combined with Marsouin and Teranga, in aggregate, the drilling to date is 
conservatively discovered around 25 Tcf of gas resource and de
-
risk a total 
resource base of more than 50 Tcf of gas in the inward f
airways, as well as 
providing us with a proven calibrated Seismic amplitude and AVO exploration 
tool.
 
We've now taken a deliberate pause in drilling, which provides us with a time 
to carefully analyze and integrate geological information obtained from the 
wells we drilled during our first exploration phase as well as acquired process 
and interpret new 3D Seismic.
 
Respectively this work is designed to one, refine our hydrocarbon charge 
model to better predict fluid phase, specifically for oil and liquids and
 
second, identify mature and ranked prospects in each of the three potential 
oil prone, oil mature source kitchens, more on this shortly.
 
During the last quarter, while we're still at a relatively early stage, 
substantial progress was made with respect to 
both sub surface work flows. 
In regard to our hydrocarbon charge modeling, we've earned more direct 
and compelling evidence in support of the presence, quality and maturity of 
the three potential oil source systems, including the Cenomanian
-
Turonian 
or CT,
 
the Albian and the third deeper Apto
-
Barremian.
 
The presence of a working world
-
class CT source system in board, Northern 
Mauritania has been demonstrated by the Chinguitel Field as well as 
offsetting wells. Fluid and sidewall core samples recovered from 
the 
exploration side of the Teranga
-
1 well, have now confirmed the presence of 
a rich, mature, oil prone, Albian source system in the inboard Northern 
Senegal.
 
For example, a 40 degree API liquid sample recovered from the Albian and 
Teranga
-
1, had a conden
sate
-
to
-
gas ratio of more than 150 barrels per 
million standard cubic feet, which is approximately 10 times richer than the 
gas in the Cenomanian reservoir at Tortue.
 
Based on this wetness, a 6 TCF gas discovery would yield a billion barrels of 
liquids. Si
milarly, new in
-
house analysis of core samples acquired by deep 
sea research drilling, coupled with intense, direct, florescence observed in 
whole coal taken in the Ahmeyim
-
2 appraisal well, more strongly infer a 
deeper, highly acted gas and oil source kit
chen, of Apto
-
Barremian age, 
Albian, Northern, Senegal and Southern Mauritania.
 
Going forward, our charge work will focus on the four dimensional modeling 
of oil and gas generation from each of the three oil prone, oil mature source 
kitchens, centering in 
particular on the nature and timing of maturation and 
migration, which we believe is crucial to our understanding and predicting 
hydrocarbon phase.
 
In parallel with this new data being input into the hydrocarbon charge 
modeling, we also have new data from 
the fast track processing of our 
recent 3D AVO Seismic, as well as nearly the reprocess 2D.
 
This is already confirming that the Cenomanian and younger exploration 
potential of the outboard pool fan system is in order of magnitude larger 
than what we've dis
covered and de
-
risked with the inboard slope channel 
fairways.
 
New giant and super giant class prospects have been defined on the basin 
for fan play fairways within each of the potential oil prone, oil mature source 
kitchens.
 
These combination structural s
tratigraphic prospects has played strong and 
confirming geophysical support for reservoir, strap and charge, including 
Seismic geometries and attributes, notably AVO. They're located down depth 
of the existing inboard slope channel discoveries, which we've
 
calibrated and 
de
-
risk them.
 
We believe these prospects are some of the largest undrilled exploration 
opportunities identified by the industry today along the Atlantic margins. In 
addition to further 3D Seismic surveys are planned for Northern and 
Souther
n Mauritania during the third and fourth quarter of this year 
respectively.
 
And we fully expect the potential resource base will continue to grow further 
as new data become available. We anticipate beginning a second multi well 
program mid 2017 to test thi
s multibillion barrel potential.
 
The significant scale of the discovered and de
-
risk gas resource base with 
the inboard slope channel systems, coupled with the transformational 
exploration upside within the outboard basin pool fan systems has attracted 
the
 
attention of both IOCs as well as contractor developers who are seeking 
to partner with us.
 
Indeed the substantial increase in size of the hydrocarbon resource base in 
Mauritania and Senegal has made the opportunity to enter the basin, more 
strategic for 
potential partners but also demands that we secure our partner 
who is strategically aligned with our forward plans. This would include our 
first phase Tortue gas development which is making good progress as well 
as our second phase drilling program.
 
With r
egard to Tortue we continue to move the project forward. Last quarter 
we completed our appraisal drilling campaign and defined a 15 Tcf of 
resource necessary to underpin the first phase of the project. Now our 
attention is shifted to advance in the above g
round agenda. Significant work 
is ongoing to progress the intergovernmental cooperation agreements or ICA 
to Mauritania & Senegal and finalize the development contract.
 
During the last quarter we reached an important milestone when we secured 
the 
agreement of both governments on a project location for phase one 
eight kilometers offshore on the border of Mauritania & Senegal. This is an 
important prerequisite in ICA which we believe remains on track to be signed 
by the end of this year. With the str
ong support of both governments the 
project continues to move along at pace.
 
All of the lends to quarter two and indeed we believe confirms our view that 
the deepwater Mauritania & Senegal basin is progressively growing into one 
of the largest and most imp
ortant new petroleum systems ever opened up 
along the Atlantic margins. With a super major scale up potential resource 

further exploration and development.
 
Our second set of exp
loration initiative involves finding oil in other regions of 
our exploration portfolio which overall and we believe has never been as 
attractive as it is today. We continue to our technical aspects to identify 
mature and ranked the prospectively through ne
w 3D seismic, progress high 
graded prospects in the operationally drill ready and strategically align our 
partners and the host governments.
 
Two assets in particular are displaying most promise at the present time, 
Suriname and Sao Tome. Suriname has recei
ved a very positive read 
through from the Liza discovery and its successful follow
-
up appraisal. This 
is confirmed by the recent farm
-
out at Block 42 with Hess a part owner of 
the lease at discovery. A, we will acquire a new 3D seismic survey in the 
third 
quarter this year with a view to drilling to two down in late 1017 or 
early 2018.
 
Similarly in Sao Tome which represents the outward extension of the proven 

which is expected to commenc
e in January next year and covers 13,000 
square kilometers. This will be the largest 3D seismic survey in the 

covered offshore West Africa.
 
Finally a third initiative targeting or invo
lves new ventures. As one of the few 
active deepwater explores today we have the advantage continuing to learn 
from the results of our ongoing seismic and drilling operations and then 
applying this new proprietary knowledge to identify and access additiona
l 
opportunities through execution of our second cycle reentry strategy into the 

number of new venture opportunities at this time.
 
So in conclusion new data confirming the scale of th
e Mauritania & Senegal 
basin and the potential for liquids together with the derisk prospectively in 
Surinam and Sao Tome provide Kosmos with high quality opportunities for 
near term drilling.
 

dity and financial 
results for the quarter.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thank you Neal and good morning everyone. Before turning to the results of 


ow increasing from the 
upcoming start up of the TEN project and the corresponding decrease in 
Ghana CapEx.
 
As we become free cash flow positive starting in the fourth quarter of this 
year and as this trend continues into 2017 Kosmos is positioned to be one
 
of 
the few companies able to improve its balance sheet in a low commodity 
price environment. Kosmos remains a well capitalized company and we 
expect to remain that position while prudently investing through the cycle.
 
At quarter end Kosmos had total corpo
rate liquidity of $1.2 billion including 
$700 million of undrawn availability on our reserve base lending facility or 
RBL or $1 million of undrawn availability on our revolving credit facility and 
$113 million of available cash.
 
Cost control continues to b
e a priority for Kosmos. We rigorously challenge 
ourselves to reduce expenses and work more efficiently and effectively. To 

meet our full year capital budget of approximately $650 milli
on excluding 
any capital associated with the Jubilee FPSO remediation.
 
With the Atwood Achiever now stacked our team is spending this time to 
minimize associated expenses and retender all our contracts ensuring that 

perating at the lowest cost possible.
 
Hedging also continues to play a key role in supporting our CapEx program 
by allowing us to protect the Ghana cash flow despite volatile oil prices. We 
continue to maintain our strong hedge position and at quarter end 
our 
commodity hedges had a mark to market value of approximately $85 
million.
 
As of June 30, our crude oil hedge portfolio included approximately 3 million 
barrels remaining in 2016, 8 million hedged in 2017 and just less of 1 million 
hedged in 2018. This 
robust hedging programs remains a core part of our 
strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet and protect our cash flows and 
liquidity and we plan to continue to add additional protection on a regular 
basis.
 

second quarter. We finished the 
quarter with one crude lifting which was in line with our previous guidance 
and generated oil revenue of $46 million excluding $45 million of derivative 
settlements. When you add our oil revenue to our settled hedges it resu
lts in 
a realized price of $95.61 per barrel sold for the second quarter of 2016. At 
the end of the quarter the company was in a over lift position of 
approximately 110,000 barrels more than our entitlement.
 
For the quarter we generated a net loss of $108 
million or $0.28 per diluted 
share. Adjusting for the impact of one
-
time items that affect comparability 
the company generated a net loss of $44 million or $0.11 per diluted share 

inc
ome includes the operating expense related to the recently revised Jubilee 
procedures. We expect any related insurance recoveries for these revised 
operating procedures to be netted against total operating expenses once 
accrued.
 
On the cost side operating 
expense in the second quarter was $33 million or 
$34.47 per barrels sold versus $20 million or $10.40 per barrel sold in the 
second quarter in 2015. The sequential increase in absolute operating cost 
during the second quarter was primarily related to the c
ost of additional 
operating procedures related the turret bearing issue including tugs, the 
shuttle tanker and the storage tanker with a small amount related to our 
over lived position.
 
Exploration expense of $36 million for the quarter was largely related
 
to our 
ongoing 3D seismic processing and interpretation for the outboard Senegal 
area. Exploration expense during the second quarter included approximately 
$16 million associated with the stacking of the Atwood Achiever beginning in 
late May through the e
nd of the quarter.
 
General and administrative cost for the quarter included non
-
cash equity 
based compensation came in at $20 million which represents a 52% 
decreased from the second quarter of 2015 and as we indicated as a result 
of our cost control effor
ts as well as lower equity compensation expense.
 
Second quarter DD&A was approximately %17 million or $17.86 per barrel 
compared to $38 million or $19.29 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. 
The absolute decrease was based on one last cargo being lift
ed in the second 
quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 and the decrease of rate was the result of 
an increase in proved reserves associated with the Jubilee field booked in 
the fourth quarter of 2015.
 
Effective income tax rate for the quarter was a 13% benefit.
 
The effective 
rate was impacted by lower oil prices, losses primarily related to expiration

e remainder of 2016. 
Based on the current forecast Kosmos now expects to sell seven cargoes in 
2016. We currently anticipate having one lifting from Jubilee in the third 
quarter and two liftings in the fourth quarter. This translates to a total of six 
lift

cargo from TEN for the year in the fourth quarter.
 

the claim process on both insurance policies. On the LOPI
 
policy the insurers 
have agreed on a framework to reimburse Kosmos for loss production and 

will calculate loss product volumes.
 
The framework provides for LOPI insurers to reimburs
e Kosmos for loss 
production on a monthly basis with the first claim expected to be filed. Once 
the claims process is up and running smoothly we anticipated accruing the 
payment the month following the loss and receiving the cash a month after 
that. This m
inimizes the difference in timing of the loss of cash flow and 
timing of the payments. When accrued these payments will be recorded a 
other revenue on the income statement starting in the third quarter.
 
Based on our second half 2016 production forecast we 
anticipate recognizing 
LOPI proceeds of approximately $35 million per quarter in the second half of 
2016 subject to actual production and downtime. Once we finalize the 
process for the H&M we will provide the details for this claims process as 
well.
 
On the
 
cost side in the second half of 2016 we expect Jubilee OpEx to 
average approximately $15 per barrel with total OpEx averaging 
approximately %17.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter when we sell our first 
10 cargo. This includes the previously disclosed add
itional operating cost 
associated with the Jubilee FPSO and does not reflect insurance 
reimbursement of these costs given the potential timing of receipts which 
could cause quarterly OpEx to fluctuate. Once we begin to incur insurance 
proceeds related to o
perating cost they will show up as offset to OpEx.
 
In addition to OpEx we also expect to incur an additional $20 million of net 
CapEx related to the FPSO spread mooring that is planned to be executed in 
2016. We ultimately expect our insurance 
coverage to reimburse these costs 
but the exact timing and accounting treatment of the reimbursement is not 
currently known.
 
As I started out saying Kosmos remains a well capitalized company and we 
expect to maintain that position while prudently investing
 
through the cycle. 
We expect to be one of the few companies able to improve our balance 
sheet in this low commodity price environment.

Answer Session
 
Operato
r
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manish Kapadia from 
Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.
 
Manish Kapadia
 
Hi, so the first question was on the Senegal & Mauritania development. I 
was just wondering if you could give somewhat of an update
 
on the 
partnering process is there still some expectation that you get partnered by 
year end and from a final investment decision perspective I think there has 
been some talk about getting for that in 2017 is that still realistic in the 
current environmen
t?
 
Andy Inglis
 


[ph] and contractor developers. I think the interesting sort of new news I 

t this morning is really around the newly identified 
prospectivity in the outboard of Senegal where we have from the early 3D 
seismic identified some large structures, some very large structures basin 
for plan structures where we see strong evidence from t
he seismic and 
strong AVO conformance.
 

right partner for the development of Greater Tortue into I think a bigger 
conversation about the right exploration partner to drill out the pros
pectively 
we see in Senegal and clearly we're starting the outboard seismic shoot 
outboard Mauritania in September next month. So we want to have all the 
data from that back.
 
So I think the process is moving forward. What I would say is that we need 
to be 
aligned around both the exploration phase that we see now for the 
outboard and particularly the basin for fans, as well as the development 

it could well be by the end of the year b
ut that will really depend on the 
speed at which we get the early products in from seismic.
 
Manish Kapadia
 
And then just another question on exploration looking at 2017, I think you 
gave some guidance on timing of the wells. Just wanted to get an idea of i
n 
the current environment where are you seeing exploration well cost in the 
region for you would be expecting to be drilling. And also if you can just give 
an update on the plans you have for the rigs that is currently stacked for 
alignment and what is the
 
potential cost and if you can pass that next year?
 
Andy Inglis
 

program for next year. I think at this stage we see potential from multi
-
well 
program. It would start in mid 2017. Just so
rt of back to the most important 
point about the timing here clearly the rig not being used is an irritant but 
back to the fundamentals which is Kosmos is a rifle shot exploration 

-
year history 
w

and Senegal with 100% success.
 
The most important thing now is that we spend the time to identify the 
liquids potential of the basin which we firmly believe is there and drill t
he 
next best prospects, and we see the potential both the out boarders in 
Mauritania, the outboard Senegal and in northern Mauritania. So there are 
potentially three independent tests. What we need to do now is high grade 

 
program.
 

register is packed but the most important thing is that we drill the best 
prospects and we will start that program around the middle of the year.
 
Manish Kapadia
 
Okay. One
 
just quick follow on and other thing on the carried well that you 
had from BP in Morocco and what were the problems with that, are you still 
intending to drill that at some point.
 
Andy Inglis
 

entum Manish 
we're trying to figure out what the best way forward is on that. So clearly we 

in discussions with BP.
 
Manish Kapadia
 
Great. Thanks so much.
 
Operator
 
Our next que
stion comes from Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. 
Please go ahead.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Yes, thanks gentlemen. It's Brendan from BMO. Just following 
-
 
the first 
question just following on from Manish, I guess in terms of either farm down 
or active sell [ph],
 

do, is it a single partner across all your blocks or are you looking at also 
parceling up perhaps just as you get discovery and I appreciate that stats 
about three blocks. And then just again what s
ort of process you have 
actually been running to roll that 
-
 
this is going to be pushed into 2017.
 
And then just second question just following on from your comments 
regarding outboard Senegal, can you just talk through the 
-
 
obviously the 
upside and 
you made comments to better understanding of the source in the 
region, but can you just talk about these basin floor ends, just what type of 
trap that you see that is just relying on stratigraphic and just the risks in 
and around this type structure and pa
rticularly I just remember those similar 
type of structure offshore Tanzania a number of years ago that ended up 
actually not working out. Can you just talk about the risks of what you may 
actually see on Seismic please?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Okay. If you go ba
ck, so starting with the endpoint, I think we've 
progressively worked the basin in terms of our overall standing of it. We 
clearly focused initially on the slope channel system. We got very good 
calibration of the Seismic
-
2 and we now have something both i
n terms of 
amplitude and AVO, which is fully calibrated.
 
We always believe there was the potential for launch of sand packages 
outboard in terms of the fan plays and we've now seen those come through 
on the 3D seismic. So I think it's very different from t
he Tanzania example 
that you've talked about.
 
This is about an evolving understanding of the basin. We've now highly 
calibrated high quality seismic tools, which we've significantly de
-
risked 
there. So I think the trap type is the same stratigraphic struct
ural trap that 
has worked in the channel system and I think the key point is that we've got 
very strong geophysical markers now, which support it.
 
I think the time out is really about understanding charge so that we can get 
the best possibility of finding 
liquids with an extended well and that's really 
what we're focused on. So I think when you get to the reservoir story and 
you get the structural story, we have a high degree of confidence given the 
quality of the Seismic we have and the tools that we're us
ing.
 
I think the real challenge in a big basin like this is ultimately about 
understanding the four dimensional aspect of the charge model. So there are 
no different to the Gulf of Mexico and it's complexities, but for an oil and gas 
basin, the trick is to
 
really understand the charge model and we're very 
early in that process given the scale of this basin,
 
But nevertheless, I think certainly over the last three months and 
particularly the exploration tail on Teranga allowed us to get lot more 
confidence ar
ound an oil mature source rock in the Albian, which I think is a 
key piece of new information for you all.
 
And then to your last question, which is about what you're trying to do and I 
think the point strategically Brendan is really around history would sa
y when 
you have a large basin such as this where people are part elements of it out, 
it led to quite a challenged partnership at the end of the day given the 
ownership structures at least a fragmentation and it leads to differing 
agendas.
 
And so our view t
oday is that we're best served given the scale of potential 
we believe is that to try and secure a development partner that allows us to 
keep the ownership intact and keep it simple.
 
So I think when you look at it, what we're trying to do is find a way for
ward, 
which maintains the integrity of a very simple ownership structure that we 
have today and enables the exploration drill to occur as well as the first 
development to move forward and I think that's the goal.
 
I think the strategic alignment of that is 
as important as passing out pieces 
of it and as I say, we're in conversations with folks today. It could well occur 
before the end of the year, we just need to remain 
--
 
we just need to let 
that process run out because it's important that we pick the right
 
partner 
and don't create complexity where it didn't occur.
 
Brendan Warn
 
That's ideal. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale. Please go 
ahead.
 
John Herrlin
 
Yes. Going back to what you just said Andy, you wouldn
't have any 
containership thing or you really want to do the whole [insulate] [ph] 
inboard versus outboard rather than having separate deals? Is that really 
what you're saying?
 
Andy Inglis
 
John, and again nothing is excluded at this point in time, but I th
ink there 
are some very good examples that you know of well where trying to 
leverage maybe the last cent has ultimately led to a reduction in value 
because things become complicated and actually get deferred.
 
East Africa is an example of that and I think o
ur view at the moment is to 

nothing is excluded, but I think our approach is that this is a high quality 
basin that we currently have a significant working interest in.
 
We need to ensur
e we align with a partner in a way that they create the full 
potential to the explored and developed rather than something which is just 
a stop gap measure. So that's not what we're trying to do.
 
John Herrlin
 
Great. Regarding the Albian discussion that you
 
had in terms of sourcing, 
would that be then our retrograde type situation?

I think it's a little early to say. I think it's a little early to say, John actually. 
We're still working the data. It could be, but I think we need to let the work 
c
ontinue.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov 
from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for taking the question guys. Just in the last three
-
four weeks, we 
saw 
stranded gas related M&A deal in Papua New Guinea and reportedly a 
pending one in Mozambique as well.
 
As you look at these industry milestones that are not related to you guys 
specifically, what kind of read through do you think investors should draw? 
What
 
kind of conclusions from looking at these other deals?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Hi Pavel, it's Andy. Look what I would say is that and you know as well as I 
do is the distinctive assets which have scale and quality in terms of the 
resource are valuable today and quote
, even gas, and that's my read 
through and I think as you look at both P&G do and the Mozambique, 
reported Mozambique deal, then this is about world scale resource and it's 
about operator ship, it's about significant working interest, it's about the 
abilit
y of larger scale companies to take control of assets.
 
So I think those are the hallmarks of those deals and ultimately there are 
other scales where it makes a difference to a super major. So I think if I 
would have identified the cream on top of the bottl
e, there is lots of stuff 
floating around in the industry today, but the stuff that's actually moving is 
characterized by its quality, its scale of working interest and the degree to 
operate and I think those are the things that clearly we've been talking 
about in Kosmos around Mauritania and Senegal from the very beginning 
and the prior questions from Brendan and John have all been about the 
nature of what sort of relationship are you looking for and I think that those 
types of deals are the ones that are 
clearly in discussion at the moment.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. Can I just drill a little bit more into the insurance issue that you guys 
talked about in the press release, when you begin to collect the 
reimbursements on a monthly basis, what's the revenue reco
gnition going to 
be?
 
In other words which line item will you actually will they feed into your 
product sales or other revenue and then on related point, will it be 
recognized as received or will there be some sort of black?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Tom, why don't you p
ick that up.
 
Tom Chambers
 
That's a good question Pavel. What will happen, let me talk about the LOPI 
proceeds first. So the loss of production proceeds will come through the line 
as other revenue on our income statement. So you will see those proceeds 
in t
hat line. It will not come through as oil and gas revenue. It will come 
through as other revenue.
 
In terms of we talked about the framework that we're in final agreement on 
or we're getting to a final agreement on and what we're going to do is we're 
going 
to recognize the loss a month after 
--
 
the month after it's incurred and 
then the cash will show up a month after that.
 
Okay. And so there is two month lag in the cash, but we're going to accrue 
the proceeds, the month after the loss. And in terms of the o
perating 
expense and we're less furloughing on those discussions, but from an 
accounting treatment, the operating expense, the additional operating 
expense of the toughs, the shell tanker and the storage tanker are already 
included in our operating expense
.
 
You saw to the tune of little over $12 million in the second quarter and the 
guidance from the operator is $115 million for the year. So that will continue 
to show up in the operating expense line. When we get reimbursed from the 
insurers for operating e
xpenses that will show up as an offset in operating 
expense in the operating expense line.
 
So we'll net it out against the increased cost and in terms of the capital 
spending, we're not quite sure on the accounting treatment of the accounts. 
We're still lo
oking at that and determining how we should actually show that 
on the income statement or if we should show it some other way.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. Appreciate the detail guys. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Al Stanton from RBC Capital Ma
rkets. Please 
go ahead.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes. Good morning, guys. I want to stick with the LOPI insurance if I can 
please. Can you give some guidance as to what rate of tax you pay on that 
revenue and also the duration, is it just something that will run from I 
suppose the end of the excess period, i.e. May for 12 month or should we 
assume that the 
--
 
when the offloading boy is installed in 2018, that you're 
also going to be reimbursed LOPI at that time as well?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Tom.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Okay. Al, in 
terms of the LOPI, we will get 12 months from the end of May. 
We will collect it and the current schedule shows the current spread to be 
complete in the first half of 2017. We think that our coverage will extend 
through that. That spread mooring will be do
ne prior to the expiration of that 

 
That's when that coverage expires. So any shut down in '18 for the com boy 
installation we will not be covered under our LOPI proceeds or polici
es.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. And just sorry on the tax what rate.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Currently we're 
--
 
those proceeds are not considered taxable.
 
Al Stanton
 
To get revenue that's not taxed.
 
Tom Chambers
 
That's correct.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay.
 
Tom Chambers
 
The revenue is 
not received in Ghana. So it will not be taxed there.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. And I assume there are losses at the corporate level that prevents 
you getting paying tax in Texas or wherever.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yes.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. Cool. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. I
 
would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Shah for any 
closing comments.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator. We appreciate all of you joining us on the call today 
and your interest in Kosmos. If you have any further questions, please don't 
hesitate to 
contact me. Thank you very much.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Third Quarter 2016 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance 
and Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy. Thank you, you may begin.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator. And thanks, all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which is available on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website. We also anti
cipate 
filing our 10
-
Q with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
ce
rtain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in our 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our disc
ussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, 
the information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal and good morning, everyone.
 
Our 2016 objectives are focused on s
trengthening our foundation asset in 
Ghana and demonstrating long
-
term self
-
funded growth. I am pleased to say 
that the third quarter, we have made good progress across the business and 
are now in better position than ever to deliver these objectives and c
ontinue 
to grow shareholder value.
 
To go through my remarks today, there are two key points I want to 
emphasize. First, our Ghana asset successfully reached an inflection point 
with the recent delivery of the 10 projects. We're now generating the free 
cash
 
flow that will enable Kosmos to grow and create value in the years 
ahead.
 
And second, the quality and size of our exploration portfolio continues to 
improve as we mature new prospects and leads. We're taking the right steps 
needed to deliver a high qualit
y multi
-
well exploration program targeting 
liquids, which we expect to begin by mid
-
2017. This program will include 
some of the best prospects we have drilled over the company's 12
-
year 
history. Tom will then finish up with the review of our strong financi
al 
position and quarterly results.
 
Turning to Ghana at Jubilee, the revised operating procedures we 
implemented earlier this year are working better than anticipated. Jubilee 
production was strong during the quarter averaging approximately 91,000 
barrels o
f oil per day gross and reasonably over 100,000 barrels of oil per 
day gross with more than 65 offloadings completed. This performance 
underpins the offloading of second half 2016 gross production guidance for 
Jubilee of 85,000 barrels of oil per day and t
hat's potential to exceed this 
level with continued strong operating performance.
 
In parallel with reestablishing reliable field production in the near
-
term, 
we're focused on restoring the field to its full production capacity for the 
long
-
term. Since I've
 
last updated you we've made good progress 
implementing the solution. As a reminder, the total borrowing remediation 
process is comprised of three principle work phases.
 
The first phase of the program involves the interim spread mooring of the 
FPSO of the 
current heading. The initial part of this work locking of the turret 
was complete in early September and we began the interim spread mooring 
operation in early October. This first phase is anticipated to be completed by 
year end 2016. The completion of the
 
interim spread mooring work will 
eliminate the need for the tug boats, which are currently been used 
-
 
highly 
controlled of the FPSO.
 
The second phase of the working involves rotating the vessel to its optimum 
heading and permanently spread mooring the FP
SO. This phase is currently 
planned to begin the first quarter of 2017 and is expected to be completed 
during the first half of 2017. The work is anticipated to involve a field 
shutdown for approximately 8 to 12 weeks.
 
The third and final phase of the work
 
is the installation of the CALM buoy, 
which is expected to restore a full offloading functionality of the field and 
remove the need for the shaft and storage tank and associated operating 
expenses. We expect this work to be complete in the first half of 2
018.
 
In conjunction with the operational advantage made during the quarter. 
We've also made good progress on the insurance recovery process. 
Coverage under both of our loss of production income or LOPI and hull and 
machinery or H&M policies has been confir
med by our insurance and 
proceeds already coming in. This demonstrates the process is working.
 
As a reminder, our LOPI insurance covers loss revenue below a threshold 
production level for 12 months beginning in late May 2016 at a price of $62 
per barrel. L
ast quarter, we reached an agreement LOPI insurance on the 
payment terms and process. We are submitting claims under this policy on a 
monthly basis and are receiving payments within 30 days of acceptance.
 
The claims adjusting parties or CAPs that have acce
ptable LOPI claims of 
approximately $42 million, covering the period beginning in late night 

million so far. Going forward, the future signs of LOPI claims will be a 
function of our actu
al Jubilee field production.
 
With regard to our H&M policy, which is procured by TELO [ph] on behalf of 
the partnership and covers repairs for the FPSO. The partnership is currently 
working on a similar agreement of the claims and reimbursement process. 
We
 
expect the partnership to finalize that agreement within the fourth 
quarter and reimbursements to follow
-
up shortly thereafter.
 
So, despite the issue with the turret bearing early this year, we believe that 
the cash flow and the value of the Jubilee field
 
remain intact, given strong 
production in the near
-
term, a long
-
term solution currently being 
implemented and our insurance coverage is functioning as anticipated.

was delivered on budget. The 11 development wells, the initial phase of 
drilling which includes five producers, five water injectors and one gas 
injector, have all been completed in early October an
d the West Leo rig has 
moved off location.
 
Production has now increased to approximately 50,000 barrels of oil per day 
gross. During startup, ramp up of production is being managed in 
combination with water injections to ensure proper management of 
reservo
ir. Water injection is now increased to approximately a 100,000 
barrels of water per day, which we expect will allow a gradual ramp up in oil 
production to test the TEN FPSO capacity around the end of the year.

portfolio and where we remained focused on finding liquids in the Mauritania 
and Senegal Basin, which shows s
ignificant potential.
 
Kosmos' disciplined and consistent execution of our differentiated strategy 
has been and will continue to be the primary driver of our success. We are 
taking the time to do exploration in the right way to deliver not only large 
resources, but most importantly superior full cycle returns to our 
shareholders. That means carefully gathering, interpreting and analyzing the 
right data, so that when we drill, we are drilling the best prospects with the 
highest chance of success.
 
When w
e make a discovery, we secure the right strategic partnerships, with 
the right balance sheet strength to move forward into development. This 
quarter, we made excellent progress to define a multi
-
year exploration 
drilling program, beginning mid
-
2017. That w
e expect, will include some of 
the best prospects we have drilled in our 12
-
year history and are among the 
most anticipated prospects to be drilled by the industry.
 
Over the 15
-
month period beginning in January this year, we will acquire 
approximately 40,0
00 square kilometers a 3D seismic which will complete 
coverage of a significant portion of our acreage in Mauritania and Senegal 
during Suriname and Sao Tome. This will allow us to take advantage of the 
current down market to counter cyclically acquire Sei
smic at a historically 
low rate. As a result, Kosmos will be one of the largest, one of the largest 
acquirer of new 3D seismic data globally.
 
We currently receiving fast track data from our seismic acquired output in 
Senegal earlier this year and we recent
ly began the first of two further 3D 
Seismic acquisition projects at Abdo [ph] Mauritania position.
 
In October, we commenced a new 3D Seismic survey of a Block 42 in 
Suriname located in the Peruvian
-
Guyana Suriname Basin, adjacent to the 
Liza discovery.
 
Ad
ditionally, in January next year, we plan to commence a new 3D Seismic 
survey, Offshore Sao Tome, which will be the largest such acquisition in 

technical team to mature high grade prospe
cts to support an ongoing drilling 
program over the next several years.
 

the right partnerships to strengthen our regional knowledge and bring the 
right combination of capabilitie
s necessary to manage exploration success. 
In Suriname, earlier this year in our Block
-
42 acreage, we partnered with 
Hess, who is also a partner of the Liza discovery offshore Guyana and 
therefore bring significant regional knowledge.
 
In Sao Tome, we reach
ed an agreement to farm out 20% non
-
operating 
stake in our interest across three Blocks to Galp. Last year, we got an 
interest in a Block in Sao Tome from Galp and bringing them in across all our 
acreage allows to join explore the basin with full technical
 
alignment. 
Additionally, as a Portuguese company favoring strong above ground 
capabilities which should prove valuable as we continue into the drilling 

into our Mauritania and Seneg
al acreage, discussions are ongoing secure a 
major IOC partner.
 
Now more on Mauritania and Senegal, where our ongoing work program is 
designed to support the maturation of high
-
graded prospects to a drill
-
ready 
stage with a focus on finding liquids. We exp
ect the second multi
-
well 
program to begin in mid
-
2017 and to feature at least three independent 
tests for liquids in each of the three
-
potential oil
-
prone oil material source 
kitchens and the outboard of our acreage.
 
One of the standout tests, which we to
ld you about previously Requiem 
Tegra [ph] is a multi
-
billion
-
barrel prospect that lies in the basin full of 
[indiscernible] in Senegal. As a result of additional seismic interpretation and 
processing, a second standout prospect, Lamantin has been identifi
ed in our 
Northern Mauritania acreage.
 
Lamantin is a slope channel prospect on the border of Block C
-
12 and C
-
6 
and it is designed to test the Cenomanian, and Turonian old source rock, 
which has been proven in the nearby Chinguetti field. In addition to mu
lti
-
billion
-
barrel potential, we believe Lamantin is our lowest risk oil prospects in 
the basin, given it lies in the middle of the Cenomanian, and Turonian oil 
kitchen.
 
The acquisition of Block C
-
6 in Mauritania this quarter, which held 
approximately half
 
of the Lamantin prospect is a good example of how 
Kosmos is leveraging our proprietary technical knowledge and taking 
advantage of the environment to high
-
grade our exploration portfolio.
 
On the seismic that we acquired over Block C
-
12, we could clearly s
ee the 
Lamantin prospects expanding into Block C
-
6. Given that we were the only 
company would access that knowledge, we quickly access adjacent Block. C
-
6 was previously held by number of international oil companies who drilled 
several unsuccessful wells f
rom the license further up that prior to its 
relinquishment last year and demonstrate the contrary ideas can lead to new 
exploration concepts. This countercyclical approach is key to our success.
 
As the potential of Mauritania and Senegal growth and our un
derstanding 
improves, we continue to have in
-
depth partnering discussions for the basin. 

technical capability to develop the large resources we have found and expect 
to find was als
o aligned strategically on the exploration program necessary 
to fully test the basin.
 
As we have said, the size and quality of the basin requires a multi

well 
exploration program which we believe can yield a world class liquids 
discovery. While we cannot p
rovide any specific guidance on timing of a

quarter.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thank you
, Andy and good morning, everyone.
 

position. As Andy indicated, this quarter was about execution for Kosmos 
and we have delivered on our financial side not just this quarter, but
 
throughout the cycle. We now expect to be free cash flow positive as a 
business and expect this trend to continue into 2017, which should allow 
Kosmos to be one of the few companies able to improve its balance sheet 
without raising equity or selling asset
s.
 
As we begin the fourth quarter, Kosmos has total corporate liquidity of over 
$1.1 billion including $617 million of undrawn availability and reserve base 
lending facility or RBL, $400 million of undrawn availability at our revolving 
credit facility and 
$109 million of available cash.
 
Furthermore, in September 2016, the borrowing base under our RBL was 
increased by over $40 million to $1.467 billion following the conclusion of 
our lenders semi
-
annual redetermination. This reflects the resilient nature of 
our long
-
life Ghana asset.
 
In addition, upon the achievement of certain apparitional milestones at TEN, 
we have the ability to further increase the borrowing base capacity prior to 
our next determination in March of 2017. Our banks continue to be very 
supp
ortive of our company given our history of financial prudence and we 
expect that to continue going forward as well.
 
Also, reflective of the progress we've made year
-
to
-
date, Fitch upgraded to 
Kosmos to stable from negative watch.
 
Hedging also continues to 
play a key role in supporting our capital spending 
program. We expect continued volatility in the oil price in the near
-
term, but 
feel comfortable with our activity set underpinned by our active hedging 
program. Year
-
to
-
date, we've collected approximately 
$150 million in 
proceeds from our commodity derivatives and at quarter end had a mark
-
to
-
market value of approximately $57 million.
 
As of early October, our crude hedge portfolio included approximately 1.5 
million barrels remaining in 2016, 7 million barre
ls hedged in 2017 and just 
under 3 million barrels hedged in 2018 with protection on average above 
$60 per barrel. This robust hedging program remains a core part of our 
strategy to protect our cash flows and maintain our liquidity enabling the 
execution o
f our plans without putting our balance sheet at risk.
 
Now I'll turn our financial results for the third quarter. For the quarter, we 
generated a net loss of $60 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Adjusting for 
the impact of one
-
time items that affect com
parability, the company 
generated a net loss of $37 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the 
quarter. It is important to note that our calculated adjusted net income 
includes the operating expenses related to their recently revised Jubilee 
operating proc
edures.
 
We finish the quarter with one crude oil lifting which was in line with our 
market guidance and generate oil revenues of $47 million excluding $45 
million of derivative settlements. When you add our oil revenue to our sold 
hedges it resolves in a r
ealized price of $96.49 per barrel sold for the third 
quarter of 2016. At the end of the quarter the company was in an under
-
lift 
position of approximately 1 million barrel less than our entitlement.
 
As if mid
-
October, we have filed claims on a LOPI policy
 
totaling $50 million 
that cover the period from initial coverage in late May through September. 
The claim adjusting parties or CAPs have accepted claims of $42 million, of 
which as Andy said over $30 million has been received. Of the outstanding 
balance, 
$8 million is pending and received with further documentation.
 
As a reminder, we accrue these proceeds they appear in the revenue section 
of the income statement as other income. The LOPI claims process is now 
running smoothly and we anticipate 
accruing the payment for loss 
production the month following the loss and receiving the cash a month after 
that.
 
On the cost side, operating expense in the third quarter was $14 million or 
$14.33 per barrel sold versus $23 million or $12.52 per barrel sold
 
in the 
third quarter of 2015. This includes approximately $7 million for regular 
operating expense and an additional $6.5 million for the revised operating 
procedures related to the turret.
 
The decrease on an absolute basis was related to one more lifting
 
occurring 
during the third quarter of 2015 compared to this year. As we've received 
insurance reimbursement for the additional operating cost, they will appear 
as a credit to oil and gas production expense on the income statement.
 
In the third quarter, we
 
added an additional line to the income statement 
titled Facilities Insurance Modification, this line items will capture the 
insurance related cost to convert the FPSO to a permanently spread mooring 
facility and associated insurance reimbursements.
 
In the
 
third quarter, we recorded approximately $6 million in Facilities 
Insurance Modification expense, related to converting the FPSO to a 
permanently spread mooring facilities. These expenses are excluded from 
the adjusted earnings calculation.
 
To summarize, 
the insurance side that was appearing on the income 
statement, the LOPI proceeds will show up as other income in the revenue 
section. The increased operating cost and reimbursement of the same will 
show up as oil and gas production expense. Cost to convert
 
the FPSO to a 
permanently spread mooring facility and associated insurance 
reimbursements will show up in the cost and expense section under Facilities 
Insurance Modification expense.
 
So now continuing on. Exploration expense of $66 million for the quarte
r 
was primarily related to the stacking of the Atwood Achiever, accounting for 
$47 million of the total, plus ongoing 3D Seismic acquisition and 
interpretation in Mauritania and Senegal. General and administrative cost for 
the quarter including non
-
cash eq
uity based compensation came in at $22 
million which represents nearly a 20% decrease from the third quarter of 
2015. This is the result of our focused
-
on cost control and lower equity 
compensation expense.
 
Third quarter DD&A was approximately $18 million 
or $18.84 per barrel 
compared to $36 million or $19.46 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015. 
The absolute decrease was based on one less cargo being lift into the third 
quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 and a decrease in rate was the result of 
an increas
e improve reserves associated with the Jubilee field booked in the 
fourth quarter of 2015.
 
The effect of the income tax rate for the quarter, was a negative 14%, the 
effective rate is the result of taxes in Guyana where we generated positive 
income which c
ould not be offset against expenses incurred another 
jurisdiction.
 

2016. Based on the current expectation, Kosmos' forecast of selling seven 
cargos in 2016 remains unchanged sinc
e our second quarter call.
 
During the fourth quarter, we anticipate having two liftings from Jubilee and 
our inaugural lifting from TEN. As Andy discussed earlier, we made good 
progress on advancing the insurance recovery process with claims accepted 
by in
surers under both our LOPI and H&M policies.
 
Based on our second half 2016 production forecast, subject to actual field 
production and downtime, we anticipate our LOPI claim accruals to total 
approximately $70 million for the year, in line with previous gu
idance. In 
addition, we expect that a substantial portion of the cash covering these 
claims will be received this year. We are also currently working on a similar 
agreement detailing the payment process and timing for the H&M insurance 
and expected to be a
greed with the insurers before the end of the year.
 
On the cost side, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Jubilee OpEx to 
average approximately $15 per barrel, which includes the cost of additional 
operating procedures on the FPSO. On a total company 
basis including our 
first cargo from TEN, we anticipate OpEx of approximately $17.50 per barrel 
in the fourth quarter.
 
In addition to OpEx in 2016, we also expect to incur and additional $15 
million of net facilities insurance modification expenses from an
y insurance 
recoveries related to the conversion of the Jubilee FPSO to a permanently 

financial position and we will continue to focus on the disciplined execution 
of our strategy both 
from an operational and a financial perspective.
 

like to open up the call for questions.

Operator
 
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be
 
conducting a 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question 
comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could start with one on the capi
tal 
spend. The capital spends in Ghana anticipated to decline notably in next 
year. How do you think about capital requirements over the next in 2017 
and maybe even in 2020? And I know you've talked about been free cash 
flow positive, so I guess that's ass
uming what capital price in general kind or 
sorry what capital requirements and what oil price do you think you 
breakeven?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah. Hi, Ryan it's Andy. So, clearly our number moving in parts and we 
quite frankly with all oil prices something using
. And clearly it also depends 
on the nature of the partnering agreements that we coming to as we start to 
think about Senegal and Mauritania as we restart the drilling program in 
mid
-
2017. But within all that variables, we believe that we can be 
-
 
live 
wit
hin our means in 2017. And I think that's the key message. So, we 
haven't given a CapEx forecast for 2017 yet or also even not 2018.
 
But as you step back and you look at the variables that are out there, there 
are sort of credible oil price not the similar
 
to where we are today. And 
restart the drilling program in mid
-
2017. That's the objective.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Okay. Would you limit yourself to trying to stay within cash flow or that just 
in a rough estimate that's around about where you think you'll be in 2017?
 
Andy Inglis
 
What I'm saying is, we think when we think what a sensible program is for 
drilling and restarting in '17, the numbers of wells, the cost of those wells, 
we think that we can live within our means. So, I think we're doing two 
things out of that.
 
We're saying we have a strategic objective not to weaken 
the balance sheet. And at the same time, we have a strategic objective to 
drill the right wells at the right time, both of two things are absolutely 
deliverable.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Okay, thanks. And then 
maybe one more just on the monetization process 
graded toward to. You said a few of things but any thoughts can you 
elaborate anymore on potential timing and when you think you might be 
able to get a farm down drill down and maybe how we might expect 
somet
hing to be stripped or does it likely they'll be some combination of 
cash and carrier. Just any thoughts and how the process is going there?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, what I'd say, so that sort of come back to your question actually. And 
I think, it's a bigger obj
ective and simply the farm
-
out of greater Tor 2 [ph]. 
I think since we probably spoke a quarter ago, what's clear to us as we start 
to analyze the data that we're getting in from the seismic and the outboard. 
The significant exploration potential in outboa
rd in both Mauritania and 
Senegal and clearly the process of acquiring additional data continues.
 
So, I think the message really is about, we see two things that we needed to 
deliver from that partnering agreement. We need to deliver a partner that 
aligned
 
around that exploration program so that we can deliver the full value 
of that in a timely fashion in terms of the drill out and the potential which we 
think is considerable as well as move forward on the gas development. And 
it's bringing both of those th
ings together which is really driving the timeline.
 
We need to make sure that we got the data that present to the incoming 
parties and we're not through that process yet. And as well as the 
opportunity from the discovered resource. So, I think out of that,
 
I think the 
message really is about, this is about getting the right partner from 
Mauritania and Senegal for the long
-
term rather than simply a process of 
farming out the discovered resource in Tor 2 [ph].
 
So, I think that at least gives you, I think a go
od understanding of what our 
strategic objective is and as I said in our remarks and I think cool part of our 


tting 

getting in early in the cycle with good fiscal terms to get for its positions. But 
we know what other companies they can take things through the 
development stage. But something o
f the scale of Mauritania and Senegal I 

the development side.
 
Four of which back to timing then if you want to welcome question is, we 
need to be in a position where I think we have
 
the partnership outlined 
ahead of the drilling campaign which has started mid
-
2017 and all of that 
strategic thinking is aligned with that.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Ryan, are you there?
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond 
Ja
mes. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. On the timing of the Sao Tome 
given that you previously telegraphed your intention of doing the deal by the 

onth push out what 
changed beyond the fact that oil is having trouble to get back above 50, I'm 

-
 
I mean is there 
something strategic that has been kind of adjusted in the process maybe 

'm hearing you say?
 
Andy Inglis
 

process we had a significant discovery in Tor 2 [ph] and it was about getting 
the right development partner for the Tor 2 [ph] discovery. I think as we
 
have the early opportunity to assess the Seismic from the outboard and 
Senegal which we showed earlier this year. We got the fast track in recently 
over the summer and that changed our thinking entirely.
 

with significant 
opportunity and the outboard, with some significant structures there not 
only in Senegal, but we believe there are structures now continuing to the 
outboard in Mauritania, in Block C
-
8, 13 and we are now also talked about 
the Lamantin stru
cture which is in Block C
-
12 and C
-
10 in Mauritania.
 
So, I think it's a much bigger opportunity now and that's changed our 


tle slower, because 

basin, it could be potentially one of the largest basin as opened up in the 
Atlantic margin in the last 15 years and therefore getting the right long
-
term 
p

 
Make sure we got the right data to base decision on, get the incoming party 
as that data and therefore we can get absolute alignment both on the 
exploration program and the development approach.
 
Pa
vel Molchanov
 
Okay. I also wanted to clarify just the timing of the exploration catalysts 
during 2017. So, the Requiem Tegre [ph] second half of next year will 
Kosmos be involved in any prospects between now and then?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No as we said we intend to
 
start the drilling program in mid
-
2017, so we 

the best prospects in the right order, so we have seismic being acquired 
outboard of Mauritania today. We recently acquired Blo
ck C
-
6 and want to 
extend the seismic program into the northern part of C
-
12 and C
-
6 of 

the right order. And we are in the right shot approach to exploration where 
company will se
e very few exploration wells and our view is that today we 

opportunity issuance to the right wells in the right order.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
All right. Appreciate it, guys.
 
Andy Ingli
s
 
Great, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Good afternoon, guys. Sorry I fell off the call halfway through the description 
about the 
exploration, so can I just ask about Manatee [ph] and the target 
short prospect. So, in terms of the similarities and the differences, do they 
look the same or do they have the same seismic amplitude and laser or is 
there anything totally different than mi
ght lead you to think is one is 
potentially more royal prior than the other?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, thanks Al. I think the big issue I think is really about the source. We 
see sort of three potential source kitchens in the outboard. To the south 
actually in the 
southern part of Senegal, if you remember we drilled 
Taranga, and while we penetrated an Albian source rock, oil source rock, we 
believe clearly in our part of our acreage we have an independent test of the 
Albian.
 
As you move to the more central part of t
he basin, close to the Senegal and 
Mauritania border, we see the deeper after Borromean [ph] has been the oil 
source rock and that would be the source rock you would be testing with in 
Requiem Tegre or Tiger Shark [ph] as you appropriately translated it.
 
A
nd then you go further north to Lamantin and the key difference with 
Lamantin is that's it's in the proven Cenomanian and Turonian source 
kitchen, that's a source kitchen that Chinguitel and I think Chinguitel is an 
update [indiscernible] and so Lamantin y
ou're testing the CT source rock, 
which is the proven source rock.
 
So, you could argue actually from a liquids perspective, Lamantin is the 

independent test now, the order in whic
h we drill the wells, the relative signs 
of them in terms of liquid is something that still to be finalize, but there is 
significant potential outboard, that is the first message, these are large 
prospects and Lamantin is on two days probably over 2 billio
n barrel with 
further work to be done to define it from the 3D. Requiem Tegre [ph] is a 
significant sign in terms of the larger than Lamantin. But I think it is the 
source rock and actually that the quest for liquid now which drives a 
differentiation in th
ree prospect.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. And sorry, can I ask a follow
-
up question on the drilling activity. 
Based on what some of your pays that saying about rig rates, back in my 
envelope suggest that you could make a payment for rig for the Atwood 
Achiever and br
ing in it a separate rig more quickly at lower day rate and 
save a fair amount of cash, so is this wondering what we should anticipate 

595 and have a short contract and then mov
e on to cheaper rig. What 
should we be thinking about in terms of rig contract?
 
Andy Inglis
 


-
2017. I think ther
e is lots of opportunity to optimize the program beyond the 

we are going to look at all the options, what it does says is as you start 

 
of opportunity to optimize it. 
So, we haven't made those decisions yet.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. Thank you. Fair enough.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Maze from Macquarie [ph]. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Hi,
 
thanks for taking my question. Just curious is having the farm
-
out in 
place, the requirement to begin the drilling process or would you proceed if 
no farm
-
out is in place?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good question, there is plenty of interest that we believe will be now,
 
we will 
be successful with the farm
-
out and that actually when you look at the scale 
of what we have today, we believe that is the right root forward. So, we 
have the financial capability to drill it out ourselves. And clearly we could 
pursue that as an o
ption, but our primary objective is to secure a pharma 
partner.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Okay. And then just as you guys move towards becoming free cash flow 
positive here, what's the intention with the cash? Is that to paydown the 
revolver borrowings or how y
ou get thinking about that?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Tom, do you want to cover that?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Sure. Obviously the first use of the cash will be to fund the capital program. 
And then as we're said we're free cash flow positive we use the excess cash 
to paydown the R
BL. We don't have anything drawn under the RCF right now 
and we have a significant amount of restricted cash which as we execute the 
drilling program those that restricted cash will free up as well. So, but to 
answer your question will CapEx program and th
en paydown the RBL.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Okay, great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about a 
Guyana little bit, 
how operations and production appear relative to your expectation. How do 
they make you think about the 2016 and 2017 guidance? And if you could 
just talk about where we stand at the ramp and how it's delivering relative 
to your forecast
?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah. Hi, Neil. As I said in my remarks production is now up to 50,000 
barrels a day. I think we always said it was going to take around six months 
to ramp up. So, we're kind of on track with that and we're on track to testing 
the facility's 
limit by the end of the year which is always the intention.
 
We had an 
-
 
with the water ejection earlier on the guys have fixed that 
problem. And so, we've been conservative in ensuring that we match the 
water injection capacity to the oil production level 
and manage the reservoir 
in the right way from day one. That certainly been done and we've got 
production water ejection capacity of well over 100,000 barrels a day now. 
So, that allows us to ramp up.
 
The next big step is to get our gas injection in place 
into 
-
 
and that's planned 
for the end of year. So, everything is kind a going in lock step with what 

production ramping up kind of in line with what we'd intended doing things 
the r
ight way in terms of managing the reservoir from day one. So, I think 
kind of what we'd expect to be we have some stuffs to finish by the end of 
the year.
 
Neil Mehta
 
I appreciate that. And not to be the dead horse to around the partner, but 
can you just ki
nd a talk a little bit about what specifically you're looking for 
partner to bring to the table. I know you addressed in your opening 
remarks. But then some there is been some talk of oil services company is 
also getting involved in L&G type of project and
 
natural gas. Can you talk 
about whether that could be a potential partnership opportunity relative to 
large IOC?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, it will be good. So, I think as you said, what we believe today is that 
significant oil and gas potential offshore Mauritani
a and Senegal, where the 
front
-
end of opening of basin that's going to require multi
-
well, multi
-
year 
exploration program with success significant follow along appraisal.
 
So, what we're looking for when you step back from it is the partner that is 
aligned 
with those around the exploration program that we see which is to 
be defined, but given the exploration potential we complete from the early 
3
-
D out for Senegal the 2
-
D that we have outboard Mauritania, which is 
being confirmed by the 3
-
D been shaft out. W
e believe that significant 
exploration program to be pursued.
 
Now what we're looking for is a partner that shares the exploration outlook 

have gas L&G skills. So, in a best kind 

as you look at the list of names around the world, you can come to your own 


 
Where does that leave the contract 
to develop a piece a probably puts it as a 
less of a priority today is one of them ruled it out. There are clearly that was 
interest from parties to do that and it remains an option. But I think what 

e of the best thing 
to do is to create the right partnership from day one in Mauritania and 
Senegal, that allows to realize the full value from both exploration and 
development. And therefore, the set of skills we are looking for is allowing 
with that mind
set.

Guyana, you guys have a Block in Suriname. Can you just talk about 
prosecuting that play and where now it's capital allocation optic [ph]?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, good ques
tion. We see it has been very perspective, obviously Block 
42 is adjacent to the Boujdour with Guyana and as we believe the 
continuation of the trend with the Liza discovery. Where with shooting 
Seismic over it as we speak 
-
 

ts in the early 
part of next year and so as we start to think about the evolving sort of 
portfolio of Kosmos, we see we have got high quality prospectivity in 
Mauritania and Senegal that they are drilling out in 2017 and 2018.
 
The back end of 2018, back en
d of 2017 into 2018, we would hope to start 
the program in Turonian and we have got two different test there, we have a 
drill ready prospect in Block 45, which is a different concept to the Liza 
trend, but we see in 42, of 2D and some very high prospectivi
ty.
 
So, it ranks high in terms of our capital allocation and if this very nicely as 
the sort of follow
-
on set of drilling opportunity that would come after the drill 
out of the big prospect in Mauritania and Senegal.
 
Then after that, we shoot Seismic in Sa
o Tome next year and when we will 
do the prospectivity following from that. So, I think you know, we all of 
which as I think you know as I said in my remarks, think our exploration 
portfolio today is the strongest that companies ever had.

[Operator Instruction] Our next question comes from the line of Rafael [ph] 
from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Yes, thank you. Thank you for the 
opportunity to ask a couple of questions. I 
just had two follow
-
ups on the TEN field in Guyana. I just wanted to clarify 
whether you said that the full water injection capacity is now available to 
you post the fix of the hiccup you mentioned and then secon
dly I was just 
curious as to how long you think that Plato level of 80,000 barrels a day and 
I appreciated capacity testing but how long do you see that being sustained 
and then how do you see production trajectory going over 2017? Thanks 
very much.
 
Andy I
nglis
 
Yeah, what I said in my remarks, is that we now got water injection capacity 
up to 100,000 barrels a day, which is more than a sufficient to 
-
 
around 
-
 
in 
the oil production rate therefore enable us to test the facilitate capacity. So, 
I think you kn

enough water to manage a reservoir properly, I think that issue is now 
behind us.
 
And then in terms of the 2017 guidance, I think the operator has guided 
towards 65,000 barrels a day sales for 201
7. Clearly given what we know 

need to do is ramp up the productions you have to see how the field 
behaves and its early days, we've only got sort of less than three months of 
prod
uction.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin from Societe 
Generale. Please proceed with your question.
 
John Herrlin
 
Yeah hi Andy. You said that with Suriname, you had a different conce
pt are 
you still looking for stratigraphic track.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, same thing on Suriname. It's exactly the same concept. If I misspoke 
then I would have misled you, it's the same concept in Suriname.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay. And then with respect to Mauritania
 
and Senegal and farm
-
outs, are 
you looking for folks that want to do both gas NOL or just bear the burden 
the outboard program or all the above?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I probably I have a strong view to create value by having partnerships that 
are aligned from day o
ne. And therefore, oil comes with gas. What we need 
to do in Mauritania and Senegal is to trying to find the simplest partnership 
from day one. So, what I believe we should be doing which is where we're 
the compensation is really trying to find an alignmen
t around a party that 
shares both the exploration outlook and the gas development outlook that 
we have. So, it's a combination of both, John. It's essentially the ruling we're 
done.
 
John Herrlin
 
Thanks, Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
All right, thanks.

Our nex
t question comes from the line of Anish [ph] from PPH. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Good morning, I think question as well on Guyana. I was wondering if you 
can give an update on the development of some of the satellite sales or 
currently the great Jubilee development. And also, the gas sale agreement 
with regards to TEN going forward.
 
And then secondly just going back to the Guyana's region once again I was 
wondering if you could give some idea of any potential read through we 
sh
ould be watching from the wells that has to going to be drilling the PRO 
well. And also, I think Apache got well planned at the beginning of the year 
in Suriname. Just from what you say in terms of trend, whether drilling what 
should we be watching from th
ose wells. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah Anish [ph]. Yeah just in terms of the satellite development. The 
approach on that in terms of the Jubilee satellite just to here put those 
together with the Jubilee greater field development plan, which is kind of the
 
final phase of the development with Jubilee.
 
We're in conversations with the government around the approval of that. It's 
actually been deferred until next year just given the focus that's been on the 
work to repair the turret and move forward with that d
evelopment.
 
So ultimately we would see the development of MTA which is the satellite 
field has been part of that fulfill development which is part of the ultimate 
development long
-
term development of Jubilee. I think we should see that 
as being an 
extension of the plateau that's fundamentally the view of the 
way that would work.
 
In terms of gas sales, the gas currently on TEN is being planned, it will move 
to injection by the end of the year in Ntomme. We intend to 
-
 
2017 initiate 
the gas sales; the
 
associated gas is at $0.50 Mcf and the non
-
associated gas 
is at $3 an Mcf. So, those the pricing is set, there is some detailed to be 
worked out in terms of the final details of the oil and gas sales arrangements 
of the actual financial basis on which it 
will be done has been said.
 
In terms of Guyana, I think the big read
-
through will be from the next phase 
of drilling from Exxon that's clearly looking for following the lease trend 
which is John Holland said, all the settles [ph] we see the same trend then
 
the same prospect types in 42. So, that's the reason I think the is the 
continuing drill out of the Exxon has work in Guyana following on with Liza 
and clearly with HESS as the partner in our block now in 42. We get it, we 
have the advantage of having tha
t regional input.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Kosmos Energy Second Quarter 2020 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Jamie Buckland, Vice President of 
Investor Relations at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Jamie Buckland
 
Thank you, operator and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release. This release and 
the slide presentation to accompany today's call are available on the 
Investors page of ou
r website. Joining me on call today to go through that 
material are Andy Inglis, Chairman and CEO; and Neal Shah, CFO.
 
During today's presentation, we will make forward
-
looking statements that 
refer to our estimates, plans, and expectations. Actual results
 
and outcomes 
could differ materially due to factors we note in this presentation and in our 
U.K. and SEC filings. Please refer to our annual report, stock exchange 
announcements, and SEC filings for more details. These documents are 
available on our websi
te.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks Jamie. And good morning and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start 
today presentation with the highlights for the quarter before passing over to 
Neal who talks through the financials a
nd the balance sheet. I'll then finish 
with the look forward to the second half of the year and into 2021.
 
Turning to slide 2, the highlights for the quarter. Kosmos delivered strong 
operational performance in a challenging quarter for the sector which sho
ws 
a record low oil prices in an unprecedented volatility. We delivered 
production of around 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day which in line with 
the guidance we gave at the first quarter and reflect that May shut
-
ins in the 
Gulf of Mexico which reduc
ed overall company production by around 6,000 
barrels oil equivalent per day in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver 
the cost reduction set out early in the year with reductions across OpEx per 
barrel and G&A of around 5% to 15% for the first quarter
. We project an 
increased impact in the third and fourth quarters as additional OpEx and 
G&A reductions are reflected and CapEx reduces in line with a decrease in 
activity set.
 
Importantly, these cost savings are not expected to have a long
-
term impact 
to 
the portfolio or our operations. And they will help position Kosmos as a 
leaner company that can perform strongly as the sector recovers over time. 
In addition to the sustainable cost savings, we also took steps to ensure the 
balance sheet remains in a sol
id position, during the quarter; we increased 
our liquidity position through a pre
-
payment agreement with Trafigura which 
Neal will talk about in more detail shortly. We ended June with around $600 
million of liquidity. Importantly at current oil prices, w
e've reached a cash 
flow inflection point, meaning we expect to generate free cash flow to the 
second half of the year and into 2021, which we expect to use to reduce our 
yearend net debt and enhance liquidity.
 
As we look to the future, we continue to make
 
good progress on the Greater 
Tortue development despite COVID
-
19 mitigation measures implemented in 
Mauritania and Senegal. Phase one of the project is now around 40% 
complete with an increase of 7% in the quarter with activity ramping up in 
key areas. On
 
expiration, we're high grading our prospects for 2020 with a 
combination of proven basin, infrastructure
-
led targets and self
-
funded base 
and opening tests expected in 2021.
 
Turning to slide 3, as I mentioned on the previous slide, Kosmos delivered 
strong
 
operational performance in the second quarter with net production of 
60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in line with previous guidance.
 
In Ghana, net production of 29,000 barrels of oil per day was at the high 
end of our guidance. Jubilee continues 
to perform well with high reliability 
delivering gross production around 90,000 barrels of oil per day within the 
quarter. This was achieved through consistent water injection and gas 
offtake. More recently, we've continued to make further progress with re
cord 
water injection rates since the field was commissioned, coupled with 
increased gas offtake supporting our objective of lowering the field
-
wide gas 
oil ratio. We remain encouraged by the enhanced collaboration with the 
operator and alignment of the par
tnership to focus on consistent delivery 
and improving reliability. At TEN growths production of around 50,000 
barrels of oil per day was in line with guidance. The NT
-
9 well expected 
online shortly is expected to increase TEN productions to the second hal
f of 
the year.
 
In Equatorial Guinea, net production of 11,000 barrels of oil per day was in 
line with guidance. In the Gulf of Mexico, net production was around 20,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, which is in line with our 
guidance ref
lecting the May shut
-
ins that we flagged in our first quarter 
results. In addition the Tornado four well has completed drilling. We are now 
completing the well. We expect the well to be online around the beginning of 
the fourth quarter. Late in July, we ex
perience a hydrate in the gas export 
line of the delta house platform resulting in a temporary shutting of the 
facility. The operator is currently working to remove the hydrate blockage 
which we expect to occur later this month. Full year guidance for the 
Gulf of 
Mexico remains at the low end of the guidance range.
 
Turning to slide 4. I want to talk briefly about our COVID
-
19 response. Since 
the pandemic began, we focus on guiding the company to a challenging 
period. However, we haven't lost sight of our re
sponsibility to the countries 
and local communities where we operate. This slide shows a few examples of 
how we're doing our part, working with government and local communities, 
we've procured and donated medical supplies and other vital equipment to 
assis
t COVID
-
19 response efforts. While the slide features four countries in 
West Africa, we have been involved in similar projects across our entire 
portfolio. It's important work reflects our commitment to be a force for good. 
It's consistent on how we have s
upported communities in the past, 
particularly during the 201 Ebola outbreaks.
 
With that I'll now hand over to Neal who'll take you through the financials for 
the quarter in more detail.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thanks Andy. Turning to flip slide 5, the key financial ite
ms for the quarter. 
As mentioned production of 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was in 
line with previous guidance and included the impact of the May shut
-
ins in 
the Gulf of Mexico. One area I want to draw your attention to is the price 
realization
 
during the quarter. As Andy talked about in May when we 
reported 1Q results, there was a significant dislocation between quoted oil 
prices and those realized. Dislocation was largely due to lower demand and 
buyers passing through materially higher shippin
g costs to the producers. In 
addition, the timing of our sold volumes played a large role in our realized 
pricing. Due to lifting timing, we sold approximately of 60% our volume in 
the second quarter in the month of April, where benchmark prices were at 
th
eir lowest. Realizations have now returned to normal with GoM production 
and international cargos sold at benchmark prices or slightly above. Don't 
plan to talk through every line item on this slide, but as you can see we are 
in line with guidance in most 
instances.
 
On CapEx, we remain on target for full year guidance as the second half is 
expected to be materially lower than the first half due to the phasing of 
expenditures. Similarly in OpEx, we expect costs to trend lower in the 
second half. We are makin
g no change to our full year 2020 guidance.
 
Turning to slide 6, the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with over $600 million of 
liquidity, including $160 million of cash. The pre
-
payment agreement with 
Trafigura announced in June enhanced our liquidity position a
nd provides 
Kosmos with a new source of liquidity secured against our future Gulf of 
Mexico production primarily in 2022 and 2023. It provides Kosmos with low 
cost capital and gives us the flexibility to potentially take advantage of 
opportunities that may
 
arise in a dislocated market. In addition, if oil prices 
rise, we can repay the prepayment earlier and benefit from higher oil prices. 
Net debt increased in 2Q by around $65 million in the second quarter. The 
majority of which was the result of a build
-
in
 
working capital. Net debt 
should start to reverse in the second half of the year as the business is 
expected to generate free cash flow in the current environment. As a result 
of the lower realized prices we discussed earlier EBITDAX in the second 
quarter
 
was lower than forecast and will impact our net debt to EBITDAX 
covenant as we move through the year.
 
At the full year, we anticipate that leverage could get higher than our 
original 3.5x net debt covenant. As a result, we have proactively sought out 
a wa
iver from our banks, which provides additional temporary headroom 
until the end of 2021. Even with the waiver in place, we are working to 
minimize future leverage, continue to have a very constructive dialogue with 
our banks and appreciate all of their sup
port to ensure Kosmos remains well 
positioned to take advantage of the current market. Early actions taken to 
reduce costs have resulted in low cash flow breakeven of around $35 per 
barrel with the 2Q to 4Q period and position the company well to generate 
free cash flow in the second half of the year. At current prices, we expect to 
generate material free cash flow going forward allowing us to pay down debt 
in the second half of the year and into 2021, while continuing to fund 
selective growth opportunities
.
 
With that I'll hand it back to Andy for the remainder of the presentation.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks Neal. Turning to slide 7. In Mauritania and Senegal despite COVID
-
19 mitigations the Greater Tortue project continues to advance. The four key 
work streams deta
iled on this slide have all seen meaningful progress since 
we last reported in May. The FPSO which has been constructed in China is 
now around 40% complete and the floating LNG vessel being built in 
Singapore is over 50% complete. In Senegal, the case and 
construction yard 
in Dakar is closed due to COVID
-
19 mitigation measures. However, progress 
on the Breakwater work stream continues with delivery of rock from the 
quarry in Mauritania. The progress made during the pandemic continues to 
de
-
risk the overall 
project schedule which is now 40% complete. The good 
progress has helped create further momentum in the sell down process 
which remains ongoing.
 
Turning to slide 8, as we start to generate free cash flow to the second half 
of the year and into 2021, we pla
n to prioritize the pay down of debt in the 
near term. That said we still expect to be active with a high quality portfolio 
of exploration assets both Proven Basin ILX and Frontier opportunities. Our 
first use of discretionary cash is expected to be short 
cycle, high return 
lower risk ILX opportunity in the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea where 
we're excited by our high grade opportunity set. We also remain focused on 
reducing our interests in Suriname, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe which 
would allow 
us to retain upside of future drilling activity at very little to no 
cost to Kosmos.
 
These processes continue to make good progress. We expect to provide a 
full update on our 2021 exploration plans when we report our 3Q numbers in 
November.
 
Turn into slide
 
9 and to conclude today's presentation. I'd like to summarize 
the key points we've made today before opening up the Q&A. Kosmos 
delivered good underlying performance while navigating a challenging 
second quarter. Operationally, we've delivered in line the
 
prior guidance and 
we've maintained company guidance for the full year. The balance sheet is in 
a solid position and at current strip prices; we've reached a free cash flow 
inflection point. And finally, we're preparing for the future with growth 
through 
LNG and high return, fast payback exploration in 2021 and beyond.
 
Thank you and I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the 
session for questions.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]
 
Our first question comes 
from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
 
CharlesMeade
 
Good morning. Do you and your team there? Or afternoon as it maybe. I 
wanted to ask a question, you mentioned the Tortue sell down efforts are 
ongoing. Is there any is more color to add there? 
Is there a time frame that 
we should be thinking about or for when an announcement maybe more 
probable or less probable?
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes. Hi, Charles. Yes, I think you've either sort of stepped back and look at 
the whole the sell down process. I think 2020 
was really about first phase of 
activity was to get the data room set up with all of the input from the 
exploration success we had at the back end of last year. And differentiate 
the buyers between those looking for the broader resource play and those 
that
 
were looking to participate in the Tortue project. Clearly with the 
COVID
-
19 mitigation measures. We had a project in Tortue that was kind of 
stalled at the beginning of the quarter. I think what we've demonstrated is 
that we continue to make really good 
progress on the project in 2Q, which 
was important for those buyers looking at Tortue. And we would work with 
alongside BP to re
-
establish the timelines and I think build confidence 
around that. So I think now the process is about engagement with those 
buy
ers particularly around Tortue on the back of the progress we've made 
and a project that ultimately is going to come forward with first gas at a 
time when we see opportunity in the LNG market. And I think it's just worth 
sort of reminding that it is becaus
e the innovative development concept a 
scheme that is top quartile in terms of cost and is a vast resource in terms 
of the potential to continue to grow the project to a $10 million ton per 
annum scheme.
 
So that's where we are in the process Charles. I thi
nk I don't want to get 
boxed in with timelines, but what I would say is that there 
--
 
that the 
conversations are ongoing with the buyer pool and for us ultimately it is 
obviously getting to the right deal, a deal that enables us to build a project 
go forwa
rd which is self
-
financing but still is a meaningful contribution to 
Kosmos.
 
CharlesMeade
 
Got it. That's all very helpful commentary, Andy. And then if I could ask a 
question about Suriname, Apache I think since the last time we spoke 
Apache has had a coup
le of discoveries on the block inboard from you guys, 
and campaigning in Santonian and I'm just curious if what they have found 
there would either elevate or maybe elevate your Suriname prospects for 
2021 or alternatively maybe cause you to rethink your ta
rgets there?
 
AndyInglis
 
No. Look, I think what I think 
--
 
what's been important about the Apache 
while results and particularly the last well result is the Santonian clearly it's 
come in, I think there's still some work to do I think on the timing of the 
h
ydrocarbon there, but I think that they have, Apache have demonstrated 
both hydrocarbon bearing zones in the Campanian and in the San Antonio. 
So as you look at the block, we're looking at a play where we know that's 
quality reservoir and we know that exis
ts down depth and the down dip 
locations that we're targeting are the same reservoir sections that Apache 
have drilled in the Campanian and Santonian. So from a reservoir 
perspective, it is encouraging.
 
We know it's a supercharged basin and I think the suc
cess that Apache have 
had in sort of replicating the leaser type structure on the shelf on the 
omnichannel has demonstrated that. And then clearly, we're targeting a 
different play type. We're targeting a play type which is down dip and 
outboard. But I thi
nk the success in the Santonian and the quality of the 
reservoir is clearly an important part of understanding the overall 
prospectivity in the basin and particularly in block 42.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the David Round with BMO Capital Markets.
 
Pleased proceed with your question.
 
DavidRound
 
Hi, Andy. Thanks for the presentation. Can I start with Jubilee? 90,000 
barrels a day seems to be a pretty good outcome so far, so really just trying 
to gauge your thoughts about the second half. If I look at
 
your guidance, it 
certainly seems to imply that it's possible to maintain production up at these 
levels, but just sort of wondering how likely you think it is that you can 
maintain production at or around 90,000. And I might just ask on the GoM 
as well. Y
ou mentioned some high return projects where obviously there's 
still an element of exploration risk attached to the ILX stuff. So do the high 
return projects you talked about also come with very high chance of 
success? I'm really just trying to gauge the r
isk appetite at the moment 
whether that's changed and how quickly we could potentially see activity run 
better>
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes. Okay, Dave. Thanks David. Yes just on Jubilee, I think it's just worth 
sort of stepping back and sort of looking at the numbers.
 
I think year
-
to
-
date through the end of July and you have productions around 85,000 
barrels a day and that included the shutdowns in the first quarter. As you 
said production was strong in the second quarter at 90,000 barrels a day in 
the fields currently
 
doing around 90. The most important thing is in terms of 
sustaining that is managing the GoM and as I said we're managing to sort of 
inject record levels of water actually higher since the first year of 
commissioning actually. And with consistent gas off
-
take, so I think that all 
of that I think underpins our confidence in the forward projections that we 
have. Today's performance is absolutely sort of represented 
--
 
representative of what we think is possible going forward.
 
Gulf of Mexico, it's interesting
 
sort of taking the interregnum as it were and 
pausing allows us to go back and really high grade the hopper. And you are 
not rig driven yet, you have the opportunity to be absolutely sure through 
and make sure you are drilling the very best first. And I t
hink the 
opportunities that we've identified in the Mississippi Canyon area high quality 
and we genuinely excited with our chance to sort of rework the seismic. And 
therefore I think it is about exploration success comes of having quality 
through choice, f
ocusing on the very best things and ensuring that you are 
doing the lowest risk opportunities first. And as a reminder is in that 
Mississippi Canyon area, the four main DGE ODG had a success rate of 
around 60%. And I think we're absolutely targeting that t
ype of quality of 
opportunity.
 
So I don't think it's actually about changing our risk appetite in any way. I 
think we're going sort of back to the future in terms of the nature of the 
prospects we'll be drilling and actually taking a time out allows you to
 
get 
absolutely confident that you're executing on that strategy that the data 
supports it. And you've got time to do it. So I'm very much sort of genuinely 
looking forward to getting on with that ILX program now because I think 
we've got a really quality 
set of opportunities.
 
Operator
 
The next question is from the line of Richard Tullis wit Capital One. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
RichardTullis
 
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Andy you in the press release you talked 
a little bit about free cash flow
 
possibility into 2021. what kind of free cash 
flow range might you be able to achieve next year using currency oil outlook 
$40 WTI roughly $45 brent?
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes. Okay. Thanks Richard. I think I want to be slightly cautious about 
giving hard numbers for next year because I think we're at a point where 
we're still optimizing the activity set. What I would say is in the second half 
of the year, we are going to se
e let's move into a free cash flow positive 
zone. Yes, why? We're obviously seeing higher prices. We've actually got 
more of our production in the second half of the year than we have in the 
first half of the year 60% in the second half of the year. We're 
going to see 
the cost actions flow through. And we believe those are sustainable and 
we're going to see the reverse of the working capital build. So I think that 
we're definitely at that point of inflection where we're confident about the 
scale of free cas
h flow generation the direction. I think the absolute amounts 
it will be around just the pace at which some of the working capital 
movements unwind. And that's about the pace in which the forward activity 
sets. But I think what I can say today is that we'r
e confident it's material at 
the current prices. And I think at 3Q we can give you a much more accurate 
prognosis as to what the figures will be. But it's material and we're at the 
point now where we can actually see that trajectory emerging.
 
RichardTullis
 
Okay. And that's helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow
-
up at this point 
what do you think the or estimate the CapEx level is to hold production flat 
next year say with what you expect for 4Q 2020 average?
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes. You see what I would say is it'
s going to be pretty consistent to this 
year, yes, so we were in the sort of 200 
-
225 range. I think it's absolutely 
within that range, yes, it may do a little better actually as you say because 
you're sort of coming down to a normalized level. So I think 
in terms of the 
CapEx required to sustain the business going forward where we're absolutely 
in that range.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of Nick Stefanou with Renaissance Capital. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Nikolas Stefanou
 
Hi, guys. 
Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I've got a 
couple to ask them. The first one is just going to go back to David's question 
for production in Ghana. And it is not the guidance you offer early to the 

tially. So could you maybe outline what 
the main differences are in your assumption, based on what tell us from 
there for production for quarter Jubilee and 10 points on half of the year? 
And then my second question is in regards to liquidity and finding m
aybe a 
total CapEx for next year in case you don't say 
--
 
you don't manage to farm 
it down would it be possible to refinance the RBL and include the Gulf of 
Mexico and Tortue reserves to which the [Indiscernible] basin to fund the 
cost there or is not some
thing that you would explore doing. Thank you.
 
AndyInglis
 
All right. Thanks Nick. Well then I'll take the Jubilee question then I'll pass it 
over to Neal just to sort of talk through where we are on liquidity and then 
the RBL and then the reserve base in T
ortue. Look on Jubilee I think all I 
would 
--
 
all I'd repeat is fundamentally our forecast is based on the current 
performance of the asset yes and what is that performance year
-
to
-
date it's 
done 85,000 barrels a day that included a significant shutdown in
 
first 
quarter. 2Q was 89,000. We're currently at or around 90,000 barrels a day 
and we're putting enhanced amounts of water in the reservoir and 
consistently taking gas out, which actually manages the GoM. So I think 
those are the fundamental. So I think 
I would say our forecast really has 
been consistent. This is 
--
 
we haven't changed guidance on Jubilee from the 
start of the year to where we are now. We're seven months in and the 
performance of the field is replicating exactly what we initially forecast 
at the 
beginning.
 
So I think that's the fundamental point that I want to get across is that 
we've had a very consistent approach to it, performance has actually been in 
line with that. And we continue to make good progress on the key 
performance parameter,
 
which is ensuring that we get water in the ground 
and gas out of the reservoir. So, Neal, do you want to cover the question on 
liquidity, RBL borrowing base for Tortue?
 
NealShah
 
Yes. Sure. And so 
-
 
hi, Nick. Yes, I mean in terms of liquidity as you 
mentio
ned we have around $600 million on the books today. And we expect 
to generate free cash both in the second half of this year and into 2021. So 
we're good from that perspective. One of the options that we have looked 
back 
--
 
looked at as sort of a fallback 
option or backup option to the 
financing or to the sales process and Tortue is can you put financing against 
it and you're right that we have flexibility within the RBL to put it within the 
RBL. So that's something we got from the banks actually in 2018 wh
en we 
refinance that facility. And so there is the comment the option to put it 
within the RBL. There is project financing available options that we've looked 
at to provide some competitive tension within the overall sales process. And 
so we know those opt
ions exist and we'll continue to sort of pursue those, 
but it is a valid option that we have the capability to push forward.
 
Nikolas Stefanou
 
Okay and just a quick follow
-
up and about prepayment advanced and is it is 
it treated as debt by the financial cre
dit rating agencies?
 
NealShah
 
Yes. So it's not debt from an accounting perspective but as part of the 
waiver process we mentioned on the call what we provided the banks is or 
what we agreed with the banks is ultimately we would keep, we would count 
what wa
s accelerated or advanced payments from the prepayment in the 
leveraged calculation. And so even though it's not debt, we'll include it 
within the calculation in exchange for getting, yes, the waiver on the 
absolute leverage limits.
 
Operator
 
Our next quest
ion is from the line of James Carmichael with Berenberg. 
Please proceed with your questions.
 
JamesCarmichael
 
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. And just to I think firstly on the covenant waiver. 
I think you said that was in place until the end of 2021. And just in
terested 
to know at current oil prices how long do you expect to actually need that 
waiver or is that just there to give you a bit of headroom? And then on 
Tortue, you're thinking about the delay to that project is that giving the JV 
the chance to sort of 
take some time out and maybe reassess the cost 
profile of phase one or is that or is everything locked in there now? Thanks.
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes. Thanks James. Yes why don't I'll take the torture question and then 
pass over to Neal on the covenants. Yes, look I
 
think on Tortue, it's actually 
been a really constructive process in the quarter. The operator is sort of they 
may have step back and look at each of the individual work streams, ensure 
the work streams that could progress have progressed at the right pac
e and 
reschedule the key area which is around the placement of the caissons, 
which was the interregnum that caused the year shift. I think what you get 
out from all of that is you get two things, which are by really being sharply 
focused on the cash flows;
 
we've worked hard to preserve the economics of 
the project. And then I think the second part about it is you're actually sort 
of de
-
risking delivery which has been an important conversation with buyers 
because we showed a little photograph on the slide of
 
the quarrying work in 
Mauritania has actually continued.
 
So we're building up a stockpile of rock which means that when we start to 
build the caissons, we are not worried about that particular critical path. The 
FPSO was always the tightest part of the cr
itical path from the offshore 
facility side. And again we've had the opportunity now to sort of re
-
phase 
that and ensure that it's no longer on the critical path. So actually I'm not 
--
 
I sort of look at the project now and I actually feel as though do we 
have a 
very credible timeline? Yes, we do. Does it have appropriate contingency in 
it? Yes, it does. And have we managed to re
-
phase the contracts to secure 
the economics? Yes, we have.
 
So actually in some respects, it's actually a better project. So look 
with that 
I'll pass over to Neal just to talk about the covenants and the way that.
 
NealShah
 
Yes. Hi, James. Yes, so as far as the waiver goes what we're really trying to 
solve around was the impact to 2Q. So 2Q is clearly impacted by the 
differentials in 
the cargo timing, so really the inclusion of that Q2 number 
within the LTM EBITDAX calc it's really what creates the temporary pressure 
on the covenant. And so given that it's temporary and a result of sort of the 
oil price crunch last quarter, the banks w
ere happy to support us around 
that and we pushed to extend that into the second half of 2021 beyond that 
ratio just to provide extra cushion given volatility in oil prices and ultimately 
continue to de
-
risk the story. So Q2 is a real impact once you get b
eyond 
that it sort of normalizes by itself.

The next question is from the line of James Hosie with Barclays. Please 
proceed with your questions.
 
JamesHosie
 
Hello. Good morning or afternoon. Yes, I just a question on this $56 million 
of your 
debt classified as current. Is that just an indication of how you 
expect availability and your RBL to change in the next 12
-
months? And are 
you assuming any of it are needed to be repaid at the next redetermination 
in September?
 
AndyInglis
 
I'll pass it ove
r to Neal.
 
NealShah
 
Yes. So the $56 million is really a forecasting artifact based on the borrowing 
based model that was approved in March. And so, yes, we will go through a 
sort of another exercise here in September to briefly forecast that based on 
sort 
of where prices are now and where the production profile ends up going, 
but seeing as prices have broadly improved since we went through the last 
redetermination the major issue or the issue that we will eventually 
encounter, it's sort of a loan life issue
. And how we see 
--
 
we plan to 
address that is in the normal course of business every few years we will 
extend the time period on the RBL. So, yes, I think there is 
--
 
we will plan to 
do that at some point probably next year.

Our next question com
es from the Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please 
proceed with your questions.
 
EmilyChieng
 
Hi, guys. This is Emily Chieng on behalf of Neil. My first question is just 
around a capital spending for next year. I know you mentioned probably it'll 
be fairly co
nsistent with what you're seeing this year, but perhaps in the 
case that we don't see a sell down in Tortue by yearend, maybe could you 
provide some color around what perhaps the capital layout might have to 
be? In other words what's the work program ahead
 
for the next couple of 
years for that project?
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes. So if you sort of, Emily if you sort of step back we've sort of 
--
 
we've 
talked around the fact that we've got a low level of maintenance CapEx 
going into the business. So we think it's around
 
that sort of $200 million 
mark sort of around where we've spoken about. We sort of underpin the 
cash flow breakeven at 35. We've got then free cash flow generation. The 
objective of that is to ensure that we have the ability to pay down debt as 
Neal's tal
ked about and pursue what we believe is a very promising high 
return, fast payback set of opportunities in particular in the Gulf of Mexico. 
And again as we've said on the call our objective is that we have a self
-
funded gas business. We'll do that through
 
the sell down process or we'll do 
that through financing. We've already been around the fact we have the 
potential to do that from an RBL or a project finance perspective.
 
Now in terms of the Frontier wells, our objective is to ensure that is a self
-
funde
d program going forward. So I think that we're clear about where the 
capital level needs to be to sustain the business. We're clear about what 
we'll do with the additional cash flow and our objective is to use that to kick 
off the ILX program and the Gulf 
of Mexico where we see a really good set of 
opportunities.
 
EmilyChieng
 
Okay. Great. Thanks and then my follow
-
up is just around the hedging 
program into the 2021. How are you guys thinking about in terms of 
protecting the business from macro volatility the
re?
 
AndyInglis
 
Okay. Great. I'll let Neal pick that one up.
 
NealShah
 
Yes. So, Emily, in terms of what we plan to do for 2021 on the hedging 
program, it'll be broadly consistent with what we've done in the past. So 
continue to layer in hedges on a 
regular quarterly basis and the floors will 
sort of move around based on what we can achieve. But we're trying to 
provide the downside security knowing that there's going to be volatility, so 
continue to enter into that program but keep as much access to t
he upside 
as possible. And so we have about 35% of our production hedged at the 
moment and the goal will be over the second half of the year to get that to 
around two
-
thirds. And so we're about adding about 1 million barrels a 
month largely in collars but 
it may look include some swaps at some point as 
well.

The next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond 
James.
 
PavelMolchanov
 
Thanks for taking the question. Can I ask kind of a little conceptually what 
are the measures you guy
s are taking at your offshore platforms to prevent 
a COVID
-
19 outbreak? If you can just kind of paint a visual picture for us of 
how operations have changed versus 100 days ago, 120 days?
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes. Sure, Pavel. I think that again it if you look at ou
r offshore operations, 
we're not drilling currently. So therefore it is the sort of non
-
operated world, 
yes, what has the operator done in both Ghana and Equatorial Guinea, 
they've used a very strict quarantining process. So basically the way that the 
quar
antine works is persons tested before they come in, quarantine for two 
weeks; retest it on exit then go offshore. So a very comprehensive process. 
Has it been flawless sort of, no, there was a breakdown in the protocol in 
Ghana which led to some cases on t
he construction support vessel. It was 
isolated quickly, contained. We know where the issue was? How it broke 
down? And I think that the process is actually stronger as a result.
 
Equatorial Guinea, there was a case offshore and actually it was because one 
of the government inspectors actually who wasn't following the same routine 
we're not sure. That's now being corrected by the government. So what I'd 
say is interesting question is the way if you like 10 days in. We've learned a 
lot about how you do this a
nd how you sustain it. So is this good for the 
future? Absolutely. And I think that by bringing the rigor and discipline to it 
you've managed the situation whereby that hasn't been an impact to 
production. And we've learned as we've gone along. So I actual
ly feel quite 
positive now around our ability to continue to execute our business with 
these measures in place.
 
PavelMolchanov
 
And one more about the sell down, obviously, you're not giving any 
timetables and rightly so, but is it fair to say that 
under current conditions 
your focus is on getting it done at the right multiple rather than getting it 
done quickly for the sake of getting it done quickly? So timing is less 
important than the outcome.
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes, look, great question, Pavel, again. I
t's a balance, okay; we're not being 
a sort of romantic about the price expectations. I think the world's moving at 
the moment, deals are getting done and they're getting done at credible 
prices. So I think we clearly got options as well. Do you pursue the
 
financing 
route that Neal's talked about, there's competitive tension there between the 
sell down process. And we do need to get it done. So I think it's a balance 
between the two. And all I want to sort of reinforce is that we don't have 
crazy price expe
ctations. We're realistic but equally well we want to ensure 
that we get to the point where we do have the ability to continue to execute 
the business because we've got it to a point where it is self
-
funded.
 
So I think it's just a combination of pulling al
l of that together and making 
sure that we make the right choice. And we have options. So I think that's 
the fundamental balance we're trying to get right.

The next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. 
Pleased proceed
 
with your questions.
 
BobBrackett
 
Great. Thank you. We saw recently a combination of a large integrated 
company and a successful LNG explorer. What's your appetite for a similar 
type merger or agreement?
 
AndyInglis
 
Yes, interesting, Bob. Look, I'd say the 
world is moving forward, yes, I think 
we are seeing more asset deals and we're also seeing more corporate deals. 
So I think is that a surprise? But not really, it's what you would expect. So I 
do believe that restructuring of the sector is ongoing and will
 
continue 
almost sort of irrespective of price actually. And in good assets 
fundamentally will be coveted. So ultimately it is about creating value for our 
shareholders. So I think that we've got absolutely the ability to execute on 
our current business pl
ans. We have a great organic portfolio and we have 
the ability to grow the cash flow from the business. And ultimately that's our 
first order of priority is to make sure that we have a business looking 
forward into 2021 which is cash flow generative and ca
n continue to access 
and execute on a very strong organic portfolio. So that's where our focus is, 
but clearly the industry around us is throwing up opportunities and we want 
to make sure that where we can participate in them,

The next question is
 
from the line of Al Stanton with RBC Capital Markets. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
AlStanton
 
Yes. Good morning, folks. Neal has been asked most of the questions. I was 
going to ask him. So just two random ones, then if I may. We still talk about 
a s
ell down in Senegal and Mauritania, but I hear what you're saying Andy 
that deals being down in prices. So when will we start calling it a disposal 
rather than the sell down?
 
AndyInglis
 
Well, I think whichever word you want to use Al, I'm open to. I think 
the real 
point about this is how we create value for our shareholders, yes; we've 
done well so far with our Mauritania and Senegal process. We were 100%, 
we brought BP in. We got a project moving. It'll be the fastest project from 
discovery to first produc
tion even despite the year's interregnum that we've 
suffered. So we've got a great resource base there and we've managed to 
monetize it I believe in a very credible way. And I think that's the word that 
I would like to use is we're monetizing it and ensuri
ng that we're creating 
value as a result. And that's what we've done so far and that's what we'll 
continue to do.
 
AlStanton
 
Okay and then just changing tack but sticking with consolidation. So I 
probably missed it I'm sorry, but was there a decision on the
 
share 
consolidation?
 
AndyInglis
 
No, it's open. So we're clearly 
--
 
we're trading in the right zone at the 
moment and so we had the approval at AGM to do it. And the board will 
consider it going forward.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Kosmos Energy Fourth Quarter and 
Full Year 2014 Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being 
recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance 
and 
Treasurer at Kosmos Energy. Please go ahead.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release, which is available 
on the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com Web sit
e and we anticipate 
filing our 10
-
K for 2014 with the SEC later today, which will be available on 
our Web site at that time as well. Joining me on the call today are Andy 
Inglis, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer.
 
Following our pr
epared comments, we will have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Consistent with prior calls, I request that you only ask one primary 
question and one follow
-
up question. This will help ensure we get to 
everyone on the call today. If there are questions that w

to within our 45 minute timeframe, please contact me later today. Before we 

forward
-
looking statements based under current expectations. The risk 
associated wi
th forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
Company's histori
cal and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and i
ncluded in our 
SEC filings.

Thanks Neal and good morning everybody. As I go through my remarks 
today, there are three messages I want to emphasize. First, the strong 
delivery of our business
 
plan in 2014. Second, the quality of our current 
portfolio, both our production and development assets in Ghana as well as 
our exploration portfolio. And third, our sound financial strength and 
favorable positioning for 2015.
 
I'll start with our solid 201
4 results. Performance remained strong at Jubilee 
in the fourth quarter and the field continues to exhibit good reservoir 
characteristics as demonstrated by our reserve replacement ratio. The 
Jubilee field averaged gross production of 102,000 barrels of oi
l per day 
sales throughout the year and approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day 
sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. This led to Kosmos lifting its 9th cargo 
for the year in December, slightly ahead of expectations.
 
In addition an important milestone 
was reached in the fourth quarter as the 
Ghana and National Gas Company completed construction of the gas 
processing plants at Atuabo, and first gas was exported from the Jubilee 
field to support commissioning of the plant. As we continue to ramp up gas 
ex
ports from Jubilee and increase the FPSO gas processing rate, we expect 
to be able to further increase oil production toward the FPSO capacity.
 
We have recently been exporting approximately 50 million cubic feet of gas 
per day, and uptime of the gas explor
e system has been relatively good. The 
TEN project is now greater than 50% complete and remains on budget and 
on track to deliver first oil in the second half of 2016. The TEN wells plan to 
be on line and first oil have all been drilled, de
-
risking initial
 
production. 
Plant activity levels at TEN are expected to increase this year as completions 
of scheduled to begin. MTA also remains on track with appraisal completed 
at the end of last year. We plan to integrate the learnings from our appraisal 
program int
o the creation of a development plant, the Greater Jubilee area 
which we expect to submit the Government of Ghana in the middle of this 
year.
 
On the exploration front, we executed our 2014 plan with precision. We took 
delivery of the Atwood Achiever in Sep
tember and began drilling the Al 
Khayr prospect offshore Cap Boujdour in mid
-
December. Operations are 
ongoing and we expect well results in early March, consistent with a timeline 
we previously announced.
 
Additionally in 2014 we added licenses in Senegal a
nd Portugal which is 
obviously scale and quality of our portfolio. We have already completed a 
7,000 square kilometer 3D seismic shoot in Senegal and the preliminary 
results look promising. At this point let me pause for a moment to speak 
about the quality
 
of our portfolio. The current environment with depressed 
oil prices has reaffirmed our corporate strategy of focusing on world class 
assets at the low end of the cost curve. The combination of scale and good 
fiscal terms are necessary to achieve low cost 
high value barrels and remain 
the driving course of our exploration strategy. The high value barrels and 
quality of cash flow out of Ghana exemplify this. On a full cycle basis, the 
breakeven of Jubilee is in the low $40 per barrel range. That said, since 
a 
majority of the CapEx requirements have already been incurred, ongoing 
cash costs are very low around $20 per barrel. This means our production is 
in line vis
-
à
-
vis the marginal barrel that will be shut in to rebalance the 
market.
 
Similarly on the explor
ation front, we have previously communicated that 
our Second Innings portfolio is expected to have very low full cycle 
breakevens in the $40 to $60 per barrel range. However these were based 
on cost in $100 per barrel world. Low oil prices should translate
 
into lower 
service costs, but the industry has yet to fully see the benefits. We expect 
that in a sustained lower oil price environment, we should be able to realize 
substantial savings on development costs that could reduce the full cycle 
breakevens in o
ur exploration portfolio to approximately $30 to $50 per 
barrel. This is why we believe our differentiated exploration strategy 
executed with discipline can create significant value even in this current oil 
price environment.
 
Lastly, I'd like to comment on
 
how well positioned we are looking forward 
into 2015 from both a financial and operating perspective. On the financial 
side we've been ahead of the curve enabling us to continue to fund our plan 
regardless of commodity prices. In August of 2014, we access
ed the high 
yield market to term out some of our existing debt and raise capital ahead of 
our needs. In May, we reorganized the Company ahead of the oil price drop 
and when combined with increased [several] charge
-
outs resulted in an 
approximately 33% redu
ction in net cash, general and administrative 
expenses.
 
As a result our balance sheet remains strong and we ended 2014 with $1.9 
billion of liquidity and only $213 million of net debt. We maintained a robust 
hedging program to protect our cash flow. As of 
last month we've hedged 
12.2 million barrels of production over 2015 and '16, further reducing our 
exposure to lower commodity prices. We've been resolute about defending 
our balance sheet over the past few years. We are now seeing the benefits 
of this pro
active management of our financial position. We are well prepared 
for a world where prices remain at their current levels.
 
On the operational side, the growth plan in Ghana continues to live, as 
demonstrated by our 336% reserve replacement ratio. As we've 
said before, 
big fields get bigger. In Jubilee alone, we replaced 115% of production with 
new reserves added through field performance. We also booked our initial 
reserves related to the TEN project this year. With an increase in gas 
processing and explore
 
at Jubilee, we anticipate that we should be able to 
produce at the FPSO capacity by the end of the year. Along with the delivery 
of TEN, we have clear line of sight to 200,000 barrels per day of gross 
production out of Ghana in 2017.
 
On the exploration si
de, 2015 will be a critical year for Kosmos. We are in 
the midst of our multi
-
well multi
-
year drilling campaign designed to test our 
Second Inning exploration portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, we are currently 
drilling CB
-
1 well targeting the Al Khayr pro
spect and expect results in early 
March. After the Atwood Achiever departs from the CB
-
1 well location, the 
rig will go to Mauritania to drill two high quality prospects, Tortue and 
Marsouin. Earlier this quarter we announced the farm out of 30% of our 
Mau
ritania acreage to Chevron. Consistent with our business strategy, we 
will retain operator shift through exploration, appraisal and Chevron will 
become operator, provided as we enter development phase.
 
We believe the success of the farm out process, especi
ally in this market 
demonstrates the quality and potential of this asset which we've held since 
2012. Each of these prospects have significant follow
-
on prospectivity which 
could be unlocked as a result of initial exploration success. Our other 
exploration
 
projects are progressing well and given our financial position and 
portfolio quality, we believe we are positioned to create significant value 
through the drill bit.
 
I'll now turn over the call to Tom to update you on the financials.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thanks A
ndy. As Andy mentioned, we entered in 2014 in a favorable 
financial position. Total corporate liquidity was $1.9 billion at year end 
including cash and cash equivalents of $555 million. This is nearly a $650 
million improvement in liquidity over year end 2
013. We finished the year 
with nine crude oil liftings, of which 2.5 occurred in the fourth quarter 
slightly ahead of expectations. This drove full year oil revenues to $856 
million.
 
Fourth quarter revenues were down compared to fourth quarter 2013 as a 
re
sult of lower oil prices. At the end of the year we were in an under
-
lifted 
position, having solid approximately 99,000 barrels less than our 
entitlement. For 2014 we generated net income of $279 million or $0.72 per 
diluted share and in the fourth quarter
 
generated net income of $129 million 
or $0.33 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of unrealized commodity 
derivatives, the Company generated net income of $114 million or $0.29 per 
diluted share for the full year 2014.
 
On the cost side operating expen
se in the fourth quarter was $46 million or 
just under $19 per barrel sold, higher than our normal run rate, primarily 
due to the fact that the fourth quarter saw our largest amount of work over 
activity during the year. For 2014 we averaged operating expe
nse of $11.48 
per barrel, in line with our annual guidance.
 
Exploration expense of $94 million was significantly below 2013 expense of 
$230 million, as we benefited from the BP carry on, the Fa
-
1 exploration well 
in Morocco. Exploration expense of $36 mill
ion for the quarter was larger 
related to our large 3D seismic program offshore Senegal which was 
completed in early January of 2015.
 
Full year general and administrative costs including non
-
cash equity based 
compensation came in at $135 million which is a
 
15% reduction from 2013 
levels. More importantly, we were able to decrease net cash G&A from 
roughly $90 million to $60 million, a reduction of 33%, reflecting the 
benefits of our mid
-
year restructuring and increased technical charge outs.
 
Fourth 
quarter DD&A per barrel was favorably impacted by the addition of 
proved reserves at year
-
end which was the result of positive field 
performance at Jubilee. This benefit will also impact the rate going forward 
in 2015. Booked taxes showed an increase in 20
14 largely as a result of the 
mark
-
to
-
market gain in commodity derivatives in the fourth quarter. 
Excluding this impact, taxes would have been in line with guidance of around 
$22 a barrel. The value of our unrealized commodity hedges at year
-
end is 
approxi
mately $250 million before tax. A robust hedging program is a part of 
our strategy to protect our cash flows and balance sheet liquidity. This 
program is integral in allowing us to continue to execute on our strategy 
despite the current price environment.
 
At this time, I'd like to transition to our expectations for 2015. Consistent 
with the operators' guidance we anticipate average Jubilee production to 
mirror 2014 levels, resulting in Cosmos selling a total of eight cargos of 
crude oil from Jubilee during 
2015. This variation from 2014 is primarily due 
to the timing of cargos as we lifted an extra cargo in December of 2014. As 
a reference 2014 average sale was approximately 970,000 barrels per cargo.
 
On the cost side we anticipate total production operating
 
expense in the 
range of $9 to $11 per barrel. G&A cost for the year are expected to be 
slightly lower than the full year 2014 as a result of the decrease in equity
-
based compensation expense. We also expect that DD&A should average 
around $20 per barrel. 
Bearing in mind the challenge of giving guidance on 
taxes, we project total tax expense to be approximately $10 million per 
lifting, assuming Brent remains at the $55 per barrel level. We expect two
-
thirds of this amount to be current tax and one
-
third to 
be deferred tax.
 
Today we announced our expected investment program for 2015 of $800 
million with around two
-
thirds of this targeted for the development activity 
in Ghana. Exploration investments based on a current CapEx guidance are 
expected to be approxi
mately $300 million for the year. A majority of this 
cost is associated with drilling operations, giving our increased activity in 
2015. Also included is spending related to seismic processing and 
interpretation activities across our portfolio.
 
Our 10
-
K to
 
be later today will contain the details of our hedging position 
which totals 12.2 barrels with approximately 6.2 million barrels hedged in 
2015 and 6 million barrels hedged in 2016. Our 2015 hedging program 
reduces commodity price exposure for approximate
ly 75% of 2015 
production with floor prices above $85 per barrel.
 
If Brent oil prices average $50 per barrel over the course of 2015 we expect 
to net just over $80 per barrel. We have been proactive in reducing our 
commodity exposure for the next couple of
 
years and we plan to continue to 
this approach as more opportunities arise. Maintaining adequate financial is 
critical to our business strategy as it provides the capacity to internally fund 
our development and growth programs in Ghana, as well as our hig
h impact 
exploration program even in a depressed commodity price environment.
 
It goes without saying an improved balance sheet provides flexibility to 
capture attractive new opportunities as they arise. With Ghana's high margin 
cash flow and our solid fina
ncial position, we remain well positioned to 
execute on our strategy as a self
-
funded exploration Company. Thank you 
and now with that operator, we'd like to open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. At this time we'll
 
be conducting a question and answer session. 
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brendan Warn from 
BMO Capital Markets.
 
Brendan Warn
 
One question please, and I think you've already answered one in terms of 
sources and use of the cash flo
w. But just a question 
--
 
I don't want to 
sound bearish. I'm quote up beat on the back of a holiday for a week. But if 
I have to think forward 12 months' time and if we think that you P&A your 
four wells this year, can you talk to me about the strategy goi
ng forward? Is 
it maintaining call it the reselling of the Hopper and drilling another sort of 
handful of wells in 2016, and just in terms of your cash flow from Jubilee at 
around a 120,000 barrels a day and with the TEN development only six 
months away fr
om the end of this year?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yes thanks Brendan, yes it's a good question. I think if you get back to the 
sort of fundamental position we stand in today 
--
 
we stand in a position of 
very low net debt $230 million. We have very strong liquidity goi
ng forward 
and we have a growing production profile as you said. We have growth from 
Jubilee South as we ramp to the FPSO capacity and as you say in the back 
half of 2016 we have the growth coming through from TEN, and in that time 
period over the next two
 
years production is doubling. So really we do have 
the liquidity and the cash flow to be able to continue with a very high quality 
exploration portfolio. We're targeting as it has always been the fundamental 
strategy of the Company, opportunity towards [p
h] the low cost of the 
development curve that sit in a world that are we believe economic in that 
$30 to $50 per barrel range assuming some deflation. And therefore it is 
about continuing to drill out. Now depending on exploration success, we will 
channel 
funds from exploration to appraisal and optimize the capital 
deployment that way. But we stand in a position today where we can 
execute on the strategy that the Company has had since it started and has it 
kept it in great shape, because ultimately Ghana is
 
the example of a field 
where you have a world class asset. It continues to grow and it's at the low 
end of the cost curve.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Maybe one question on MTA. Any thoughts at 
this point 
--
 
I know the full 
development plan was due later this year, but any thoughts on the scope of 
the development at this point? Is it a confirmed tieback to Jubilee? Is there 
the potential for it to be a Company by an increasing capacity of the fac
ility? 
Or will it likely be developed as olage backfilling as Jubilee declines?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I think what we can say is it did 
--
 
it will be tied back to Jubilee. That's the 
basis on which we're working with the Jubilee Partners and it will be part of 
an ex
pansion of the Jubilee facility. So I think both of those things are the 
basis on which we're preparing the development plan and as a result of the 
appraisal results.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Okay. And maybe on Jubilee as well, can you walk you through over the 
course of
 
the next 12 months maybe the timeline of the potential for 
debottlenecking, now that the gas export solution is up and running?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes I think what you're going to see really is, as your question is probed 
really are sort of two factors. One is w
hat I would call a large scale 
debottlenecking, which is as you said really is accompanied around just 
economic justification for that. It's built around the additional resources that 
will come through from MTA that will also allow us to accelerate Jubilee
 
barrels. And then I think in the short
-
term, it's about really the gas process 
-
-
 
gas export ramps up as the GOR issues therefore become easier control 
gas handling increases, we should see an increase oil rate. And what we'll do 
then is incrementally deb
ottleneck the system as we test the various 
bottlenecks on the FPSO capacity and that will be done on an incremental 
sort of quarter
-
by
-
quarter basis. The FPSO has a designed capacity of 
around 120,000 barrels a day. We should now be able to test potential
ly a 
10% increase in that with very relatively low expenditure, and that will occur 
over the medium term, with a larger step
-
up as a result of the ability to 
integrate both Jubilee acceleration and MTA.
 
Ryan Todd
 
And is there anything on the 
--
 
well from t
he onshore gas handling facility 
that we should see as kind of 
--
 
I guess are there any thresholds that need 
to be cleared there that would allow you to 
--
 
I guess the timing on the 
increasing that from 50 million cubic feet a day gas potential?
 
Andy Ingli
s
 
Yes, the plant has operated reasonably well. The reliabilities have been 
pretty good. The real issue now is about reliability of gas uptake at the 
power station. That obviously would demonstrate a reliability around that 50 
million scuff level. The objec
tive is to sort of test it at a 100 plus, probably in 
the second half of the year and that's about the gas plant stepping up and 
also the ability to take additional gas to the power plant.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward 
Westlake from Credit 
Suisse.
 
Edward Westlake
 
I guess just on the Chevron farm
-
outs, you kept Tortue out of that. Maybe 
just talk a little bit about how you think about the involvement of Chevron 
across the broader Mauritania Senegal acreage?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Ye
s look it's sort of relatively simple. Both ourselves and Chevron see the 

the Senegal 3D at time of the farm
-
out. And that 
--
 


want to pursue any farm
-
out of Senegal at 
that point. Therefore its simplest for all parties is to just to keep Tortue 
separate. And we do have as part of the agreement that they have the 
ability to come back in to Tortue at a significant promote. But clea
rly the 
arrangement that we have with Chevron was therefore focused on 
Mauritania itself. And that way we kept it pretty straight forward and simple.
 
Edward Westlake
 
And then in terms of any seismic reprocessing or any extra delineation that 
you've done ob
viously 
--
 
it takes a long time. So quarterly calls are probably 
not the best for any of this, but just wondering if there have been any 
changes in views since the last quarterly update?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No the 
--
what would I say Ed, as you know you sort of hav
e 
--
 
the world is 
now fast tracks upon fast tracks. We've shut the Senegal seismic. And 
obviously through year end, we've had the ability to fast track the data over 
the Senegal side and it continues to sort of confirm Tortue as a very solid 
prospect. So I
 
think other than that really, you then have the further work 
that we will do in Western Sahara, the further work that's obviously ongoing 
in Ireland, but nothing that I would say to sort of cause 
--
 
any other 
comments other than we see the prospectivity c
ontinuing to develop.
 
Edward Westlake
 
And presumably I mean there's a lot of jumping off points in terms of 
success or otherwise at the program this year in terms of deciding what you 
might do next other than lease expiry?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes absolutely. The j
ump off points as you say are dependent on success in 
one of the initial play opening tests, did we come back to appraisal, what's 
the timing of that appraisal, and so how do we mix and match the 
exploration program we've set out versus the potential for a
ppraisal. So 
they're all jumping off points.
 
Edward Westlake
 
And just if I may, the $30 to $50 is quite an aggressive statement obviously 
reflective of I guess some cost deflation, but that's also the fiscal terms that 
are available in these regions becaus
e its frontier exploration, but how 
confident are you that that is going to be the right range?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Clearly so we talked about 40 to 60 in the past, we've talked about 30 to 50 
here with what we anticipate to be the impact of deflation in deepwater
, 
which we are starting to see. But again just sort of 
--
 
it's really a statement 
about [indiscernible] model outcome but 
--
 
and it's dependent on the size of 
prospects. We are chasing prospects that have materiality as you know. And 
we do have good fiscal
 
terms because we've entered the basins at a very 
early stage. So it is a model outcome, but it's a model outcome on the basis 
of the prospects that we're targeting and the fiscal terms which we know to 
be good. So I think it's a genuine reflection of the 
quality of prospects that 
we're drilling.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeb Bachmann from Scotia 
Howard Weil.
 
Jeb Bachmann
 
Just a couple of quick ones. First, any kind of additional details can you guys 
give on the Chevron farm out? Doll
ar amounts, maybe percentages on 
disproportionate share that Chevron will pay on that first exploration well?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. Again, as you know, the finance arrangements are confidential. So there 

locks. They will pay a 
disproportionate share on the first well and potentially on a second 
contingent well.
 
Jeb Bachmann
 
Okay, and then just on the timing of the cargo liftings. Should we expect 
maybe 1, 1.5 in the first quarter then maybe jumping to 3, 2
 
and 2 for the 
rest of the year to get to eight, or how should we think about that?
 
Andy Inglis
 

planned for two liftings, and then just got two in each quarter and then we 
will giv
e you an update as we go along.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Al Stanton from RBC.
 
Al Stanton
 
I was just wondering if we could just be a little bit clearer on what you get 
for the $300 million of exploration spend this year, 
whether you do get four 
wells which was suggested in one of the earlier questions. So can we just 
put the wells in each quarter so we can see where we are?
 
Andy Inglis
 

Al Khayr
 
at the moment. The rig then would move to Tortue which is in 
Mauritania. There is been actually a farm
-
out playings, then it will move to 
Marsouin, which is the third well in Mauritania and then depending on what 
happens, we have fourth well in the fourth
 
quarter, it could be another 
exploration prospect it could be an appraisal well.
 
Al Stanton
 

 
Andy Inglis
 
It could be.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond 
James.
 
Pavel Molchano
v
 
Of the year
-
end reserves can you break that out between Jubilee and TEN?
 
Andy Inglis
 
TEN was about 28 million barrels and the balance was Jubilee.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
28, okay, got it. And then on the CB
-
1 prospect, recognizing that you're 
weeks away from po
tentially getting some results, any latest thinking on the 
predrill estimate?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, nothing's changed that number.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from John 
Herrlin from SGB.
 
John Herrlin
 
Regarding the gas 
production in Ghana, will there be any seasonality once 
things are fully up and going Andy?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good question John. Fundamentally the answer is no, and I think if you ask 
the question behind the question is, given this hydro, where is the swing? I 


sort of if you look forward five years and the power gets built out, potentially 
there could be some, but I
 
suspect at that point that will swing it around the 
hydro rather than the gas.
 
John Herrlin
 

in swing.
 
Andy Inglis
 

write
-
off because 


believe through time John that given the expansion of the economy the 
actual gas ca
pacity, the power capacity in the country will lag. The needs 
therefore is always going to be ability have everything fully turned on.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay, great. One other one for me on the CB
-
1 wells, coming along in terms 
of where you expected, given your
 
seismic modeling, is the structure being 

 
Andy Inglis
 

than that, we will give you full update in March when we get the results.

Energy.

the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website. We've also published 
a presentation 
this morning giving an update on our Mauritania & Senegal

Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will have a question

Thanks, Neal.
 
Before we dive into the details of
 
our first quarter results, I want to step 
back for a minute and talk about the big picture. Throughout, the history of 
Kosmos, we remained disciplined in the execution of our strategy. This focus 
has led to Kosmos opening, two world
-
class petroleum system
s over the 
past 10 years, drilling only six frontier basin and opening wells at 1 and 3 
success rate much better than the industry.
 
With our four recent follow
-
on successes offshore Mauritania & Senegal, it's 
becoming clear that this is a basin with signif
icant hydrocarbon potential. 
We've already discovered more resource at a much larger working interest 
than we discovered in Ghana and we've only just started.
 
Our exploration portfolio continues to be rich in opportunity and we are 
entering an exciting pha
se in the company's history. And as a result of our 
financial prudence and disciplined approach to capital allocation. We are 
well
-
positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us.
 
The heart of our success is a dedicated group of people among the 
best in 
the business remained fully committed to our bright future. We've 
accomplished a great deal. But there is much more for us to do. I'm 
confident that our approach and work plan will create lasting value.
 
As I go through our remarks today, I'll start
 
with an update of our Ghana 
operations. Brian and I will then discuss progress in our second inning 
portfolio in Mauritania & Senegal, where we announced our fifth successful 
well at Teranga
-
1 this morning and are quickly moving the gas discovered in 
the 
basin towards commercialization. Then Brian will provide an update on 
our third inning portfolio before Tom reviews our strong financial position 
and results for the quarter.
 
Now turning to Ghana. In our fourth quarter call in February, identified a 
potent
ial issue with a Jubilee FPSOs turret bearing. As a precautionary 
measure, we implemented additional operating procedures to limit the 
rotation of the vessel at that time. Since that call further technical 
investigation confirmed that the turret bearing is
 
no longer able to rotate as 
originally designed and as a results provides operating procedures were 
implemented, which allows the continued production on our long
-
term 
solution as identified and implemented.
 
Revised offtake procedure due to dynamically po
sition shuttle tanker to 
offload from the FPSO and transfer to a Suezmax storage tanker before the 
oil is offloaded to the buyer's vessel and transported to market. I can 
confirm the production resumed on May the 3rd and we are now ramping up 
oil productio
n levels and gas exports.
 
While this solution should allow for production to continue in the near
-
term, 
a long
-
term permanent solution is required. The Jubilee partnership has 
established a project team to study the root cause and determine the best 
path f
orward. A number of remediation options exist and we expect to make 
a decision over the next few months.
 
Kosmos does not expect these issues to have a significant long
-
term 
financial impact on the company due to continued production from the field 
and the 
appropriate insurance coverages we have in place. The partnership 
level, Tullow has procured hull and machinery insurance for the joint 
venture, which ensures against damage to the FPSO and covers operating 
expenses in capital cost associated with this dam
age.
 
Kosmos also have his own loss of production income insurance or LOPI, 
which covers a loss of production revenue after a 60
-
day waiting period. Our 
production shortfall calculates the low count [ph] threshold is insured at a 
price of approximately $62 
per barrel for 365 days. However, near
-
term 
cash flows could be impacted by the timing of reimbursements. As there are 
number of moving parts in the interim, we expect to provide you with an 
updated full year 2016 production guidance once the long
-
term sol
ution is 
selected.
 
So in summary, we've implemented procedures in the short
-
term to allow 
production offloading and export to continue. We're working diligently on our 
long
-
term solutions, which we expect to update you on in the next few 
months and we have
 
the necessary insurance coverage in place to help 
mitigate the financial impact of the issue.
 
Moving to the TEN project, our second major oil development in Ghana. The 
project is now more than 90% complete and remains on budget and on time 
with first oil 
expected in the third quarter of 2016. The FPSO sales from 
Singapore in January and arrived on location in March.
 
Field hookup activities have begun and investments now being connected to 
the subsidy infrastructure by rises and then binnacles [ph]. The 
com
missioning of these systems is underway. Additionally, the completion of 
the development wells is on schedule with seven wells completed to
-
date. 
The project continues to progress well and we are pleased with this 
advancement.
 
We'll now shift from our Ghan
a operations to discuss our second inning 
progress in Mauritania and Senegal starting with a successful well at 
Teranga, which we announced this morning.
 
Brian?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Andy. As I make my remarks, I'll be talking through the 
presentation provi
ded on the website entitled Mauritania and Senegal 
exploration update.
 
Turning first to slide two, in just over a year since we announced the Tortue 
well, opened up the Cretaceous petroleum system offshore Mauritania and 
Senegal. Since that time, it 
made tremendous progress in further unlocking 
its hydrocarbon potential. Indeed, although exploration is still at an early 
stage results to
-
date, have already confirmed the province has is a world 
scaled gas resource and substantial follow
-
on potential for
 
gas and oil. 
Moreover, extrapolation of these results project the petroleum system to be 
one of the large 
-
 
open along the Atlantic margins in the last 15 years.
 
Let me remind everyone that our new ventures identification and access 
initiatives over the l
ast few years have captured the vast majority of this 
prolific petroleum system. And then now nearly 40,000 square kilometer 
acreage position, which is equivalent to roughly 1,700 government scale 
blocks. This is also equivalent to approximately 10 times t
he size of our 
acreage position we initially had in Ghana, but here, our working interest is 
significantly higher. It's an average 75% and we also hold operatorship.
 
The principal benefit of this is the control that provides in designing and 
managing the e
xploration strategy, including timing and sequencing of 
seismic and wells and the pace of spend. Completed 3
-
D seismic coverage, 
although significant is limited to less than half of the area under license 
offshore Mauritania and Senegal. And we've only dri
lled four exploration 
wells. However, the 100% drilling success rates as well as the size of the 
discoveries and the defined exploration potential demonstrate that this is a 
super
-
major scale of hydrocarbon province and that the resource base is 
likely to 
continue to grow.
 
On the three inboard structural trends drilled so far, we believe we have 
discovered a resource base with the Pmean of 25 Tcf. When combined with 
the follow
-
on on
-
trend and calibrated potential we estimate we have a total 
gas resource bas
e of over 50 Tcf.
 
All the wells we have drilled and have all been located along the inboard 
trend of the petroleum system in both Mauritania and Senegal. We've 
learned a great deal about this prudent petroleum system from a play 
standpoint.
 
The first takea
ways that the multiple prolific hydrocarbon column exists over 
our acreage. The deeper most Apto
-
Barremian is now understood to be 
regionally the dominant source rock. We believe this has charged the Tortue 
and Marsouin as well as Teranga discoveries on th
e inboard structural trends 
at Mauritania and Senegal respectively, where it is gas mature.
 
We interpret the source systems to be on onshore outboard given the 
temperature information we have acquired. We've also drilled through the 
source rock in the shal
low Cenomanian and Albian sequences. With the data 
acquired we consider these Cenomanian and Albian sequences to be all 
mature of a part of our acreage in Senegal and Mauritania.
 
Secondly, we have two high quality reservoir sequences in the low 
Cenomanian 
and Albian, which have been deposited by the Senegal and New 
York Shaft [ph] river systems, as we shall discuss again later. We believe 
that these are commercial in scale being reasonably extensive, thick and 
high quality Deepwater channel sands.
 
Thirdly, 
we've demonstrated the 3D Seismic and AVO attributes, which are 
now well calibrated by drilling, can be reliably used as an exploration tool to 
identify reservoir hydrocarbon fluids, although we are unable to discriminate 
between oil and gas plays at this 
time based on geophysics.
 
On this basis, we believe there is significant exploration potential including 
for both oil and gas on our licenses beyond the estimated 25 to 50 Tcf oil 
discovered and demonstrated. Indeed, we have four additional structural 
tren
ds on our acreage that remain on tests.
 
Turning now to slide three, we show the results of Teranga
-
1, which is our 
fourth successful exploration well offshore Mauritania and Senegal over the 
course of the last 12 months. The well has made another significa
nt gas 
discovery maintained at 100% exploration success rate and derisked follow 
on potentially, which we believe is likely gas along the inboard Senegal 
trend. This discovered a Pmean resource, gas resource of 5 Tcf having 
encountered 31 meters of net gas
 
pane [ph] in a single hydrocarbon column, 
which resides within a good quality reservoir of low Cenomanian and NH 
[ph]. This channel system extends with AVO support approximately 30 
kilometers down depth to the western limit of the existing 3D Seismic.
 
The
 
next slide on page four summarizes from an exploration standpoint what 
we have done so far, what we know today and what it means. Four 
exploration wells drilled to
-
date have been designed to test three structural 
trends including one in each of the three 
fairway which constitutes the 
inboard Senegal river reservoir system in the Southern Mauritania and 
Northern Senegal. Specifically, these includes Tortue and Guembeul on the 
central fairway, Marsouin in the northern fairway and Teranga on the 
southern fair
way.
 
As previously discussed, we now know based on the results of the wells 
coupled with our 3D seismic and number of things. Firstly, we believe the 
dominant source rock is from a deeper charge, which we currently interpret 
to be Apto
-
Barremian and that i
s gas mature inboard. We know that 
together these four wells have discovered approximately 25 Tcf of gas and 
we estimate the total of more than 50 Tcf potential including adjacent 
prospects comprising well delineated and calibrated channel sand.
 
Prior to d
uring Teranga
-
1, we believe that prospect had a reasonable chance 
to finding all based on the postulated presence, quality and maturity for 
working out the source kitchens located directly below the lower 
Cenomanian reservoir target. The key risk to phase 
was considered to be the 
contribution of an oil charge from the Albian resource relative to a deep gas 
charge from the underlying Apto
-
Barremian. It's important to note that we 
deliberately chose to accelerate Teranga
-
1 well before now drilling force, as 
i
t not only allowed us to test the key prospect on a separate independent 
trend, but provided us an opportunity to acquire additional technical 
information and enabled further well to seismic calibration. Together these 
pieces of information would be critic
al to optimizing our next phase of 
drilling.
 
While rock and fluid samples and analysis from Teranga
-
1 are not yet 
available given the well resources is speculated that the Apto
-
Barremian gas 
charge strongly prevailed at this prospect location. While inhere
ntly in gross 
terms, a hydrocarbon charge model remains intact, and indeed indirect 
measurements while drilling and logging suggest the Cenomanian and Albian 
source kitchens are both presents and working. Our focus going forward will 
be in further refining
 
the model in order to better predict hydrocarbon phase 
with the play fairway in prospect scale. Specifically, our efforts will focus on 
more deeply understanding sourced to reservoir plumbing including 
migration pathways and timing.
 
Secondly, we know that
 
this inboard Senegal river reservoir system is about 
200 kilometers inland and the primary target of Cenomanian frequents 
extends and can be correlated across this distance. This confirms to us that 
this reservoir is recently present, continuous, thick an
d high quality with the 
central Tortue fairway been the overall sweet spot. This is important as the 
primary reason to generally, more generally for exploration failure in 
Deepwater to lack of reservoir or reservoir quality, and this risk is much less 
of a
 
concern for us.
 
And thirdly, we know that the combination structural stratigraphic traps 
which fall on the prospects on the structural trends have been both Senegal 
of the inboard Senegal river systems as well as others consistent with work.
 
To conclude, 
I want to turn to the last slide. Going forward, our plan has two 
primary goals. Firstly, to develop the large gas resource that we've 
discovered. And secondly to define and test the other independent trends, 
which have significant potential including for 
oil both in Northern Mauritania 
and in the outboard of the Mauritania and Senegal. We have multiple 3D 
seismic surveys in various stages of acquisition processing.
 
In addition to the final processing of existing 3D seismic inboard Senegal 
during the first 
quarter this year we acquired 3D seismic outboard at 
Senegal and we plan to acquire additional 3D seismic outboard Mauritania in 

 
Prospect interpretation and mapping of these dataset through the remainder 
of the year incorporated w
ith the player valuation of hydrocarbon source 
systems and charge mechanisms discussed previously will together enable 
us to develop an integrated VOD [ph] exploration potential at this 
Cretaceous petroleum system by the first quarter of 2017.

Andrew Inglis
 
In terms of moving forward with the inboard gas resource development, we 

discovery well that commercializes resource, we
 
would need to deliver 15 Tcf 
for high quality gas resource, as the government agrees on the gas 
development plant and finalize the development strategy. You may consider 
progress across all three objectives in just 12 months since the initial 
Tortue
-
1 dis
covery.
 
In Q1, we announced the successful results of the Ahmeyim
-
2 appraisal well 
offshore of Mauritania. This was the third well drilled on the Tortue West 
structure and together with Guembeul
-
1 it validates an LNG scale resource. 
In aggregate Guembeul a
nd Ahmeyim
-
2 have defined the Tortue West field 
limits extending the productive field area and significantly derisk reservoir 
continuity and connectivity. As a result, these wells have increased our 
Pmean extra months of gross discovery resource for Tortue
 
West for 15 Tcf. 
And we did base with one last well that initially planned.
 
Beyond proving that the resource exceeds the minimum threshold we have 
growing confidence in the competitiveness of the project. The Tortue to be 
commercial today we believe it ha
s to be competitive with the lowest cost 
LNG supply which is currently the U.S. Gulf Coast. The scale and quality of 
discovery resource are major drivers are I believe that Tortue can be a 
competitive source of LNG.
 
The wells we have drilled today demonstr
ate that we have a high quality gas 
and excellent reservoir quality. We have not [indiscernible] CO2 or H2S in 
the gas. Furthermore, Tortue is a lean gas with low levels of liquids which 
should provide the options to provide the gas directly to shore a dis
tance of 
only around a 130 kilometers with no Deepwater infrastructure required and 
minimal gas processing.
 
In addition, the well has proved the existence of excellent quality reservoir 
in both the Cenomanian and deeper Albian zones which should result in 
high 
well deliverability. We believe that each well would be capable of delivering 
production rates of between a 150 million to 200 million cubic feet gas per 
day, reducing a number of development wells acquired. Both of these 
elements are critical deliver
ing our low cost development enabling the 
project to move forward.
 
Given these attributes, we think the Tortue development can be one of the 
most competitive LNG projects in the world with an estimated upstream cost 
of approximately $2 per Mcf. This 
combined with a competitive low cost 
FLNG mixed stream solution should provide the ability to deliver gas on a 
FOB basis at less than $5 per Mcf, which should place Tortue with the low 
end of the cost curve.
 
Above the ground, we continue to make good progr
ess and are very 
encouraged by engagement with both Mauritania and Senegal. Both the 
government and national oil companies have been supportive of the project 
and taken a practical approach regarding the development of the shared 
resource. Probably this ye
ar we entered into an MOU with national oil 
companies which outlined the principles of an inter
-
governmental co
-
operation agreement or ICI for the joint development across board of 
resource. These efforts continue to gain momentum and discussions 
concernin
g unitization of the resource recently began modeled on the FIG 
[ph] agreement between the UK and Norway, which has been successful in 
the North Sea. We expect to finalize the ICI in the second half of this year, 
which will mark a major milestone in the pr
oject. With all parties motivated 
and focused on delivering a competitive project, we believe that we are well
-
positioned to provide early first gas and maximize value for all stakeholders.
 

t strategy 
for Tortue. This time we're in serious discussions with a number of interested 
development partners who wish to work with Mauritania and Senegal 
including both large IOCs and contract developers. With gas landscape 
changing rapidly, the industry
 
is evolving to create new paradigms to fund 
and develop high

quality resource; given the various potential options we 
are evaluating them in parallel with an expectation to make a decision on 
the optimal structure later this year.

Thanks, Andy. I would now like to take a moment to remind you that,

financials.
 
Thom
as Chambers
 
Thank you, Brain.
 
Before turning to the results of the quarter. I would like cover our financial 
position. Kosmos liquidity remained strong and we are committed to 
maintaining our history of financial prudence and protecting our balance 
sheet. 
We have maintained our balance sheet strength, despite the 
prolonged market downturn and the quarter end, Kosmas had total 
corporate liquidity of $1.5 billion, including $877 million of undrawn 
availability on our reserve based lending facility or RBL, $40
0 million of 
undrawn availability on a revolving credit facility and $213 million of 
available cash.
 
During the quarter, we concluded our semi
-
annual bank predetermination on 
our RBL, which as expected did not result in a material change in our 
borrowing b
ase. The borrowing base decreased by less than 5% or just 
under $74 million to approximately $1.427 billion driven primarily by a 
decrease in bank price debts. This modest decrease in our borrowing base is 
a testament to the quality of our assets. Furtherm

able to maintain our borrowing base in the second half of 2016, following 
startup of the 10 field as a value of those barrels have not been fully 
captured in our existing borrowing base, but has expected to post first oil.
 
Hedging 
plays a key role in supporting our CapEx program by allowing us to 
protect the Ghana cash flows despite low oil prices. We continue to maintain 
our strong hedge position in a quarter end, our commodity hedges had a 
mark
-
to
-
market value of approximately $18
5 million
 
In early April, we executed a hedge for an additional 2 million barrels of oil 
for calendar year 2017, bringing our total oil hedges to 13.4 million barrels 
with approximately 4.5 million barrels remaining in 2016, 8 million barrels 
hedged in 201
7 and just under 1 million barrels hedged to 2017. This robust 
hedging program remains a core part of our strategy to maintain a strong 
balance sheet and protect our cash flows and liquidity. And we planned to 
continue to add protection on a regular basis.
 
Now, I'll turn to our financial results. We finished the quarter with 2 crude oil 
lifting generating oil revenues of $62 million, excluding $57 million of 
derivative settlements. When you add our revenue to our settled hedges, it 
results in a realized pri
ce of approximately $62.64 per barrel for the first 
quarter of 2016. At the end of the quarter, the company was in over lift 
position of approximately 107,000 barrels more than our entitlement.
 
For the quarter, we generated a net loss of $59 million or $0.
15 per diluted 
share. Adjusting for the impact of one
-
time items that effect comparability 
and company generated a net loss of $15 million or $0.04 per diluted share 
for the quarter.
 
On the cost side, operating expense in the first quarter was $29 million 
or 
$15.50 per barrel sold versus $32 million or $16.90 per barrel sold in the 
first quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating cost during the first quarter 
was primarily related to a reduction in non
-
routine workover activity that 
occurred in 2015 which m
ore than offset the increase in operating cost 
related to our over lift position, the planned two
-
week shutdown and the 
FPSO turret bearing issue.
 
Exploration expense of $24 million for the quarter was largely related to our 
ongoing 3D seismic processing a
nd interpretation in the onboard Senegal 
area. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 included $84 million of unsuccessful 
well cost.
 
General and administrative costs for the quarter including non
-
cash equity 
based compensation came in at $18 million. The seque
ntial decrease 
compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was driven by decrease of equity 
based compensation and lower cash expenses.
 
First quarter DD&A was approximately $31 million or $16.49 per barrel 
compared to $37 million or $19.48 per barrel in the fir
st quarter of 2015. 
The decrease was based on a lower deflection rate in the quarter the result 
of an increased improved results associated with the Jubilee field in the 
fourth quarter of 2015.
 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was a 3% benefit. The e
ffective rate 
was impacted by lower oil prices, losses primarily related to exploration 
expenses incurred in jurisdictions in which we are not subject to taxes as 
well as losses in jurisdictions in which we have valuation allowances against 
our deferred ta
x assets and therefore do not realize any tax benefits.
 
At this time, I'd like to transition my comments to expectations for 2016. 
Second quarter production is forecast to be below expectations due to 
expected increase downtime associated with the implemen
tation of revised 
operating procedures for offloading and export from the Jubilee FPSO.
 
As a result, we currently anticipate having one lifting from Jubilee in the 
second quarter. Consistent with the Jubilee field operator, we expect to 
provide an 
update on our full year 2016 production guidance once the 
revised operating procedures for Jubilee have been fully implemented and 
the long
-
term solution for the turret issue has been selection. However, 
Kosmos does not expect this issue to have a signific
ant long
-
term financial 
impact due to continued production from the field and appropriate insurance 
coverages in place. If there is have prolonged impact of Jubilee production 
we will expect any loss of production income insurance proceeds to be 
reflected 
in the other income item on our income statement, when it is 
received.
 
On the cost side, at Jubilee, we expect operating expense will increase 
temporarily by $3 million to $4 million per month net to Kosmos due to the 
revised operating procedures. We ultim
ately expect our insurance coverage 
to reimburse these costs but the exact timing of reimbursement is not 
currently no. However, when the related insurance proceeds are received, 
they will be reflected as a reduction to our operating expense.
 
While first q
uarter G&A was significantly lower than our normal run rate, we 
still expect G&A cost for the year to be modestly lower than full year 2015. 
Therefore, going forward, we anticipate the quarterly G&A run rate in terms 
of combined cash G&A and equity based c
ompensation expense to be more 
in line with the fourth quarter of 2015.
 
And with that, that concludes my remarks. And operator, we'd like to open 
the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ed Westlake with 
Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.

Yes, good morning. I guess, quick question just on the phase in, I guess 
Mauritania as you 
look aboard Marsouin. I mean what gives you perhaps 
confidence but as you go further out may be oil potential
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Hi, good morning. I would pass over to Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Hey, good morning. I think there is a couple of things to know. I think o
ne 
is, as I mentioned in the prepared notes, the Albian major in source kitchen 
was being tested by the Teranga
-
1 well deliberately not just to test the 
prospect, trying the prospect, but to gain information on those source 
systems. And while we were drill
ing the wells, it was clear to us that those 
source systems are both present inboard, in the southern part 
-
 
in the 
northern part of Senegal, at least we also predict in the northern part of 
Mauritania too. And those have liquid potential, and indeed we ha
ve 
-
 
we 
covered liquids in the well from the Albian source rock below the 
[indiscernible].
 
So, we know that these source rocks are actually working inboard. And then 
from the temperature information that we've got, we are predicting that this 
deeper Apto
-
B
arremian source is potentially all mature in the outboard 
sector. So it's a 
-
 
the inherent charge model in our minds remains intact. 
What we've always known is, given that we're dealing with multiple oil and 
gas source rocks, the migration pathways are goi
ng to be key here. And 
we've always understood that it's going to be in the shallower reservoir 
target, it's going to be, how do this deeper gas charge inboard compete with 
the shallower oil source rocks where they all mature.
 
And then the Teranga trend or
 
at least the Teranga prospect, it looks like the 
Apto
-

point, but what we do know is that we have a lot of trapping geometries, a 
lot of trapping situations in different reservoir systems, b
ut in the inboard 
and outboard, which gives us the diversity of play and prospect time to fully 
test the oil charge model in this basin.
 
Edward Westlake
 
The separate question [indiscernible] related to Suriname, just surprised 
given the industry excitement
s that you were looking to farm down, I know 
there is always a view of risk mitigation ahead of any well, but it would seem 
that Block 42 would be quite perspective so just to maybe some color as to 
why you made that decision?

Yeah, Ed a couple of things. One of course HAS [ph] are actually in at least 
in the discovery.
 
Edward Westlake
 
Yeah.
 
Brian Maxted
 
And so, bringing in a partner who has got both familiarities with the play, 
where it's proven was obviously advantageous 
to us. We have a significant 
position in Suriname. And from a capital allocation standpoint, it made sense 
for us to dilute them to, what is still a very material position of about a third 
alongside Chevron and it has to be set within the context to some o
f the 
other opportunities that we got and both within the portfolio and within new 
ventures as we try to manage our work prevalent budgets, manage our 
balance sheet and allocate capital across the portfolio on all of the strategic 
opportunities that we see
 
out there. So it was 
-
 
it was portfolio drivers for as 
well as specific Block drivers.
 
Edward Westlake
 
But maybe to say in other word, it wasn't lack of confidence in the Block, it 
was the value that has to bring to the potential 
-
 
choosing the first targ
et on 
the [indiscernible].
 
Brian Maxted
 
No, the reason we were able to farm it out in the first place is because 
actually the Block from an interpretation standpoint, the Block is looking 
them more attractive than it's ever looked, which is always of an 
easier in 
hindsight when you have a discovery next door. It was that prospectivity 
that has so.
 
Edward Westlake
 
Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please 
proceed with your question.

Hi. Taking another tactic, I guess with the new discovery with Brian. I've got 
a question for you regarding geothermal graded, do you think inboard you're 
just going to be too hot, so you'll tend to be more guess prone and outboard 
and you had a g
reater potential for oil and then you mentioned that your 
seismic AVO work does not differentiate, do you ever think you'll get to the 
point where you could see oil versus gas.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, John. Great questions, I mean two things. We're obviously 
gaining a 
lot of regional thermal graded information as we drilled these wells and now 
we drill more [indiscernible] in Teranga 200 kilometers, 130 miles apart. And 
the hotter temperature grades inboard being slightly hotter is a good thing 
and a bad thing
, right? It's a good thing and that it makes the shallower 
source kitchens switched on over a wider area, which is kind of what we 
want. On the other hand, it varies the deeper source rock even deeper. But 
extrapolating away from the data points that we ha
ve which really quite 
consistent and point to relatively simple thermal model for the basin. It's fair 
to extrapolate outboard that we can expect to see given the debt for burial 
of the deeper source rock that it will move into an oil mature window in the 
outboard area and we are reasonably confident that will happen and of 
course we got a DSDP well which is further outboard of the well which 
outboard of our blocks, which gives us some [indiscernible] thermal grade 
across that the outboard area.
 
In terms of
 
your question about prediction of phase from AVO and related 
geophysical tools and of course it's the holy grail of exploration and as we 
get more and more calibrated I think there is a reasonable chance that we 
will be able ultimately differentiate. Obvi
ously, there is a number of drivers 
of the AVO and not just the AVO signature, not just phase and it's dealing 
with reservoirs quality and methodology in particular as that influences the 
different kind of AVO responses and trying to pull out the oil versu
s gas 
response and we haven't drilled enough wells at different depths different 
reservoirs qualities yet to be able to isolate geophysical responses to predict 
better oil and gas. But ultimately I think we will get there, we just haven't 
drilled enough we
lls yet and it's one of the points that we made in the notes, 
where only four exploration wells into a giant petroleum system. It's still 
very, very early days and 
-
 
but ultimately, I think it will have a better 
chance of doing that.
 
John Herrlin
 
Agreed. T
hanks. My next question is for Andy. You found a lot of gas, the 
street is very bearish on LNG and all that. How are you finding a 
conversation with companies that are willing to discuss LNG development?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think John you have to differentiate
 
sort of today from tomorrow. And I 
think the conversations we're having with the bigger companies. And I think 
they see this as differentiated resource given as I said in my remarks. It's 
the quality of the reservoir it's the productivity of the wells. So
 
it's not 
Deepwater gas, we needed to think about it being gas plus 130 kilometers 
from the shore. And therefore it can be below up with that Deepwater 
infrastructure. All of those I think things make it what we believe as a 
competitive source of gas. And 
of course it got legs, so it's a considerable 
resource here. So I think there is a conversation really as about how you get 
started, I think we'll get started with the smaller scale development.
 
We're looking at steams that are probably module at 2 million
 
tonnes per 
annum. And I think as you look at the market beyond 2020, we certainly 
believe there is the potential for that gas to seeking a good buyer as 
considerable churn in the contracts in Europe which are replace closely to 
Europe. And so it can't com
pete, but ultimately it is about the price point. If 
you can price it a point where it's competitive versus the US Gulf Coast, then 
it is an important resource of gas. And that's where we believe we are today, 
we done enough work to do that.
 
So going back 
to your question, what are the big companies looking at it, 
they see there is a large source of gas. They see that there is a source of 
gas that has a considerable life. And they see it is being competitive. I think 
the entry strategy to the market will be
 
small and then multiple trends to 
follow.
 
John Herrlin
 
Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Manish Kapadia with Tudor Pickering Holt. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Manish Kapadia
 
Hi. First question on the Teranga well. Just one ano
ther follow up on that. 
Can you say something in a bit more detail on the reservoir quality on 
Teranga. And what the implications in terms of at the area of the basin. And 
potentially going further outboard if there is the risk that at the reservoir 
qualit
y for the periods.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Can you get it Brian?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah. I mean 
-
 
if you will. The reservoir here was a fairly little bit deeper, 
few 100 meters deeper than below the mud lines than Tortue. So as 
expected, across this was slightly below To
rtue, but still in the 15% to 20% 
range with good permeabilities. So we still believe that these are commercial 
scale, highly productive reservoirs within the low Cenomanian. We never did 
have an Albian target here [indiscernible] show to you.
 
As you go ou
tboard, the overburden i.e. the thickness of Cenomanian 
between the seabed and at the top of the reservoir actually decreases. So 
reservoir quality what we don't expect to be a problem. And I'd be very 
surprised if with the fact that we see one of the reas
ons that we believe that 
one of the other reasons we believe is because the we know that from the 
drilling that we done today being calibrated in the AVO. The AVO only works 
where we got good quality reservoir and that is high carbon barring. It 
doesn't wo
rk where we don't have good quality reservoir or no reservoir. So 
in fact that we can see AVO supporting prospects in the outboard gives us 
confidence based on calibration that we not only have hydrocarbons 
outboard but we have decent quality reservoir as 
well. Does that answer 
your question?
 
Manish Kapadia
 
Yeah, thank you. Yes, that does. And then the question on the Guyana's 
region. Just wondering how come you haven't taken any acreage to
-
date in 
Guyana, does it seems like there is plenty of 
opportunities to get into blocks 
in Guyana in the fiscal terms also paid back to them in Suriname.
 
Just wondering why, the opportunities say for has been passed up and also 
in your own other acreage in Suriname. Just what you see with regards to 
Liza or yo
u've heard on Liza, where you're seeing on the other block and 
how that kind of ties into your desire to drill at the [indiscernible] prospect. 
Is it that are you seeing kind of better stuff elsewhere to be prioritize the 
drilling of that prospect. Thank y
ou.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah good questions. Look, I mean Suriname has been a focus area for us 
for several years well before the Liza discovery obviously. It was a play that 

in Block 42.
 


in these basin that the real sweet spots are focused in certain areas. We 
believe the Exon and their partners in Guyana
 
are focused on the right trend 
and we believe that at 42 and 45 blocks are focused on similar sweet spot 

seen anything that we believe and to the play diversity or the prospectivi
ty 

 
In Suriname block, what we like about our position is the 42 offers an 
extension of the proven Liza fairway and we have partial 3D over that block, 
which has defined substantial AVO supported potential in some similar 
features.
 

[indiscernible] play, which is different structural play, but nearly cretaceous 
play, it is also AVO supported and so we've got at least two play types to 
test in those two blocks, one of which have
 
got proven to the North.
 
So, we're actually very excited about our Suriname acreage, will there be 
opportunity to expand the position down the road? Probably. But as you 
know we're highly selective in our new venture process and we just haven't 
seen anyth
ing that competes with either of the blocks that we already have 
in in Surinam or other parts of our portfolio to want to go and pick them up.
 
Manish Kapadia

with Raymond James.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Versus potential looks like?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Go on, Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Well, I mean the first step as I mentioned just to M
anish at the moment ago, 
we have 3D seismic over Block 45 and we have partial 3D seismic over Block 
42 so the first task is to go in and acquire a new 3D over the rest of the 

what has
 
it coming into fund. And that will shoot in August timeframe. So 





us walking away from either of those two blocks without drilling them.
 
And I think [indiscernible] are similarly excited as similarly 
about 42 where 

from now into Liza discovery so it is billion barrel, if you want the number 

-

-
 
similar size 
commensurate with Liza.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 

months to go, but obviously elections in Ghana in November, is there any 
prospect in your mind of a change in fiscal policy 
depending how particularly 
the presidential election turns out?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah hi, Pavel. I'll take that one. Look, Ghana has a long tradition of a 
democratic process. I think their elections will proceed on that basis I think 

hat the outcome will be. What I am confident about is 


had success recently with NI and the NI discovery 
and that project moving 
forward. And they wanted to do more and I think they understand that fiscal 
stability is a key part of that particularly given the competition for capital 
now amongst the nations of the world as they put their exploration acreage 
ou
t to bid. So, I have had experience, no conversation that would suggest 
that they are intended to change the fiscal terms and I think almost the 
reverse several of the countries we are in today are examining their fiscal 
terms to ensure that they are compe
titive.

Our next question comes from Petr Grishchenko with Imperial Capital. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for 
taking my question. I guess on the cash flow side; I 
was wondering on the CapEx you guys iterated 650 million span for '16. But 
looking at Tullow Oil the operator obviously they are talking about the 
cutting CapEx targets. So how should we think about that
?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think Petr it depends on where you started. I think we had a good estimate 
when we started, it wasn't sort of padded. I think that we continue to spend 
absolutely in lined with our 650 forecast clear little more in the ratable basis 
in th
e first quarter, because we got our full exploration program in the first 
quarter and a full quarter of 10 capital spend, as we go into the second half 
we are clearly stacking the rig this quarter. The second quarter and then 
with the start of 10 in the th
ird quarter CapEx runs down. But what you'll 
see is a quarter
-
on
-
quarter reduction of capital our capital through the year 
650 remains a good estimate.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Got it and I probably missed that, but you talked about the exploration 
spending guidan
ce for '16?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
The exploration spending guidance...
 
Thomas Chambers
 
We gave is the last number we provided is basically $450 million to $250 
million of that in Mauritania & Senegal and then 200 on sort of other 
exploration which include sort of 
the rig expense.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Perfect. And the last if I may little bit on insurance side. How should we 
think about potential claims and hear that right you said you have insurance 
for 365 days working production post 60
-
day window at $65 per barrel.
 
Thomas Chambers
 
Yeah, 62 I think.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Is there any limit on volumes?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
The volume is set by the prior period. So we take time the volume from the 
-
 
how many days?
 
Thomas Chambers
 
180 days.
 
Andrew Inglis
 

 
Petr
 
Grishchenko
 
I guess what I'm trying to say and why wouldn't you just take the whole 365 
days to kind of working days and sort of collect the previous year.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Petr, I think what we need to do is look at what the right approach, I think 
the righ
t approach is absolutely we need to find a permanent solution for the 
problem, that's what the partnership is aimed to doing and clearly we need 
to do it in the way which causes least disruption to production both from an 
oil and the gas perspective and th
at's what we are trying to do. We describe 
to the insurance cover we have which is robust and what we need to do now 
as a partnership is with the regard to all stakeholders make sure that we are 
getting a permanent solution which is obviously the intent to
 
fix the problem 
for the long
-
term. But ensure we do it with the least disruption to both 
production and both oil and gas.

Our next question comes from Al 
Stanton with RBC capital market. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Good morning. Two questions if I may, a very quick one to start with and 
then slightly longer one. Just on that question about production. Do you 
believe with a shuttle tanker a
nd do you think you can get production back 
up to 100,000 barrels a day or do you think the shuttling back and forward 
is a potential bottleneck?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
It's early days we have walked for the 6 days into the startup. All I would 
say is that things a
re going well. I think we are ramping up towards that 
100,000 barrels a day and I think physically it's absolutely possible. I think 
the only thing that we don't yet know what the impact will be in, I think that 
could be some weather impacts. But I think a
bsolutely it is possible to get up 
to 100,000 barrels a day.
 
Al Stanton
 
Cool. Thank you. And then can we just touch on the plan for the gas in 
Senegal and Mauritania, you seem to have a fast track plan for 
commercialization, but at much slower more conside
red plan for the 
exploration and appraisal campaign. I was wondering how you marry them 
up while getting maximum value? How do you get somebody to pay for the 
exploration upside, if they coming in to develop a gas project?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Well, there are act
ually many commercial structures and you know one can 
just envisage a structure which does exactly what you say. So I think you 
know, the barrier is not the inability to bring those two things together. I 
think the importance for us is finding the right pa
rtner for the long
-
term. 
There actually has an alignment around an early development of the gas, 
but actually cost competitive development of that gas, while continuing to 
exploring the basin which as Brian has described today, we believe has both 
oil and 
gas potential.
 
We clearly have a world class gas field in Tortue, which we believe its 
market is cost competitive today. And there, we believe there is rate through 
early development of that. And I think we need to take the right pace to the 
overall explor
ation of the basin, which you consider the scale of it, we only 
have really four wells and actually have only tested three trends and that 
continues to be considerable potential. The partner that actually shared that 
long
-
term strategy, I think is absolute
ly to go and those are the 

 
Al Stanton
 
Right, okay. Thank you.

Hi, there. Yes, thanks for taking my question. So, two questions mainly just 
around Jubilee Insurance. So the first one just on your business interruption 
insurance. So, when should we expect to ge
t the all clear from your 
insurance company? Is that the four, after you, you hit the 60
-
day kind of 
threshold in early June and is the root cause analysis similar there to what 
you have to go through with Hull and Machinery insurance?
 
And then secondly ju
st given that some of your stay like and government 
may not have revenue insurance; how could that influence your timing 
approach to long
-
term solutions to find the FPSO? Thanks very much.
 
Andrew Inglis
 

nd then Tom will just talk 
to you around the time sequencing. Like you know, as I said to Petr, I think 
this is an engineering problem. There is an engineering solutions. What we 
need to do is find the right solution that insures we have a permanent fix of
 

variety of option that could actually do that.
 

best solution for all the stakeholders and clearly minim
izing the impact on oil 
and gas production is part of that. So I think, their first job is technical, we 
need to come up with the right technical solution that fixes the problem and 

conversations around the best route forward and it's too early to predict the 
way in which that will go. But, all that said, we have very robust insurance 
policies in place which cover all the eventuality. So, Tom in terms of the first 
question on the timi
ng.

Greetings and welcome to the Kosmos Energy First Quarter 2020 Earnings 
Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. A question
-
and
-
answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] 
As a 
reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Jamie Buckland, VP of 
Investor Relations. Thank you. Please begin.
 
Jamie Buckland
 
Thank you operator and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This 
morning, we 
issued our first quarter earnings release. This release and the 
slide presentation to accompany today's call are available on the Investors 
page of our website. Joining me on call today to go through that material are 
Andy Inglis, Chairman and CEO; and Nea
l Shah, CFO.
 
During today's presentation, we will make forward
-
looking statements that 
refer to our estimates, plans, and expectations. Actual results and outcomes 
could differ materially due to factors we noted in this presentation and in our 
U.K. and SEC
 
filings. Please refer to our annual report stock, exchange 
announcements, and SEC filings for more details. These documents are 
available on our website.
 
At this time I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks Jamie and good morning and afterno
on to everyone. As Jamie said, 
I'm joined on today's call by Neal, who officially steps into the role of CFO 
today. Given Neal's deep experience in Treasury, I could not have a better 
person by my side. I'd also like to thank Tom for his longstanding 
contr
ibution to Kosmos as CFO.
 
I'll start today's presentation with the highlights for the quarter and cover 
some of the key items which impacted the numbers in 1Q. Then I'll discuss 
our response to COVID
-
19, the steps we've taken to protect the business in 
202
0, our differentiated portfolio, and end on the work we're doing to 
position the business for the future.
 
Turning to slide two, entitlement production of 66,300 barrels of oil a day 
equivalent in the first quarter was at the upper end of our expected range
, 
driven by strong production in Ghana and the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Sales volumes were 43,700 barrels of oil a day equivalent impacted by cargo 
timing which resulted in Kosmos being in a material underlift position of 1.7 
million barrels oil equivalent at the e
nd of the quarter.
 
Overall, costs in the quarter were largely in line or below our original 
guidance. In response to the market volatility, we are lowering our total 
2020 costs by around 30% or $250 million. However, those savings do not 
flow through into 
our 1Q results. OpEx, DD&A, and G&A were in line with our 
original guidance for the quarter and all three are expected to reduce over 
the year as our cost
-
cutting initiatives take effect.
 
Exploration expense was slightly below expectations and is expected 
to 
significantly decrease as we pause our 2020 exploration activity. We've 
lowered our base business CapEx program by 40% this year but most of that 
is backend loaded as we are 
--
 
as we reduce our ongoing activity set. There 
were several exceptional items 
which skewed the first quarter numbers 
which I wanted to give some color on.
 
We took a noncash impairment charge as a result of current oil prices which 
largely relates to two fields in the Gulf of Mexico. And we also had a 
restructuring charge in 1Q as a 
result of the 25% reduction in headcount in 
March. Together these charges total approximately $170 million. Partly 
offsetting that negative adjustment was a positive market
-
to
-
market gain on 
our hedges during the quarter.
 
We also had a $72 million non
-
cash
 
deferred tax expense related to 
valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets and the market
-
to
-
market gains on our hedging portfolio.
 
So, in summary, a strong quarter operationally ending with a material 
underlift position and incorporating s
everal exceptional non
-
cash items.
 
Turning to slide three, I now want to focus on the coronavirus pandemic and 
the decisive actions the company is taking in response. COVID
-
19 has 
created unprecedented disruption across the world which has resulted in 
hist
orically low and volatile prices.
 
During this challenging period, the health and safety of our employees and 
contractors continues to be our primary concern, while ensuring the strength 
of our balance sheet is maintained. To
-
date none of our employees or 
p
roduction facilities have been directly affected and we continue to monitor 
the situation on a daily basis.
 
Despite the mitigation measures that have been imposed in large parts of 
the world, our employees remain committed to running the business safely 
an
d efficiently with the utmost professionalism in anticipation of the recovery 
ahead.
 
I'll talk in more detail about individual assets on the following slide, but our 
overall portfolio remains advantaged, characterized by conventional low
-
cost 
low
-
decline a
ssets that are well
-
suited to withstand the current lower price 
environment. As a result 2020 production guidance remains within our 
previous guidance range.
 
Early in the year when faced with changing market conditions, we took 
decisive action to maintain 
the balance sheet and protect cash flow through 
cutting costs by around 30%, $250 million in total and by restructuring our 
hedging program.
 
During the quarter in accordance with our normal banking requirements and 
against a challenging backdrop, we succes
sfully completed the 
redetermination of the reserve
-
based lending facility. We have no near
-
term 
debt maturities with the first RBL amortization payment not until the first 
half of 2022. With the liquidity available from our RBL, revolving credit 
facility 
and cash on hand, we are well positioned to withstand the current 
market volatility.
 
Lastly, we continue to position Kosmos for the future. It remains our 
intention to deliver self
-
funded gas business in Mauritania and Senegal and 
we continue to make progr
ess towards that goal. We also have a portfolio of 
high
-
quality prospects that we are preparing for 2021 both low cost, low 
breakeven, infrastructure
-
led prospects as well as high
-
quality basin
-
opening 
targets that we anticipate will be largely carried.
 
Tu
rning to Slide 4. Our assets have performed well so far this year as we 
continue to focus on safe and reliable operations. First quarter entitlement 
production was slightly ahead of forecast. For the full year we still expect 
production to be within our pr
evious guidance range, despite the impacts of 
COVID
-
19 lower prices and a significant reduction in capital expenditure.
 
Prior guidance of 14.5 net cargoes in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea remains 
unchanged, although due to the timing of liftings we only had 
sales of 1.5 
cargoes in 1Q. As discussed on the opening slide this impacted first quarter 
revenue and profit and resulted in a 1Q underlift of 1.7 million barrels.
 
In Ghana, the Jubilee and TEN fields are currently unaffected by COVID
-
19 
and we have been e
ncouraged by the operator's swift actions to protect our 
crew and facilities. These include amended crew scheduling, strict quarantine 
measures and testing for all workers going offshore.
 
Production at Jubilee and TEN was slightly ahead of expectations in 
the 
quarter with net production of around 26,000 barrels per day which includes 
the impact of the planned downtime at Jubilee for the gas handling upgrade. 
Following the successful completion of this work in February, we've seen 
consistent production over 
90,000 barrels per day.
 
The operator has also recently successfully increased water injection 
capacity from two pumps to around 180,000 barrels per day which provides 
the necessary pressure support for the reservoir, while providing some 
redundancy with a third pump as needed.
 
In addition we've seen a consistent gas offtake in the range of 90 million to 
100 million standard cubic feet per day at Jubilee which should help maintain 
higher oil production in the future.
 
On TEN, the field is cu
rrently producing over 50,000 barrels per day slightly 
ahead of the operator's guidance. The Ntomme
-
09 well has been drilled 
successfully and completion operations are now underway with the well 
scheduled to come online later this quarter. Full year net pr
oduction for 
Ghana remains in the range of 27,000 to 29,000 barrels per day which 
equates to prior guidance of 10 cargoes for the year.
 
In Equatorial Guinea, first quarter production was around 12,000 barrels per 
day which was in line with our expectations
. Operations at Ceiba and Okume 
are currently unaffected by COVID
-
19 and the operator has put in place 
strict operating procedures in line with those mentioned in Ghana.
 
That said, we are aware of the situation of the Exxon facility in Equatorial 
Guinea an
d the Ceiba/Okume operator has responded accordingly. There 
was a minor mechanical offloading issue late in the first quarter that affected 
one of the cargoes which was supposed to be loaded in late March. The issue 
was resolved within 48 hours and the lif
ting was completed in early April 
which resulted in 0.5 cargo moving from the first quarter to the second 
quarter.
 
Our full year production for EG remains unchanged at 11,000 to 13,000 
barrels per day which equates to prior guidance of 4.5 cargoes for the 
year. 
In the Gulf of Mexico production in the first quarter was 28,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day at the top end of our guidance. We have seen no COVID
-
19 cases so far on the production facilities for our fields.
 
As you're all aware so far this year
, we've seen an elevated level of price 
volatility which is causing a number of GoM producers to evaluate shutting in 
fields. Given our advantaged assets and low
-
cost model around 75% of our 
Gulf of Mexico production has a positive operating margin at $10 
per barrel 
HLS.
 
Due to the expectation of lower realized prices in May, the operator of the 
Delta House host platform which processes about half of our GoM production 
has decided to shut in their operated wells and accelerate planned 
maintenance. This incl
udes Kosmos' interest in Marmalard and Nearly 
headless Nick.
 
It also caused us to shut in the Odd Job field even though this field remains 
profitable at $10 per barrel HLS. We expect the Delta House shut
-
in to last 
the month of May. However, the timing wil
l depend on future market 
conditions. As a result of the May shut
-
ins, we expect 2Q net production in 
the Gulf of Mexico to be around 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower.
 
Fortunately, our Gulf of Mexico production is well set up for shut
-
ins and 
restart activity given the natural aquifer drive. Shutting in production 
pressurizes the reservoir. When the wells are opened up, it's common to see 
flush production as is often the case after hurricane shut
-
ins.
 
Elsewhere in the GoM drilling the Tornado w
aterflood well continues with the 
completion expected late in the year. Assuming the second quarter shut
-
ins 
last through May full year production guidance for Gulf of Mexico is now 
expected to be the bottom end of our 24,000 to 28,000 barrels of oil 
equiv
alent per day guidance range.
 
Turning to slide 5. I've talked about the importance of having a portfolio that 
is able to withstand volatile commodity prices. On this side, I'd like to focus 
on the specific characteristics that make the Kosmos portfolio res
ilient in a 
lower price environment.
 
First, conventional deepwater assets typically have low decline rates and low 
maintenance CapEx to keep production planned. Over the last seven years, 
Kosmos has had over 100% reserve replacement ratio across the portfo
lio 
demonstrating the quality of the underlying reservoirs. 2020 production is 
expected to be broadly in line with 2019 with minimal decline in 2021 all 
with relatively modest maintenance CapEx.
 
Second the assets have low costs and therefore low breakevens
. The top 
right chart on this slide from RSEG shows the half cycle breakeven costs for 
the most well
-
known shale basins versus the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and 
the Kosmos portfolio. The average half cycle breakeven for the shale basins 
is around $48 WTI co
mpared to $25 for the deepwater GoM.
 
Modeling Kosmos' infill wells in Ghana EG and the GoM using the same 
methodology we get a comparative half cycle breakeven of less than $25 per 
barrel WTI. The low Kosmos breakevens are largely due to well productivity 
existing infrastructure and low incremental development costs.
 
Third with a diverse production base, we have exposure to advantaged 
pricing with our Ghana and EG production priced off Brent and our GoM 
barrels priced off HLS. The structural advantage of Br
ent, which has traded 
at an average premium of $6 per barrel to WTI over the last three years, is 
its access to global markets.
 
In the GoM HLS has traded at a $4 per barrel premium to WTI on average 
over the last three years, due to proximity to Gulf Coast
 
refineries and not 
having the same infrastructure constraints as many onshore U.S. producers. 
There has been increased volatility in pricing here in 2Q. But on average HLS 
continues to trade at a healthy premium to WTI. We believe that these 
structural pr
icing advantages are unlikely to change in the foreseeable 
future.
 
And finally, while ESG is temporarily overshadowed by the oil price we still 
believe it is a fundamental importance for companies to have a portfolio, 
which is both low cost and low carbon.
 
We talked about this at our 4Q 
results in February and believe those companies that are best suited for the 
energy transition will outperform over time.
 
Moving now to slide 6, the balance sheet. Shortly after the COVID
-
19 
pandemic was announced Kosmos too
k decisive actions to protect the 
business. The financial actions can be split into two categories lowering our 
cash flow breakeven and maintaining liquidity. This slide focuses on cash 
flow. We took quick steps to reduce costs and ultimately protect the 
c
ompany's cash flow for the year.
 
As you can see from the chart on the right, we have reduced costs that is 
base business CapEx, OpEx and G&A by over 30% for the year or 
approximately $250 million. We also took the difficult decision to suspend 
the dividend
 
a total cash saving around $57 million in 2020. Combined these 
changes have reduced our cash breakeven to the low 30s including our 
hedges 

 
excluding our hedges and working capital. We believe it is a 
sustainable cost structure to cover all of our cash c
osts and maintain 
production. We do expect 2Q cash to be relatively weaker given the dramatic 
slowdown in activity across our portfolio and the resulting reduction in 
working capital.
 
We've also restructured our hedging portfolio to remove around 80% of pr
ice 
exposure across our three production hubs for the remainder of the year 
that is May to December. Given our current hedges were fully valued we 
converted them into fixed price swaps, which provided downside protection 
for the majority of our production 
all the way down to zero. At $25 Brent 
and $20 WTI, 2Q forward our hedges would generate over $200 million of 
proceeds this year, a $5 move in Brent results in only a $15 million change 
to free cash flow.
 
Turning to slide 7, which focuses on liquidity. As 
we announced in early April 
as part of our normal banking requirements, we successfully completed the 
redetermination of the reserve
-
based lending facility and have a borrowing 
capacity of around $1.5 billion with $100 million currently undrawn. We have 
no
 
near
-
term maturities and the first RBL amortization payment is not until 
March 2022. Our total liquidity at the beginning of the quarter was around 
$580 million post the RBL redetermination.
 
Turning to slide 8, which gives an update on Mauritania and Sene
gal. Phase 
1 of the Tortue project is now around one
-
third complete. As previously 
communicated, the LNG offtake SPA was signed in the first quarter, allowing 
Kosmos to book around 100 million barrels of 1P reserves.
 
Due to COVID
-
19, operations in Mauritan
ia and Senegal have been impacted 
by mitigation measures including border closures travel bans and social 
distancing restrictions. As a result, the concrete breakwater installation will 
now miss the 2020 summer weather window with the work expected to take
 
place during the same period in 2021. The Phase 1 project time line is, 
therefore, being delayed by approximately 12 months with first gas now 
expected in the first half of 2023. This delay has resulted in a significant 
reduction in activity and budgeted 
spend in 2020. The BP development carry 
is now expected to last through 2020 with remaining CapEx spread over 
2021, 2022 and 2023.
 
On the sell down, our objective remains to deliver self
-
funded gas business 
in Mauritania and Senegal and we've been able to 
make progress with 
several interested parties despite the challenging working conditions we find 
ourselves in. The process remains ongoing and we're currently progressing 
remote management presentations supported by virtual data rooms.
 
Turning to slide 9, 
the future. It's important during these challenging times 
not to lose sight of the future. When global energy demand returns to more 
normalized levels, Kosmos will be ready. We have a deep hopper of high
-
quality opportunities spread across our ILX and basi
n
-
opening portfolios and 
we continue to progress these through 2020 to be ready to drill in 2021.
 
For our ILX portfolio, we maintain the option to drill two to three wells from 
the prospects listed on the slide. As a reminder, these wells have low
-
cost 
and
 
attractive economics and we can be quick to react when market 
conditions improve. Our basin opening portfolio we have several attractive 
opportunities across some of the most prolific basins in the world.
 
As we prepare to drill these opportunities in 2021
, we're working to finalize 
this year the partnerships and working interests to allow us to drill these 
opportunities on a carried basis. We have completed that process in São 
Tomé with Shell and plan to advance Suriname and Namibia this summer.
 
That 
concludes today's presentation. So to summarize, we've taken quick 
decisive actions to protect our people and our assets. We remain focused on 
cash flow and liquidity and are taking the necessary steps to maintain our 
balance sheet in anticipation oil pric
e may continue to be volatile. And 
finally, we continue to progress the business to be ready when the sector 
does start to recover.
 
Thank you, and I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the 
session for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Ses
sion
 
Operator
 
Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of 
David Round of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.
 
David Round
 
Hi, Andy. Than
ks for the presentation. The useful chart on decline rates and 
maintenance CapEx. So could you just elaborate as to the type of activity 
this would envisage for Ghana in 2021? And given the lower CapEx world 
we're now living in, how are you thinking about 
the medium
-
term production 
profile from both Jubilee and TEN in Ghana?
 
And second one just 
--
 
it's just a quick admin one actually. There was a 
stock exchange listing requirement announced a few weeks back. Are you 
still considering steps to move away from
 
the $1 cutoff? Or are you 
comfortable with where you stand at the moment?
 
Andy Inglis
 
All right. Thanks David. Let me 
--
 
I'll talk about the portfolio first and then 
just come back to the admin question. Yes. I think, the chart on slide 5, I 
think demonst
rates, I think an important characteristic of our portfolio. 
Jubilee TEN world
-
class reservoirs. As I said in my remarks, seven years 
100% reserve replacement. We actually have significant well stock in 
Jubilee. And the operators made a lot of progress in 
the first quarter to 
optimize the production delivery from that well stock. And as you heard me 
describe in the past, it's all about ensuring that we're getting the right water 
injection. And an important step in the first quarter was to enable us to get 
1
80,000 barrels of water a day away from just two pumps. We now have a 
third pump on standby which means that we have greater reliability.
 
And then, we're now working very closely with the Ghana government to 
ensure that we're getting the gas offtake. And a
gain, as I said in my 
remarks, we're getting 90 million to 100 million standard cubic feet a day 
away, which again is helping the performance. So ultimately, they require a 
limited number of additional wells. And in 2021, we would envisage a 
continuing wel
l program in Ghana. There could be an additional producer or 
an injector in Jubilee.
 
But actually, I think the greatest benefit we'll see will be from the 
optimization of the reservoir from an injection and gas offtake. And then, we 
will see continued dril
ling on Enyenra. We've got the Ntomme
-
09 well to 
complete. And again, Ntomme has produced actually very well through the 
first quarter, well ahead of the operator's initial guidance. And we would 
expect with Ntomme
-
09 coming on to see some additional impro
vement.
 
So, I think, it is a real characteristic of conventional assets that they require 
less maintenance CapEx. And ultimately, you're seeing that from the Kosmos 
portfolio whereby we're 
--
 
in 2020, we're going to be cash flow breakeven in 
the low 30s. A
nd actually, we can sustain that sub
-
$35 into 2021. So, these 
aren't just one
-
off interventions that cause damage. They're actually 
sustainable interventions because of the nature of the reservoirs. So, I think 
that sort of covers your question around the 
portfolio.
 
Just on terms of admin, clearly, we're ahead of the $1 requirement over the 
last sort of 30 days, I think which ends at the end of May. So 
--
 
and then 
we'll take a decision. I think it is an administrative point, whether or not we 
do a reverse s
plit, but clearly the stock price is making progress and we're 
ahead of the $1 criteria as we stand at the moment and we would continue 
that progress through May.
 
David Round
 

 
Andy Inglis
 
All right. Thanks
 
Operator
 
Our next
 
questions come from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One 
Securities. Please proceed with your questions.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Hey good morning Neal and Andy. Could you speak on current drilling cost 
trends with this downturn, Andy? Do you see costs to dril
l the deepwater 
exploration wells next year say in Suriname, could you compare that to say 
what it would cost in say the second half of 2019?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Great question Richard. I think, we are 
--
 
we clearly are seeing an 
industry today where they're 
probably as we look to 2021, there will be high 
availability of rigs. And I suspect, there will be the opportunity to probably 
do better than your benchmark at the second half of 2019. Just need to 
remember that 2019 wasn't all that high. So, now there com
es a point when 
you're getting very close to the 
--
 
ultimately the sort of cash breakeven for 
the drilling contractors.
 
So, I think we'll see 
--
 
I'm sure there is a potential for some cost savings 
sort of year
-
on
-
year. But I'm not sure that it's going to b
e dramatic. 
Ultimately, the saving that we can make is by having the right well design 
and drilling efficiently. So, I think there will be some benefit Richard, but we 
know there comes a point where the industry cannot lower its cost base 
simply from the s
upply chain. It actually has to create lower cost either by 
advantaged assets and by more efficient development processes.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thank you for that. And just as a follow
-
up, a bit on the housekeeping side. 
Were there any shut
-
ins in the Gulf of Me
xico in April? And what the oil mix 
or the oil component of the 7,000 a day for the second quarter? What would 
that oil component be? And that's all for me. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. No, Richard. Yes, just as a housekeeping there were no shut
-
ins in 
April. And the oil mix is about 80%.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next questions come from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. 
Please proceed with your questions.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Thank you guys for the time this morning.
 
The first question is around 
Tortue. Recognizing it must be very difficult to execute any process in the 
coronavirus world, but just any thoughts on your ability to ultimately 
monetize the asset, thoughts around time line and then the value of the 
resourc
e?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. No, interesting, Neil. We've continued to make really good progress. I 
think, in general, I've been surprised at how well the company has 
functioned with remote working and actually how well the connections have 
been with our partners. 
We have sort of consistent VC platforms now. And 
so, we're enabling to continue with virtual management presentations and 
virtual data rooms.
 
So, actually, the point that I made I think at our 1Q 
--
 
at our 4Q 
commentary was, we've obviously updated the vir
tual data room with all the 
new data on Orca, the appraisal on Tortue and the Yakaar
-
Teranga. And so, 
we now have a fully populated data room and we have the ability to continue 
to work with potential farminees.
 
All that said, is it more difficult? Is the 
business environment more difficult? 
Yes, it is. But the point I'd make about Tortue is that, it is a distinctive 
greenfield project in a world where companies are thinking long term. It has 
a breakeven FOB price of less than $5. Why? Because it has a very
 
low cost 
of gas supply, very productive, wells over 200 million standard cubic feet a 
day and an innovative low
-
cost midstream solution.
 
So it is low cost gas and I think that's absolutely critical for us to gain 
interest. And it has to be coming on in a 
world where people perceive the 
demand is there. And with a start
-
up for the first phase in 2023 and then 
FID of Phases 2 and 3, not until sort of post 2023 with gas coming on in the 
back end of the decade I think it's perfectly timed.
 
So from a strategic 
perspective, I think, it remains relevant. And ultimately 
in terms of price expectations, our view is to ensure that we've got a self
-
funded business. And 
--
 
so that we protect the balance sheet and we can 
adjust the equity that we sell then to achieve tha
t outcome. So, I think, with 
those variables in play, I think, we continue to make good progress.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Thank you. And the follow
-
up, I appreciate the slide six and seven. That's 
very helpful around maintaining the balance sheet. But Andy and Neal, ju
st 
if you could flesh it out in more detail the way the equity has been trading 
and even the way that credit has traded until recently, would suggest that 
there's distress in the business.
 
Obviously, what you're describing today is a scenario where you can
 
make 
your way through the down cycle to participate in the upside. So from where 
you guys sit, as the leadership of the firm, can you talk about what gives 
you confidence about your ability to navigate the down cycle with some 
more detail?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes
. I'll make a couple of comments and pass it over to Neal. I think 
--
 
as 
you said, I think, slide six and seven are important. Yes? The first point, we 
entered the down cycle with significant liquidity $580 million. And I think a 
point that I'd like to add
 
actually is that, we don't have any debt on our Gulf 
of Mexico assets. So that if required if necessary, we have an additional 
source of liquidity there. So liquidity is strong.
 
And the second characteristic is the low price for the cash flow breakeven. 
S
o sort of 2Q forward and actually into 2021, cash flow breakeven is in the 
low 30s. And that's without the hedges, without working capital. So it's a 
very conservative view of the world. And I think, that's the point that I 
wanted to communicate with those
 
two slides is ultimately and the strength 
of the cash flow breakeven. And we're ultimately in a world where we're 
close to that world today. And ahead of this, we took steps to restructure the 
hedges which gives us in the event that the world turns agains
t us we have 
protection on Brent from $43 down, HLS from $30 down. So those are the 
bits that actually make up the picture and that's the story that we're trying 
to tell on pages 6 and 7.
 
Neal Shah
 
Yes. I think 
--
 
the only thing I would add Neil is, we hav
e good visibility on 
the production given our asset base. As Andy mentioned, we're well hedged 
for the remainder of this year with fixed protection all the way down. So we 
know what's coming into the business. We've taken the steps to reduce the 
cost, whic
h will get us to a very low
-
cost basis in the last half of the year.
 
And then we have plenty of liquidity through the RBL and the RCF. And then 
obviously the access to our unlevered sources in terms of the GoM and 
Mauritania, Senegal as well as the asset s
ales that we're working through.
 
So I think 
--
 
so if you put that sort of picture together, we feel good about 
sort of the cash flow generation of the business. And ultimately, the levers 
we can pull around the liquidity side if we choose to. So 
--
 
we do h
ave a lot 
of flexibility and that gives us ultimate comfort around pushing the business 
forward. Thanks, Neal.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Great. Thanks, Neal.
 
Operator
 
Our next questions come from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond 
James. Please proceed with your 
question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for taking the question. Back in February, happier times, I suppose 
you made the point that as part of the ESG strategy, you will not be doing 
oil
-
focused exploration going forward if I remember correctly. And I think for 
2
021 you have plans to explore in Namibia, São Tomé and Suriname all of 
which are oil basins. How should we kind of reconcile those two?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. What I said Pavel was that we weren't going to access new frontier 
positions yes? And I did say actuall
y in February that we were going to drill 
out our existing advantaged portfolios.
 
Why? The issue with taking on a new frontier basin today is the cycle time to 
get it to be drill ready. So you start accessing a new portfolio position at the 
beginning of th
is decade. You then have the time to conclude a deal. You 
then have the time to shoot seismic. You then have the time to get to drill
-
ready prospects it can be three, four, five years. Then you have the cycle 
time through appraisal to development, yes?
 
You
 
start looking at that. And it's not only a draw on capital from the 
business, but you're entering a period where I believe you could see 
continuing demand destruction. So we were clear though Pavel where you've 
accessed the acreage, you've shot the seismi
c, you process the seismic, 
you've built the partnerships and you have drill
-
ready prospects to go we're 
absolutely going to drill them, because you can bring those online if you're 
successful within a much shorter time line.
 
So I see what we're doing in S
uriname ,Namibia, São Tomé to be absolutely 
in line with that. And then we've got the ILX portfolio in the Gulf of Mexico, 
which has an even shorter sort of time to market. So that's the point that 
--
 
and that's how we're going to create value for sharehol
ders is by ensuring 
that whatever we do we've got the ability to seek a payback from the project 
in a short time line.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. Let me follow
-
up with a question about Ghana. Of all the kind of non
-
U.S. geographies you have assets in, I believe
 
Ghana is the only one that 
had a full
-
fledged lockdown. And I'm curious if there was any impact on your 
workforce or just kind of the business in terms of people being able to 
physically get the work and do what they're supposed to?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. You're
 
right, Pavel. That was a full lockdown in Accra for I think three 
weeks. It's now been lifted but it was a full lockdown for three weeks. The 
answer was no. There wasn't any impact to the 
--
 
and it was in Accra itself. 
It wasn't actually outside of Accra.
 
So it didn't affect the operations base. It didn't affect the ability to get our 
crews in and out. So as I said in my remarks, the operator has done a really 
good job to ensure that we're not only managing to move people, but 
--
 
and 
there are some special
ly chartered flights to do that. But actually the 
quarantine as well sort of two weeks of quarantine before they go offshore 
means you're absolutely safe in terms of managing the potential of 
coronavirus getting offshore.
 
So now it's actually a positive co
nstructive story of actually not only the 
country doing what it needed to do, but actually ensuring that there was no 
contamination as it were by foreign visitors coming into the country that 
weren't being properly quarantined.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Good to you 
hear. Thank you very much.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Sure. All right.
 
Operator
 
Our next questions come from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein 
Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Hi. Thank you. I'd like to talk a little about the sell
-
down proce
ss for 
Mauritania and Senegal. What I'm trying to get at is I realize that the 
objective function is a self
-
funded development that is minimal capital out of 
Kosmos' pocket upfront. And the way the first phase transaction was 
handled it was a drilling carr
y, would you be amenable to a royalty structure 
something that guarantees a revenue stream in the out years but you're 
effectively just a royalty owner on the structure? And would the 
counterparties be amenable to a structure like that?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. An
d see Bob. I think we are exploring all options. But I think that the 
problem with the royalty structure would be 

 
is that you still got to actually 
put the capital in to deliver that outcome. So our preference is to ensure 
that we build it truly self
-
fun
ded, which means that you wouldn't naturally 
gravitate to that as a singular mechanism.
 
It could be a mix but not as a singular mechanism. You could retain some 
upside from a royalty structure. But clearly it doesn't deliver the outcome 
that we're targetin
g which is self
-
funded.
 
Bob Brackett
 
The follow
-
up to that would be, can you talk about the timing how the 
conversations are evolving with the counterparties? And are there any clocks 
ticking in terms of relinquishing acreage under the PSA or having to mov
e 
toward a final investment decision that keep you wanting to move this more 
quickly?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. I think the good news is that we've sort of captured the acreage from a 

 
through the development plans that have been submitted. So we're not 
under 
any clock from the government in terms of having to continue with 
activity to maintain the discovered resource.
 
So there are no clocks ticking from that perspective. So the answer is we 
continue to be in 

 
when I genuinely in good conversations with prospe
ctive 
buyers. And ultimately it sort of comes down to, as I answered in the prior 
question, you have something which has scale, you have something that 
actually has low cost, you have something that actually has a production 
build which matches the market.
 
So your second question about are you 

 
are we under any threat from an FID for Phases two and three at the 
moment? No. They will come post 2023 when we've got Phase 1 onstream.
 
And what's interesting about Phase 1 is there's actually a significant 
invest
ment in the infrastructure for Phases 2 and 3. To get the first gas on 
Phase 1 it's about $4 billion
-
ish. Of that, $2 billion is on the breakwater and 
the FPSO. So over 50% of the money that's going into the first phase is 
actually there as pre
-
investment 
of Phases 2 and 3. All of that means is that 
subsequent phases that follow are very economic. And the timing is not in 
front of the current buyer. So those are attributes which make this quite a 
distinctive project.
 
Bob Brackett

Our next question comes from the line of James Hosie of Barclays. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
James Hosie
 
Hi, Andy, Neal. Thanks for your time. Can I ask you about your final slide on 
preparing for the 
future? I mean at this stage how likely are you to resume 
exploration drilling in 2021 both in the Gulf and elsewhere? Are there any 
particular sort of conditions you need to attach to when you could start? And 
also when does restarting exploration, where 
does that rank, the capital 
allocation priority versus resuming the dividend?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. No great questions James. So if you sort of circle back. As we look at 
2021, you can maintain the business minimal decline in a sort of sub $35 
Brent world, yes?
 
So first priority is to ensure that we maintain the balance 
sheet. So as we start to think about expenditure beyond that maintenance 
CapEx, we have to I think to be confident that we can see a trajectory to 
gearing getting sort of comfortably below two. Y
es?
 
So I think if you can see a world where the trajectory gets you to that place 
then I think you can legitimately get into a debate about incremental spend. 
Yes? And I think it's incremental spend in high
-
quality opportunities and I 
think it has to be a 
few.
 
I think our objective in the frontier program is to look to ways in which we 
can get that expenditure in 2021 carried. And we're going through actually a 
very good process at the moment in terms of getting to the right equities to 
enable us to do that
.
 
And then it's a question of having the flexibility in the Gulf of Mexico 
depending on the equity level the timing you can slop the wells in. So that's 
really where we see the priority. So the big point and I think it's an 
important question you've asked 
is, first thing what's your objective is 
strengthen balance sheet.
 
Yes? When we believe we're in a place where we're comfortably below 2 and 
on a trajectory to do that, then you can start to think about alternative 
forms of capital allocation and where wou
ld you put your own dollar as 
opposed to somebody having an opportunity to get a carry. We've already 
got carry on the same at São Tomé well from Shell in 
--
 
for drilling in 2021. 
And the objective is to find equivalent mechanisms for Namibia and 
Suriname.
 
Okay?
 
James Hosie
 
And versus dividend resumption?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I think it's 
--
 
again I think for the dividend resumption we've got to 
genuinely get the balance sheet back in the right place. So I think from a 
shareholder perspective, the first thing they w
ant to see is dividend back in 
the right place. And then, I think you're in a debate of an incremental well in 
the GoM versus the dividend. Yes?
 
But we're not in that place today. And I do think you have to get back to a 
position where you know that that d
ividend is sustainable. Yes. So 
--
 
and 
we're not in that position today. So I think that that's a debate to come. And 
we are going to ensure though that we're 
--
 
we have the opportunity set 
ready to move forward. Yes? But it has to be with the balance shee
t that's fit 
and healthy.
 
James Hosie
 
Okay. Thank you.

Our next questions come from the line of Al Stanton of RBC. Please proceed 
with your question
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes, good evening guys. I had two questions if I 
may. I think you've covered 
most of the ground. First of all on Tortue Phases, that 2 and 3 you've left me 
with the impression that they are very much in series rather than in parallel 
and there'll be no spending on Phase 2 ahead of first gas in Phase 1. S
o we 
should time them that way?
 
And then the second question is on exploration. I'm curious whether you just 
want to reduce your expenditure or whether you would rather diversify a 
little bit and you would consider swapping out of acreage in Namibia with 
s
ome of your neighbors and whether perhaps there's a clock ticking whether 
you have a view on whether you've got to do your farm
-
out before or after 
the Venus well in Namibia.
 
Andy Inglis
 
All right, Al. Yes. I think you answered the first question yourself,
 
I think and 
your answer was very good. So I agree with everything you said on the 
phasing on Tortue which is ultimately that Phase 2 will follow Phase 1, when 
Phase 1 is up and running. Yes. So you're absolutely accurate. Yes.
 
On the exploration portfolio
, I think Namibia is very interesting. That's what 
I would say and I think there's a lot of actual 
--
 
and there's a lot of industry 
interest in it. As you point out there is the Venus well. The Venus well is 
cretaceous, but it's outboard of where we are an
d we see it as an 
independent test.
 
And it's got a different charge. So fundamentally we don't 
--
 
we see it as 
something which is 
--
 
will be interesting, but is not a 
--
 
where there is an 
exploration dependency between the objectives we have for the cretac
eous 
objectives in PEL 39 which are up
-
dip of the Venus well.
 
So there's no sort of clock ticking to get that done. I'm not 
--
 
given the 
current circumstances, I'm not absolutely sure what 
--
 
even what the timing 
is of the Venus well. But there's no linkag
e on that. And no, we don't sort of 
see it about being a swap. We actually like the acreage we have in Namibia 
and want to participate.
 
Al Stanton
 
Fair enough. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, all right. Thanks Al.

Our next questions come from the line
 
of James Carmichael of Berenberg. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
James Carmichael
 
Hi. Just a quick one on the operating cost savings. Obviously not much of 
that came through during Q1. So just interested to understand, I think that 
implies a roughly s
ort of 20% cost reduction on a unit basis for the rest of 
the year. So just interested to get maybe a bit more color on where those 
savings are coming from. And also to understand how sustainable they are 
whether we should expect them to start creeping bac
k up as activity comes 
back into the portfolio?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. No I think 
--
 
good job absolutely. You're dead right on the phasing of it. 
And the issue is around 
--
 
I think there were two elements that are going on 
which 
--
 
there's a piece of it which is
 
fundamentally sustainable. And so it is 
about restructuring contracts. It is about actually using the challenge that 
we have today to change the way we're doing business in both Ghana and 
Equatorial Guinea. So 
--
 
and they're in different places if you thi
nk about it. 
In Equatorial Guinea we've had the assets now...
 
Neal Shah
 
2.5 years.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
2.5 years yes. So the objective at the beginning takeover from Hess put in 
place the management systems start to unlock the resource that we have 
there through
 
the ESPs et cetera. And so it's been a process of getting our 
arms around it. And actually as it were defining what the upside is. And the 
team with Trident as the operator there they've done a really good job in 
doing that. We're now into sort of the nex
t phase, which is about the 
optimization of that. So we've got a much better understanding of which 
ESPs work. So actually, part of the 
--
 
the ESPs are actually our operating 
expense yes. So as you start to think about now sustaining that forward you 
do it
 
by picking the best locations that you're now are going to work. And 
therefore you have higher success rate. So that is sustainable. Yes. And I 
think in Ghana, it's about changing the way that we work. Some of it is 
about high
-
grading activity, which is t
he impact in 2020. What will sustain 
this into 2020 and beyond will be a fundamental change in some of the work 
practices there.
 
So I think overall, I think it's a mix of both. There have been some things 
where yes you have deferred activity to create the 
cost savings in 2020. But 
they are going to be sustained in 2021 by items which will not appear in 
2020 because they're longer term because they're required to change the 
way that you're doing business. So I don't think this is a fundamental sort of 
just a
 
one
-
off. And if you look at our G&A, cash G&A of course we obtained 
25% reduction in headcount. So you start to think of the G&A saving that 
that obviously rolls through 2020 and into 2021. And we are finding a lot 
more efficient ways to run the business 
today a lot more efficient.
 
So I'm 
--
 
it's a great question. It's one that we've been asking ourselves. As 
we look 
--
 
we'll be doing a lot of work on 2021 in terms of what we think the 
sustainable breakeven is. And we remain of a view that it is sub
-
$35 wi
th a 
minimal reduction to the 
--
 
to production. So it is interesting I think that this 
is an opportunity I think for us to continue to drive efficiency into the 
business. And I think we're using it not as just as a one
-
off, but actually as a 
sustainable ch
ange. And the best evidence of that is how Kosmos is working 
today. It's working remotely a lot cheaper and actually with 25% less people 
and actually doing exactly the same activity set if not more.
 
James Carmichael
 
Okay. Thanks a lot.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Okay.
 
Thanks, James. Appreciate it.

Welcome to the Kosmos Energy's third quarter 2012 earnings conference 
call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, let me turn the call over to Brad 
Whitmarsh, VP of Investor Relations at Kosmos Energy.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
Thanks, operator and 
thanks to all of you for joining us today. This morning, 
we issued our third quarter earnings release, which is currently accessible on 
the Investor's page of the kosmosenergy.com website.
 
Later today, we anticipate filing our third quarter 10
-
Q with the S
EC, which 
will be available on our website at that time. Joining me on the call today 
with our prepared comments are Brian Maxted, CEO; Greg Dunlevy, 
Executive Vice President and CFO; and Darrell McKenna, our Chief Operating 
Officer.
 
Following brief commen
ts today, we will have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Consistent with prior calls, I'd ask the participants to keep your 
questions to one primary and one follow
-
up. This will ensure that we get to 
all who are on the call today. If they are questions that w
e're unable to get 
to within a one hour timeframe, please feel free to call me later in the day.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks a
ssociated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings. You may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. We believe such measures are 
important in looking at the company's his
torical and future performance and 
these are commonly referred to metrics in the industry. These measures are 
provided in addition to and should be read in conjunction with the 
information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance 
with G
AAP and included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I want to turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks Brad. I'd like to take a few moments this morning to comment on a 
number of our recent successes, highlights in the great progress we've made 
in a
ll areas of our business. Throughout, I will stress on how we strategically 
positioned Kosmos for the future before handing over to Greg for financial 
review and Darrell for an update of operations.
 
Starting in the Tweneboa basin petroleum system offshore 
Ghana, we have 
focused on delivering maximum value through our diversified set of assets, 
which includes existing growing and long
-
term production plateau at Jubilee, 
upcoming development projects, as well as near term exploration upside.
 
At Jubilee, we ha
ve continued to see a high level of performance at the field, 
with strong and consistent production levels over the last several months, 
following implementation of the well productivity solution.
 
Production exited the third quarter at over 85,000 barrels 
of oil per day 
gross, our successful asset stimulation program, while we have treated five 
of the nine production wells supported high levels of production from the 
field resulted in two crude oil lifting's for Kosmos in the third quarter.
 
To accelerate re
aching plateau production, we have prioritized Phase 1 
activity, with completion operations underway. Two new Phase 1A 
production wells are anticipated to be online by the end of the year, 
launching us into 2013 with field production at its highest level e
ver.
 
On the development front, we anticipate submitting the PoD for the TEN 
developments to the Ministry of Energy by the end of the year. This will be a 
second high volume FPSO based development for our company and indeed 
the country of Ghana, providing t
he next significant step up in production 
and cash flow growth for Kosmos beyond Jubilee.
 
In addition to the ongoing production and development operations, our 2012 
expiration campaign in Ghana provide significant opportunity to expand our 
inventory of dis
covered resources.
 
Early in the third quarter, we announced an expiration success at Wawa oil 
and gas condensate discovery, immediately a bit off, but separate from 
Enyenra, in a previously undrilled portion of the Deepwater Tano Block.
 
This was the first 
of three important expiration wells for Kosmos in Ghana 
this year; the second is Okure, which is the largest of the three prospects 
with multiple hundred million barrel equivalent potential. The well is 
currently drilling. We should have results by the end
 
on the month. Okure, 
will then we followed by the drilling of the Sapele prospect, a 75 million 
barrel equivalent target down at the Jubilee and Mahogany.
 
Results of Sapele are expected in early next year. For Kosmos, the value of 
proposition in Ghana is 
the example of what we are intent on replicating 
throughout our global exploration portfolio in places such as Morocco, 
Mauritania and across the Atlantic in Suriname.
 
Our exploration strategy is simple, build a world
-
class exploration portfolio, 
focused o
n high value, high volume petroleum systems and deliver major 
discoveries for Kosmos into the places where we operate.
 
The first of these opportunities is onshore Cameroon with the Sipo prospect 
on the Ndian River Block. Sipo is a 150 million barrel equiva
lent tertiary age 
prospect with multiple look
-
alike structures in the block derisked in the case 
of success. The rig and heavy lift helicopter are in country. Transport of the 
rig to the drilling location and assembly should begin shortly with a planned 
De
cember spud and results expected 45 to 60 days later. We continue to 
negotiate with the number of companies to form out a portion of this 
position.
 
Turning to Morocco, we have completed the acquisition of additional interest 
in the Foum Assaka Block raisin
g our interest by 18.75% to 56.25%. We 
also announced in this morning's earnings release that we have execution in 
agreement to acquire an additional interest in the Essaouira Block, when 
completed following the acquired government approvals, our interests
 
in the 
block will double to 75%.
 
Both of these transactions strengthen our position in the offshore Agadir 
Basin, an area where we have seen significant recent industry activity. We 
continue to process the 3D seismic data that we acquired in late 2011 and
 
early 2012. And we're extremely excited about the prospectively of our 
blocks. Timings of potential first drilling offshore Morocco, remains as early 
as late 2013.
 
Across the Atlantic in Suriname, another area where we have seen a 
significant amount of in
dustry activity recently, we have completed our 3D 
seismic shoot, acquiring over 3,800 square kilometers of data covering 
portions of our deepwater Blocks 42 and 45.
 
Our teams in cooperation with Staatsolie, Suriname's national oil company, 
executed this p
rogram very efficiently, following preparation approval of the 
environmental assessment, seismic operations begun in August and were 
completed in early October. We anticipate receiving the fast
-
track dates in 
the early part of next year, with 2014, as a dr
illing target.
 
In offshore Mauritania, we're focused on finalizing plans for 2D and 3D 
seismic program. They are target to begin the acquisition in the very early 
part of 2013. In addition, our new venture efforts continue, as we further 
expand our portfol
io to provide significant exposure for future exploration 
success and several opportunities are in the pipeline.
 
I am very excited about where we are today as a company, but more 
importantly where we're headed in the near and longer term. Strong and 
growin
g cash flow from Jubilee, combined with our existing liquidity, puts us 
in an enviable position of being financially self
-
sufficient. It's allows us to 
fully fund all of our future activities in the Tano Basin offshore Ghana, as 
well as the company's poten
tial game changing exploration drilling campaign 
elsewhere. We are in a great position to create substantial value for our 
shareholders going forward. Greg?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. In my prepared comments this 
morning, I will provide a brief review of our financial results for the third 
quarter before giving an update on our outlook for the rest of the year.
 
On our oil revenues were $222 million on the sale of two cargoes in the third 
quarter. Previously, we had
 
forecasted, as most likely, only one lifting for the 
period. However, improved production levels at Jubilee as well as some 
slight scheduling changes accelerated the lifting from the early part of 
October into the latter part of September.
 
Our annual guid
ance for lifting's is unchanged as we still anticipate six 
lifting's for the full year with our fifth cargo sold in the latter part of October, 
and our sixth planned in December. On the cost side, the impact of having 
two cargos in the quarter is seen in o
ur production expense, depletion, and 
income tax line items.
 
As mentioned in our second quarter call, we anticipate higher production 
costs resulting from acid stimulation expenses in the period. The third 
quarter amount includes costs associated with the 
last three acid 
treatments, two of which include detailed diagnostic and multiple production 
logging procedures, which were more expensive than a basic treatment, 
while cost savings procedures were critical in identifying the most effective 
solution and re
fining the treatments to enhance well productivity. Excluding 
these amounts, production expense for the third quarter was consistent with 
our expectations and recent quarters at under $9 per barrel sold.
 
Exploration expense for the quarter was $37 million,
 
a large portion of which 
was associated with our substantial 3D seismic acquisition program offshore 
Suriname. As required, we've expensed 100% of the cost of the 3D program 
to
-
date and we'll continue to do so until our 50% farm
-
out to Chevron is 
closed. 
We anticipate government approval and finalization of the agreement 
by the end of this year.
 
Derivative expense for the quarter was $25 million. And mark
-
to
-
market 
charge, reflecting the impact of strength in Brent prices at the end of the 
third quarter. $
5 million of this amount relates to derivative instruments, 
which settled in the third quarter with the remainder representing the 
change in valuation of future derivative positions.
 
With increasing confidence in our cash flows, we elected to repay $110 
mi
llion under our credit facility, ending the quarter with $400 million of cash. 
Subsequent to quarter
-
end, the borrowing based on our credit facility was 
adjusted to up $180 million to $1.34 billion, resulting from a combination of 
factors including our enh
anced production outlook and increased hedging.
 
Our available liquidity at the end of October was comprised of approximately 
$500 million in cash on hand and $340 million available under the revolver. 
Capital expenditures for the third quarter were approxi
mately $120 million, 
bringing the total year
-
to
-
date to $340 million.
 
Our outlook for the remainder of the year still has CapEx in the range of 
$500 million or somewhat below that with expenditures in the fourth quarter 
driven by Phase 1 development in Jub
ilee, exploration activity in Ghana, 
Cameroon and elsewhere.
 
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, I would anticipate it to be fairly 
consistent with the third quarter in terms of revenues and expenses with a 
couple of exceptions.
 
As I mentioned earlier, 
we anticipate two lifting's in the fourth quarter. 
Production expense should be less than the third quarter as a result of lower 
anticipated work over activity. Exploration expense excluding any potential 
well costs is anticipated to be significantly less 
than the fourth quarter as our 
seismic program offshore Suriname was completed in the very early part of 
fourth quarter at ahead of schedule.
 
In wrapping, up, I want to provide an update on our hedging program. We 
focus on reducing downside commodity price
 
risk, unlocking and significant 
amounts of future cash flow, we recently added to our strategic hedge 
position for next year.
 
Our current 2013 position covers 3.5 million barrels of oil, and are structured 
as three way columns with floors averaging just n
orth of $91, a ceiling of 
about $110, and with upside prediction in the case of Brent north of $130 
per barrel. The details of these positions will be in our 10
-
Q filing.
 
Our strategy targets hedging production in the range of 20% to 50% of total 
volumes u
p to 36 months out. So, I anticipate, we will continue to look to 
execute more hedges for 2013. And we will begin to lock in some of our 
2014 cash flow as the opportunities arise, with continued confidence in our 
long
-
term production forecasts and with inc
reased price certainty, we are 
ensuring that Kosmos will be well funded for the long
-
term.
 
Now, I'll turn the call over to Darrell.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Thanks, Greg. Let me first start my comments with an update on Jubilee. 
The producing reservoirs continue to
 
perform strongly, and the production 
has been stable at 85,000 barrel oil per day, while awaiting completion of 
Phase 1A wells and additional asset stimulation activities. Fuel production 
was enhanced in the middle of the year by the implementation of our
 
highly 
effective solution to well productivity, which has been successfully applied to 
five of the nine original producing wells.
 
Additional asset stimulations are being planned with one or two of these 
treatments potentially in late 2012 following the co
mpletion of the first two 
Phase 1A producers. Technical work is underway to evaluate the ability to 
complete future asset stimulations from a vessel rather than a rig. This will 
further reduce the cost of each application.
 
As a reminder, the last asset tre
atment utilizing a rig was only $8 million 
gross, and we believe we can use an intervention vessel to reduce that 
amount by approximately 50%.
 
So let me now provide an update of Phase 1A activities. To
-
date, we have 
drilled three producers and two water in
jection wells as part of our Phase 1A, 
representing 60% of the total wells in the program. Four of the five wells 
drilled have been tied into the subsea architecture system and two new 
producing wells are expected to be online by the end of year.
 
During th
e third quarter and into the early part of force, we experienced 
some rig downtime as a result of planned BOP maintenance as well as 
unplanned rig maintenance due to a number of mechanical issues. 
Completion activities are now underway on the first Phase 1
 
producer.
 
Drilling results for the program have been very encouraging with good 
reservoir communication seen throughout the field and better than expected 
rock properties indicating strong productivity capabilities in all the 
producers. With the additiona
l capacity from these new wells, we anticipate 
exiting the year with the Jubilee field producing its highest level since start
-
up, growing further in the early part of 2013.
 
Following a very successful exploration appraisal and development 
optimization pro
gram at the Deepwater Tano companies are in the final 
stages of preparing to submit the TEN plan of development to the 
government. The development plan will be focused on providing early 
reservoir performance and well productivity data. The characteristics
 
of 
these fields, including the geometric distribution of Enyenra, which is a 
confined channel system with three primary reservoirs extending 20 plus 
kilometers long, support an early learning approach to optimize future well 
count and placement.
 
Collectiv
ely, the development teams are working together to evaluate and 
tender a number of major subsidy components including trees, controls, 
umbilical's, riser and flowlines. And we are also close to selecting the FPSO 
contractor as well. Following the final PoD
 
approval, we will aggressively 
move this project forward with the award of key contracts and pre
-
ordering 
the long lead items.
 
On the West Cape Three Points Block, we successfully tested the Akasa well 
with a restricted rate of over 7,500 barrel per day, 
indicating deliverability 
potential of over 10,000 barrels oil per day. We are continuing to analyze 
pressure build up data, which assist in determining the area extent of the 
discovery and total resources in place.
 
Discussions continue with the government
 
in regards to aligning the 
appraisal programs for Mahogany, Teak, and Akasa with a strategy to 
advance these discoveries towards the most optimum development plan.
 
We are close to achieving long
-
term plateau production at Jubilee. The 
development projects
 
have made good progress, and we remain focused on 
exploration for company making discoveries with near
-
term potential in 
Ghana and Cameroon and new basin opportunities within the expanding 
global portfolio.
 
Operator, we'd like to open the call for questio
ns at this time?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bob Morris 
of Citigroup.
 
Bob Morris

Citigroup
 
At Jubilee, you didn't do any asset stimulations during the third quarter, and 
you 
exited the second quarter about 86,000 barrels a day, you had 85,000 
barrels a day. Currently, what has occurred there to preclude any real 
natural decline rate in that production and in absent whatever you doing to 
keep that steady, what would be the natu
ral decline and I guess follow
-
on 
that would be with the additional asset stimulations in the Phase 1a wells, 
will you still hit a peak rate of 120,000 barrels a day or has that kind of been 
dampen a little bit just how things are stressed out with the dec
line rates?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Let me say a few things and I'll maybe pass it to Darrell to add to it. I think 
what you are seeing is the success of the five of the nine wells that we've 
acidized and those jobs, production is staying pretty stable as you pointed
 
out, which talks to the success of the well productivity remediation efforts, 
and of course, the reservoir and the performance of that.
 
And, as we go forward, we got four other acidizations to do as well as to tie 
in our Phase 1A producers. The Phase 1A p
roducers are being prioritized 
principally because they are ready to be tied in and hooked up just awaiting 
the rigs to come back from some maintenance. And you're going to see with 
the additional wells that we need to acidize as well as the Phase 1A 
produ
ction, we anticipate sometime beginning of next year, early next year 
to get to a plateau production and pretty much stay there.
 
I mean one of the things that you should note that once we got the 
production capacity that fills the boat, any additional acid
izations we may do 
either on the ones that are untreated or once that we may need to do in the 
future, we'll not be seeing, hopefully, in the production levels, because we 
will have greater capacity than we have got FPSO capability at this point.
 
Darrell, 
does that answer for you?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
I think that's good. I was saying the key thing is good communication and 
conductivity throughout the field, and we see that in all the Phase 1A wells 
that were drilling as we think pressures is going along, so goo
d results there.
 
Bob Morris 
-
 
Citigroup
 
So were you chocking back the wells in order to keep them from declining 
during the third quarter or how is it that production held up?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
There is multiple choke work going on at all time, balanced prod
uctivity 
against reservoir management.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of John Malone of Global Hunter.
 
John Malone 
-
 
Global Hunter
 
Just jumping over to TEN for a second, I think you addressed this a bit. Do 
you maybe get the Okure results a
nd to have to an idea of what you've got 
there before you submit the planned development final?
 
Brian Maxted
 
No, not at all. The Okure is a very separate opportunity, prospect 
opportunity. It's deeper than the main Enyenra field and indeed the 
Tweneboa acc
umulations as well. The phased development plan that we'll be 
submitting, and in particular, the Phase 1, will not be impacted by the Okure 
results at all. It will be nice to find additional discovery below the field that 
we are about to develop for sure, 
but the two are quite independent.
 
John Malone 
-
 
Global Hunter
 
And then, just back to the previous question on Jubilee, just kind of to frame 
it. You mentioned actual rate for that will be the highest you've achieved so 
far, I think that about 86 was that 
number, so does that imply that you don't 
think you will hit the 90,000 of the operated TEN we've talking about or can 
you constrain what that actually means in terms of number?
 
Brian Maxted
 
We're at mid
-
80's. Right now, we've been there for a while. We've
 
had some 
challenges with the rig that's been doing the well completions and workovers 
for (Circle) Energy. Those are behind us now. We're back on the wells. 
We've got two wells that we said we were going to tie
-
in from Phase 1A by 
the end of the year that
 
we still anticipate just being able to do that subject 
to the rig performance, and those are wells that are both benefited from the 
learning's of the Phase 1 development in terms of drilling and completion 
design, very high productivity wells, and we woul
d be very surprised if we 
don't far exceed the highest rate that we've flowed before which is as you 
say about 86,000 barrels a day.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Warn of Jefferies.
 
Brendan Warn 
-
 
Jefferies
 
Just three 
questions if I can. Just still on Jubilee, and I appreciate you've 
had call of mechanical well issues, but is there anything you can tell us 
about now the reserve resource classifications and reclassifications and just 
your understanding of potential incre
ases of recovery factor.
 
Second question just relates to Cameroon, I apologize, I got under the call a 
little bit late, just any update of the farm out or the divestment process for 
Cameron, and then just lastly, just in terms of your call it seismic drill
ing 
activity in both Suriname, Mauritania and Morocco, can you tell us what sort 
of level of intimation sharing you have with other players in the region not 
some much in your block, but other players such as Tullow in Mauritania, 
Total whether there is an
y information sharing that's going on between 
blocks just to assist with derisking of new frontier agents?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Let me take the latter two questions there, Brendan, and then I will past the 
first question to Darrell. In terms of Suriname, Mauritani
a and Morocco, 
internally we're still very much at the seismic acquisition processing stage 
and early interpretation stage for fast track volumes and so none of that 
information has really been shared with the industry as a whole.
 
Whist, logistically we ta
lk to our co
-
venturers in each country, particularly 
around ensuring that we're optimizing the operations of our seismic and 
drilling programs beyond that I wouldn't want to say anything about any 
shared compensations we may have.
 
In Cameroon, is an opport
unity that we'll like a lot, and we have been 
speaking to a number of potential farm in east and those discussions go on, 
and that well is planned to spud some time in December with results in the 
New Year. So we'll have to just see how will that farm
-
out 
process goes, but 
the well will get drilled regardless. Darrell?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
On the Jubilee question, just go back to our comment on communication 
conductivity across the field is good. We see that in all the wells we drill in 
the Phase 1A producers an
d injectors. We're pleased with the pressure 
support with both gas and water across the entire section. So we wouldn't 
have any updates from prior guidance, nothing that gives us any worries 
relative to recovery factors. We're still on track to what we sai
d in prior 
conversations.
 
Brendan Warn 
-
 
Jefferies
 
I guess, I was driving that in terms of if we're going to start seeing good 
productivity, an increases recoverable resource or an increase in reserve, 
and when would you be looking to book those to your ba
lance sheet?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
I would just say that at year
-
end is our process where we update all our 
reserves. And as Brian mentioned, we'll have the first two Phase 1A wells on 
production. Once we see some of the production of those wells that will give 
us an opportunity for an update.
 
Brendan Warn 
-
 
Jefferies
 
Just one follow
-
up question, just in terms of submission of the PoD for TEN, 
any likely push backs or constraints to the government and timing of 
approvals that you envisage?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
I guess
, we've got the PoD all prepared and there is some dialogue going on 
with various parties both ministry and the GMPC. So we're optimistic in 
terms of the way forward with the actual approval process.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of John H
errlin of Societe Generale.
 
John Herrlin 
-
 
Societe Generale
 
Just a couple of quick ones, with the seismic, have you been getting brute 
stacks or you really haven't seen any in Suriname?
 
Paul Dailly
 
In Suriname, John.
 
John Herrlin 
-
 
Societe Generale
 
Yes.
 
Pa
ul Dailly
 
The factor I concerned that was actually not in yet. We completed that 
program ahead of schedule and actually below budget, which was great. But 
the so called fast tracks, volume actually won't be in until January. But we 
do have the fast
-
track s
tart later on Morocco.
 
John Herrlin

Societe Generale
 
Speaking of Morocco, how much was the incremental 37.5% position that 
you purchased or you negotiation for?
 
Paul Dailly
 
As we pointed out, in Essaouira license, we've increased that we've 
increased our interest and we now got 75% of that. Obviously, as usual we 
keep the terms and conditions of such transactions confidential.

With Jubilee, you're pleased with pressure support with water reinjection, 
have you c
onsidered using any sort of chemicals or maybe high rich water 
injection or you're just comfortable with the way the reservoir is performing?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
There has been no modeling so far on enhanced recovery at this point. But 
we would want to see the
 
field fully developed through Phase 1A before we'd 
even consider any augmentation on the water flow.

Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton of RBC.

Going to try and make it sound like one question. Portfolio rational
ization, I 
mean you've added a few things to your portfolio. You are looking to farm 
down Cameroon quite late in the day. I was wondering, when we should 
expect news flow from the various licenses.
 
Obviously, you've shown, where you are going to drill the 
wells or when you 
are going to drill the wells, but should we anticipate farm out ahead of that. 
And then conversely with TEN, do you think you will participate with the 
17% stake or if Tullow offered you more, would you be interested in it?
 
Brian Maxted
 
I
 
wouldn't comment on your last question. Other than, we anticipate going 
forward on the current basis of our interest. In terms of the exploration 
portfolio, a couple of things really; one, we've made a tremendous start to 
rebuilding the portfolio to deliv
er the next one or two Ghana's for this 
company.
 
We're very, very pleased with the acreage position we've established. They 
are larger acreage positions. There is a lot of work to do on them. They are 
potentially very prospective. So as we think forward, w
orking in what we see 
as a highly competitive business environment, there is a couple of ways and 
mix of couple of ways we could go.
 
One is to kind of leverage the opportunity that we do have and to diversify 
the portfolio by acreage swaps et cetera to get
 
into other opportunities and 
fill out the portfolio. And then with the blocks that we're in already, our main 
focus is working with partners that bring something that sit at table either at 
the exploration stage or very importantly for us the development 
and 
production stage in the event that were successful.
 
So you will see us partnering most likely in these opportunities, but with 
people that we think are going to add value to the full exploration 
development cycle. As you've seen in Surinam, where we br
ought Chevron 
in to that opportunity. At the moment, we don't see any rationalization 
beyond diligent to get the right partners into our various blocks and look to 
leverage our opportunities to seek diversification portfolio.

Just quick on
 
acreage swaps, should we assume that's with neighbors or is it 
a way of leapfrogging into new areas?
 
Brian Maxted
 
More than latter, I mean we're about diversification, focused diversification. 
We think we got very strong positions in existing petroleum sy
stems, 
particularly in Morocco and Suriname, where we have the guts of the 
petroleum system. And so it's principally a focus of getting into new 
opportunities in other areas.

Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond 
Jame

Raymond James
 
I want to go back to one of the earlier ones about the approving the plan of 
development, does the timeline or just generally your outlook for that 
approval depend in anyway on the outcome of the Ghana election in 
Decembe
r?
 
Brian Maxted
 
I don't think it depends on the outcome necessarily. I think obviously, there 
is an election and there is an election process going on. So there is the 
challenge to ensure that we can tell the operator who is dealing with the 
approval proce
ss can interact with the relevant parties in GMPC and the 
ministry and the government at large. And that's probably more of the 
challenge at the moment as opposed to the actual election itself and the 
outcome.
 
Pavel Molchanov

Raymond James
 
And then, 
just following up on that, just generally, do you anticipate any 
substantive changes to energy policy if the current opposition takes power or 
is that a non

issue in your mind?
 
Brian Maxted
 
It's not an issue that we would make a comment on that.

(

Kapadia of TPH.

Just a couple of questions. Firstly, I was wondering, if you could comment on 
the potential to increase the production capacity at the Jubilee FPSO fr
om 
the 120,000 barrels per day, either to take more volumes from Jubilee or 
from the MTAB development, is that the kind of current plan in terms of 
developing MTAB to back filled the Jubilee FPSO? Then I've got one follow
-
up.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Definitely tha
t is an area of focus for us from an engineering standpoint is to 
look at the capacity, get it up to that level with existing level of Jubilee, test 
where the potential bottlenecks are and take a capital look at how much it 
would take to bring it beyond th
e 120.
 
I'll also add that there are some space on the deck itself that we could 
potentially add modules in as well overtime. And that have to be a function 
of capital against economics.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH
 
Have you got any idea of what the potentially upsi
de could be? And just on 
the MTAB, is that what you are thinking about for MTAB at the moment to tie 
into Jubilee?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
That's definitely and option on MTAB, but we can comment on capacity 
increases at this point in time. Take some engineering w
ork, and we'll be 
able to answer that in time.
 
Anish Kapadia

TPH
 
The second one was just some clarification on TEN, see you've got to submit 
the PoD, then I believe there is an approval process, how long are you 
anticipating for that approval process. Is
 
the way to understand it, it's that 
it's 30 months from approval that you're expecting first oil. We've seen press 
reports of around $7 billion cost for the TEN development, is that about 
ballpark along with the expectations?
 
Brian Maxted
 
No, No, no, is t
he answer. I have no clue where you got that. It's not the 
first time we've heard it, but let Darrell answer your question.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
We're not pumped on capital at this time. It is a function of been 
documented in the PoD itself. The approval proces
s is a function of the 
government of Ghana going through the process. We know the track record 
from the past. It was 8 to 10 months for Jubilee, phases in the past. We 
expect that this one probably would be a little quicker. It's a non
-
process in 
the count
ry now and with the various agencies. So we think it will actually 
be somewhat three month.
 
Brian Maxted
 
I mean, the last one we did was Phase 1A for Jubilee and that just took us 
10 weeks. So obviously, it's a new field. But we have a very strong working 
relationship with the GMPC and the ministry. So notwithstanding the political 
distractions, we hope to make good progress on it.

Then you're still good for about 30 months after that first oil?

up question from the line of John Malone of 
Global Hunter.

Global Hunter
 
Just housekeeping, just south of $9 run rate you had for LOE in the quarter. 
You said that that's what it would be netting the three acid jobs. Can we 
use 
that as a run rate going forward, and you talk about more acid jobs after 
Phase 1A well started to come online. So where do you think that south of 
$9 run rate goes into next year?
 
Brian Maxted
 
I'll give that one to Greg.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
We have $9 has be
en pretty close to a clean run rate if you will excluding 
ore corporate related or acid costs. We do expect some additional acid job 
related cost for the fourth quarter. As Darrell mentioned, we have four of the 
original nine producers that have not yet re
ceived an acid treatment, we 
may get one or two of those into the quarter, and then the rest of them 
probably sometime early next year. So I do expect some acid costs. I do 
expect in the fourth quarter that the amount of those will be substantially 
less th
an what we saw in the third quarter numbers.

Good day everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Second Quarter 2012 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Brad Whitmarsh, Vice President of 
Investor Relations at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
Thanks operator and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This morning, 
we issued our second quarter earnings release, including an update on 
Jubilee and our 2012 capital program. The release is currently available on 
our websit
e, which is also where you can find our 10
-
Q expected to be filed 
with the SEC later today. Joining me on the call with our prepared comments 
are Brian Maxted, CEO; Greg Dunlevy, Executive VP and CFO; and Paul 
Dailly, Senior VP of Exploration.
 
Darrell McKe
nna our Chief Operating Officer is out of the office today, but he 
will be joining us for the question
-
and
-
answer session, which will follow our 
prepared remarks. During the Q&A session, I would ask that you keep your 
questions to one primary and one follo
w
-
up so that we can get to all who are 
on the call today.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements, based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking stateme
nts have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion.
 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
Company's historical and future performance
 
and these are commonly 
referred to metrics in the industry. These measures are provided in addition 
to and should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our 
financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP included in our SEC 
filin
gs.
 
At this time, I like to turn the call over to Greg for a review of our quarterly 
results.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Thanks Brad and good morning everyone. I will first provide a brief review of 
our financial results for the second quarter before reviewing our up
dated 
guidance items. I will then hand the call over to Brian and Paul to review our 
production, development, and exploration programs.
 
Overall our results for the second quarter were generally consistent with 
prior expectations. We had one Jubilee sales l
ifting during the quarter net to 
us of approximately 1 million barrels of crude. This generated total revenues 
of nearly $113 million for Kosmos, with the lifting price at premium of $0.77 
per barrel above the Brent settlement price.
 
With regard to our net
 
production versus sales during the second quarter 
this year, we under lifted by approximately 240,000 barrels and our 
cumulative under lift position was around 500,000 barrels at quarter end.
 
Our third sales lifting for the year occurred in later July for
 
nearly 1 million 
barrels and it will price slightly above August monthly Brent settlement 
average. On the cost side, our product expense for the second quarter 2012 
included 10 million associated with the enhancement program for Phase 1 
wells at Jubilee.
 
Excluding these work over cost, the average production cost was a little over 
$9 per barrel. Exploration expense was $17 million for the period, being 
primarily composed of some seismic, G&G studies and the second quarter 
costs associated with the Teak
-
4A 
well.
 
General and administrative costs were slightly lighter than expected at $35 
million for the quarter with 50% non
-
cash long
-
term equity compensation 
expense consistent with prior periods. Tax expense was $22.5 million for the 
quarter with about two
-
th
irds of this attributable to our Ghana operations. 
We also incurred additional book tax expense as a result of a change in our 
deferred tax asset position related to the vesting of stock awards under our 
long
-
term equity compensation program.
 
Combined we r
eported a $0.07 loss per basic and diluted common share for 
the second quarter of this year. Cash and cash equivalents remain robust at 
approximately $630 million on June 30, 2012 and debt was unchanged from 
prior levels. Our overall financial position, co
mbined with growing near
-
term 
cash flows from Jubilee have us well positioned to continue executing our 
meaningful development in exploration programs.
 
Capital expenditure for the second quarter were approximately $120 million, 
bringing the total for the f
irst half to $250 million. In this morning's 
earnings, we updated our capital spending outlook for the year, which is now 
estimated to be $500 million. This is a $100 million increase from our 
original guidance, reflecting lower spending in Ghana and highe
r spending in 
accelerating our exploration of base in opening petroleum systems in new 
areas.
 
At Jubilee, the success of our acid stimulation program has replaced the 
need for drilling sidetracks. In addition, we have reduced the extent of our 
appraisal ac
tivities for the discoveries in the West Cape Three Points blocks, 
as we continue to assess the most optimal development options for the 
discovered resources there. As part of our continuing portfolio expansion, 
we've slightly increased our overall explora
tion capital spend with funds 
allocated this year to the seismic programs in Morocco, Surinam and 
Mauritania, as well as to our new business opportunities.
 
Full year 2012 production at Jubilee is estimated to average between 
70,000, 80,000 barrels of oil p
er day gross, including the three Kosmos 
listings that have occurred to
-
date, we anticipate a total of six liftings for the 
year with our next lifting scheduled at the beginning of the fourth quarter. I 
want to provide a couple of updates to our outlook on
 
cost for the remainder 
of the year.
 
Production expense including workovers in the third quarter is expected to 
be up from the second quarter amount, largely driven by greater asset 
stimulation costs and detailed diagnostic work that has been ongoing as pa
rt 
of the enhancement program. For exploration expense, we are anticipating 
about $70 million of non
-
well associated costs in the second half of the year, 
which includes a large 3D programs in Surinam expected to start this month 
and a 2D shoot in Mauritan
ia plant in the fourth quarter.
 
G&A should be relatively consistent with what it has averaged for the first 
half of the year. Included in our 10
-
Q filing is an update on our hedge 
position, which reflects additional crude oil hedges covering a portion of o
ur 
production in the second half of this year and in 2013.
 
We've taken the opportunity to lock in some downside protection in advance 
of upcoming capital commitments over the TEN development and I expect 
we will continue to look to further enhance this pos
ition as the opportunity 
avails itself.
 
Now, let me the turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Thanks, Greg. I like to start off with some comments on our exploration 
strategy and portfolio and then focus on our Ghana assets before handing 
over to Pa
ul for an exploration update. Strategically, Kosmos is focused on 
progressively growing shareholder value by making world
-
class oil 
discoveries of unlocking new super major scale petroleum systems. With this 
in mind we've been actively expanding our portfo
lio of exploration 
opportunities to deliver an annual multi
-
valve drilling campaign going 
forward, beginning later this year.
 

opportunity for Kosmos, more than tripling our gross acreage held t
hrough 
focus on a number of potential petroleum systems in Northern West Africa, 
as well as along the northeast equatorial margin of South America.
 
A couple of highlights during the second quarter include the capture of a 
significant acreage position offsh
ore Mauritania, and our execution of an 
agreement with Chevron to bring them into our offshore Suriname position. 
And we continue to see additional opportunities that will provide significant 
growth potential for Kosmos in the future.
 

highly focused on enhancing the value of our legacy Ghana asset, 
by growing existing production, bringing on additional projects to deliver 
new revenue streams and by exploring for new hydrocarbon discoveries in 
the resource rich Tano Basin. Much progress 
has been made in each of these 
parts of our business. Starting with our existing production at Jubilee, this 
world
-
class field continues its excellent performance. The reservoirs are 
responding extremely to water flood and gas injection with strong pressur
e 
support demonstrating good reservoir and fluid continuity, connectivity and 
communication.
 
Approximately 40 million barrels of oil have now been produced. 

productivity issues that have im
pacted on our original Phase 1 wells. We 
have now performed 5 acid stimulation treatments and the results of the 
program have been very encouraging, with each of it treated wells 
demonstrating impressive and progressive improvement.
 

lly recovering well productivity to near original levels 
and in some cases beyond. Compared to pretreatment levels, the increase in 
productivity index a measure of production at similar drawdown differential 
has been quite dramatic. Our productivity index 
increases in the first four 
treatments ranging from five to over 40 times pre
-
treatment levels, which 
demonstrates the significant impact we've made with the program.
 
In addition productivity levels in the treated wells have remained relatively 
stable with
 
the earliest of these now having the own stream for over four 
months. Our technical teams have done a magnificent job of isolating the 
productive issues and identifying the optimal solvents and chemicals to 
resolve for our restriction. Very extensive diag
nostic work is being 
performed, including detailed production logging, as well as flow testing of 
isolated infills
 
before and after each stage of application and we have 
recovered samples from wellbore and thoroughly analyzed in the lab.
 
All of this work h
as been part of the learning effort we have undertaken to 
optimize the flow field developments of both Jubilee and of our other 
discoveries in Ghana. Although there might be other contributing factors, we 
believe the productivity loss to be associated prim
arily with a build
-
up of 
calcium deposit scales in the very near wellbore area. Small volumes of 
mutual solvents and acid have proven highly successful in dissolving the 
scale and restoring productivity, which further confirms this restriction is 
localized
 
and easily treatable.
 
We estimate that applied treatment volumes need only contactor radius of 
few feet beyond the wellbore to resolve the issue, confirming our early 
beliefs that the well productivity declines are not reservoir related. 
Production today 
is at its highest level in 2012 at 83,000 barrels of oil per 
day with one well still ramping up following a recent stimulus treatment. This 
equates to a 35% increase from the second quarter of 2012 average.
 
In addition while in the midst of a Phase 1 enhan
cement program we've also 
been advancing the Phase 1A developments. We have drilled half of the 
Phase 1A wells to total that including three new production wells and one 
water injection well. Two of the three production wells were drilled as high

angle wel
ls with the third being drilled as a horizontal producer.
 
Drilling of these wells was designed to maximize exposure of the reservoir 
and increase the productive interval. Results have been excellent, with each 
well displaying very high productive capacity.
 
In addition, we've seen good 
and in some cases best than expected pressure communication of these 
wells with our existing Phase 1 wells.
 
In applying our Phase 1 development, learnings to future phases of 
development, we are implementing modified completio
n designs on the 
Phase 1A producers, including perforated stand
-
alone screens and open
-
hole 
gravel pack completions. Following some plant BOP maintenance work that 
is ongoing, we'll soon begin completion operations on the Phase 1A wells.
 
In total there wil
l be five new producer wells from Phase 1A with two 
anticipated to be on line by the end of 2012, and the remaining three to 
come on line in 2013. With the success of the Phase 1 production 
enhancement where we have treated five of the nine produces, along
 
with 
the new production from Phase 1A, we anticipate exiting 2012 in highest 
production points in the field's history, ramping further to facility capacity in 
early 2013.
 
The next major project for Kosmos is the TEN development from the 
Deepwater Tano Blo
ck, which is progressing towards POD submission before 
the end of the year. During the second quarter, we finalized the flow test of 
the oil leg Ntomme
-
2 with over 20,000 barrels of oil per day from multiple 
zones.
 
Along the successful appraisal and testin
g program we are in the final stages 
of the design process for TEN, focusing on optimizing the scope and facing of 
the development, associated production profile, and the capital investment 
requirements.
 
The oil discoveries at Enyenra and Ntomme underpin t
he developments, and 
the FPSO is being sized to handle additional follow
-
on successes as phase 
tie
-
ins at a later date such as the recent discovery at Wawa or other 
potential funds that may come from the remaining exploration program, 
which includes two me
aningful near term prospects to be drilled by the end 
of the year.
 
The TEN project is expected to provide the next outlet for the Kosmos in 
terms of production and cash flow beyond that ramp up to plateau at 
Jubilee. On the West Cape Three Points block, we
 
have a drill stem test 
underway at the Akasa well. This will give us incremental information to 
better refine the resources discovered and the potential productivity of this 
reservoir.
 
As we have continued to refine the resources and assess the developmen
t 
potential of our discoveries at Teak, Mahogany and Akasa, the optimal 
development is rightly to be tie
-
back to the Jubilee FPSO. We're executing in 
all areas of our business, growing production and cash flow at Jubilee, 
progressing the developments of ot
her fields, continuing to identify new 
discoveries through a meaningful exploration program.
 
I will now turn this over to Paul for a more thorough review of our 
exploration portfolio.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Thanks, Brian. As we've mentioned, in Ghana, our exploration
 
efforts are 
focused on drilling out the remaining resource potential in the Deepwater 
Tano Block, between now and the end of the exploration period early next 
year. We got off to a good start in our 2012 campaign with a new field 
discovery at Wawa where w
e encountered 33 meters of oil and gas 
condensate play.
 
Located in the Northern, previously undrilled portion of the block, this well 
encountered good quality oil between 38 and 44 degree API and API and 
Turonian
-
age channel updip of the Enyenra field. We 
are currently 
integrating the well information into our mapping to determine an optimal 
appraisable strategy, defined all those potential future tie
-
in to the TEN 
development and has opened up a new trapping stairway.
 
In the next month or so, we will spud 
our second exploration well for the 
year to test the Okure prospect, this was formerly named Tweneboa Deep. 
This Turonian
-
age file is located beneath the Enyenra field and is to some 
extent de
-
risked as we prepare encounter in the exploration field of Enye
nra 
2 well is interpreted to have been on the flank of this Okurean reservoir 
fairway.
 
Our upcoming well is designed to test these thicker portion of the fairway. 
This is a very exciting, and sizeable prospect which we interpret to help 
multi
-
100 million b
arrel equivalent potential.
 
We expect results early in the fourth quarter and this will be followed by our 
sub
-
exploration prospect, the Sapele prospect, which is seismic attribute 
supported likely 75 million barrels feature located down
-
dip of the Mahogan
y 
and Jubilee fields and located in similar age sands. Results are anticipated 
for this well towards the later part of the year.
 
With these attractive opportunities on the horizon, set against the backdrop 
of previous success we are well positioned to enha
nce the resource space for 
potential future development in Ghana. Elsewhere, we continue our efforts 
to open up new petroleum systems and replicate our success, including 
identifying and capturing new exploration ventures and maturing existing 
blocks to th
e drilling stage.
 
Our petroleum systems analysis based strategy involves number of tactics to 
access strategic opportunities. These include expanding our core theme, the 
implication of structural stratigraphic plate of West Africa, for example in 
offshore 
Mauritania, as well as new themes such as the North West Africa 
pre
-
salt play offshore Morocco and new geographies like Suriname along the 
transfer margin of Latin America.
 
The intent of our exploration initiatives is to provide the Company exposure 
to mul
tiple potentially petroleum system opening wells each year going 
forward. In this regard Cameroon is most advanced. Preparations are 
ongoing for our first operated well there the Sipo
-
1 well, which is expected 
to spud late this year.
 
This well will take th
e most likely size of 150 million barrel prospect in a 
tertiary aged compressional thrust structure in our onshore Indian River 
block. This is located along terrain from offshore producing fields. We 
recently contracted (Helios Lake) for this well and the 
results are slated to 
be in the early part 2015.
 
Elsewhere in our existing portfolio we're targeting first drilling in our offshore 
Morocco acreage likely in the latter part of 2013. Here we're continuing to 
process and interpret our recent 3D program and 
preliminary interpretation 
in showing encouraging prospectivity. Offshore Surinam, subject to final 
closing conditions Chevron will join us in our deepwater Blocks 42 and 45 
where we originally contracted a 3D seismic vessel to acquire approx 3,800 
square 
kilometers of data with the acquisition expected to start this month 
and last through the remainder of the year. Chevron brings a lot of value to 
our opportunity in offshore Surinam and we look forward to working with 
them to progress towards initial drill
ing potentially in 2013.
 
Offshore Mauritania Blocks C8, C12, and C13 have now been formally 
gazetted by the government and we are quickly moving forward to secure 
sizing vessels to acquire data later this year. These blocks represent a huge 
add to our port
folio in a proven hydrocarbon province down dip from existing 
production. Alongside efforts to mature our current exploration assets to the 
drilling stage, our new business initiatives are continuing in order to build 
the balance concentrated portfolio wit
h the right risk reward potential to 
deliver new Ghana size success.
 
The sale and expecting time for Kosmos, as we are making great progress in 
Jubilee, preparing for our second offshore development and have meaningful 
exploration drilling before the 
end of the year, while continuing to build 
substantial future opportunities in a number of new hydrocarbon basis.
 
Operator, we like to open the call for questions at this time.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our fir
st question comes from Ryan 
Todd, with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ryan Todd 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks gentlemen. A couple of questions on Jubilee, you referenced how the 
asset stimulated wells have been coming on very successfully. Can 
you talk 
about generally what rates you are seeing on average in the wells coming 
back and from the earlier asset stimulate wells, which I think you said 
you've got about four months of production? Are you starting to see any 
signs of buildup of the finds 
again or what are you seeing from that point of 
view?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Let me answer them Ryan, I think Darrell is offline. In terms of the asset 
stimulation program, obviously, it's been extremely successful over the 
weekend, since our release. Production 
is now at about 88,000 barrels a 

field thus far. So, obviously the program has been very successful. We've 
only complete 

 
we only acidized five of the nine producers so far, and in
 
terms of production, we have 

 
what we've said is we've restored the PIs to 
same level some time, in some cases even better than the original PI, which 
will give you an indication that production on each of the wells is what we 
would anticipate from those
 
PIs. In terms of the one continuing or known is 
how long or how often might we need to be doing these assets stimulations 
and the information so far is encouraging given the several of these wells 
have been 

 
at least one of them have been on stream for a
bout 120 days 
since the first simulation. And of course, we're not at steady
-
state 
production yet so any changes in production rates are not simply going to be 
related to the well, the wellbore issues, but also what's happening in the 
reservoirs well, but 
generally speaking rates are holding very steady on a 
relative basis to the original initial production after coming on stream 
following the production enhancement program, if that helps.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Yeah. I'll jump in too, Brian. My phone went dead fo
r a minute there, but 
yeah absolutely there has been no decline seen on the five that are being 
stimulated so far.
 
Ryan Todd 

 
Deutsche Bank
 


 
you said that you'd have three of the 
Phase 1A wells on by year
-
end and the other
 
two producers would come on 
in the first half of 2013, is that right?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yeah we said 

 

1A wells, which obviously we benefited from the learnings of the Phase I 
drilling and complet
ion, those wells are 

 
so the wells are high angle and the 
third is actually a horizontal. So, the KH on those wells is some of the best 

be bringing them on stream with more optim
al we believe completion 
designs again, pick it out from the learnings that we had on Phase 1. The 
current plan subject to any operational delays is to have two of those three 
on stream and producing by the end of the year, with the third one in the 
early 
part of 2013.
 
Ryan Todd 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. And so, from a production plateau point of view you think, is first half 
of 2013 a reasonable expectation in terms of hitting 120.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yeah, I mean obviously ourselves and Tullo in fact have given o
ut guidance 

this point and that guidance includes reaching a plateau sometime in the 

without additional activi
ty yet done, so that should give you some sense of 
where we are at.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Al Stanton with RBC. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC
 

y
ou talked about it the high
-
back to Jubilee that kind of left me feeling that 
the field is smaller or the complex is fairly smaller and they will be 

best guess on resources and sta
rtup dates for those two fields?
 
Brian F. Maxted 

 
CEO
 

Darrell and he can add on. Obviously these discoveries are still very much at 
the appraisal delineation stage. We've drille
d several appraisal wells 
recently, we're currently testing the Akasa well, all of which is designed to 
try and understand what the likely resource base is. Given it's just not about 
barrels, it's actually about value and what's the right value decision to
 
take 
in terms of a potential development plan for these barrels. And so we're very 
much looking at maximizing returns on the development, which is part of the 
equation of I bet being a likely tie back to Jubilee. And if it is tied back to 
Jubilee than the
 
resource base will be integrated alongside the Jubilee 
resources and we will optimally develop the entire resource base within that 
context. So, it's not necessarily safe to assume that production in a tie back 
case will be way out into the future because
 
it might well not be, because I 
think part of the appraisal program for some of these discoveries will 
actually be long
-
term tests not just simple DSTs. Darrell do you want to 
add
-
on to that?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yeah, the only thing I would say is we're still
 
in the thrills of the appraisal 
program we're testing the Akasa
-
1, so it would be too early to put any 
volumes and resource base to it.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC
 
So should I now assume that Jubilee, Mahogany and Teak are all produced 
over a platform with plus or 
minus capacity of 120,000 barrels a day?
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
I think again it's too early to say at this point and until we both within the 
company we finished our appraisal program and integrated the results, and 
as the partnership and alongside GMPC and the 
ministry until we've done all 
of that and figure out what the right way forward is that, I don't think we'd 
be comfortable in making any statements on that.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC
 
Can I just close with one final question then Tullo recently said that TEN was 
360
 
million barrels of oil equivalent. Are you a buyer or seller at that level?
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
The resource range for TEN, again Tullo quoted a range in there and I think 
the partnership as a whole is broadly in line with that range. It is a wide 
range, prim
arily driven by what recovery factors are going to be on the 
resources in place. And obviously that won't be known until we've got these 
fields on stream and we can better estimate how these discoveries are 
performing at the production stage. So, I would s
ay that we are aligned with 
the range that the operators have given out.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC
 
Thanks guys.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 
Yeah, hi, tw
o quick ones for me. With Morocco you said you were shooting 
seismic, what license?
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Hi, John. Good to hear you again. In Morocco, we've got three blocks there 
at the moment, which is a very significant acreage position about 25,000 
square k
ilometers. I'm sure, you know this is probably one of the last pre
-
salt frontiers in the South Atlantic margin, at least to our knowledge. So, we 
are pretty excited about the deep potential here. We have completed in the 
early part of the year a 3D program
 
over the Essaouira and Foum Assaka 
licenses and processing as you know in these pre
-
salt situations takes a 
while, but we do have the fast
-
track volume in and we've been interpret in 
that, and that's the basis for some of Paul's comments in terms of the 
p
rospectivity being encouraging, but the final processing in fact won't be 
available until the early part of next year, but initial indications are 
extremely encouraging from a tracking standpoint and from other aspects of 
the play concepts that we're pursu
ing.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 
So, you're going to stick to those first and then get to the other ones later, 
like the cap one?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yeah. The other block that we have there is Tarhazoute in that salt basin, 

nd we haven't established any plans on 

dataset that exits over that area.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 
Okay, great. With Suriname, will you be heads
-
up with or will Chevron be
 
heads
-
up with you on an expansion rate basis going forward once they close 
or will you be recouping anything that you are spending on the seismic 
currently?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yeah. Normally details of private transactions remain private in respect.
 
John Her
rlin 

 
Societe Generale
 

 
Brian F. Maxted
 
We didn't, not surprising, but with respect to Chevron, we will not disclose 
that. Obviously, we're delighted to have Chevron alongside us. They bring a 
tremendous, as you know development to produ
ction capability to the table. 
They are very respectable of our exploration capability as well. Suriname is 
straight down the middle of a fairway from a strategic standpoint for us 
being downdip of a giant oil accumulation that somehow made its way 200 
kil

Suriname, particularly given the success that Tullo and Shell and Total have 
had both at South and French Guiana. And that seismic survey is about to 
start actually both on locations.
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Ed Westlake, with 
Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ed Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Good morning everyone.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Good morning Ed.
 
Ed Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Just a 
quick question on OpEx per barrel for the field, obviously with the acid 


 
that higher OpEx is going to be part of the results?
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Darrell, do you want to take that que
stion.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Ed, the question on sustainability on each treatment is still an unknown, so 


a on
e
-
time event from an acid simulation standpoint, it could be related 
back to drilling and completion fluids, so again lot unknowns here, we can 
bring some guidance later on, on whether that's sustainable or not.
 
Ed Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Approximately.
 
W
. Greg Dunlevy
 

of around $9 a barrel, excluding workovers, as you saw in the second 
quarter. Second quarter workover costs were about $10 million to 
production expense, we see that w
orkover cost in the third quarter going up 
significantly just based upon timing of realization of those costs and then 
dropping significantly in the fourth quarter. Again, based upon the timing of 
the workovers and the liftings.
 
Ed Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Yes. So, we should think about it in absolute terms and then divide it by the 
barrels you're producing and run it that way?
 
Paul Dailly
 
I think you should look at the run rate by barrel and then you should look at 
the workovers more as a one
-
off by 
quarter, and that was about $10 million 
in the second quarter. It will be significantly higher in the third quarter and 
then it should drop in the fourth quarter.
 
Ed Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
And then have we got any estimation yet on the CapEx for the TEN 
project, 
a range?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
No, we're still relatively early in the stages of planning that development and 
at this point, I think it wouldn't be appropriate to quote that Ed.
 
Ed Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
But presumably on the per barrel basis, obviou
sly, costs have gone up since 
Jubilee and it's also a slightly more complicated development given its gas 
condensate is a higher ratio than it was at Jubilee, is that a fair assessment?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Well, if the first phase that development is hung on t
he oil lag at Ntomme 
and the Enyenra oil discoveries. So, those gas volumes are not going to be a 
part of the original development, but directionally you're correct that you 
can expect them to be a little bit higher then Jubilee.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suiss
e
 
All right. And then you've mentioned twice I think that the initial 
expectations for the processing of the seismic in Morocco look good. When 
do you think you will get to a definitive answer or view on the pre
-
drill that 
you have in Morocco say for 
2013?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Some time the second quarter or so quarter, early third quarter next year, 
and we're trying to setup the program to spud in Morocco by sometime late 
next year. So, I would hope that we would be pretty clear on our exploration 
program 
later than the second quarter next year or so. The final data sets 
won't be until the beginning of 

 
until the early part of next year. So, we 
wont make a final decision on how many wells and what prospects they are 
going to be testing after that point obv
iously.

Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, if 
you could follow
-
up o
n the emerging plays, where would you expect your 
working interest levels to stand? I mean in other words Morocco and 
Mauritania in particular. Should we expect that you will be taking those 
interests down a bit as you get closer to the drill point and if 
so, what would 
you be comfortable with and I have a follow
-
up please.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 


the challenge


very acreage positions to capture as much of the petroleum systems, 
potential petroleum systems if possible and gi
ve us play diversity and 
prospect dependency etcetera. So, but what that brings with it, of course is 
they are large areas and the seismic stage, the costs of large acquisition 
program is going to be in a much more significant in units passed. So, one of 
t
he challenges we are looking at is how do we therefore think about 
partners, do we think about partners later in the game and more 
conventionally after we've defined the prospectively and format of the 
drilling stage or do we bring partners in earlier. And
 

mix of those strategies in. In Surinam, we decided to bring a partner in 
earlier, although we still got 50% of that block and so that provides us with 
further options down the road to dilute a little, but if we think that's 
appropria
te. And that will very much depend on how much prospectively we 
see and how confident we are in that prospectively. But this is a team game 
exploration. We've got a great deal of confidence in our own capabilities, but 
we also respect the abilities of pote
ntial co
-
ventures as well, and so you can 
expect us to anticipate that we will be partnering on most if not all of our 
projects.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Great, thanks. My follow
-
up is really following up from a question earlier, 
when w
e go back and look a year or so ago at the sort of prospect backlog 
and the way you had viewed some of the Teak and so on and West Cape 
Three Points, just listening to you today I'm wondering if your sort of 
relative enthusiasm there has changed or was the
re something you saw in 
Teak
-
4A that has changed your view or can you just elaborate a little bit as 
to why you might not want to move, we might not see you move a little 
quicker on the other development or not? I will leave at that. Thanks.
 
Brian F. Maxte
d
 
Well, obviously, we're looking at returns for this business and now returns 
are through exploration success. So, when we look at the capital 
expenditures on the business, we're very much focused at ensuring that we 
deliver maximum returns for our shareho
lders. TEN is clearly a very sensible 
development and there is going to be substantial capital outlay on that 
development ultimately. The MTAB area as you know we've always 
considered it to be different from Jubilee. It's multiple pools and stacked 
reservo
irs not always coinciding with each other, but offset is also a range of 
hydrocarbon types from dryer gas through to rich gas through to 
conventional oil, and so it's a much more complicated development, and so I 
think in terms of timing, in our mind, it's
 
always ranked third behind Jubilee 
in the TEN area. I don't think that's the case, and I don't think we've, we're 
any less enthusiastic about it. I think it's just a question of how do we 
position it within our portfolio and think about in terms of capita
l allocation 
relative to some of the other great opportunities that we've got in the 
business?
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Shola Labinjo with Tudor Pickering. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Shola Labinjo 

 
Tudor Pickering
 
Hi gentlemen, good m
orning. I just wanted to clarify something, on the 
MTAB area, is there a deadline for making a decision with regards to 
development, and the second thing was in the scenario that you do tie back 
and the MTAB cluster to say Jubilee and is it reasonable to a
ssume that your 
production at Jubilee will be higher than the current projected plateau?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Well, let me take the second part of the question first. The nameplate 
capacity on the Jubilee FPSO is 120,000 barrels a day. We haven't focused 
on it 
thus far, but the opportunity may exist for increasing that potentially, I 
think we've talked about that in the not too distant past, but our first priority 
is ensuring that we've got the productive capacity within the Jubilee field to 
deliver the 115,000,
 
120,000 barrels a day capacity in FPSO now. So, that's 
the first priority, but in terms of how we tie in, how we might tie in Teak and 
these other discoveries, it will very much on what the appraisal requirements 
demand, particularly of long
-
term testing 
as we think about phasing these 
developments and again learning from the early stages of initial tiebacks, 
trying to understand how much oil is recoverable and the flow rates of the 
different wells before proceeding with a full development of each of these
 

probably aware, within the petroleum agreements there is a set timeline for 
each discovery. We are trying to integrate all of those with the government 
and we are in discussio
ns at the moment and are papering it up some basic 
agreements to try and integrate the discovery areas into one single 
development area, so that we can take one integrated development decision 
sometime later next year.

Our next question is a follo
w
-
up from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 
Yes, thank you. Regarding Jubilee and the scaling, could you give kind of a 
simplified rationale for why you think the scaling was localized?
 
B
rian F. Maxted
 
Yeah Darrell, do you want to take that one.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yeah. There is actually two issues that kind of indicate to us that the scaling 
is localized, and Brian mentioned earlier, within several feed of the wellbore, 
it's a size of the tr
eatments we executed. They are all very modest at the 
frontends of the treatment. So, we see a majority of the effect with very 
modest volumes injected during the treatment itself. We've also collected 
samples of scale from the workover themselves and we a
re taking them 
apart in the lab and clearly it is a scale and trying to understand the 
precipitation environment that actually occurs to actually precipitate that 
scale. The other thing I'll say is during the drilling of the Phase 1A wells, we 
have taken p
ressures in the Phase 1 reservoirs and we find this consistent 
pressure effect from the water flood and gas injection across the field. So, 
that gives us confidence again, but the reservoir is reacting well to the water 
and gas flood, and it's not across t
he field issue from productivity 
standpoint.

8/9/16,Kosmos,"Operator
 
Good day, and welcome to Kosmos Energy's First Quarter 2012 Conference 
Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time let me turn 
the call over to Brad Whitmarsh, Vice President of Investor Relations for 
Kosmos Energy. 
Thank you, Mr. Whitmarsh. You may begin.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
Thanks, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our first quarter earnings release and later today we will 
be filing our 10
-
Q with the SEC. Both items will be 
available on our website.
 
Joining me on the call today are Brian Maxted, CEO, Greg Dunlevy, 
Executive VP and CFO, Darrell McKenna Chief Operating Officer and Paul 
Dailly, Senior VP of Exploration.
 
After our prepared remarks, we will have sufficient time fo
r a question
-
and
-
answer session. I would ask that you keep your questions to one primary 
and one follow
-
up question, so that we can get to all who are on the call 
today.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain 
forward
-
looking statements based on our current and most 
reasonable expectations. The risks associated with forward
-
looking 
statements have been outlined in the earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in
 
our discussion. 
Management believes these measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to metrics in our industry.
 
These measures are provided in addition to and should be read in 
co
njunction with the information contained in our financial statements 
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Those are included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'm going to turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. At 
Kosmos, we've had a fast 
start to 2012 and I plan to provide a high
-
level overview our results today 
before handing over to Greg for a financial discussion. Darrell, will then wrap 
up our prepared comments with an operations review.
 
Kosmos' first quarter t
his year included a number of strong results. The high 
level and priority strategy of organic growth through exploration success by 
unlocking new billion barrel (inaudible) petroleum systems was further 
enhanced by our capture for significant acreage posit
ion offshore Mauritania, 
as well as an expanded position onshore Cameroon.
 
At Mauritania, we executed three petroleum agreements covering over 6.5 
million gross acres, which we'll operate with a 90% working interest. These 
new blocks reside in the proven o
ffshore Mauritania salt basin and include 
the air board fairway of four [ph] geological concept the upper cretaceous 
stratographic play.
 
Our initial plans for the acreage will be to accelerate a significant seismic 
program and we're actively looking to sec
ure seismic vessels for this position 
and also across the Atlantic in our large Suriname position as well.
 
Adding in the new acreage in Cameroon and Mauritania to our existing 
already exciting portfolio in Cameroon, Morocco and Ghana, we have now 
captured 
close to 24 million gross acres, the substantial prospectivity. And 
we're not done building our portfolio. We will continue to aggressively but 
selectively identify and access additional opportunities. All with the goal of 
drilling multiple new basin (inau
dible) wells each year beginning late in 2012 
with our first operated Cameroon well.
 
For next year, we're targeting multiple wells in our offshore Morocco 
position. And to that end, we have recently completed a large 3D seismic 
acquisition program just und
er 5,000 square kilometers in our Agadir basin 
blocks. A portion of the data has already been processed and interpreted 
and I anticipate we'll have a number of large prospects identified later this 
year as potential 2013 drilling candidates.
 
And we are fil
ling in the plans beyond 2013 with our large Suriname 
position, Mauritania and others to follow. I've very pleased with the progress 
we've made in adding [ph] our portfolio and bringing forward acreage 
capture and seismic acquisitions.
 
In Ghana, our first 
quarter activities were highly focused on optimizing our 
Jubilee program and finalizing the appraisal and pre
-
development of the TEN 
project. At Jubilee, we have continued to gain valuable reservoir and 
production information that gives us further confiden
ce that the production 
issues we are experiencing are related to the well bore region and not to the 
reservoir.
 
As part of our ongoing Phase 1 enhancement program, we have now 
performed several different procedures to address the near well bore 
impacts. We
 
are continuing to watch the performance of the side trap that 
came online early this year utilizing a new mechanical completion design.
 
In addition, we have now performed acid stimulations on a couple of existing 
Phase 1 producers. While it's still very e
arly in analyzing the outcomes, the 
results are encouraging. Enough so that the partners have committed to 
performing further acid stimulations on multiple (inaudible) through the 
middle part of this year.
 
In addition, we're implementing the Phase 1A devel
opment at the field, with 
new wells scheduled to come online in our program of Phase 1 
enhancement. The outlook for production growth at Jubilee in the second 
half of the year is now strong.
 
At the TEN developments on Deepwater Tano we've had really outsta
nding 
results in 2012 both the Enyenra
-
4 and Ntomme
-
2 wells finding more oil 
than expected. In addition we have a very strong flow test at Owo
-
1, the 
original discovery location for Enyenra field. We are on a schedule to declare 
the TEN project commercial 
and submit the plan of development to the 
government in the third quarter of this year.
 
On our operated West Cape Three Points Block, we recently announced 
results from the Teak
-
4A well, which was testing a potential stratigraphic 
expansion of the Teak dis
covery area. The well was designed to reduce the 
volumetric uncertainty associated with the Teak discovery pools and the 
outcome (inaudible) refining reservoir distribution and trap definition.
 
We believe our discoveries at Teak, Mahogany, Akasa and Banda 
contain 
substantial (inaudible) of oil and natural gas and our forward appraisal and 
development plans will be focused on helping optimize the development 
potential for these fields.
 
Our meaningful 2012 exploration program in Ghana is underway and we 
expec
t results from the Wawa [ph] prospect by the end of June. Wawa [ph] 
is a campaigning and (inaudible) prospect optive of Enyenra. A second 
prospect this year is the Tweneboa D prospect, which has been renamed 
Arcurie [ph]. This multi 100 million barrel pros
pect is currently planned to 
spud in July and we expect to have results 40 to 50 days after spud.
 
The third main prospect in Ghana is Deepwater Sapelli [ph] downdip of 
Jubilee to be drilled later in the year. Combined, these three prospects are 
testing sub
stantial results upside for Kosmos.
 
As I mentioned earlier, we'll also be spudding our first operated Cameroon 
prospect, the Sipo well, which is 150 million barrel tertiary aged 
compressional thrust structure on our Ndian River Block. We recently 
secured a
 
halirig [ph] for this well. We have plans to commence drilling late 
in the year. Well results (inaudible) in the early part of 2013.
 
A few months ago we executed a production
-
sharing contract with the 
continuous Fako Block, which may contain and 
extension of the Sipa play. 
The Fako Block is 320,000
-
acre position in which we have 100% 
participating interest. Combined with our Ndian River position, we now have 
about 700,000 gross acres onshore Cameroon. And we are pursuing a 
Deepwater play concept i
n this onshore position.
 
Looking forward to the second quarter and the rest of the year we have a 
number of big wells and key data points that will drive value for our 
company. As we close in on the anniversary of our IPO, I'm very proud of 
the things we'v
e accomplished over the last year and the way we have 
transformed our portfolio and organization, the substantial growth that is in 
front of us.
 
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Greg for a financial review.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you, Brian. I will quickl
y review our first quarter 2012 financial results 
before commenting on the remainder of the year.
 
During the quarter we strengthened our financial position growing our cash 
balance over $70 million while our long
-
term debt position remained 
unchanged. Our 
capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately 
$100 million led by our activities at the TEN project in Jubilee, as well as 
significant expenditures in Morocco for the 3D program.
 
After these investments, we ended the first quarter with $745
 
million in cash 
and strong capacity to execute our investment programs. We reported a net 
loss of $38 million for the first quarter of 2012 or $0.10 per basic and diluted 
common share. This is versus a net loss in the first quarter of last year of 
$71 mil
lion. With IPO in May of last year, there was no equivalent per share 
numbers for 1Q 2011.
 
Our results in the first quarter of 2012 were impacted by a significant under 
lifting of production, higher exploration expense and a larger income tax 
expense resul
ting from our Ghana operations. Total revenues in the first 
quarter of this year were $117 million with the sale of one Jubilee cargo of 
931,000 net barrels and robust realized pricing of more than $124 per 
barrel. This included a (audio gap) of a little o
ver a dollar per barrel.
 
As mentioned in our earnings release, we significantly under lifted 
production in the quarter by about 450,000 barrels due to the timing of our 
lifting schedule. This is an equivalent to an incremental $55 million in 
revenue at the
 
first quarter lifting price.
 
As we forecasted in our year
-
end 2011 earnings call, we anticipate a 
production cost per barrel to decline and TD&A expense to increase. This 
move is largely attributable to the purchase of the Jubilee FPSO at the end of 
the y
ear.
 
Our production costs decreased to approximately $8 per barrel while 
depletion and depreciation increased several dollars a barrel showing a full 
quarter impact from the FPSO purchase.
 
Exploration expense for the period was approximately $40 million, p
rimarily 
composed of the sizable 3D seismic program executed offshore Morocco as 
well as certain geological and geophysical costs incurred in Ghana and 
Cameroon.
 
In association with the 3D program offshore Morocco, we increased the size 
of the seismic acqu
isition and carried a larger percent interest of the cost in 
exchange for gaining a larger interest in the Foum Assaka Block. Following 
final approval from the government, our interest will grow to 56.25% from 
the current 37.50%. We also included in explor
ation expense the portion of 
the Teak
-
4A costs that were incurred in the first quarter of 2012.
 
General and administrative costs were $39 million for the quarter consistent 
with our expectations and the run rate for the second half of last year. Our 
non
-
ca
sh long
-
term equity compensation put in place in concert with the IPO 
comprised over half of this amount.
 
Interest expense was $13 million and our mark
-
to
-
market on our all
-
hedge 
was an expense for the quarter of approximately $4 million. We reported 
$16 m
illion in tax expense for the quarter, which primarily relates to our 
Ghana operations where we incurred taxes at the statutory 35% rate. In the 
majority of our other jurisdictions we reported net losses for the period that 
we do not accrue any associated 
tax benefit. As a result, we booked a large 
tax expense in the period verse our prior tax position.
 
Looking forward we currently expect to have one lifting in the second 
quarter, which would again result in an under lifted position verse 
production. We for
ecast that to turn around in the second half. For the full 
year we still anticipate production to average between 70,000 and 90,000 
barrels per day for the day with between six and eight liftings net to 
Kosmos.
 
The variance in the average production rate i
s dependent on the success of 
the ongoing Phase 1 optimization program and the timing of Phase 1A wells.
 
We do expect to see higher production costs in the second quarter verse the 
first as we begin to see significant costs from the asset stimulation progr
am. 
These operations are considered work
-
overs and are expensed instead of 
capitalized. So with a number of stimulations planned in the second quarter, 
we would expect to see higher production cost figures.
 
On exploration expense, excluding unsuccessful we
ll costs, we are further 
enhancing our seismic program from our prior guidance driven by the larger 
Morocco program as well as increased expenditures planned for Suriname 
and some expenditures expected in Mauritania as well.
 
For full year 2012 exploration 
expense, excluding any future unsuccessful 
well costs annualizing our first quarter number would be a reasonable 
approach. We are not changing our capital program guidance in total at this 
time, although the mix is likely to move a bit more towards explora
tion as 
seismic programs increase.
 
As a biggie [ph] exploration company focused on opening new, high
-
impact 
exploration opportunities in petroleum systems undertaking more seismic 
and accelerating that activity makes a great deal of sense for Kosmos.
 
Taxes
 
continue to be an item that is difficult to predict typically resulting in a 
difference verse street expectations. We will continue to generate income 
and incur tax expense on our Ghana operations while generating losses in 
our other jurisdictions. These 
losses are not tax effective.
 
The net of these factors and the apparent high effective tax rate or high 
negative rate in the case of the first quarter of this year, tax expense is 
likely to fluctuate quarter to quarter. However, we think it is a reasonable
 
basis to model taxes on a per cargo basis with the amount of tax paid per 
cargo equal to the first quarter amount.
 
Now, let me turn the call over to Darrell McKenna.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Thanks, Greg. It has certainly been a busy and active start for Kosmos in
 
2012. In fact, we are currently running four deepwater rigs at the same time 
offshore Ghana between our operations at Jubilee as well as at the 
Deepwater Tano and West Cape Three Point programs. Despite this high 
level of activity our teams and our partne
rs have done a great job on 
managing not only the four rigs, but also the associated supply vessels and 
personnel. All with a committed safety first culture.
 
Starting off with Jubilee, Brian already mentioned we are continuing to see 
strong reservoir press
ure support throughout the field confirming that we 
have good communication and conductivity throughout. Gross cumulative 
production from the field to
-
date is 33 million barrels and uptime at the 
FPSO remains extremely high.
 
Production for the first quarte
r averaged 68,000
-
barrel oil per day, which 
was impacted by temporary shut
-
ins of multiple wells throughout the quarter 
for pressure buildup, acid stimulation and additional field diagnostic work.
 
As you recall that as part of our production 
enhancement program for Phase 
1, we performed a side track of the J7 [ph] well late last year, incorporating 
a new completion design with larger screen size and gravel pack 
configuration. The well was drilled only 250 meters away and restored the 
well's pr
oductivity to prior levels, giving us further confidence that the 
productivity issue is in the near
-
well bore region and not related to the 
reservoir.
 
The new completion design demonstrates improvement over the original 
completion yet on its own we believe
 
there is potential for optimal 
completion solutions. In addition to the side track, we also now perform two 
acid stimulations on existing producers and we are currently in the process 
of executing a third. Though it is still quite early results thus far h
ave been 
encouraging and we plan to move forward with executing a series of acid 
stimulations on other producers throughout the second quarter.
 
These acid stimulations are potentially a cost effective solution to 
significantly enhance productivity in the J
ubilee well. As we begin to 
implement the next phase of development at Jubilee, Phase 1A, which 
includes five producers and three injection wells, we are applying all 
learnings from Phase 1 into the way we are drilling and completing the new 
wells.
 
The fir
st production well is anticipated to be online in August. This well was 
drilled at a high angle therefore exposing more of the reservoir. As 
mentioned earlier, we are also continuing to look at completion design 
modifications with this first Phase 1A well 
to be completed with a standalone 
production screen. We have also drilled a couple of other top hole locations 
for Phase 1A with plans to drill and complete the remaining producers and 
water injectors throughout the rest of the year and into early 2013.
 
We
 
are making significant progress at Jubilee and the outlook for ramping up 
production during the second half of the year is encouraging. At the 
(inaudible) area, the Teak 4A Aprada [ph] well, which was testing a potential 
stratigraphic extension of the Tea
k discovery encountered non
-
commercial 
thin reservoirs. As we integrate well results into our field models for Teak we 
are continuing with our appraisal program for the area with plans to set 
gauges at Teak 2 to test press communication and we will follow
-
up with a 
float test of the Akasa discovery.
 
We've changed the order of these activities a bit to allow us to analyze 
results before proceeding with a float test and possibly an additional 
appraisal well at Teak. What we know today is that we have signific
ant 
amount of hydrocarbons at Teak, Akasa and Mahogany discoveries and we 
are continuing to refine the resource side and the potential development 
scenarios for this area.
 
At the TEN project, Brian already mentioned our outstanding results at the 
Enyenra
-
4
A and Ntomme
-
2A appraisal wells drilled in the first quarter this 
year. In the Enyenra
-
4A was a significant downdip extension test proving a 
static communication in the reservoirs over 13 miles distance with a 
continuous oil column of approximately 2,000 f
eet.
 
At Ntomme
-
2A we encountered substantial oil lake downdip versus our pre
-
drill expectations of gas condensate. Both these wells enhance the liquid 
content and value of the TEN project. Our teams are currently executing a 
float test at Ntomme
-
2A, which 
we should have in the next month. We are 
still on schedule for declaring commerciality and submitting the POD to the 
government in the third quarter this year.
 
We are in the final stages of fee process for TEN and have already begun 
identifying necessary l
ong lead items. In addition we are currently preparing 
to tender all major equipment and installation items including sub
-
seed trees 
[ph], manapolta [ph] controls, umbilical, risers and float lines. The FPSO's 
design competition is currently underway and w
e expect to short list the 
contractors in the next couple of months.
 
TEN is moving aggressively forward as a high volume FPSO development 
anchored by the oil discoveries at Enyenra and Ntomme with the potential 
for upside volume in the event of additional 
success in the remaining 
exploration program. The FPSO is being built to handle in the range of 
100,000 barrel oil per day with up to 30 total wells including oil production, 
water and gas injection.
 
With our positive outlook at Jubilee, progression on our
 
next project 
development and building our portfolio of exploration upside, Kosmos' 
growth outlook is substantial.
 
Operator, we'd like to open the call for questions at this time.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our

Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question then. So it sounds as if the 
acid (inaudible) or acid stimulation is 
going better than expected. Do you 
think you'll be able to get back to close to the original production guidance 
without having to drill further side tracks? Maybe just talk through that. And 
how much data 

 
how long will it take before you can actually sa
y that it's a 
success.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Ed. This is Brian here and thanks to everybody for joining us on the 
call this morning. We appreciate everybody's interest in the company. Let 
me pass that on to Darrell, our COO, to answer that Jubilee question.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Okay. Thanks, Ed. Yes, indeed we are encouraged by the response of the 
wells that we've stimulated and we have a third on ongoing right now. Our 
view is that it'll take us at least a couple of months to see the total effect 
and that way we
'll get some time on productivity on each of these cases.
 
Our guidance for the year will stay with our production forecast that we 
originally put on the table, which was 70,000 to 90,000 barrels per day. And 
that we would achieved full production rate by y
ear
-
end 2012 for the FPSO.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
And maybe asking it a different way. You've done the J7 side track. You've 
got Phase 1A so how many other side tracks are you planning in the CapEx 
program this year? Or have you dropped those in f
avor of acid stimulation.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yes. Right now we want to continue to see what these acid stimulations will 
do. So right now we've not put any new additional side tracks on the 
schedule.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. Great. Thanks very mu
ch. And then just on the development at MTAB, 
clearly TEN is moving forward and looking great. MTAB with these Teak 4 
results. How long do you think it'll take before you make a decision on 
whether that's a type out to Jubilee or whether it's going to be a
 
standpoint 
development in its own right?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Well, we're disappointed in Teak 4 results. We do have substantial resource 
there. We want to take the time to properly integrate all the information we 
have into all the fields 
-
 
Mahogany, 
Akasa, Banda and then look forward to 
set a new course in terms of what we have in the area. But at least by close 
of year
-
end we'd have a view of what we're doing with the development.

Our n
ext question comes from the line of Brendan Warn with Jefferies. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Brendan Warn 
-
 
Jefferies & Company
 
Yes. Thanks, gentlemen. Just one quick question just in terms of the Teak 4 
results. You still show a few prospects in th
e region of Teak 4. They're now 
under question. And just secondly I missed any comment or update on 
Cedrela. If you can make a comment on that please.
 
Brian Maxted
 
This is Brian, Brendan. Let me take the second question first. Cedrela is still 
under discus
sion with the government as it was at the last earnings call. And 
we anticipate that those discussions will move forward over the course of the 
next few months. And until we've got those issues resolved, then we can't 
make a statement on Cedrela.
 
With resp
ect to Teak 4, the Teak 4 results as Darrell pointed out were 
disappointing in and of themselves. But there is a substantial resource in 
multiple pools at multiple horizons in the Teak, Mahogany, Akasa and Banda 
area, which given the nature of those resour
ces is going to require more 
appraisal and delineation to do than for example on Jubilee, which is a 
different beast.
 
And underpinning that appraisal program as we go forward will be ongoing 
integration of the results of the wells that we drill. So the imp
ortant point for 
us to do now is to ensure that we incorporate the Teak 4 results into an 
updated field model resource estimation and understand how we can best 
appraise and delineate the field to maximize the volumetric uncertainty 
reduction and therefore
 
define an optimal development plan.

Bank of Americ
a Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you. Thanks for taking my question, fellas. Going back to Jubilee for a 
second, can you just give a little bit of clarification as to what exactly Phase 
1A will do? So if I hear you correctly, is the acidizing and side tracking and 
so
 
on that you're doing in the original Phase 1 field, is that going to get you 
to FPSO being filled by year
-
end? Or are you assuming Phase 1A contributes 
to that. And if that's the case, can you then talk about the implications then 
for the plateau. Because
 
it was my understanding was Phase 1A was 
originally intended to extend the plateau and then I have a follow
-
up please.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
On the Phase 1A just to clarify, there'll be five producers and three injectors 
and the Phase 1A will have three of thos
e producers on production by year
-
end 2012 and the remaining will be drilled and completed and on production 
in 2013.
 
In terms of total volume, total learnings I guess and we are applying in the 
acid jobs in the Phase 1 program the existing nine wells; we 
will apply all 
those learnings to our drilling and completion excise of both 2012 and 2013 
Phase 1A program.
 
Doug Leggate 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Right. But there's no loss of resource or is there in terms of the plateau. Are 
we assuming therefore 
that the longer ramp up is compensated not from an 
MPV standpoint obviously but from a volume standpoint by an extended 
plateau?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
You're absolutely correct. There is no resource loss in terms of the 
productivity. It's just a timing issue.

ug Leggate

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Got it. Thank you. My only other question really is related to the other 
acreage positions that you've obviously built up. And I'm just curious about 
what your thoughts are in terms of the working interest levels 
that you 
would expect to hold when you do actually start to have drilling capital 
spend on those assets? Are you planning to basically retain all your positions 
or how would you expect to farm [ph] down to get some carries? And I'll 
leave it at that. Thank
 
you.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Doug. It's Brian. Our plan calls for reducing our working interest to 
around 30% to 40% on average in our blocks. This is really to diversify risk 
and on the one hand and limit our capital at risk on specific projects on the 
other. So as you know a lot of our exploration initiatives are ideas and 
concept
-
driven and so oftentimes those projects are not at the optimal stage 
to seek farming [ph] partners. And so we go through the 3D seismic stage 
and then at the prospect time, th
en we'll seek to bring partners in.

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Anish 
Kapadia with TPH Group. Please proceed with your q
uestion.
 
Anish Kapadia

Good afternoon. My first question was more of a strategic thinking question. 
By the end of this year it seems that you'll reach the peak evaluation 
creation curve on Ghana as you move more into development and 
production 
cycle on the asset. And given your core competence really seems 
today at the early stage of exploration. I was wondering whether it would 
make sense to monetize or partially monetize those Ghanaian assets and 
then redeploy the capital into exploration. Jus
t interested in your thoughts 
on that.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Anish. It's Brian again. Obviously those are key strategic thoughts 
that we have every day actually. And at what point is the optimal time when 
we understand what they forward value of Ghana is. O
ur belief is that great 
petroleum systems and world class fields get bigger. And we are seeing that 
with the TEN project. We've had some very encouraging production date in 
Jubilee, which I think will ultimately end up in a higher recovery factor.
 
And of c
ourse we've still got quite a lot of work to do in appraisal and 
delineation in the MTAB and (inaudible) Teak Aksas Banda area. So there's 
quite a lot of work to do and as you know we've got a ongoing exploration 
program in Deepwater Tano that'll take us t
hrough to the early part of next 
year at which point we will protect any discoveries that we make with two
-
year appraisal area.
 
And so whether it's at the end of this year or it's at the end of the following 
year I don't know. But at some point here we wil
l better understand what 
our position is in Ghana. Obviously the cash flow is significant from that 
asset. And important for us in terms of driving funding our ongoing 
development projects. But our focus very much will be on exploration and 
replicating tha
t Ghana success from next year onwards.
 
But it's a good thought and we think about it and we'll look at making a 
decision on things like that probably into next year and the following year, 
as we better understand what the ultimate potential of Ghana is.
 
A
nish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH Group
 
Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow
-
up, thinking from a valuation MPV 
standpoint, given the tax structure you have in place in Ghana with the 
additional profit tax. I was just wondering how much impact additional 
capital being spent
 
or additional asset stimulation jobs from a production 
cost standpoint has on MPV. Because as I understand it, you end up pushing 
back the payment of the higher trenches of that additional profit tax. So I 
was just wondering overall you've got this higher
 
cost coming through but 
does it actually have much of an impact on MPV?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Right. Let me ask Greg to take that question.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Anish, you obviously understand very well how the contract model works. 
There's no question that it is structur
ed favorably from either an expense or 
an investment point of view. Investments are amortized over five years per 
the Ghanaian tax code. Whereas work over, which is a cash expense is 
expensed immediately.
 
So that will go against current income and defer th
e time when we use up 
our existing NOL position. As you may recall right now we have NOLs from 
past activities so we're not in a cash paying tax position in Ghana but we are 
accruing taxes and using up our net tax asset.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH Group
 
Just one 
final follow
-
up on the NOLs when would you expect to start paying 
cash tax? Have you got an update on that?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
It's subject to forward oil prices so since I'm not sufficiently clairvoyant to 
give you an exact number, what I would say is that circ
a strip prices, it 
would be sometime late this year. Depending on the exact price it could slip 
into next year.

Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton

RBC Capital Markets
 
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Greg, you said the tax was hard to forecast. I'm 
actually struggling more with cargos. You've said just now that you're only 
going to produce one in the second 
quarter. I'm kind of surprised by that 
because you've already got half a cargo pretty much in your back pocket 
already. And I would have thought if you're producing 70,000 barrels a day, 
you should have at least produced three cargos in the first half. So 
should 
we be assuming that production in the second quarter is at best flat quarter
-
on
-
quarter? And then more generally my bug bear is should you do 
something about selling oil on a more short
-
term basis rather than on a 
cargo basis. Maybe doing a deal wit
h your partners.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Being in the (inaudible) business and because you're cargo
-
specific it does 
get very lumpy. We've noticed in the analyst models that some of them 
model everything on a perk
-
barrel basis not a per
-
cargo basis. We under 
lifted a
s you know in the first quarter almost a third of our production. So 
our sales were roughly two
-
thirds of production.
 
We're going to have a similar circumstance in the second quarter where 
we're probably just going to miss the second cargo and it will slip
 
into the 
third quarter. The cargo liftings are per written agreement among all the 
parties that specify when and how each party and in what order gets to lift. 
So it's quite clear and fixed. They're forecasted out in time and right now we 
will have one li
fting. It happened this weekend of 996,000 barrels of oil. 
That at the moment is based on the cargo schedule that TULA produces, our 
only lift anticipated in this quarter.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
Hey, Al. Brad Whitmarsh. I would add to that, that we were actually i
n an 
over lifted position at the end of December and so our under lifting of 
450,000 barrels in the first quarter doesn't mean we're in a overall under 

quarter.
 
Al Stanton 
-
 
R
BC Capital Markets
 
Right. Okay. Greg, you gave me half of my revenue number for this quarter. 
Do you remember what realization you got?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
The cargo was in the process of pricing. Typically we and our partners all are 
priced on a post
-
lifting bas
is in the five business days after. Respective of 
the holiday in London, today, that will start this Tuesday and go for five 
days.
 
Al Stanton

RBC Capital Markets
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
You can pretty much tie it to a Brent [ph] dated price plus a 
very small 
margin as with seasonal refinery shutdowns in Europe, the West African 
sweet crude margins verse Brent [ph] have shrunk a bit.

Yes. Just coming back to TEN. Obviously you're going to be putting that in 
for a development and you're doing a lot of work right now it sounds like to 
nail dow
n the costs. Is there any sort of qualitative commentary you can put 
to the type of F&D cost or overall CapEx for that development as we sit here 
today?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Edward, I'd just add that there's a lot of work going on in the background in 
terms of 
subsurface models and pricing and unknowns right now in terms of 
actual cost per contract. So right now there's no update in terms of our costs 
for TEN.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. And then a second follow
-
up just on Morocco. It sounds like you'r
e 
halfway through some of the processing and the question is when do you 
think you'll be able to get up to a point of giving some kind of pre
-
drill 
estimates and number of structures, et cetera, that you see on the block 
from here? Obviously subject to dri
lling.
 
Brian Maxted
 
I think in Southern Morocco, Ed, it will be later this year into the third, early 
part of fourth quarter. It's where we've got a reprocessing exercise going on 
that's almost complete. In the Agadir Basin blocks as you know those are 
sal
t and pre
-
salt plays and the seismic processing needs some tender loving 
care and will take a little bit longer. So we won't be seeing that until into the 
early part of next year.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full 
Year End 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is 
being recorded. At this time, let me turn the call over to Brad Whitmarsh, 
Vice President of 
Investor Relations at Kosmos Energy.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
Thanks, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our year
-
end earnings release, which is accessible on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website. And later
 
this 
morning, we anticipate filing our 2012 10
-
K with the SEC. [indiscernible] this 
morning are Brian Maxted, CEO; Greg Dunlevy, Executive Vice President and 
CFO; and Darrell McKenna, Chief Operating Officer. Following our brief 
comments, we'll have a que
stion
-
and
-
answer session.
 
[Operator Instructions] If there are any questions that we aren't able to get 
to within our 1
-
hour timeframe, please feel free to call me later.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain
 
forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussio
n. We believe such measures are 
important in looking at the company's historical and future performance, and 
these are commonly referred to metrics in the industry. These measures are 
provided in addition to and should be read in conjunction with the 
infor
mation in our financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP 
and included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Thanks, Brad. In today's call, I want to touch briefly on the 2012 and then 
focus o
n the present, in 2013, and our strong future. Greg will follow with 
the financial discussion before handing over to Darrell for an operations 
update.
 
Looking back, 2012 was a strong year for our company, and we ended it in 
our best position ever, operatio
nally, financially, as well as organizationally. 
As a result, we have an attractive long
-
term platform for growth. We are 
building and maturing a world
-
class exploration portfolio that provides 
transformational upside opportunities.
 
Our position offshore g
arners only the initial success for Kosmos, 
representing the foundation from which we will grow our business. In 2012, 
we significantly matured and de
-
risked these assets, growing production and 
cash flows to record levels, progressing our next
-
door develo
pment and 
furthering the appraisal of our other discoveries as well. At Jubilee, the early 
part of the year was focused on overcoming well productivity problems, 
which we resolved successfully and did so at much lower costs than earlier 
planned. We also be
gan implementing the Phase 1A development program 
and exited the year with Jubilee production at approximately 110,000 
barrels of oil per day, a record level for the field and up 70% from the 
beginning of the year.
 
In 2013, we'll be focused on maximizing p
roduction by identifying ways to 
de
-
bottleneck the FPSO and increase production even further. Jubilee is 
proving what we've known all along: It's one of the world best 
[indiscernible] oil discoveries over the past decade, and now it is one of the 
world's b
est producing fields as well.
 
We also progressed at 10 discoveries in 2012, extending the Enyenra oil 
channel and identifying a new oil [indiscernible] in Ntomme before 
submitting a plan of development to the government later in the year. Along 
with our di
scoveries at Mahogany, Teak and Akasa, we have a superior track 
record of success offshore of Ghana and these discoveries are strategically 
important to our future. Over the next several years, our expected operating 
cash flows from Ghana, based on a conse
rvative $85 per barrel Brent price, 
combined with existing liquidity, provides for substantial and well
-
defined 
production and cash flow growth to our business.
 
In addition, our programs internally fund the material exploration program 
with 12 to 15 explor
ation shots on goal over the course of the next 4 to 5 
years. Given this exposure to a multibillion barrel potential. This is a real 
asset metric rich reward opportunity, particularly when we're trading just 
slightly above our 3P, P10 value, for only the P
hase 1 and Phase 1A 
resources at Jubilee. Let me emphasize that this excludes the value of 
additional phases of development at Jubilee, the TEN development, MTA and 
the upside in our exploration portfolio.
 
Before moving onto our exploration assets, I want 
to make a quick comment 
on the recent secondary offering of Kosmos' stock. The $30 million share 
offering was recently completed and significantly enhances our public flow 
without dilution to our shareholders. Despite the near
-
term impact, we 
believe the b
enefit of nearly doubling our public flow will provide long
-
term 
gains to our new and existing shareholders. We made the number of key 
strategic decisions in 2012 regarding our exploration program, including 
adding a substantial new acreage position offsho
re Mauritania and expanding 
further acquisition offshore Morocco, which combined, make Kosmos Energy 
to be one of the largest acreage holders offshore of north West Africa today. 
We also executed sizable seismic programs in Morocco, as well as in 
Suriname.
 
We brought in Chevron to join our exploration efforts there.
 
In 2013, our exploration efforts are accelerating, with focus on maturing the 
existing assets to the drilling stage, as well as capturing additional near
-
 
and 
longer
-
term opportunities for drill
ing. In Cameroon, drilling operations are 
now underway at the Sipo prospect on the Ndian River Block. Albeit, a little 
late than we have planned due to logistical challenges with the rig
-
up 
process. Results are likely to be in April of this year. As a remi
nder, Sipo is a 
150
-
million barrel oil equivalent prospect of tertiary age with multiple similar 
structures in the block. Kosmos operates the well with 100% working 
interest.
 
Offshore Morocco, we have established leading acreage positions in 2 basins, 
the 
Agadir Basin to the north and the Aaiun Basin in the south. We continue 
to mature identified prospects through seismic interpretation and are 
planning on the first phase of exploration drilling to include between 2 and 3 
new wells, testing both pre
-
 
and po
st
-
salt opportunities beginning as early 
as late this year. We have received the final volumes of seismic data, and 
we're very excited by the early interpretation, which provides a diverse set 
of opportunities with a multibillion barrel potential.
 
Offshore
 
Morocco is still under the high level of interest 
--
 
industry interest 
in both its shallow and deeper water petroleum systems with a number of 
U.S. and international independents and majors all negotiating new acreage 
positions, or forming into positions 
near where Kosmos is located. This 
bodes well as we are now beginning to process to secure strategic partners 
to join our exploration efforts. In addition, we're in discussions to access the 
necessary rig capacity to support not only our Morocco joint plan
s, but also 
other exploration areas as well.
 
We expanded our leading acreage position in Northwest Africa by capturing a 
nearly 27,000
-
square kilometer position offshore deepwater Mauritania. The 
concept offshore Mauritania represents our first reentry in 
the Upper 
Cretaceous stratigraphic play concept along the West Africa transport 
margin, where the industry, following our success in Ghana, spent over $1 
billion pursuing this play without much success during the last 6 or 7 years. 
We're targeting large ba
sin for farm [ph] potential in its proven petroleum 
system with proven oilfields up [indiscernible] we believe being leaked from 
a deeper source kitchen. We have now secured a seismic vessel to cover our 
entire 3
-
block position with 2D seismic, commencing 
in March this year. And 
we're close to contracting the larger 3D shoot to follow in the middle part of 
the year.
 
In South America, offshore Suriname, where we are exporting the same 
Upper Cretaceous stratigraphic play across the Atlantic margin, we've just
 
now received in the fast track data from our 3D 
--
 
acquisition, and we'll 
spend the large majority of 2013 working to identify opportunities for 
potential 2014 drilling. Similar to Mauritania, there is a proven oil discovery 
up there and we're in a deepwa
ter basin for composition, close to where we 
believe the source kitchen has generated substantial volumes of 
hydrocarbons. While maturing these existing assets to the drilling stage, 
we're also intently focused on further expanding our exploration portfoli
o to 
provide significant exposure for additional success. There are several 
opportunities in the pipeline. I'm excited about where the company are 
--
 
is 
today and more importantly, where we're headed in the future.
 
Let me now hand it over to Greg.
 
W. Greg 
Dunlevy
 
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared comments this 
morning, I will first review our financial results for the final quarter of 2012 
while providing some of our expectations for 2013. To follow on Brian's 
comments earlier, I'd l
ike to highlight the financial position we ended the 
year with, largely a result of improved performance and production increases 
at Jubilee, combined with a step up in our financial capacity late last year. 
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year
 
was $515 million, and we 
had approximately $600 million of availability in debt facilities. Combined, 
this provides over $1 billion of liquidity, marking Kosmos' strongest financial 
position since becoming a public company.
 
Maintaining adequate financial 
liquidity is core to our business strategy, as it 
provides the capacity to internally fund our development and growth 
programs in Ghana and also give us the ability to fund our high
-
impact 
exploration programs to the point of success and beyond. At the sam
e time, 
an improved balance sheet provides flexibility to capture attractive new 
exploration opportunities as they arise. With production ramping significantly 
in the second half of 2012, we finished the year with 6 crude oil liftings. 2 of 
which incurred 
in the fourth quarter, as expected. Total oil revenues for the 
fourth quarter were $218 million. On the cost side, oil and gas operations 
expense was expected and included cost related to 2 acid treatments 
performed at Jubilee, which average approximately 
$8 million gross a piece.
 
Exploration expense for the quarter was impacted by the completion of a 
large 3D seismic program offshore Suriname. In addition, we finalized our 
farm
-
out to Chevron during the period. Previously, we had been recording 
100% of the
se costs to exploration expense until the farm
-
out transaction 
was finalized. Depression and depletion per barrel was positively impacted 
by the transferred improved reserves from undeveloped to developed at the 
end of the year, largely a result of the suc
cessful acid stimulation program 
conducted throughout the year. In conjunction with executing our new 
corporate revolver in the fourth quarter, we also made some changes to our 
existing reserve base lending facility. This reduced the commitment amount 
from
 
$2 billion to $1.5 billion and associated with this change, we expensed 
of $5 million of deferred finance costs in the fourth quarter. EPS for the 
quarter was $0.08 per share and net cash provided by operating activities 
totaled over $221 million for the 
quarter.
 
At this time, I'd like to transition to our expectations for 2013. Overall, our 
expected investment program totals $525 million, excluding the benefits of 
any future formats with a little more than half this amount targeted for 
development activit
y in Ghana. The remaining 45% goes towards our global 
exploration programs. At the midpoint of our production guidance range, we 
estimate selling 9 cargoes of Jubilee crude oil this year, which marks a 50% 
increase from our 2012 sales volumes. At current B
rent prices, this 
represents approximately $1 billion in annual revenues for Kosmos and 
substantial operating cash flows that should more than meet our 2013 
capital requirements.
 
In the first quarter of the year, we anticipated 2 liftings, of which the fir
st 
has already occurred. On the cost side, we anticipate total production 
expense per barrel to range from $10 to $12, consistent with the operators 
guidance. In total, the midpoint of this range represents a greater than 30% 
reduction from the full year 2
012 rate. Exploration expense is expected to be 
approximately $115 million for 2013, excluding the impact of any 
unsuccessful well costs or farm
-
outs completed during the year. The 
majority of these costs are planned for seismic acquisition and 
interpretat
ion. In addition to this amount, we will be recording 
approximately $10 million exploration expense related to the Sapele Well, 
which has been drilled to total depth and is being plugged and abandoned.
 
G&A cost for the year should be relatively in line wit
h full year 2012 and 
DD&A should average about $30 per barrel. Our 10
-
K filed today will detail 
our current hedge positions, which totals 7 billion barrels, with 
approximately 15% of 2013 production covered and 2.5 million barrels 
covering 2014. With conti
nued strong Brent pricing, we would expect to add 
further to our 2014 positions and begin to lock in initial hedges for 2015. 
With the strength in Brent outlook in the early part of 2013 versus year
-
end 
2012, and should pricing remain at these levels, we a
nticipate a negative 
mark
-
to
-
market change for our hedging position at the end of the first 
quarter of this year.
 
Bearing in mind the challenges of giving guidance on taxes, we project total 
tax expense to be approximately $16 million to $20 million per 
lifting, 
consistent with 2012 actuals. We do anticipate larger portion of our tax 
expense in 2013 to be current as we anticipate using up our remaining 
Ghana NOL carryforwards during the year.
 
Now, I will turn the call over to Darrell for an operations rev
iew.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Thanks, Greg. Let me start off my comments discussing our planned 
development program for 2013, which is focused on maximizing production 
levels at Jubilee, as well as commencing our next major project development 
at TEN. As Brian a
nd Greg mentioned, results at Jubilee continue to be very 
strong and the field has been averaging about 110,000 barrels of oil per day 
through the first 2 months of the year. This is a result of successful acid 
stimulation program in 2012, as well as the i
mpact of production we have 
seen from the first Phase 1A wells. The new Phase 1A wells are exceeding 
our expectations and we are now 
--
 
have well deliverability, substantially 
exceeding the FPSO capacity.
 
To date, 6 of the 8 Phase 1A wells have been drille
d to various stages with 
the remainder anticipated to be completed through 2013. As mentioned 
earlier, the acid stimulations has proven to be a highly successful in 
resolving near wellbore scale buildup. Going forward, we intend to utilize an 
intervention 
vessel for these treatments, which we anticipate can further 
reduce the cost.
 
Our outlook for full year average production for the field is in the range of 
105,000 to 115,000 barrels of oil per day. This includes high predicted 
uptime for the FPSO, as well
 
as a 2
-
week scheduled downtime during the 
year for planned maintenance, timing to be determined. Recently, we have 
been performing at the high end of the range as we are testing the capacity 
limits of the FPSO, including gas
-
handling capacity, water injec
tion and oil 
throughput systems.
 
In the third quarter of this year, we anticipate re
-
wheeling the gas 
compression system on the FPSO, which will provide immediate uplift to gas
-
handling capacity and result in an increase in oil production. Accordingly, we 
anticipate exiting 2013 with a production above 120,000 barrels of oil per 
day. At the same time, we are continuing to monitor the progress of the 
domestic gas export plan. The system is anticipated to pipe Jubilee gas to an 
onshore process facility and wi
ll hook up to multi gas
-
driven power 
generation sites. We anticipate first volume of gas to shore in the second 
half of the year.
 
The Deepwater Tano partners are continuing to discuss with the government 
the path forward for the TEN plan of development. Ou
r submitted PoD 
supports an oil
-
based FPSO development with scale 
--
 
scalable production 
capacity initially targeting 80,000
-
barrel oil per day and flexibility to expand 
based on performance and additional resources.
 
Similar to Jubilee, our plan focuses on
 
gathering early dynamic reservoir 
information and cash flows from which we expand our full field development. 
The operator has guided to a mid
-
case development CapEx of approximately 
$4.5 billion, assuming a leased FPSO. Our portion of that amount will be
 
approximately $900 million, which is anticipated to be spent over a 
multiyear timeframe. Initial production is anticipated to be in the first half of 
2016, which would be the range of 30 to 36 months following project 
sanction. With the base production ca
pacity of both Jubilee and TEN, gross 
oil production combined is planned at over 200,000 barrel oil per day. Our 
net portion represents approximately 40,000
-
barrel oil per day or 2.5x our 
2012 average.
 
Progress is also being made in regards to aligning the
 
appraisal periods of 
Mahogany, Teak and Akasa. In 2013, we're planning to add at least 1 
appraisal tail [ph] in a Jubilee Phase 1 well to test the previously undrilled 
portion of the Mahogany reservoir. This is in addition to a potential well at 
Akasa and
 
additional seismic interpretation at Teak. From a development 
standpoint, we are looking at the concept of tying selective MTA producing 
wells into the Jubilee FPSO to garner early, long
-
term dynamic reservoir 
information.
 
We also released our 2012 reserv
e data a few weeks ago reflecting net 
production of 6 million barrels in 2012, as well as a reduction in 14 billion 
cubic feet of gas of our fuel gas reserves from the prior year to align with 
actual fuel usage on the FPSO. In addition, we transferred 15 m
illion barrels 
of oil reserves from proved undeveloped to proved developed category, 
resulting 
--
 
as a result of our successful acid simulations and Phase 1A 
drilling. Our P1 PB10, which is available in our 10
-
K, showed an increase 
versus last year, largel
y as a result of improved production outlook at 
Jubilee and lower assumed operating development costs at the field.
 
The path forward for growth at Kosmos is clear and our vision to achieve it is 
simple and focused. First, executing Ghana by maximizing oil 
production and 
fields recovery from existing and developable rediscoveries while 
maintaining strong capital discipline in our investments. Next, progress our 
existing exploration assets to the drilling stage, which expose Kosmos to 
potential petroleum syst
ems that are of major scale. And lastly, continue to 
build a premier exploration portfolio that will deliver multiple new basin, 
shots on goal each and every year.
 
Operator, we'd like to open the call for questions at this time.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ed Westlake of 
Crédit Suisse.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Just 
--
 
I wanted to focus and touch on de
-
bottleneck. Any rough numbers in 
terms of how what the ma
ximum could be for the FPSO as you look at the 
kit that you have onboard at the moment?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, let me hand over to Darrell.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Okay, Ed, as we mentioned, we're looking through also systems onboard the 
FPSO right now, gas, wate
r and oil handling. We started the re
-
wheeling 
project in 2011 when we approved the equipment. We'll be assembling and 
putting that in place in 2013. And as we mentioned, we know we can hit the 
120 nameplate once that project is completed. I guess, the onl
y other thing 
I can add is that we were looking at all the systems of looking for 
opportunities across the board and we can perhaps give some more 
guidance in later calls on that.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay. And a broader qu
estion about Morocco. I've got the plains release in 
front of me. Obviously, they found in the carrier of $215 million next to your 
acreage. And according to DeGolyer and MacNaughton, they were talking 
about an estimated gross un
-
risked mean recoverable re
sources in that 
block of around 7 billion barrels, which seems like, obviously, a very large 
number. Could you comment on potentially where you are in a farm
-
out of 
your own acreage? And maybe a comment on is the D&M assessments, as 
you look at the seismic
, in line with your thoughts for that 
--
 
for the 
potential of that block?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Ed. Brian, again. Let me just add to that first question that you asked on de
-
bottlenecking. I mean, we're obviously in a great position with the resolution 
of the we
ll
-
productivity issues with the remediation and the acidization jobs, 
and we've now got productive capacity way above the nameplate FPSO 
capacity. And as Darrell pointed out, a number of options are open to us, 
shorter
-
term and longer
-
term, to get this pro
duction 
--
 
get this production 
up. And so we continue to look at all of those. And the obvious long
-
term 
one that we need to add is the Jubilee export of gas, which we understand 
from the state will be 
--
 
the project will be in place in the second 
--
 
somet
ime in the second half of this year. So we obviously look forward to 
that because it provides us with the long
-
term solution. To answer your 
question about your Morocco. Yes, I mean, as you know, we were one of the 
--
 
as we sought to push the horizons of o
ur existing playing fields further 
away from the transform margin in an effort to secure 
--
 
identify and secure 
new portfolio opportunities for ourselves, we were one of the first players to 
join the hunt for oil and gas offshore Northwest Africa. And so, 
we had the 
--
 
basically, we had the pick of the acreage as we've had in Ghana when we 
went into there in 2004. So we're very happy with the position we've got. It 
was deliberately selected because it's in the heart of the salt basin, offering 
post
-
salt and
 
pre
-
salt plays. And there are several fairways on that salt 
basin, one of which extends into the plains of Pura Vida block. We have, in 
addition to that though several others that we 
--
 
that are included in our 
acreage. And we're in the early stages of in
terpretation on that data set, the 
3D data set. We're not in the game of promoting large numbers of track 
capacity and trap potential, we're very focused on de
-
risking the whole 
petroleum system including source rocks and reservoirs. And what I will tell 
y
ou is that everything is starting to come together really quite nicely for us 
and we look forward to maturing that prospectivity ahead of farm
-
outs later 
in the year and then drilling as early as the end of this year.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is coming f
rom the line of Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.
 
Ryan Todd

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
If I could get one more follow
-
up on Morocco. If we look over the course of 
the rest of the year, at what point do you think you'll be in a position from a 
seismic analysis and data analysis point of view to communicate some 
additional clarity on targets and timing of the wells and so on?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes. In terms of the 
--
 
Ryan, it's Brian again. In terms of the analysis 
evaluation of prospectivity aroun
d the middle of the year, as you I'm sure 
aware. The pre

salt interpretation in particular, takes a lot of tender loving 
care and as we define the pre
-
salt potential. So it's going to take us some 
time. And then we will be looking to farm it out during the
 
early part of the 
second half of the year, so we should be able to give some guidance on both 
prospectivity and, hopefully, new partners sometime in around the third 
quarter. And then alongside all of that, we are working to secure a rig and 
all the vario
us permits that we're going to need to get this drilling program 
underway.

Great. And then if I could 
--
 
just one more follow
-
up on Jubilee. You've 
mentioned a few times now that the 
--
 
you believe that the w
ell 
deliverability is significantly above the capacity of FPSO right now. Would 
you be willing to say what you think the well deliverability is right now?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
No, it's obviously enhanced significantly by 
--
 
I would say that the original 9 
wells
 
we haven't fully acidized all of them yet. I think we've done 7 of the 9. 
But once we've done all of them, I think the original plan was to fill the boat 
with the Phase 1 wells and I think we'll be in a position to be able to do that. 
The big game changer
 
has obviously been the Phase 1A wells of which we 
drilled 3, I think 2 are tied in. And they've benefited from the learnings of 
the Phase 1 drilling and completion. The wells are designed quite differently. 
They're high angular, in one case horizontal, so
 
the exposure to the 
reservoir interface is significantly greater, and therefore, the KH and the 
productivity is significantly higher. They've got much simpler completion 
strings as well. And they've all got the 
--
 
each of those has got the capability 
of 2
0,000 barrels a day or more. With that, you can substantially above the 
current nameplate capacity of the FPSO.

Our next question is from the line of John Malone with Global Hunter

John Malone

Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research

So with TEN, assuming you get approval in the near
-
term, what do think 
that could add in terms of reserves net to you for next year?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
John, it's Brian. Let me pass that over the Darrell.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Yes. In terms of 
--
 
we won
't hand out any numbers right now in terms of net 
or gross adds to the reserve base. We will just reiterate the mid
-
case [ph] 
that the operator has put out is 
--
 
the 23 wells in development, our share, 
$900 million. And we're in the range of 300 to 360 in 
terms of total gross 
adds with the project itself. We currently...
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
We have 78% [indiscernible].
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
And currently in the stage of negotiating several items in the government. 
So we're moving along with answering technical que
stions on behalf of the 
TEN PoD right now.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
And, John 
--
 
Brad Whitmarsh, I would add to that, that certainly it would be 
a process of booking over a number of years with initial 
--
 
initial bookings 
originally, but then also associated with sa
nction. But then also as 
production comes on and you get some history information, you would 
expect to then continue with additional reserve bookings. So we anticipate 
that to be over a multiyear period.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, which is typical with these pha
sed developments, of course, as we try 
to find the right balance between developing the first phase of the field. 
While it's not overextended itself from a financial commitment investment 
standpoint and size, you've seen in Jubilee the ramp
-
up to reserves 
is 
delayed, deferred because of the phasing nature of the development.
 
John Malone 
-
 
Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division
 
Okay, great. And then 80,000 initial productivity on the FPSO that you're 
talking about for TEN, will it be built in the w
ay that Jubilee was 
--
 
that will 
be the rate and then any further de
-
bottlenecking will be again to gas 
compression in sort of ancillary moves? Or would you build an 83 
--
 
80 
initially, and really have a lot of room to expand on that? Can you give some 
sen
se of what you're thinking and expanding beyond that 80?
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
So John, the 80 is now, I guess, to the Jubilee 120. That is the nameplate 
design and then of course, we look for opportunities, once we get with well 
capacity in the TEN field to 
the same point where Jubilee has where we 
exceed the nameplate. We look for those de
-
bottlenecking opportunities as 
we go along. And there's always room for minor adjustments, capital 
investments to add in capacity as well major with deck space potential o
n 
top of the FPSO. Those could be added later on as we see productivity and 
dynamic data performing as we anticipate.

And the next question is from the line of Al Stanton of RBC.
 
Al Stanton

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
A 
quick question on exploration. You talked about the desire to bring in 
partners, so was wondering what you're looking to do, whether it's just 
manage your financial risk or perhaps it was to enlarge your portfolio. 
There's a number of players, including yo
urselves, in Mauritania with big 
stakes. Would you rather have less or more? Or are you quite happy with 
the jobs that you already have?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, Al. Brian. Really, what 
--
 
2 fundamental drivers, I think, of securing 
partners. Obviously, the ba
lance sheet in Kosmos is in great shape right now 
and 
--
 
which gives us a lot of flexibility and a lot of opportunity in farm outs. 
And so, given that the financial drivers are actually not the primary issue for 
us, there are 2 other issues that are key to
 
driving the strategy. One is 
we've got very significant acreage positions and we believe that we've got 
that sweet spots on each of these petroleum fairways, but we don't know 
that for certain, and we don't know exactly where the individual sweet spots 
ar
e. And so the exploration program is not a 1
-
well and let's get out. It's 
probably several wells in each of these opportunities. And so primarily, we 
need somebody who's going to join us with that exploration program that's 
not going to get cold feet after
 
we drill 1 well and not have the Jubilee size 
success with the first haul that's what happens. And then we look beyond 
that, with respect to our partners in terms of what they bring to the table 
not just at the exploration stage but also at the developmen
t production 
stage as well, particularly in some of these deeper reservoirs and deeper 
waters. So that's very much the thinking behind Chevron in Suriname. And 
then the second driver is, as you pointed out, everybody is looking for great 
opportunities righ
t now to build their portfolio out and deliver exploration 
catalysts. And our strategy is historically been very organic, greenfield, 
working stuff out. But to move things forward and reduce the exploration 
cycle time, these assets 
--
 
existing assets provi
de opportunities for us to 
potentially do swaps and farm
-
ins with other companies. So to some extent, 
that's a driver for us as well. As you mentioned, there's 1 or 2 companies 
along [indiscernible] in each of the basins. And if we feel that their acreage 
brings play diversity to our opportunities, which is something that we look 
for, then that could be helpful. Otherwise, getting exposed to other 
petroleum systems that we're currently not represented in this pretty 
important to us.

Can I ask you a quick follow
-
up? In term of 
--
 
do you have a strong view on 
gas? If you drill early wells and they are gas, is that key for an exit? Or are 
you willing to try your luck?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Well, I mean, as we'v
e seen in other 
--
 
on other margins in the last couple of 
years, if you can find a lot of gas it could be extremely valuable. So the 
commercial risk related to getting the phase prediction wrong is not as high 
as it used to be, at least if you find a lot o
f gas. And we will just have to see. 
I mean, I think if we 
--
 
in a petroleum system where we think there's 
potentially giant volumes of gas, it makes sense to define what opportunity 
we have in those basins.

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.,

I just have a question on the Mahogany, Teak, Akasa fields. I'm just 
wondering if you could give even a more detailed update in terms of whe
re 
you see the combined size over there. It sounds like you're moving to 
--
 
moving away from a standalone development, much more likely to be timed 
to Jubilee. So just where you see the connect combined size and what the 
appraisal program will be going for
ward on that?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes. Let's get Darrell to take that one for you.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Yes, I guess our 
--
 
Anish, our primary focus right now is to align the 
appraisal time periods with the government of Ghana, that's our big focus. 
And then we'
ve got, as we mentioned in the call, we had some minor 
appraisal work ongoing. We have deepened our Phase 1A well to look at an 
undrilled portion at Mahogany, potential for an Akasa second well from an 
appraisal standpoint and an additional seismic work we
 
want to do on Teak. 
So still very much a high
-
value, it's got some good resources there, and 
we're looking at continuing to evaluate it. The range in numbers we're 
talking right now is in the 50 million to 150 million barrels oil equivalent 
range. And pot
entially, we'll work through that 2013 to finalize our appraisal 
program and have a better view of it by year end.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.,

So the 50 to 150 is the combination of Mahogany, Teak and Ak
asa, right?
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Correct.
 
Anish Kapadia

Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.,

And then, just one follow
-
up. On the tax situation, I'm just wondering if you 
could say what percentage of the $16 million to $20 milli
on per lifting you 
expect to be cash tax and what percentage deferred tax? And also, when 
would you expect to stop paying the additional profit tax in Ghana?
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Anish, this is Greg. Obviously it depends on oil prices and essentially, what 
driv
es profitability. But our planned price, I would say, we start paying cash 
taxes late this year at current prices more like second quarter mid
-
year. So 
it really depends on the price tag [ph] and therefore, the overall profitability. 
As far as what I think
 
you're asking, which is the additional oil entitlement, 
at planned prices that's probably 5 years out. At current prices, it's probably 
couple of years out before we get to the point where the AOE is payable.

Our next question comes from the line
 
of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond 
James.
 
Pavel Molchanov

Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research

I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments about reserve 
bookings. On Jubilee, obviously, you guys didn't book any additional 
reserves in 2012. Is there more left for you to book on Jubilee? Or is it at 
what we currently have?
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Yes. Darrell McKenna here. So we're very early days on Jubilee right now. 
We've got very conservative recovery factors worked into 
our numbers right 
now. We're working with our reserves certifier through the next 
--
 
this year 
course and the following years, to bring those recovery factors up. There's 
lots of opportunity relative to Jubilee, and we'll continue to look for technical 
opp
ortunities that will bring that forward. So it's a very positive view on it 
right now. And of course, that will be predicated on the Phase 1A 
development, it will continue. And then there's follow
-
up development 
phases, Phase 2A, 2B, that'll actually bring
 
in additional reserves as we go 
along.
 
Pavel Molchanov 
-
 
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research 
Division
 
Okay. And I 
--
 
also to touch on one of the earliest comments you guys made 
in relation to the recent equity sale. Given what you know about the, l
et's 
say, investment desires of your 2 principal shareholders, what can you say 
about their near
-
term plans? Are they pretty well set after this recent 
monetization? Or do they have plans to do more in, let's say, over the next 
12 to 18 months?
 
Brian F. Ma
xted
 
It's Brian, I will try to answer that. The recent offering was very much an 
effort by private equity sponsors and management to respond to existing 
and potential new investor needs who were looking to see a higher float and 
better tradability of the s
tock that we felt was hanging over us. And we've, 
obviously, achieved that with effective doubling of the float. I mean, we 
essentially sold the same amount of stock that we sold in the original IPO. 
And as you pointed out, the investors, private equity gu
ys, still owned, what, 
over 60% or so of the company. And typically, Warberg [ph] in particular, 
have got more of a history in this in seeding companies and taking them 
public, have typically stayed in their investments over the course of a 
number of years
. They've not necessarily been market timers. They've got 
out periodically. For example, a new field Spinnaker where it was in the 
region of a decade for both of those. So I don't expect anything different 
with Kosmos, really. I think they will be opportun
istic as far as they may be, 
they can be. Obviously, nobody was happy with the price that we sold a 
week or 2 ago, but there is no further plans for them to sell any more stock 
at this point 
--
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
I think we all agreed that the prices are reas
onably low, and as Brian alluded 
to earlier, the current price is 
--
 
the values as a company is approximately 
the value is at PB10 of Phase 1 plus 1A reserves in Jubilee only, which is, 
frankly, from my personal perspective, have been silly.
 
Brian F. Maxte
d
 
And then 
--
 
and the timing of this, it's been 18 months since we IPO
-
ed the 
company and we 
--
 
just about every meeting we have with investors, this 
issue of float was brought up. We felt it was a good time because, 
structurally, we were between de
-
riskin
g of the downside in Kosmos with the 
resolution of the Ghana productivity issues and the confirmation that we 
have a world
-
class asset underpinning the value of this company on the one 
hand. And on the other hand, we were headed in between a pretty excitin
g 
exploration program, as we go forward. So it made sense from a structural 
standpoint.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from the line Rob

Robert S. Morris

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Actu
ally, its Bob Morris. I apologize if you answered this already. I got 
disconnected during the Q&A. But you mentioned that wells in Phase 1A 
Jubilee were exceeding expectations, what is your current total productive 
capacity? I think it's something like 
--
 
35,000, 40,000 barrels a day above 
the 110,000 barrels a day you've been producing?
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Bob, let me jump on this again. This is Darrell. As Brian mentioned, all the 
Phase 1A wells have benefited from lessons learned on Phase 1. They're all 
v
ery high
-
angle well, there's like you said a horizontal well in there as well. 
And we've learned a lot in terms of our progression through the stimulation 
program. We clearly exceed our FPSO capacity right now, and Brian talked 
about 20,000 barrel per day 
average on the remaining wells. We have 3 
remaining wells to tie in and put on production, so you kind of do the math 
in terms of where it ultimately can get to. Again, when we talk about FPSO 
de
-
bottlenecking, we have to look at all 3 systems 
--
 
gas, wate
r and oil, so 

 
Robert S. Morris 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Let me ask you then, if you look at that, I know you've 3 to connect, you've 
got 2 more to drill, farther ignoring for n
ow the possibility of tying in some of 
the Ntomme [ph] wells into Jubilee FPSO. So once you get to 120,000 
barrels a day, that can happen this year assuming that the major capacity 
with what you got from the Jubilee and Phase 1A wells. How long a period 
ca
n you maintain that level of 120,000 barrels per day?
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Yes. That's what we talked about in various conversations past, is the 
plateau is multi
-
years and within [indiscernible], obviously, that gives us 
even longer life on it. One of our p
rimary objectives, as an operator team 
with partners, is to look at how we might potentially shorten that with both 
minor and major capital investments over time. So we'll always look for 
--
 
trying to bring that capacity up and bring it up above 120 with t
ime.

Greetings. Welcome to Kosmos Energy Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At 
this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. A question
-
and
-
answer 
session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please 
note, this 
conference is being recorded.
 
I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jamie Buckland, Vice 
President, Investor Relations. Mr. Buckland, you may begin.
 
Jamie Buckland
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to you all for joining us today. This 
morning, w
e issued our third quarter earnings release on a slide 
presentation to accompany today's call. Both materials are available on the 
Investors Page of the kosmosenergy.com website. And we anticipate filing 
our 10
-
Q for the quarter, with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today to go through that materials are Andy Inglis, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial 
Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
lookin
g statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Management b
elieves such 
measures are important in looking at the company's historical and future 
performance and these are commonly referred to industry metrics. These 
measures are provided in addition to and should be read in conjunction with 
the information contain
ed in our financial statements prepared in accordance 
with GAAP and included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
(Auidt Start 1:45)Thanks, Jamie and good morning, everyone. I'd like to 
start the call by reinforcin
g the key characteristics that define Kosmos' 
distinctive investment proposition. Kosmos generates cash, we have 
portfolio rich and value accretive catalysts, and we have a strong balance 
sheet that underpins our strategy.
 
These themes are consistent with 
those we set out at our Capital Markets 
Day in February, and I'd like to go through them in more detail. First, 
Kosmos has a portfolio that delivers cash. In the third quarter we generated 
approximately $70 million of free cash flow and we remain on track 
to 
deliver over $200 million in 2019 at current prices, our third year in a row of 
positive free cash flow.
 
For context in 2019 this represents a free cash flow yield around 10%, which 
continues to be very competitive compared with other E&P companies and 
indeed other sectors.
 
Second, our infrastructure
-
led exploration or ILX program is working. Today 
we're pleased to announce our first success in Equatorial Guinea alongside 
the two ILX discoveries in the GoM since Kosmos acquired DGE last year. 
Both on pro
duction this year, we have now made three discoveries from four 
ILX wells in total.
 
With our results this morning, we announced that the test of the 
Moneypenny prospect was unsuccessful. The well, which was targeting net 
resources of around 9 million barre
ls oil equivalent was designed as an 
inexpensive exploration tail of the Odd Job development well and costs 
around $3.5 million net to Kosmos.
 
We have two more, near
-
term ILX wells in the GoM. We're currently drilling 
resolution and we will spud oilfield i
n December. These are the largest ILX 
prospects in the 2019 drilling campaign and both could be transformational 
for our GoM business in the event of success.
 

Kosmos has a focused hi
gh impact exploration program. We believe the Orca 
field has an estimated 13 TCF of gas in place and the well has helped to de
-
risk around 50 TCF in the BirAllah area. Orca is the largest deepwater 
hydrocarbon discovery in the world so far this year.
 
Fourt
h, with the recent success of Orca plus a significant appraisal success 
we've had a Yakaar and Tortue this year, the total resource estimate for the 
Mauritania/ Senegal basin has increased the top end of the 50 to 100 TCF 
gas in place range. As a result of
 
these major resource additions, we have 
extended the selldown process into 2020 to allow the buyer pool more time 
to evaluate the new data.
 
And finally, our conservative approach to managing the balance sheet has 
not changed. We continue to use free cash 
flow to fund the company's 
dividend and pay down debt. We expect to end the year with leverage of 
around 1.8 times.
 

detail. As mentioned on the previous slide, Kosmos generated $70 m
illion of 
free cash in 3Q. CapEx for the quarter was in line with expectations, and full 
year CapEx remains within the targeted range. With the free cash 
generated, we paid off our revolving credit facility, and we will pay a 
dividend of $0.045 for the qua
rter. Production for 3Q was flat versus 2Q 
taking out the impact of Hurricane Barry, which resulted in around 1,500 
barrels of oil equivalent per day of lost production for the quarter.
 
It was also slightly negatively impacted by unplanned downtime at Ceib
a, 
which is partially offset by the successful ESP program at Okume with 5 
ESPs now completed. We expect 4Q to be flat versus 3Q for the company 
due to deferral by the operator of the gas enhancement work on Jubilee to 
the first quarter of 2020. As a resul
t, for the full year 2019, we expect 
production to be around 67,000 barrels oil equivalent per day with lower 
than expected volumes in Ghana, partially offset by outperformance in the 
Gulf of Mexico.
 
Our ILX assets continue to make strong progress. In Equa
torial Guinea, we 
had success with the S5 well, more on that in a moment; and in the Gulf of 
Mexico, we had first oil from Gladden Deep.
 
In Mauritania and Senegal, we continue to make excellent progress. Last 
week, we announced the Orca
-
1 discovery and we 
also announced Yakaar
-
2 
appraisal well result during the quarter, which proved up the Southern 
extension of the field and supports the Yakaar
-
Teranga LNG hub and the first 
phase domestic gas project.
 
And finally at Tortue, we had a successful result with t
he GTA
-
1 appraisal 
well, which expands the Tortue resource potential. The project continues to 
make good progress with the Phase 1 development around 15% complete at 
quarter end, which should rise to around 25% by year end.
 
Turning to slide four, as I ment
ioned in my opening remarks, our ILX 
program is working. On this slide, I'd like to focus on the progress we've 

drilled three exploration wells and had two discoveries, with Nearly Headl
ess 
Nick and Gladden Deep.
 
The Nearly Headless Nick and Gladden Deep discoveries while small 
demonstrate the rapid development timelines for these ILX tiebacks. 
Gladden Deep came online within four months of discovery and Nearly 
Headless Nick is expected o
nline in December, a 15
-

these short development times that result in higher returns and quick 
paybacks for these projects.
 
Looking at the right side of the slide, we are currently drilling Resolution, 
and we expect to spud the oilfi
eld prospect in December. These prospects 
are potentially much larger and can be transformational for our Gulf of 
Mexico business. To use a baseball analogy, and apologies to my fellow 
Astro fans on the line, our ILX portfolio in the GoM offers low risk si
ngles and 
doubles, which will replace the reserves that we produced during the year. 
We complement that with larger prospects that can deliver the home run 
catalysts, if successful.
 
Turning to slide five, which looks at our ILX program in Equatorial Guinea
. 
This morning we announced success with our initial ILX well in EG. This was 
the first well to be drilled on modern 3D seismic improved our concept 
around the potential of the under explored Rio Muni basin. The seismic for 
the S
-
5 areas was fast tracked, 
and the well
-
targeted the heart of a 
Santonian channel, whereas previous wells were drilled on what we believe 
was the edge of the channel. The well encountered approximately 39 meters 
of net oil pay with better reservoir development than any of the previo
us 
wells drilled in the area.
 
From the [ph] logging data, it looks like the oil is higher quality than we 
have at Ceiba and Okume and the well could flow at an initial rate of over 
10,000 barrels of oil per day, which would be a material increment to the 
c
urrent Ceiba and Okume production. The field is within 20 kilometers of the 

to establish the scalar of this given resource and evaluate the optimum 
development solution to tie it b
ack into the existing infrastructure.
 
Work is also now underway to identify additional low risk tieback prospects 
around the existing infrastructure. Final volumes from the 2018 seismic are 
expected to be delivered in early 2020 align for the 
maturation of prospects 
for the next drilling campaign.
 
Slide six shows the considerable progress we made since taking the final 
investment decision on Tortue less than a year ago. Through the successful 
GTA
-
1 appraisal well we expanded our resource base a
t Greater Tortue 
Ahmeyim and we expect to use this well as a future producer. Beyond the 
appraisal drilling as you can see from the table at the bottom and images on 
the right, we've made considerable progress on Phase 1 of the project since 
FID. Key works
treams are progressing well with the FLNG vessel in particular 
almost 25% done. We expect the overall project to be approximately 25% 
finished by the end of the year. Our estimate for first gas for Tortue remains 
the first half of 2022.
 
Turning to slide se
ven, our appraisal well at Yakaar
-
2 confirm the southern 
extension of the field. And as you can see on the right this test 
demonstrated how laterally extensive the field is. Combined with Teranga, 
we now have the resource required to underpin an LNG hub in
 
Senegal, 
which will be developed using a phased approach with a domestic gas 
leading to an LNG export project.
 
Slide eight shows the technical highlights of the Orca
-
1 discovery we 
announced last week. We believe the Orca field has 13 TCF of gas initially
 
in 
place in thick excellent quality Albian reservoirs as can be seen from the log 
data on the left of the slide. The discovery continues our 100% track record 
on the inboard trend and demonstrates the ability of the high quality 
calibrated AVO tool to ide
ntify gas in quality reservoirs. The well which was 
drilled 7.5 kilometers off structure confirmed our pre
-
drill expectation of 
both structural and stratigraphic traps are present and working.
 
Turning to slide nine, Orca is Kosmos is ninth discovery in the
 
Mauritania 
Senegal basin, and the largest deepwater hydrocarbon discovery in the 
world so far in 2019. The well was drilled into a previously untested Albian 
play and encountered 36 meters of net pay in excellent quality reservoirs. 
Together with Marsouin
, we believe we now have the rest of the 50 TCF of 
gas in place in Mauritania alone, more than enough gas to underpin a 
standalone LNG hub in Mauritania. There is also additional upside potential 
in an untested Aptian play and we remain very excited about 
this area.
 
So turning to the final slide, one that we presented at the Capital Markets 
Day in February this year. At the time, we estimated that Mauritania Senegal 
Diego at around 50 TCF of gas in plays with upside potential to double that 
in the event of 
successful exploration and appraisal campaign this year. 
We've done that with success at GTA
-
1, Yakaar
-
2 and Orca
-
1, n we've 
increased the resource base at the top end of the range to around 100 TCF 
across the basin, providing sufficient resource to underp
in three LNG hubs, 
totaling 30 million tons per annum of capacity. With a significant resource 
additions through 2019. we've extended the selldown process into 2020 to 
allow the buyer pool more time to evaluate the new data.
 
So, to summarize today's presen
tation, Kosmos continues to be highly cash 
generative. We have an ILX program that delivers high return, short cycle 
growth that's working in the EG and the GoM. We've doubled the size of our 
resource base in Mauritania and Senegal through successful explo
ration and 
appraisal in 2019. And we have a strong balance sheet that underpins the 
strategy.
 
Thank you and I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the 
session for questions.

Operator
 
At this time, we will be 
conducting a question
-
and
-
answer session. [Operator 
Instructions] Our first question is from Al Stanton, RBC. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes, good evening, guys. Just 
--
 
I appreciate you don't always give guidance 
on what's going on in t
he data rooms and the various discussions you're 
having with potential buyers, but I think historically, we always assume 
there would be one buyer focused on Tortue with additional discoveries 
being sort of nice to have. But I'm wondering now whether there
's any 
possibility you might be looking for two buyers in terms of one for Mauritania 
and one for Senegal.
 
Andy Inglis
 

we kicked off the process in February, we had a total reso
urce across 
Senegal and Mauritania of around 50 TCF with a lot of concentration at the 
time on Tortue. Clearly through the year, we've had success with the wells 
as I said in my remarks GTA
-
1, the Yakaar
-
2 and Orca, and we now have a 
resource which we beli
eve is at the top end of 50 TCF to 100 TCF range.
 
So, we want to ensure that the potential buyers do have time to analyze the 
new data and better understand the assets. And I think as you point out, we 
now have three very distinct assets in Mauritania and 
Senegal, and they all 
have distinct attributes. Greater Tortue is a project where the first phase is 
being FID. We have gas first gas two, two and half years away. The 
resources increased with the GTA
-
1 success. So you have something that's 
well described.
 
Yakaar Teranga and Senegal, we have added resource to it with the Yakaar
-
2 success and I think underpinned a clear plan for the commercialization 
with a near
-
term domestic project consistent with the country's Plan 
Emergent Senegal, but followed by an LNG
 
export hub. So, a different level 
of definition from Tortue, but nevertheless clarity around the next steps to 
commercialize.
 

well from many perspectives, it was about the confi
dence in the AVO, we 
drilled it in an area where we could distinguish a weaker Cenomanian 
attribute to a much stronger Albian attribute. We drilled it off structure so 
that we could demonstrate the strstructure on stratigraphic closures where 

. I think as a result, we have a significant resource now in 
Mauritania.
 

show that that optionality is built into the selldown process, and there's a lot 
of new data to look a
t, and I think there are different attributes that 
different buyers will look at as a result.
 
Al Stanton
 
Can I just ask a follow
-
on, would we expect another well before the deal is 
closed or is this it for now?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Clearly, we've got an ongoing con
versation with the operator, but I think 
that if you look at GTA I believe we're done. The East Tortue was an 

described in Yakaar. And in BirAllah, I think the evidence from the Or
ca well 
is quite compelling. So, it doesn't need another well today to capture what I 
would say the core value in each of these assets now, a lot happen in a year, 
and I think we're pleased with the precision with which we've done it, and I 
don't think we 
need anything else.
 
Al Stanton
 
Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. Thanks, Al.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Bob Brackett, Bernstein Research. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Good morning, I had a question about resolution, given that 
it's the largest 
of your Gulf of Mexico ILX wells, what caused the cadence of it being the 
third to drill this year, is that because it's higher risk or it needed partner 
permits, can you give some color on that and what the risk of that well could 
be?
 
And
y Inglis
 
Yes, thanks, Bob. No, this is simply about 
--
 
there was obviously a farm
-
in 
process with BP. We have to get that done, then we have to go out and get 
the rig. As you know, we're not 
--
 
we don't have rigs on long
-
term charters, 
so it's a rig of opp
ortunity. It requires a certain spec, so that was the 
timeline behind that. So, it is important that we need to keep emphasizing 
that because we're going out and actually literally using rigs of opportunity, 
the way the various prospects will line up will 
not be driven purely by scale 
or quality, there will be operational aspects that come into play. And that's 
why resolution was 
--
 
the timing of resolution is being driven by that. 
Equally, oilfield has been done on a separate rig and so that's what drives 
its 
timing.
 
Bob Brackett
 
That's very clear. A follow
-
up would be thinking ahead to 2020, you talked 
about during the Capital Markets Day, a first well in Sao Tome and Principe, 
and then the walker prospect in Suriname, how do we think about ILX 
program for
 
2020?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, we've built a really good portfolio now, and one of the things that I'm 
really pleased about is the pace at which we've done it in the Gulf of Mexico, 

 
actually since we 
--
 
just over a year since we closed. So, I think what you 

where we've clearly opened up I think a real opportunity set in Equatorial 
Guinea now.
 
And so, we're goi

competition between EG and the Gulf of Mexico. We've got a deep inventory 
in the Gulf more than five years, some 25 prospects that will be competing 
to get quality to the top and the same with EG. But I
 
think if you were to 
sort of see us drilling four high quality material prospects in 2020 and 
actually each year beyond that, that's the cadence of the program.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Okay, great. Appreciate it.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. Thanks, Bob.
 
Operator
 
Our next que
stion is from Charles Meade, Johnson Rice. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Charles Meade
 
Yes. Good morning or good afternoon maybe Andy to you and your whole 
team there. I wanted to pick up on your EG comments, and I wondered if 
you could give us a litt
le more detail around the process forward here for 
this S
-
5 this discovery you made at S
-
5 both with respect to bringing this 
online. And also the follow up, Joe and I know you have the seismic that's 
coming in early 2020, but do you need that seismic befo
re you can do an 
appraisal well, do you need an appraisal well and when should we be 
thinking about first volumes from this?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, great Charles. Look, should you go back one of the fundamental thesis 
behind entering Equatorial Guinea was to get
 
access disciple Ceiba and 
Okume. We've done a great job in stemming the decline and creating value 
from 
--
 
purely from the production operations. We capture the three license 
blocks around first step was to go shoot the seismic and then we hydrated 
that s
eismic program to around the 
--
 
to get the product first from around 
S
-
5.
 
The target of the well was a Santonian channel, where we believe the prior 
wells had been drilled on the edges of the channel, not in the heart of the 
channel. And so the well object
ive was to establish high quality reservoir in 
the core of the channel and we've done that, we've delivered 39 meters of 
good quality reservoir. We think we've got a lighter fluid than we've got 
elsewhere in Ceiba and Okume. And actually this would be the 
first 
production from the Santonian in the area.
 
So the well fully met all the expectations, the primary target was 
[indiscernible] which you can see on the on the chart in the papers that we 
gave you ahead of the call. Going in the expectation was around 
100 million 
barrels of oil in plays. So now it's ultimately about the establishing the 
connected volume that we've got, we literally just getting the well data in 
now. So the well is still underway, but we've got the initial well data in tying 
that to the 
seismic understanding the best depletion methodology, water 
flood versus natural depletion. Therefore, what the optimal infrastructure 
that drives that.
 
And then what pre
-
investment would you put on the infrastructure there are 
other fault blocks in the ar
ea, but I think we are genuinely excited about it 
because the thesis would prove out there is good Santonian reservoir in the 
area. We've got a well which fully met the expectations now we've got to get 
to an optimized development scheme, which allows us t
o fully exploit it. So 
that's the 
--
 
those are the next steps and we're looking forward to do the 
work.
 
I don't think we will need another well to appraise it, I think we've got the 
data we need, the 
--
 
ultimately the test now is to optimize the configurat
ion 
to ensure that we've got the best value for today and tomorrow.
 
Charles Meade
 
Got it, thank you for that. And then if I could reference up slide eight and 
you guys put all that interesting seismic on that on your discovery there at 
Orca. Can you give u
s a little bit feel what was the 
--
 
obviously it's a big 
thing to find the Albian reservoir. But how much 
--
 
was that the bigger 
surprise, or was the bigger surprise finding that Santonian down structure 
like that?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Both, I wouldn't say surprise
d but I think it was a 
--
 
it was an important well 
because we wanted to test it to the fullest extent we could have drilled as 
you can see 
--
 
we could have drilled it sort of on structure in a more 

 
is it would have 
resulted in another well to be drilled later. So we drilled a well, which we felt 
was optimally placed to demonstrate the quality of the Albian and to 
demonstrate both a structural and stratigraphic trap.
 
So we 
--
 
I believe it was an 
appropriate exploration well, not without risk if 
you like, but actually with a good result. It's actually de
-
risk both of those 
elements now and of course there are read across obviously from Marsouin 
to Orca to other two other prospects in the area Dauph
in and Baleine. And 
those four are the BirAllah hub, which ultimately has the potential now with 
well described calibrated AVO that supports the upper end of the resource 
we've talked about.

Thank you.

Our 
next question is from Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Hey, thank you for the very thorough update this morning. The first question 
I have is just around Ghana production, I think year
-
to
-
date, I think you 
guys ackno
wledge it's been more sluggish than what was initially 
anticipated. To the extent you could talk about it. How do you think we are 
in terms of course correction? And how should we think about the outlook 
for Ghana production going into 2020?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Ye
s. Thanks, Neil. Look it sort of stand back from it all. We would anticipate 
2019 production to be around 90,000 barrels a day gross for Jubilee, which 
is clearly lower than forecast. And the primary issue is the rising GOR, gas 
handling is therefore the c
onstraint if you can 
--
 
clearly, if you can handle 

 
We had hoped that the gas enhancement project will be done in 4Q that's 
now been deferred by the operator to the first quarter of 2020. So once 
tha
t's carried out, clearly the ability to process more gas should lead to 
higher oil production in 2020. And directionally we would see, it rising in sort 
of 95,000 to 100,000 barrels a day gross without enhanced gas handling.
 
I think Jubilee, I think our vi
ew was gross production would be around 
62,000 barrels of oil per day and then for 2020 turn relatively flat again 
there. So I think that's the outlook and I think ultimately it is about the 
Jubilee. It's not a reservoir issue, it's not the well, got plent
y of wells, 
reservoir is performing. We've just got to make sure that we can manage 
the GOR, which will ultimately provide plenty of opportunity to improve the 
oil rate.
 
Neil Mehta
 
That's great. And the follow up question and this might be a question for 
J
amie. But with now you're trailing four quarters of earnings positive and 
with the liquidity of the stock having improved are you guys eligible for 
index inclusion? Can you talk a little bit about some of the parameters 
recognizing that you can't necessari
ly influence the outcome, but just so we 
can frame that out?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Neil, I'll tell you that. Yes, as you rightly say, the primary parameters 
are U.S. domiciled, which we are now. I think another parameter is the 
liquidity of the stock, which as 
you rightly point out has reached the 
threshold with the selldown of the private equity owners earlier this year. 
Another key parameter is the 
--
 
in aggregate your last 12 months of 
earnings need to be positive and the last quarter positive.
 
So I think tho
se are all 
--
 
those are the parameters. And I think we believe 
with 
--
 
we've met those. But as you rightly say, thereafter, it's really a black 
box in terms of the decisions of how and when the index inclusion would 
occur. So obviously, I can't comment on 
that and neither can Jamie. But the 
--
 
those are three key parameters and obviously the results today were an 
important step forward in that.
 
Neil Mehta
 
That's great. Thanks, guys.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Richard Tulli
s, Capital One Securities. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks. Good morning, Andy. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Going back 
to the selldown process Mauritania and Senegal, could you provide a little 
more detail on what the go for
ward plans are with the new data in hand? 
Will you reopen a data room? What could be the potential time? And maybe 
a few comments, if you could on how the process was going leading into the 
drilling of the well? How many participants and bids were submitte
d, et 
cetera?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Thanks, Richard. Yes, it's been an interesting year for us. I think there's 
--
 
have been a lot of interest. And I think the interest is against sort of 
mixed background I would say. The positives are around a year where the 
e
nergy transition and the pressure on companies to be relevant in that 
process. And where gas I believe will play an important role as a fuel has 
become more and more important to certain companies. So, of course, 
that's created genuine interest of how peop
le can fit our resource and our 
projects in Mauritania and Senegal into their portfolios.
 
And then people have pushed and has negative being the LNG prices in the 
year which was certainly under pressure. I think, it's never good to do it in 
that environment, but actually, this is production that comes on in 2022. 
Therefore, people are looking b
eyond that, and they see a resource which is 
ultimately low cost. It's got a very competitive price into Europe, compete 
absolutely with U.S. Gulf Coast gas.
 
And it's, importantly got no CO2 in it. And as you think of competing 
projects around the world, a
s they meet the criteria set for the energy 
transition that is a key criteria. And then we've also had all the news as it 
were on the well results. And we open the data rooms pretty early after 
February after the Capital Markets Day. So a lot has occurred 
since.
 
So I think the process really is about allowing people to come back in, look 
at the new data. And actually, I think Al's question at the beginning was 
important, I think we've got three very distinct assets now, which have 
different attractions to d
ifferent buyers, which creates additional optionality 
in the process. So, I think we've been in very different place if we haven't 
had the success with the drill bit. But we always felt we would. But actually 
getting people acquainted with the assets and n
ow the ability to come back 
and look at them will be an important part of the process going forward.
 
Richard Tullis
 

going to be additional drilling at Mauritania Senegal related
 
to the LNG 
projects in 2020. But could you talk maybe what the potential additional 
Cape could be? Now that you'll retain 30% of the project into 2020 
compared to maybe how you were thinking of it previously?
 
Andy Inglis
 

essarily going to retain 30% going in. I 
think we need to sort of let the process play through 2020. What I think 

 
what we should do we will do is we will come back to you in beginning of the 
year with our guidance for CapEx in 2020 to cover that. We clea
rly have the 
carry from BP which covers a portion of that through 2020. So if it is an 
effect and the scenario you have played out. It would be a backend effect.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Okay, that's all for me. Thanks, Andy.

Our next question is from David
 
Round at BMO Capital. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
David Round
 
Hi, Andy. I appreciate you might not be in a position to comment on the 
operators' decision to defer the gas enhancement project to Jubilee. But is 
there any thinking as the future proof
ing that work by adding even more gas 
handling capacity now? And then can I just ask on EG, you talk about 
development concepts, post the discovery there. Am I right in assuming 
those development concepts are all tiebacks or is there any thinking as to 
sta
ndalone given the additional resource that may be around the area?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good questions, David. Yes. Again, the most important thing to emphasize 

bigger. Reserve rep
lacement has been very strong year
-
on
-
year. The 
fundamental issue is sort of gas management and there are two ways that 
which you can sort of deal with the problem. Actually three ways in which 
you deal with the problem. The first is as you say is sort of 
increase the gas 
handling and what we need to do is absolutely sort of, our goal with the 
operator has been to maximize the increment that we can make now to 
provide us with the as you say sort of the optimal solution that de
-
risk the 
decision going forwar
d, so the gas is no longer the constraint.
 
The other ways in which you can help mitigate the issue is clearly water 
injection increasing the downhill pressures, reliable water injection will also 
mitigate the GOR. And then the third thing that is absolutel
y in the works is 
to export more gas from Jubilee and to be used in domestic power 
production. And there is a power plant that has actually been relocated 
adjacent to the [indiscernible] gas plant, which will actually take gas from 
Jubilee. So that will en
hance the gas off take.
 
So the combination 
--
 
those are the three parameters that are being juggled 
to ensure that we've got the optimal oil production. So I'm not negative 
about the future, but we do need to sort of see the gas handling capacity 
increased
, we need to see water injection will ought to be improved and we 
need to see more gas off take those together provide a significant upside.
 
David Round
 
Okay.
 
Andy Inglis
 
And then, so I think the answer there is plenty of opportunities to improve 
the 
situation, we just need to sort of quite get it done. And then on EG, the 
reason we went in was to 
--
 
to EG was to look at things which we felt could 
be tiebacks. I would say today on the basis of what we know today that 
would be the optimal scheme because
 
we have additional capacity at Ceiba.
 
And therefore I think that's the way you should think about it.
 
The inventory, we're building of future prospectivity they could be different, 
but I think the objective for S
-
5 was to demonstrate a resource that has 
t
ieback potential thereby has very positive economics, both in terms of its 
quality of its returns and the cash accretive nature of the investment where 

therefore very positive c
ash characteristics.
 
David Round
 
Okay, got it. Thanks, Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, David.

Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for taking the question. Going back to 
the Sao Tome and Suriname 
plans for 2020, can you just remind, do you have a carry on that acreage as 
well?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. And I agree there was a question on that, which I didn't answer actually. 
So let me get back to the timing. Let me just answer your 
question more 
broadly, Pavel, as well, because I think it's important that I come back to 
that point. So in 2020 we have planned a well in Suriname targeting Walker, 
a carbonate opportunity collectively as a group, the partners have decided to 
defer the we
ll 2021 and the rationale for that is there's a lot going on in the 
basin at the moment, you all the key wells that have been drilled, new data 
is going to come from that and I think it's important that we take the time to 
fully digest that information and
 
drill the best well at the right time.
 
And I don't think we're in that position. We've got no time clock on the 
exploration program. So quote, we're not in a rush. So I think this is one 
way it is important to be absolutely disciplined about the capital b
ecause 
today we don't want to have any regrets about the well that we drill we're 

opportunity to maximize our knowledge and therefore the deployment of our 
capital.
 
On EG, the seis
mic acquisition is obviously completed, the data is coming in 
and we can see good opportunity there. So that remains a very valid target 
for 2020.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, that's helpful. On Tortue, so you've been in construction now for 
roughly a year and I'
m curious given the kind of the looseness across the 
oilfield service value chain. Are you perhaps seeing cost savings versus what 
you've originally 
--
 
you and BP had originally budgeted?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, no, I actually think that those savings were incorp
orated when we 
obviously went out to bid and then put the major contracts in place. There 
are elements of it which are fixed costs, you've actually taken that 
opportunity in the supply chain when we did that and I think the overall 
contracting strategy tha
t the BP has deployed is being really well done. So I 
think, those elements have sort of been captured the issue now is sort of no 
changes and that's ultimately where projects sort of run into any trouble at 
this point in that cycle, where the variable cos
ts could increase equally well, 
with no changes the variable cost could come down.
 
But I think what I would say to me the most important part about the 
process is that in terms of execution, given as you say the looseness in the 
sector is you get the A tea
ms from the contractors. So there has never been 
better time to actually construct. And then, we clearly have not contracted 
yet four Phases 2 and 3. And so you have the savings, I think what we've 
learned from Phase 1, we can take across Phases 2 and 3 an
d look to 
continue to drive down those capital costs.
 
So the pace of the project has been done in a very thoughtful way where 
we're capturing the looseness in today's market ensuring that we contract 
well, and actually the final part is take the learning's
 
from Phase 1 and then 
apply them into Phases 2 and 3 lot to play for.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Yes, okay. Appreciate it.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Third Quarter 2015 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, 
let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance and 
Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which is available on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com Web site. We anticipate filing 
our 10
-
Q with 
the SEC later today which will also be available on our Web 
site.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared 
comments, we will have a question
-
and
-
ans
wer session. Consistent with 
prior calls, I request that you ask only ask one primary question and one 
follow
-
up question. This will ensure we get to everyone on the call. If there 
are questions we aren't able to get to within our 45 minute timeframe, 
plea
se contact me later today.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
ea
rnings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Management believes such 
measures are important in looking at the Company's historical and future

At this time, I'll turn the c
all over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal, and good morning everyone. Through the quarter we 
maintained our disciplined approach to executing our strategy and are well 
positioned both financially with a strong and motivated organization to 
continue to exe
cute our plans to create value for shareholders. As I go 
through my remarks today, there are three points I want to emphasize. 
First, we have a consistent, proven business model that has been executed 
with discipline over the last decade and is designed to
 
create shareholder 
value in a low commodity price environment.
 
Second, we have a world class production and development asset in Ghana 

gross production within 15 months which will 
continue to grow our cash flow. 
Third, we believe we have one of the best exploration portfolios in the 
industry and they are focused on maturing our existing portfolio and adding 
strategic new ventures. In addition to the Mauritania and Senegal basin 
whic
h we opened earlier this year, we have continued to high grade the 
portfolio with additional high quality basin opening opportunities.
 
Our first point of differentiation is our consistent, proven business strategy. 
While the oil and gas industry is facing 
challenging times today with many 
companies refocusing strategy and reducing spend, Kosmos remains focused 
on executing the same disciplined strategy with its creative success since the 
Company was founded over a decade ago. We can do that because our 
busi
ness was designed to compete and most importantly to create value in a 
lower commodity price environment. It is only when commodity prices drop 
that you see which companies have been managed for the long
-
term.
 
As a result our differentiated strategy, asset
s and balance sheet are 
distinguished from our peers. Over the last few years, we prudently build a 
strong balance sheet with $1.9 billion of liquidity ahead of exploration 
success. Most importantly, we understood that if we were to have the kind of 
succes
s we anticipated, we needed a balance sheet that would allow us to 
execute our plans. Since Jubilee started producing in late 2010, we have 
consistently used the high margin cash flow to reduce debt and build 
liquidity. Within the last 18 months we have ac
cessed the bond market and 
extended the majority of our debt facilities adding additional liquidity and 
diversifying our sources of capital.
 
Last month, we completed our semi
-
annual redetermination of our reserve 
based lending facility, which resulted in n
o change to our borrowing base, 
and is a testament of the quality of our assets. In 2015, we maintained that 
discipline and financial prudence. Through the year we've grown our net 
commodity and hedge position to secure our future cash flow and exited the 
quarter with $11.6 million barrels hedged with a mark
-
to
-
market value of 
$228 million. Given our growing activity set in Mauritania and Senegal, we 
recently renegotiated our drillship contract by reducing our day rate and 
extending the term. These proactiv
e steps will enhance our liquidity, reduce
-
costs, and enable us to continue executing our exploration program.
 
We continue to believe that deepwater exploration provides a competitive 
source of hydrocarbon supply. What the market demonstrates that over the
 
past year is that to move projects forward, you can't just find resource, 
quality counts, that is why our strategy has consistently targeted large 
resources with good fiscal terms at the low end of the cost curve. That has 
been our focus since Kosmos was 
created and we are continually high 
grading our portfolio to invest in assets that deliver value in a lower price 
environment.
 
I'll now shift to our Ghana operations where we remain on track to deliver 
over 2,000 barrels of oil per day growth in the next 1
5 months with high 
quality cash flow. As you are all aware early in July a gas compressor on the 
Jubilee FPSO experienced unplanned downtime resulting in reduced oil 
production and a temporary limit in our ability to export gas. In early August 
we fixed th
e issues and have since returned to normal operations with oil 
production near the FPSO plateau. Excluding the compressor downtime our 
oil sales volume averaged approximately 108,000 barrels of oil per day and 
gas exports averaged over 85 million cubic fee
t per day.
 
Industry experience has shown and has proven the mantra that big fields 
get bigger and the data we are receiving for Jubilee suggests it's no 
exception. We'll continue on the full field development plan for Greater 
Jubilee, which we expect to su
bmit by year
-
end. The plan is expected to 
include all future plays of Jubilee, which will target infill drilling in reservoirs 
currently in production, incremental reservoirs in Jubilee that are currently 
not producing, and the tie back of the Mahogany and
 
Teak discoveries into 
the Jubilee FPSO. Once the plan has approved the partnership we will have 
more opportunity to grow the value of the asset. Moreover through time 
Kosmos will be able to book reserves associated with those additional 
resources.
 
The TEN
 
project is now approximately 75% complete and remains on time 
and on budget to deliver first oil in the third quarter of 2016. The full 
development well is expected to commence completion operation shortly, 
and the FPSO construction is proceeding well. We
 
are expected to sail from 
Singapore in early 2016, at a very high level of completion. Combined with 
Jubilee production the TEN development is expected to push Ghana 
production to more than 200,000 barrels of oil per day within the next 15 
months. With gr
owing production and reducing capital, we expect Ghana will 
deliver significant free cash flow in 2017 and beyond.
 
I'll now shift from our Ghana assets to provide an update on our portfolio 
basin opening opportunities. In terms of exploration our portfolio
 
has never 
been stronger in the history of the Company, and there has never been a 
better time in recent years to add new opportunities. In Mauritania and 
Senegal, we have a true super major scale positioned at approximately 
40,000 square kilometers that w
e opened with our initial Tortue success last 
quarter. That is equal to approximately 1,700 Gulf of Mexico blocks, which is 
greater than 10 times the size of our initial Ghana acreage and we own 60% 
of it. We continue to believe the basin has significant o
il and gas potential 
and we will test the prospectivity through a targeted program.
 
I'll remind you that we have two clear objectives for the basin. First, we plan 
to commercialize our Tortue discovery with an efficient appraisal plan and 
second we plan to
 
unlock the rest of the basin targeting the liquids potential. 
Given the result of the Tortue
-
1 well, which demonstrate the close 
calibration of our seismic have found excellent reservoir. Our goal remains to 
confirm 16 plus Tcf of resource with minimum ca
pital through an efficient 
appraisal program. This should demonstrate that we de
-
risked adequate 
resource to underpin a world class LNG projects. Later in the fourth quarter, 
we anticipate spudding the first appraisable well in Tortue called Grumble 
which 
will task the continuity of the reservoir to Senegal. This will likely be 
followed by two other delineation wells. We expect this program should be 
complete by the third quarter of next year.
 
Our second objective is to unlock the full potential of the basi
n, which will be 
done through select wells targeting a number of different structural trends. 
Our first test is already underway the Marsouin exploration well was spud on 
August of 28th and results are expected later this quarter. In addition to 
Marsouin w
e anticipate drilling three other wells which will specifically target 
liquids, one in Northern Mauritania and two in Southern Senegal where we 
believe the same source rocks at the Tortue reservoir are very shallow and 
that will potentially more liquids pr
one. In all, the next 18 months we plan to 
have a seventh high quality high impact exploration appraisal catalyst that 
will help us gain a better understanding of the basin, and its resource 
potential.
 

ging our portfolio to 
open the next basin. We continue to mature and high
-
grade our portfolios to 
create the best possible set of basin opening opportunities. As part of our 
continuous high
-
grading process, we recently decided to exit Ireland which 
offered
 
good fiscal terms but where the geologic risk is now justifying 

taking the advantage of the current environment and are leveraging the 
learnings from our recent success in the Cre
taceous and the Atlantic Margin 
to add quality assets. The industry downturn provides easier access and 
lower costs allowing Kosmos to enter new plays that were not historically 
available to us at competitive terms. This counted physical approach is a 
fund
amental component of our business strategy and puts Kosmos in an 
excellent position to continue to grow.
 

opportunities that have good fiscal terms, low firm commitments and are 
competitiv

Gulf of Guinea through our new acreage position in Sao Tome where we 
secured an entry position of scale with fiscal terms. Industry activity in Sao 
Tome, unlike Mauritania and Ghana have bee
n limited to mainly sub
-
commercial discoveries in the inboard while the outboard remains mostly 
unexplored. Our acreage position is outboard of a proven petroleum system 
currently in production, to save OTM complex offshore neighboring 
Equatorial Guinea, a
 
system first discovered by the same exploration team 
that founded Kosmos. This is an area we know well and are looking to grow 
our position in Sao Tome beyond this initial entry position.
 
And with that I'll now turn the call over to Tom to update you on t
he 
financials.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thanks, Andy and good morning everybody. Financial performance for the 
third quarter was very strong. Kosmos exited the third quarter of 2015 with 
1.9 billion of liquidity and 517 million of net debt, which was down slightly 
com
pared to the previous quarter. As Andy mentioned, during the quarter 
we completed our semi
-
annual borrowing base redetermination and we 
retained full access to the $1.5 billion RBL facility. Our balance sheet and 
liquidity remained strong allowing us to co
ntinue to focus on executing our 
strategy. We finished the third quarter with two crude oil liftings generating 
oil revenues of $97 million. This excludes derivative settlements of $61 
million over the quarter.
 
When you add our revenue to our settled hedge
s in the quarter it reflects a 
realized price of approximately $85.09 per barrel. For the quarter, we 
generated net income of $60 million or $0.15 per diluted share, adjusting for 
the impact of one
-
time items that affect the comparability the Company 
gener
ated adjusted net income of $7 million or $0.02 per diluted share for 
the third quarter of 2015.
 
On the cost side operating expense for the quarter was $23 million or 
$12.52 per barrel sold versus 15 million or $10.46 per barrel sold in the 
third quarter o
f 2014. The increase in operating expense is primarily related 
to increased sales volumes, as well as non
-
routine maintenance on the 
FPSO, including expenses to repair the gas compressor. Exploration expense 
for the quarter was $19 million reflecting ongoi
ng seismic processing 
primarily in Senegal and Portugal.
 
General and administrative costs for the quarter were 27 million compared 
with $41 million incurred during the second quarter of 2015. The sequential 
decrease was driven by lower equity
-
based compens
ation expense and lower 
cost during the quarter. Depreciation expense was $36 million or $19.46 per 
barrel of oil sold versus $25.61 per barrel sold in the third quarter of 2014. 
Income tax expense for the third quarter was $62 million. This amount was 
imp
acted primarily by tax expense of $50 million associated with the mark
-
to
-
market gain of our commodity hedges during the quarter, the majority of 
which was deferred.
 
During the quarter we spent $197 million on CapEx bringing our year
-
to
-
date CapEx 
total to $515 million which is net of previously announced 
Mauritania farm
-
out proceeds. For the full year our CapEx forecast remains 

of our production guidance for the year, we are r
aising our full year guidance 
to nine cargos compared to the previously issued guidance of eight based on 
strong production levels at Jubilee and timing of cargos. The size of the 
cargos can vary due to operational considerations, but for the remainder of 
the year we expect liftings to average 950,000 barrels.
 
Furthermore, we expect operating expense on a per barrel oil basis to be 
lower during the fourth quarter with a sequential decline to a level more in 
line with the second quarter, absent any additiona
l non
-
routine 
maintenance. We exited the third quarter in a very strong financial position, 
despite the macroeconomic environment and as Andy said we continue to be 
good stewards of capital and focus on opportunities that add value to the 
Company. And with
 

 
Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question
-
and
-
answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, in the interest of 
time and so t
hat other participants have the opportunity to ask their 
questions during the conference as well, we ask that you please limit 
yourself to one question and one follow
-
up question during the Q&A. 
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the
 
line of Ed 
Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.
 
Ed Westlake
 

wondering if there is a breakeven again that you can share for the projects 
and still seems l
ike costs are coming down. So maybe just run through how 
that project is becoming on its competitive, should be fairly competitive?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes we are getting closer to and just to remind you that the next phase of 
the development in Ghana of the Jubil
ee will include not only sort of Jubilee 

project, it's clearly leveraging off the existing infrastructure, the Jubilee 
FPSO. So as you sort of look around the world of projects that 
do compete in 
our low price environment, this is absolutely one that does that maybe 
primarily because of the quality of the resource but also because you got the 
primary investment in the FPSO was already there. So it is a solid project 
and is one that we
 
believe is obviously very competitive.
 
Ed Westlake
 
But do you have a rough breakeven?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I am not going to give you the breakeven, but what I will say is that the 
breakeven is sort of not dissimilar to the breakeven of the initial project.
 
Ed Wes
tlake
 
And then I love how you're going to go for less labor twice, but maybe give 
us a view of the potential resources if I mean I appreciate it's still very early 
but on the Sao Tome? Thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes look Sao Tome is interesting it's absolutely at
 
the fairway of what 
Kosmos does well. This is a basin that we believe has been underexplored, 
primarily the inboard it is an area that we know well from our seller 

of deals now an 
entry position that is 14,000 square kilometers what 600
-

fundamental concepts are very similar to Mauritania we but that the quality 

ble on public demand 
clearly gives us encouragement at various 
--
there are good structure there. 
So look I think this is a great example of Kosmos continuing to execute its 
strategy, and it's all about getting big acreage positions, being always so 
you can
 
secure good fiscal terms and then having the space and running 
room with low commitments to do the exploration right where we will start 

to move forward to a drilling program. So
 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Gamboa 
with TPH Partners. Please proceed with your questions.
 
David Gamboa
 
So I have a one question please. So I appreciate that you guys have 
maintained sizeab
le through your strategy over the past years which have 
been quite successful for you guys. But now on the like of acting counter 

the appraisal or pre
-
FID space that are might be
 
trading at a potentially 
cheaper or similar cost to which it would require finding new barrels from an 
exploration perspective. I am just interested in knowing if how you guys 
think about deploying capital into buying pre
-
FID barrels versus putting 
more c
apital into exploration with that or anything you would be interested 
in doing? Thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes I think it is an interestingly timed I think fundamentally you have got to 
come back to the key question of ensuring of our capital and human 
resources 
are being deployed in the optimal way. I think we have a very 
good set of opportunities internally which we've accessed at very low cost to 
say term they wanted that we just talked about is an example of that so as 
you look at barrels that are pre
-
FID we h
ave to be confident that in the 
capital sense they compete with what we have, so we are not ruling 
anything at the moment but to rule it in it has to be competitive from a 
capital allocation perspective.
 
And I think the second thing that we are very rigoro
us about is that it has to 
be something that we can add value to so that has to be a resource that you 
could grow where there is a resource base that has additional potential, so 
we are putting a very
-

is 

have to ensure that they compete with anything that we have internally I 
think you get a sense from my remarks that we've got a very full exploration 
portfolio things that are of 
high quality that we've accessed at very low cost 
and that we can explore efficiently so that's the comparison that we are 
using as we evaluate inorganic opportunities.
 
David Gamboa
 
And lastly just a follow
-
up on the Ireland decision pulling out of that co
untry 
can you give us a bit more color upon why or what's the main thing that 
failed, what's the main issue there in terms of drilling there any cost figure 
that made you pull out of the country? Thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well David and again it's really unlike 
to the question that you just asked 
which is I believe that you get to a quality exploration outcome by creating 
quality through choice always having more things to do when you have the 
capital to do it. And I think Ireland was simply a process of high gra
ding as 
we look through the opportunity set that we have the prospectivity that we 

therefore we made the decision to withdraw.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the 
line of John Herrlin with Société 
Générale. Please proceed with your questions. John Herrlin your line is live, 
please proceed with your questions. Please check if you are un
-
muted. Okay, 
well our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with 
R
aymond James. Please proceed with your questions.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
I appreciate a slightly more granular guidance on the timing for TEN startup 
do you have a sense at this point of what the kind of trajectory of production 
ramp will be looked like to get to
 
the target capacity?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Look one of the basic sort of parameters that will impact that I think that we 
will have I mean I think current view is we will have 10 if not 11 of the wells 
completed so there will be a full well stock so and that well s
tock will be 
more than sufficient to sell the FPSO capacity. So I actually think that would 
really be dependent on the initial reliability of the facility and demonstrating 
a reliable up time in terms of in my due event today I believe the projects 
has bee
n very well executed to
-
date. The FPSO is leaving Singapore at a 
very high level of completion and so one expects that the level of pre
-
commissioning that was taken place to be good so I anticipate that we will 
have a relatively sound build up to that plat
eau rate and our view is that 
certainly by the end of 2016 that will start in 2017 we should be able to 
deliver reliably at the plateau.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
And then slightly broader question given that you operate in a pretty diverse 
set of countries have you
 
had any discussions with any of the host 
governments to
-
date about potentially revising the fiscal terms in light of the 
commodity price environment to make them perhaps a little more lucrative 
or generous than they were originally?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Initially 
the only answer to develop capital is no and why and I actually 
believe that the countries that we are in we've negotiated in a very 
competitive terms from day 1. Therefore they didn't visit to the sort of world 

 
governments and actually sort of 
plead your case when you're already in a sort of relatively sound position. So 
we're not suffering and then not really as I've said in my remarks it has 
been a fundamental part of our strategy is to ensure that when we ent
er a 
country we're targeting full cycle breakevens in the $30 to $50 range. So if it 

need to have that renegotiation. And second I'm a big believer that what 
comes around goes aroun
d and I think we're expecting that governments 
honor agreements and the reverse works for us. So now we have it and I 
think that the fundamental why we have it is because we've got terms that 
work in today's environment.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Ou
r next question comes from the line of John 
Herrlin, Société Générale. Please go ahead with your questions.
 
John Herrlin
 
With sands in the head can you give us a sense of what the contract terms 
are like vis
-
à
-
vis Ghana?
 
Andy Inglis
 
In Sao Tome?
 
John Herrl
in
 
Yes.
 
Andy Inglis
 

 
John Herrlin
 
Well I don't expect specifics, that is why I wanted a comment.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Those are very competitive John. As we look at it in terms of the quartile of 
that countries we ar
e in Sao Tome would be up there and one that would 
absolutely sort of match the Ghana's fiscal terms.
 
John Herrlin
 
For the wells that you're drilling the seven catalysts that you mentioned, 

-

 
Andy 
Inglis
 

will vary from well
-
to
-
well but the average is 90.
 
John Herrlin
 
And has Chevron come back to get it on Tortue?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, and they are not required to. They have 
essentially 90 days from when 
will completed the Marsouin well, so we'd anticipate them coming back to us 
sort of the end of the first quarter.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton with RBC. Please 
proceed with your questions.
 
Al St
anton
 
Just quickly on Marsouin, is there anything more that you can say about the 
weather in terms of being on schedule and on budget?
 
Andy Inglis
 
The well is on schedule and on budget. [Multiple Speakers], yes go ahead Al.
 
Al Stanton
 
You wouldn't say it's
 
going to be concluded in November rather than Q4 or 
anything like that?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, I think in the guidance we've given to the market which remains the 
guidance says it was spud on the 28th of August and it is a 90 day well. So 
you can figure out the 
timing on that.
 
Al Stanton
 
And then just finally then on in terms of being counter cyclical it's an 
opportunity and also a problem so people like ConocoPhillips were saying the 
other day that they didn't want to be in the deepwater. So does that 
create 
a bit of a dilemma for you in terms of looking for an operator for developing 
your fields you're looking to sell on or divest after the exploration phase or 
conversely does it create an opportunity in the event that you might seek to 
operate some of
 
your future discoveries?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well now I mean I think that sort of its one companies view and I think we 
need to be careful about what motivates that company to say that. I firmly 
believe the future growth of supply will come from both the unconven
tionals 
in the U.S. the shale plays and it will come from deepwater. Deepwater 
occupies around 7% or 8% of the world supply today, and as you look at 


ing at unconventional or deepwater is that 
it is the best projects in both of those areas have more progressed, and 

U.S., the best basins with the best rocks are actually going for
ward, and I 
think the same will be true in the deepwater where fields that have great 
reservoir will have scale, that have good fiscal terms will proceed. So I'm of 

and actually
 

changed. So from that perspective when we look at the opportunities the 
Greater Tortue appraisal will create and we look at the super
-
majors and 
their need to grow. I think we have a very attractive
 
project.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Petr Grishchenko with Imperial 
Capital. Please proceed with your questions.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Can you please quantify the amendment of the Atwood Achiever contract, 
and also remind us what the perc
entage of decline in their rate represents?
 
Andy Inglis
 

happened is that we added an additional year to the contract, it's originally a 
three
-

 
it, so there were two years to 
go, we added a third year, we added the third year of additional year at 
$285,000 per day that 285 then gets averaged with the remaining two years 
which are at 595 and if you do the math on that you get to an average rate 
of
 
495, yes?
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
And do you contemplate amending the cargo lease contracts for the TEN 
project and would it be the manageable rate card you could obtain?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Can you just repeat the question Petr?
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Do you 
contemplate amending the FSPO lease for the TEN project?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of 
Sergey Bolshakov with Invest Asset Management. Please go ahead wit
h your 
questions.
 
Sergey Bolshakov
 
The question is from the fixed income perspective. If you can please 
comment on the covenants of the reserve base facility, has there been any 
changes, have you added any new covenants, are you still computing the 
debt co
ver ratio based on the last 12 months or have you changed it to the 
annualized numbers? Are all covenants doing maintenance or have there 
been any changes there?
 
Andy Inglis
 
So yes this time there have not been any changes to any of the covenants. 
All the 
covenants as we had, as they have been previously in the documents 
still remain, so there is 
--
 
the redetermination did not have any covenant 
change whatsoever.

Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our second quarter earnings release, which is available 
on the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com Web
-
site. We anticipate 
filing our 10
-
Q with
 
the SEC later today which will also be available on our 
Web
-
site.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared 
comments, we will have a question
-
and
-
a
nswer session. Consistent with 
prior calls, I request that you ask only one primary question and one follow
-
up question. This will help ensure we get to everyone on the call. If there are 
questions we aren't able to get to within the 45 minute timeframe, p
lease 
contact me later today.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in our
 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
Company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
refe
rred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'll turn th
e call over to Andy.
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal, and good morning everybody. Through the quarter we 
maintained our disciplined approach to executing our strategy and are w4ell
-
positioned both financially and organizationally to execute our plants and 
cr
eate value for shareholders. As I go through my remarks today, there are 
four points I want to emphasize. First, our Ghana assets continue to grow 
and we remain on track to double gross production by 2017. Second, after 
our initial success at Tortue
-
1, our
 
plan for creating an accelerated value 
from Mauritania and Senegal is taking shape. Third, our exploration portfolio 
continues to mature generating additional near
-
term high
-
quality 
opportunities to create significant value. And finally, our continued foc
us on 
financial discipline and maintaining a quality balance sheet.
 
In Ghana, production continues to grow from the Jubilee Field averaging 
approximately 108,000 barrels of oil per day sales during the second quarter 
resulting in two Kosmos liftings as exp
ected. It's important to note that 
selling around 108,000 barrels of oil per day means we're actually producing 
on average through the quarter approximately 113,000 barrels of oil per day 
meted. Difference between meted and sales production is shrinkage fr
om the 
oil separation process and typically results in around a 4% difference. We've 
consistently been within 5,000 to 10,000 barrels of oil per day at the 
nameplate FPSO capacity, so we've been making good progress on this 
front.
 
We also saw reliable gas 
exports during the quarter with export volumes 
regularly in the range of 70 million to 80 million cubic feet of gas per day. 
The expected increase in gas
-
fired power generation capacity at the Aboadze 
power plant in the third quarter should enable us to co
ntinue to increase gas 
exports.
 
As some of you are aware, early in July gas compressed on the Jubilee FPSO 
experienced unplanned downtime limiting our ability to export gas, which 
reduced oil production to approximately 65,000 barrels of oil per day. We're
 
now in the final stages of restarting gas exports having changed out the gas 
compressor bundle and expect to return production to full capacity shortly. 
We don't believe this issue will materially impact annual production. As a 
result, we are maintaining 
our guidance for 2015 gross Jubilee production of 
100,000 barrels of oil per day sales and eight cargoes net to Kosmos.
 
In addition, work continues on the full field development plan to Greater 
Jubilee. This will include all future phases of Jubilee which 
will target infill 
drilling in the currently producing reservoirs, two additional reservoir 
intervals and the Mahogany, Teak and Akasa discoveries. Discussions are 
ongoing with the Government of Ghana and we remain on track to submit 
the full field develop
ment plan to the government before the end of the 
year.
 
The TEN project is now approximately 65% complete and remains on time 
and on budget to deliver first oil in the third quarter of 2016. While 
completion work began in the second quarter, we have comple
ted two wells 
and are nearing completion of the third of a set of 11 wells anticipated to be 
online at first oil. We recently took advantage of available rig capacity and 
finished drilling the 11th well which will provide additional redundancy to 
support p
lateau production levels.
 
The top
-
hole section of this well was drilled prior to the last ruling in late 
April and we anticipate that with this increased well capacity, we should be 
in a position to keep the field at plateau through the final and last ruli
ng 
which we anticipate in the second half of 2017.
 
I'll now shift from Ghana operations to an update on the basin opening 
Tortue discovery and our plans to maximizing value creation from our assets 
in Mauritania and Senegal. We are now at the beginning of 
a season of 
important wells in this region. The Tortue
-
1 exploration well opened up the 
outboard petroleum system in Mauritania and Senegal and found a 
significant natural gas resource. As a result, we're focusing our near
-
term 
program on two goals, advanc
ing the Tortue discovery towards 
commercialization by a disciplined appraisal program, and fully unlocking the 
resource potential of the basin and evaluating the liquids potential.
 
To advance the Tortue discovery towards commercialization, we need to 
work 
simultaneously on both below and above
-
ground priorities. It will 
involve completing the technical work to demonstrate the commercial scale 
resource, delivering a cooperation agreement between Mauritania and 
Senegal and bringing in an experienced LNG devel
opment partner. Below
-
ground, we anticipate proving a commercial threshold of resource with a 
limited number of wells. Industry experience has shown the best way to 
maximize returns on a long
-
dated asset is to minimize exposed capital and 
accelerate develo
pment and monetization.
 
While the initial discovery well derisk 5 to 12 TCF of gas, we believe the area 
has significant further derisk potential. There are movable prospects in both 
the Cenomanian and the Albian that are being calibrated by the Tortue
-
1 
we
ll with strong geophysical support. We believe we can prove a commercial 
scale LNG resource which we view to be approximately 15 TCF of gas with 
possibly as few as three additional exploration appraisal wells on Greater 
Tortue. Once that level of resources
 
is reached, we don't believe any further 
exploration of Greater Tortue will add value.
 
Our above
-
ground work is already in progress with our top priority being an 
inter
-
governmental cooperation agreement between Mauritania and Senegal. 
Given that we belie
ve the resource travel the maritime boundary between 
the two countries, we need to ensure a framework exists for developing the 
resource. I have met with President Aziz and President Sall and they both 
expressed a strong willingness to cooperate in a manne
r that moves the 
project forward for the benefit of both countries.
 
Our other above
-
ground priority will be to bring in an experienced LNG 
development partner and farm
-
down our working interest in Tortue. We 
believe this greatly derisk the development and 
will enable us to accelerate 
value from discovery. We plan to do this after we've defined the resource 
and established the basis for cooperation between the governments.
 
With these steps in place, we believe there's a clear path to demonstrate the 
value of
 
the world
-
scale Tortue discovery. Although it's still early days, when 
delineated we believe a Greater Tortue gas development will be a 
competitive project in the global LNG market driven by the scale of the 
resource, world
-
class reservoir quality and com
petitive fiscal terms.
 
Our second objective in Mauritania and Senegal is to fully unlock the 
resource potential of the basin and evaluate the liquids potential. Our 
acreage position is bounded by oil discoveries, to the North in Mauritania 
we're reaching [
indiscernible] discovery and to the south in Senegal with the 
SNE
-
1 oil discovery.
 
In addition, the initial data from the Tortue
-
1 well continues to validate our 
belief that this is not just a gas province but has potential for oil. Post to our 
geochemical
 
analysis of the fluid and formation samples recovered from the 
Tortue
-
1 support the presence of multiple source rocks working in the area. 
We plan to tap the liquids potential of our blocks with a series of up to four 
exploration wells drilled over the ne
xt 18 months.
 
The first one in the sequence is named Marsouin and will spud later this 
quarter. The Marsouin well will be drilled in the middle of our C
-
8 Block in 
Mauritania and targets a four
-
way structure with approximately 300 million 
barrels of oil eq
uivalent potential in multiple stack targets including the 
Cenomanian which is Albo supported. If successful, we believe the well can 
derisk a number of additional prospects along the trend.
 
After a series of exploration and appraisal wells in Greater Tort
ue, another 
exploration well is being planned for 2016 in our C
-
12 Block in Mauritania, 
directly outboard of [indiscernible]. Two more exploration wells are then 
planned for our [indiscernible] region in Senegal. We believe each one on 
this series has good
 
potential for liquids and will help us to fully understand 
the potential of the basin.
 
So in summary, we're planning an active Jubilee schedule over the next 18 
months in Mauritania and Senegal with each well having the potential to 
serve as a value creat
ion capitalist for the Company. The rest of our 
exploration portfolio outside of Mauritania and Senegal continues to mature 
and provides additional opportunities to grow the Company.
 
In particular I'd like to highlight Suriname where we benefited from the 
Liza
-
1 discovery made offshore Guyana and near our acreage. We believe at least 
one discovery validates our charge model and confirms the reservoir 
potential in the Upper Cretaceous which is one of the primary pre
-
drill risks. 
We are currently 50
-
50 partne
rs with Chevron in Suriname and we plan to 
farm
-
down our position late this year in anticipation of drilling the 
[indiscernible] prospect in late 2016 or early 2017.
 
As a contrary and [indiscernible] explore, we continue to believe that the 
current 
environment provides an opportunity to Kosmos to benefit while the 
industry pulls back from exploration. We plan to use this market backdrop to 
continue building our portfolio which allows us to explore based on the 
concept of quality through choice. By us
ing the learnings from our past and 
present successes, we are identifying a number of high
-
quality opportunities 
which we're pursuing.
 
Finally, I would like to comment on our strong financial position and our 
disciplined approach to managing capital. Kosmo
s has been building a strong 
liquidity position since the Company IPO
-
ed, reducing net debt from 
approximately $800 million pre
-
IPO to approximately $200 million at the end 
of 2014. This was a deliberate move in anticipation of the success from our 
[second
 
ending] [ph] exploration program to show we can maximize the 
value of any discoveries.
 
In the second quarter 2015, we continued to build liquidity through an add
-
on notes offering and the increase in extension of our corporate revolving 
credit facility. T
hese actions have boosted our liquidity by approximately 
$300 million. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of liquidity. Additionally, 
we continue to protect our balance sheet through the execution of our 
hedging program. We have 11.1 million barrels he
dged through 2017 at 
attractive prices and plan to continue adding protection.
 
Despite our strong liquidity position, I want to assure you that we are laser 
focused on ensuring that every dollar we spend is used wisely and would add 
value to the Company. M
aximum impact from minimum spend will benefit 
both return on capital and our liquidity position. We have a long record of 
being good stewards of capital and there are no plans to change that.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom to update you further on the 
financials.
 
Thomas P. Chambers
 
Thank you, Andy, and good morning everyone. Financial performance for the 
second quarter was strong and we finished the second quarter with two 
crude oil liftings generating oil revenues of $119 million. This excludes 
derivat
ive settlements of $42 million over the quarter. When you add our 
revenue to our settled hedges in the quarter, it reflects a realized price of 
approximately $82.96 per barrel.
 
For the quarter, we generated a net loss of $75 million or $0.20 per diluted 
sh
are driven largely by the non
-
cash $45 million mark to market loss on 
commodity derivatives. Adjusting for the impact of one
-
time items that 
affect the comparability including non
-
cash changes in the fair value of 
derivatives, cash settlements on derivativ
es, gain on sale of assets and other 
similar non
-
cash and nonrecurring charges, the Company generated an 
adjusted net loss of $1 million or $0 per diluted share for the second quarter 
of 2015.
 
On the cost side, operating expense in the second quarter was $
20 million or 
$10.40 per barrel sold versus $23 million or $7.87 per barrel sold in the 
second quarter of 2014. The higher per barrel cost reflects the fact that last 
year we lifted three cargoes in the quarter versus two in the current quarter. 
Exploratio
n expense for the quarter was $15 million reflecting ongoing 
seismic and processing charges.
 
General and administrative costs for the quarter were $41 million compared 
to $39 million incurred during the first quarter of 2015. General and 
administrative cos
ts during the quarter were impacted by the timing of 
recognition of our stock
-
based compensation awards. Completion and 
depreciation expense was $38 million or $19.29 per barrel of oil sold versus 
$23.85 per barrel sold in the second quarter of 2014.
 
Incom
e tax expense for the second quarter was $25 million. The majority of 
the amount was related to one
-
time deferred taxes on U.S. income incurred 
as the result of divesting of equity compensation associated with the 
Company's IPO. This expense was partially 
offset by a deferred tax benefit of 
$16 million associated with the mark to market change in our commodity 
hedges.
 
During the quarter, we spent $150 million on CapEx which brings us to a 
first half total of $318 million. We received approximately $29 milli
on of cash 
proceeds associated with our previously disclosed Mauritania farm
-
out which 
is [indiscernible] against our total CapEx. For the full year, our CapEx 
forecast remains at $800 million and we are being disciplined about 
managing to that budget. Tha
t said, we expect some CapEx to shift from 
Ghana to exploration as our mix of activity evolves in the second half.
 
Kosmos exited second quarter of 2015 with $1.9 billion of liquidity as Andy 
indicated, and $531 million of net debt compared to $1.7 billion 
of liquidity 
and $407 million of net debt as of March 31, 2015. During the quarter we 
renewed our revolving credit facility and added another $100 million of 
borrowing capacity. Our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong allowing 
us to continue to foc
us on executing our strategy.
 
In terms of our production guidance for the year, we are maintaining our 
previously issued guidance of eight cargoes for the year with gross Jubilee 
production of approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day sales. The size of
 
the cargoes can vary due to operational considerations but general liftings 
have changed from 950,000 to 975,000 barrels.
 
On the cost side, we expect production expense to be in line with our 
previously issued guidance range of $9 to $11 per barrel for th
e rest of the 
year. We now expect any additional work
-
overs in 2015. As we exit the 
second quarter, we are in a very strong financial position despite the 
macroeconomic environment, and as Andy said, w continue to be good 
stewards of capital and focus on o
pportunities that add value to the 
Company.
 
With that operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brendan Warn with BMO 
Capital Markets. Please proceed with you
r question.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions. I guess just two 
questions from my side please. Just firstly to your rig rate, just if you can 
update us on any discussions with your rig contractor regarding the rate and 
sharing o
f some of the pine in the current weak oil processing environment, 
and if you can just remind me, and I know I can look it up, but just your 
minimum commitments for that rig into the next couple of years? And just 
second point on the rig, for this slot tha
t you farmed out in the second 
quarter, will you be or have you booked or will you realize a loss or is there 
a cost associated with this farm
-
out? And then just second question I had 
just in terms of the next well coming up, Marsouin, just are we expectin
g a 
similar pressure regime dip, can you just talk about the technical parameters 
of drilling, technical parameters that lead to what you expect the cost of the 
well net to yourselves?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
It's quite a few questions. I'll just sort of do them 
sort of in reverse order, 
just go through them. So in terms of the farm
-
out, the answer is, no, there 
is no loss associated with that. So it's just simply a straightforward farm
-
out. 
In terms of the rig rates, it's clearly a connected question. No, we're n
ot in 
discussions with that at the moment about changing the rig rate. In our 
sense, a contract is a contract. What we are looking is the potential if we are 
successful in other areas and we wanted to increase our drilling capacity 
then play our opportunit
ies then where we'll have a different conversation. 
But I genuinely believe that we should honor that contract.
 
Clearly what we are doing, if you look at the spread rate, the drilling is 
probably 40% of that, the headline rig rate is 40% of the overall spr
ead 
cost. And so we are focusing on the remaining 60% and we're making 
progress on that. We're seeing savings of 10%, 15%, 20% coming through 
and I think we've just started on that. So from a deflationary perspective, I 
think we're starting to see it comin
g through in other sectors. And clearly, as 
that contract moves through, we will have the opportunity to look at other 
options. In terms of our commitment on that rig, it's a three
-
year contract 
started in the third quarter 

 
started in mid 2014 and will r
un through mid
-
2017.
 
And then finally I think you asked questions about Marsouin. The overall cost 
of the well will be what we have forecasted in the past about $120 million. It 
will target a series of stratigraphy. Clearly the Cenomanian which was the 
tar
get in Tortue
-
1, we also entered the Albian in Tortue
-
1 which is [also a 
horizon] [ph], and then we'll be deepening Marsouin into the Albian. So we'll 
be looking at all three Cretaceous reservoirs which we believe are 
prospective.
 
Operator
 
Our next questio
n comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Maybe if I could ask one on, can you talk a little bit about the takeaways 
from the successful 10
-
metre lower Albian section, do you have there 
Tortue
-
1, I think 
that's new relative to the last time we had a conference 
call? What does it mean for the current Tortue structure, and more 
importantly, have you looked towards the other structures, Tortue East and 
others, how does it inform you of your other targets in t
he basin?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Yes, it is new since we chatted last time because we put the second press 
release out on Tortue after the earnings call. First point is, the Tortue
-
1 well 
was targeting Cenomanian and actually we had a very good tie between the 
w
ell and the seismic. We deepened the well to get some stratigraphy 
information, particularly down into the Albian. We didn't anticipate actually 
tagging a reservoir in that location, because as you know, the sort of two 
main structures on Tortue, two antic
lines, West and East, and actually the 
Albian really bypasses the Western anticline and is predominantly on Tortue 
East. So it was really an upside to tag quality reservoir there and actually it 
was an upside to tag hydrocarbon there. So what it does do is
 
it significantly 
derisk the Albian, it's derisked the Albian in particular in East Tortue which is 
one of the three appraisal wells that we'll be drilling.
 
And I think the other sort of takeaway from it, when you step back from it, 
always just sort of rem
ember that in Tortue
-
1 we've drilled the uppermost of 
the three horizons, Cenomanian, the Albian and the [indiscernible], we just 
sort of tagged the top of the structure. And the fact that we have gas in the 
Albian in the West Tortue location is I think is
 
a real positive indication to be 
proven now through the subsequent appraisal.
 
And again, I just want to emphasize the point about sort of not running 
away with this. This is really about the minimum number of appraisal wells 
to prove the gas volume which 
allows us to deliver commercial LNG scheme. 
That's the first thing we're doing. And the second thing we are going to be 
doing through that appraisal program is testing any liquids potential that we 
have in it. So it's going to be very disciplined. We're cl
ear about the three 
wells we need to drill to do that and we don't anticipate we'll be doing 
anything else.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Thanks, that's very helpful. And now maybe one follow
-
up question on 
Jubilee, and I realize that it may not be the primary driver maybe go
ing 
forward, but you have there in the release, you're going to estimate later 
this year a development plan in Jubilee including plans for Mahogany, Teak 
and Akasa. Any thoughts as to what that might look like? Is there going to 
be 

 
any idea in terms of m
aybe in the plan what you might be able to do to 
pull forward or potentially accelerate some of the long
-
lived resource there 
or is it more going to be an exercise and kind of filling the haulage in the 
facility?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
I appreciate the spirit of
 
the question. Again just sort of stand back and 
make a big point first before going through the detail. Over a number of 
years the resources at Jubilee have grown. We replaced reserves at 135% in 
2013 and 115% in 2014. So what I understand is that Jubilee
 
is a world
-
class field, big fields get bigger, alright. So we have an increasing scale of 
resource. We now have the ability to sort of integrate MTA into that.
 
So the word that's going on with the full field development plan is to look at 
that economic op
timum of is there the ability to increase the production 
level, and it will require additional facilities offshore, additional power, 
additional gas compression, additional order that allows you to create both 
[indiscernible] an economic price from the acc
eleration of that larger 
resource base rather than simply filling haulage.
 
Now have we submitted the plan yet? No, we haven't. We anticipate doing 
that in the coming months, but that's absolutely one of the options. And I 
will give you my personal view tod
ay, I believe it is an option that we'll have 
real value to all parties, ourselves, the government and clearly for 
shareholders. So that's the word that's ongoing and I don't 

 
I know that 
you'll also respect, I'm not going to tell what do I [indiscernible
] do we know 
what we're going to announce [indiscernible] saturate, but if you just stand 
back for me, you're asking the right question.
 
Look, the field is bigger, it's bigger than you anticipated when you 
sanctioned it. Therefore there must be an opportun
ity to do more with it, 
and the answer is, I believe there is an opportunity to do more with it. What 
we have to find is the right economic optimum between the capital end and 
exhibit signs to be really disciplined about our capital, so you're not exposing
 
yourself to a sort of fool's errand there, but what's the right amount of 
capital [indiscernible] benefit.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Anish Kapadia with TPH Partners. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
Anish Kapadia
 
Just the first question was on 
the drilling of Tortue going forward. I don't 
think we had some comments from Chevron related to that going back some 
more on that early stage upstream spending. Just wondering in the scenario 
that Chevron doesn't farm
-
in, would that change your drilling p
rogram at all 
for next year if you had to fund Tortue 100% through the appraisal phase, 
and then kind of outside the Chevron have you received much interest from 
any other integrators to come into that prospect? And then the second 
question was also in ter
ms of Mauritania exploration. Given how well the 
seismic seemed to work on Tortue, just wondering if you could talk about 
which prospect Tortue is being risked and how the chance of success is 
changed for these prospects from what you've learned on Tortue?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
It certainly is a complex time in the industry in terms of individual 
companies having individual agendas, but if you sort of again sort of step 
back, when we [indiscernible] on Mauritania we only invited the majors in 
and I think all of 
the majors came and looked at it. As I've said in the past, 
we did the deal with Chevron because they were sort of the most 
accommodating around actually with the working interest that we were 
prepared to push out at that time. Clearly having drilled Tortu
e now and 
open the petroleum system up, everyone that was in the data room and 
didn't get a deal has come back to us and asked how they could actually get 
back into the prospect.
 
So I'm not overly worried actually around an individual company and its 
indiv
idual plan. Clearly that will be a decision for the Chevron to make. If 
they decide ultimately not to participate, we have plenty of opportunities to 
work with us, we clearly would like to go forward with Chevron. But what I 
think we're actually 

 
today as
 
I look at it, the [indiscernible] in fact 
fundamentally a strategy which is, we believe we've opened up a big basin. 
It's the scale of the resource, this is the scale of the resource which is 
attractive to the super
-
majors. You look at the super
-
majors' p
ortfolios 
today and look at their exploration track record, what they have to develop 
in the next decade, and it fits.
 
So do I worry overly about that? No, I don't, and I think it will be about 
individual companies and the timing of their own individual ci
rcumstances. 
Therefore, our strategy remains the same. We intend to drill this out and we 
intend to demonstrate the scale through a very focused appraisal and 
exploration program and demonstrate that it is a credible project from a 
competitive perspective 
and that competition is being set for LNG by U.S. 
exports. So kind of none of that changes and we have the balance sheet to 
do that.
 
So it's a good question but what I am clear about at the end of that 
discussion is, we are not an LNG developer, our intent
 
is not to move out of 
our experience domain which is w add value upfront through world
-
class 
exploration and appraisal, and that's our sweet spot and that's what we're 
going to do. So we don't have to get pulled to the right because people 
won't be workin
g with us. I believe we absolutely will have development 
partner and the choices remain.
 
So that's the sort of the picture going forward. If you come to the sort of 
Mauritania exploration, what's being derisked, I think it's early stages, 
Anish, and we wan
t to be careful about not getting ahead of ourselves. We 
clearly have a well in Tortue, it's penetrated to Cenomanian and the upper 
part of the Albian. So we have correlation of ABO to that but we have 
correlation there for across to Marsouin.
 
I think the 
piece of the puzzle that we're really starting to unpick today, 
which ABO did not help you with, is source and we're just starting as I said 
from starting to understand both the fluid and formation samples that we're 
getting back, and I think the positive 
is there are clearly multiple sources at 
play. So what I'm saying, this is not a predominantly dry gas basin with a 
very mature source rock. We are seeing clear source rock [indiscernible] 
upper part of Tortue but we are seeing other sources at play. And I
 
think 
that's the key message that as we start to unpick Tortue that's the most 
important thing.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
John Herrlin
 
Following up on what you just said, with
 
Tortue that means you've got more 
than C
-
1s?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Yes.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay. How long do you think it will take for you to get those three wells 
needed to delineate the gas resource done, chronologically I mean? 17?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
No. I 
mean chronologically, John, just to sort of if I wasn't clear in my 
remarks, if you look at the drilling sequence, it's Marsouin which we 
anticipate to start this quarter when the rig comes back from [client] [ph]. It 
is anticipated a 90
-
day well. Clearly 
we are successful at well being 

 
it could 
be slightly longer. Therefore you would start the series of three wells on the 
appraisal side on Greater Tortue in the fourth quarter. If you chart them 
through on 90 day wells, then what it takes you to is sort o
f mid
-
year sort of 
into the third quarter. The third quarter 2016 is really where I believe we 
would finish the three well program.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay. Say you have encouraging results from the subsequent wells, will you 
start making soft conversations with
 
LNG companies or will you wait till you 
fully delineate things?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
I think so the answer is sort of, yes. I think the story will start to evolve but 
we're demonstrating what we believe and what I believe is sort of a 
incredible world
-
scale p
roject, what people are going to say, you know what, 
this is a new source of supply for the world's existing [indiscernible]. That 
will start to emerge but I think the chronological order is to sort of by the 
second half of 2016, to say, yes, we've got a w
orld
-
class resource 
[indiscernible] TCF of gas, we have in place the basis for moving forward the 
cooperation agreement between the two governments and we have an LNG 
partner who is going to take it forward, and that's really the value.
 
Now what we're not 
going to be doing is sort of selling pieces of the project 
off to buyers. Credit complex partnerships that actually slow down progress 
rather than accelerate. I think that's what history has shown, projects, 
bigger projects have got into difficulties becau
se they've got too fragmented 
a partnership and they've got multiple agendas as a result. So if that's not 
explicit, that's really what our thinking is.

Our next question is from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
E
d Westlake
 
Good news to hear on the potential liquids content. Just on the timing of 
wells, you mentioned C
-
12 [indiscernible] and Senegal would follow on from 
Marsouin and Tortue. When do you think is the earliest that you could get 
onto those and you sor
t of alluded that it might make sense even to get an 
extra rig slot or something to get onto them earlier if that was possible?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Good question. Again, it is important that first point is we're trying to be 
really disciplined about making ev
ery dollar count and not actually putting 
pressure on the Company's budgets, how do we do more with less. I'm 
pretty rigid about the capital inputs at the moment. Therefore it's about 
making choices around timing. Part of the issue really around timing is 
two 
things really. The seismic to the north in C
-
12, we're sort of completion of 
the evaluation of that today. So that becomes our sort of first opportunity to 
sort of look at the northern part of our acreage beyond C8. It will be on 
Block C8 and that we'l
l be ready to drill by the sort of middle of 2016. So as 
you think about the three wells that would define Greater Tortue and then 
you get onto that in the second half of 2016, so that sort of defines our 
timing.
 
And then if you remember our entry at Seneg
al, we only shot the seismic in 
Senegal in the second half of 2014. It's been processed at the moment and 
so the earliest we can get to that will be with fully worked up prospects. You 
would not see us pass frontlines which we shared with the market. It wi
ll 
really be the back
-
end of 2016. So the natural sequence here of doing the 
right things in the right order and ensuring we've got quality before we get 
into them will be to drill. Marsouin is ready to go now, great prospect. You 
then get into the apprais
al, very clear three well discipline and then you 
open up probably [indiscernible] which will be the C12 prospect followed by 
the two wells in Senegal.
 
So I don't think you're going to see us going out and particularly getting a 
second rig just because of 
the timing around getting the seismic and 
ensuring that we're fully defined on the best prospects [indiscernible]. So I 
think we've got what I would call a practical drilling schedule now that 
matches the subsurface development in terms of the seismic and 
separation 
but also one that sort of meets our financial and even resources capability as 
well.
 
Ed Westlake
 
And then on Jubilee I guess Phase 2 and [MTAP] [ph], I appreciate you 
probably can't give a CapEx number at this point but maybe talk a little bit 
a
bout what the landscape looks like in terms of your ability to either 
negotiate or engineer costs out of that second phase?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
We're going to see cost coming from two dimensions. Clearly there are many 
significant number of wells drilled and 
going forward we'll obviously have the 
opportunity to take advantage of what is obviously a much better rig market 
today. So I think you'll see cost coming out in the second phase of the 
development program. The facility's work, again without getting ahead
 
of 
myself in the conversation, I think is realistically not huge. So I think in a 
relative sense as you see the second phase, it's going to be dominated by 
drilling. How many percentage will be on drilling is difficult for a front
-
end 
project and therefor
e I think there is actually a real opportunity to see some 
benefit from the lower rig rats.
 
Ed Westlake
 
And on the subsea?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
And on the subsea 

 
fair enough, good point 

 
subsea exactly the same 
which is as you say [indiscernible] well has s
ome flow
-
ons coming back, and 
I believe the timing of this, I think we're seeing a slightly slower deflationary 
impact coming in from the deepwater as the sort of market clears. The cycle 
time on projects is longer in deepwater than it is in a shallow play
, therefore 
that timing impact. But I think we would be executing this project at a time 
when we can take best advantage of that. So I think there's real opportunity 
to drive value into this next phase at Jubilee because we'll be working and 
drilling in su
bsea wells operating at a time when we're probably at 
significantly more advanced prices.

Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond 
James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Just kind of a 
high
-
level one for you on your LNG planning. Obviously we've 
seen a lot of softness particularly in spot LNG pricing amid rising supply from 
particularly Australia and eventually North American supply and European 
demand for gas is at a 20 year low. So as 
you think about LNG economics 
for this project, what are some of the sensitivities that you're running in 
terms of kind of oiling off
-
takes or anything along those lines that you would 
need to see and your partner would need to see to be able to pull the 
t
rigger?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
I think good question. Lets sort of look at this, this is gas that will be 
actually looking for a market in the next decade and it may well be the 
middle of the next decade, and it's typically the time horizon. So I'm not 
overly wo
rried today about today's spot prices. Today's spot price has been 
influenced by a lot of supply that's come on all at one time and that's the 
nature of LNG. You take the big projects, they come on the market, absorbs 
acreage, it moves forward.
 
I think I s
tand back and look at the word and say, the world is getting 
gassier, there is 

 
whichever sort of house you go to, it's sort of common 
view as you get to 2025 the world needs another 100 million tons per 
annum of LNG. I think that's a reasonable consensus
. U.S. supply is going to 
take a big portion of that. But we'll scale resource that is cost competitive 
because it's got great reservoir that's adjacent to market and has good fiscal 
terms, we'll be competitive, and that's all we're about. As long as we ca
n 
demonstrate, and sort of back to John Herrlin's question, in a reasonably 
short timeframe which is sort of back end of next year, that we meet those 
three criteria that are competitive with the U.S., then we have a scheme and 
we have a scheme that's cred
ible of what the world wants.
 
So that's where we're aimed at, and again, we need to demonstrate that 
through appraisal. I'm very clear about what it takes to do that and we need 
to demonstrate through progress both at an inter
-
government level and with 
our
 
partner, but it's a relatively short timeframe to get there.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. And so when you talk about for your oil development, you've kind of 
set out $30 to $50 a barrel kind of breakevens, will you provide that 
analogous range for LNG pricing in
 
relation to this project?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
And again, I don't think it's quite as simple as that. I think what you have to 
look at is the frame of saying, what's the alternative supply cost, you have 
to be competitive with that, and I think that's what I'
m looking at. I'm 
looking today at actually saying, the cheapest LNG in the world is coming 
from the U.S., am I competitive with that. It's a market. And that's the thing 
on my mind.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, it's a high
-
class problem to have in any case.
 
Andr
ew G. Inglis
 
It's a high
-
class problem to have but I think that's the mindset, the mindset 
has got to be is, for the world to buy it, someone to come in and buy it, they 
have to say, is it competitive with the alternative supply. Now there are 
clearly othe
r dimensions other than price, there is exposure to Henry Hub, 
you want it, don't you want it, there's the credibility of the supply, how big is 
it, all the molecules there, et cetera. So those are the things that are 
ultimately going to determine the buy 
pool and that's the world we're 
working at today but we have no illusions about having to demonstrate a 
project that's competitive against the best in the world today and that's what 
our work is focused on.

Our next question comes from Ritesh Gagg
ar with GMP Securities. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Ritesh Gaggar
 
Can you please provide whether the post
-
well analysis that has been carried 
out since April and May on the Tortue discovery, whether there has been any 
change in 
understanding of your geology in terms of the liquids content and 
whether the next three to four wells will be focusing on just proving up the 
gas resources so that you can farm into an LNG partner or you might target 
something differently in terms of the 
liquids content?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
What I can say is that we've got the early geochemical analysis back from 
the well and I was very clear in my remarks to say that what the fluids and 
formation samples demonstrate is there are multiple sources of opportuni
ty 
at the play. So clearly that's sort of to an agenda. We see this, we've tagged 
the, we've drilled the Cenomanian and I think it was the first question of the 
day, and we've tagged the top of the Albian. On Greater Tortue we're clearly 
as we appraise it 
out we've got an agenda to demonstrate what I would call 
a threshold volume of 15 TCF. That gets us to a world
-
scale project. Then 
the world can look at it and say, yes, there is a credible resource there.
 
But we're also going to get to the bottom I think 
of the potential liquids by 
drilling deeper. In particular in one of the wells we'll target the western side 
of Tortue West and clearly the well is targeting an oil 

 
what we think is an 
oil water 

 
a gas water content, but clearly we need to demonstrate t
hat. It 
could be something else.
 
So what I would say is, there remains the potential but we're clearly focused 
today on the drill
-
out of the gas resource to demonstrate the threshold I 
believe and fully understand the sources that have been at play. Now 
wh
ether the timing allows them to have a liquids content in Tortue is one 
aspect of it, it will clearly allow us then to have a better understanding of 
Marsouin and another prospect [indiscernible].

Our next question is from Al Stanton with RBC Capi
tal Markets. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Just a quick question, you said earlier that there will be a final 
announcement from the [indiscernible] about Ghana determination in the 
second half of 2017. You obviously said that you had signif
icant financial 
headroom. I was wondering if I could draw a line between the two and ask 
whether you have any concerns of [indiscernible] being paid in cash for any 
oil you produce in the second half of 2016 as sort of 12 months between first 
oil and the f
inal decision on the [board at dispute] [ph]?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
No, we don't.
 
Al Stanton
 
There is no consent at all? Hedging will only be impacted by the usual 
technical concerns about first oil and new development?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
We don't have 

 
so I 
have no indication from [indiscernible] as they were all 
from the Government of Ghana that they would hold back any payments to 
us. They've made no indications around that at all.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. So until the second half production, I mean we should be an
ticipating 
cash flow to go in line with production in my forecasting 2016 numbers?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Yes, what I said is, that we've had no indication from Government of Ghana 
that they would hold back any of those payments to us.

Greetings. Welcome to the Kosmos Energy Second Quarter 2019 Earnings 
Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. A question
-
and
-
answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] 
Please note, this 
conference is being recorded.
 
I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jamie Buckland. Thank you. 
You may begin.
 
Jamie Buckland
 
Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, 
we issued our second quarter earnings releas
e on a slide presentation today 

 
to accompany today's call. Both materials are available on the Investors 
Page of the kosmosenergy.com website. We anticipate filing our 10
-
Q for the 
quarter, with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today to go thr
ough the materials are Andy Inglis, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial 
Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expec
tations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion and management believes such 
measures are important 
in looking at the Company's historical and future 
performance and these are commonly referred to industry metrics. These 
measures are provided in addition to and should be read in conjunction with 
the information contained in our financial statements prepa
red in accordance 
with GAAP and included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start the call by 
reinforcing the key characteristics that define Kosmos's unique 
investment 
proposition. They are consistent with the themes we outlined at our Capital 
Markets Day in February.
 
First, Kosmos's business model is highly cash generative. In the second 
quarter, we delivered approximately $136 million of free cash flow and a
re 
on track to deliver over $200 million in 2019 at current prices. Our third year 
in a row of positive free cash flow. For contacts in 2019, this represents a 
free cash flow yield of around 10%, which is very competitive compared to 
other E&P companies an
d indeed other sectors.
 
Second our infrastructure led exploration or ILX program is working. The 
Gladden Deep well brought the first success in the second quarter. And 
through the rest of the year, we expect to drill four ILX wells in the GOM and 
EG target
ing a total net resource around 125 million barrels oil equivalent.
 
Third, we continue to add value to our Mauritania Senegal asset base. Our 
recent appraisal drilling further expanded the resource at Tortue and we 
continue to make good progress with the s
ell
-
down of our position to around 
10%. The scale and quality of the assets has led to significant industry 
interest and the process remains on track.
 
Fourth, creating transformational value through basin opening exploration 
remains a key part of our busin
ess. We have a deep diverse portfolio of oil 
and gas opportunities, which we will continue to mature high
-
grade and test. 
Later this year, we'll drill the Orca well in Mauritania, and expect to drill two 
basin
-
opening tests per year from 2020 onwards.
 
And 
finally, our conservative approach to managing the balance sheet has 
not changed. In April, we opportunistically refinanced our bonds that were 
due in 2021, pushing out the maturity until 2026. Balance sheet strength 
continues to be a strategic asset of Ko
smos.
 
Turning to slide 3, I'd now like to discuss the second quarter. Kosmos had 
record production during the quarter, with our entitlement share averaging 
approximately 71,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
 
In Ghana, second quarter gross production av
eraged 97,000 barrels of oil 
per day at Jubilee and 59,000 at TEN resulting in the plant two cargos from 
Jubilee and one from TEN.
 
At Jubilee, the partnership is planning to accelerate the gas enhancement 
projects into the fourth quarter of this year. Impl
ementation of these 
enhancements should increase gas handling capacity to above 180 million 
standard cubic feet per day, thereby allowing oil production to increase in 
the fourth quarter and into 2020.
 
At TEN, as the operator previously reported completion
 
problems were 
experienced at the EN
-
14 well, due to mechanical issues resulting in the well 
not being completed. In addition, there is the potential for two other TEN 
wells to be deferred. These mechanical issues and the potential deferral of 
TEN drilling
 
has reduced our full
-
year expectations for the field and we now 
expect to lift four cargoes from TEN, down from the previous expectation of 
five. As a result, we now expect production for 2019 at the corporate level to 
be the low end of our guidance range
.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico, our assets continue to exceed expectations, beating 
the high
-
end of our guidance range for the second quarter in a row. The 
26,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day net average daily production in the 
second quarter was a record fo
r the GOM business unit, demonstrating the 
growth in the business since acquiring the EG last year.
 
The quarter
-
on
-
quarter increase was primarily driven by increased 
production at Odd Job where we were able to take advantage of spare 
capacity aboard Delta 
House and the Tornado field coming back online after 
its planned drydock in 1Q. Performance in Equatorial Guinea during the 
quarter was in line with expectations. Our Electrical Submersible Pump or 
ESP program is ongoing with two further ESP installations 
this quarter.
 
In addition, the stimulation program Okume has recently begun and the 
facilities upgrade program is currently under way to enhance the Okume 
facilities in support of the 2020 and 2021 ESP program. These are low cost 
rapid payback projects and
 
the 2019 ESP program has delivered cash 
payback in excess of 120% of invested capital in just seven months.
 
This strong production performance translated into approximately $136 
million of free cash flow during the quarter. We remain on track to exceed 
ou
r $200 million free cash flow forecast at current prices for the full year. 
And finally, we paid $0.045 dividend during the quarter and announced our 
third quarter dividend today payable in late September. At $0.18 for the 
year, this equates to a yield of 
around 3% at today's share price.
 
Turning to slide 4. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our ILX program 
is off to a great start. And we expect first oil from Gladden Deep around six 
months from discovery. Our inventory of high
-
quality prospects in the 
GOM 
was broadened through our participation in the March lease sale. During the 
same quarter, Kosmos was awarded all nine leases where we were apparent 
high bidder. With these new awards, we now are approximately 80 blocks in 
total with over 30 prospects e
quivalent more than five years of future drilling 
activity.
 
In the second half, we have an active ILX drilling program in the GOM and 
plan to drill three of these prospects, which I'll talk about in a minute. In 
Equatorial Guinea, we're planning to drill o
ur first well target in the G
-
13 
prospect. We have now contracted the rig to drill this well which is expected 
to spud late in the third quarter.
 
In Mauritania and Senegal, phase one of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim 
project remains on track following FID in D
ecember. Pre
-
FEED work on 
phases two and three is ongoing and recent drilling results have further 
expanded our significant resource base at Greater Tortue Ahmeyim. The sell
-
down process we announced in February is progressing well. As world class 
resource
 
base has garnered significant industry interest we expect to 
announce a transaction by year end.
 
Turning to slide 5. This slide shows our infrastructure
-
led exploration 
program in action. Gladden Deep may be the smallest of our 2019 
prospects, but it's st
ill meaningful and demonstrates the speed to first 
production and cash flow contribution of our growing ILX portfolio. We 
expect to deliver incremental net production to Kosmos of approximately 
1,100 barrels oil equivalent per day around six months from di
scovery. The 
economics of the well are very attractive.
 
At $60 Brent, and with a $10.50 per barrel F&D cost and $7.30 per barrel 
lifting cost, the well has a full cycle 
--
 
full cycle IRR of around 70% with 
payback expected in around 14 months from first oi
l. Opportunity like 
Gladden Deep are precisely why we enter the Gulf of Mexico and we look 
forward to more success as we ramp up activity in the second half.
 
Slide 6 shows this activity in more detail. We plan to spud Moneypenny and 
Resolution in 
October followed by Oldfield in November. In total these three 
wells will tax approximately 100 million barrels of net oil resource, greater 
than our current 80 million barrel oil equivalent 2P reserve base in the GOM. 
So success at any of these wells woul
d be meaningful.
 
Interestingly in 
--
 
on oilfield specifically, we're in the process of finalizing 
cross assignment of our interest with Hess on the adjacent block with 
Kosmos taking a 40% interest in the two blocks and Hess 60%.
 
As a result of new seismic 
data that Hess has processed in the area, we now 
believe that there could be significant upside to the 30 million barrel oil 
equivalent, we initially talked about.
 
Oilfield is another example of Kosmos's strong license to operate within the 
Gulf of Mexico,
 
often with much larger players like Hess and BP. With 
Oldfield, we plan to operate the prospect on behalf of Hess during 
exploration and the initial development phase.
 
One important point to note, each of these three prospects is located in their 
existing
 
infrastructure which has available capacity. If successful the 
discoveries can be brought online quickly. The wells have an average F&D 
cost of around $12 per barrel and an average lifting cost of around $6 per 
barrel. And with oil prices of only $60 per 
barrel Brent generate average full 
cycle IRRs of around 50%.
 
There is a lot of oil yet to be found in the deepwater GOM, an abundance of 
underutilized infrastructure. As I've said in previous presentations, I don't 
believe there's ever been a better time t
o be active in the GOM.
 
We plan to take advantage of this attractive backdrop and a growing 
opportunity set by drilling 4 to 5 ILX wells a year, targeting 65 million to 100 
million barrels oil equivalent of unrisked net resource each year.
 
Turning Slide 7 
I'd like to discuss another ILX opportunity this time in the G
-
13 area in Equatorial Guinea. This is a unique opportunity around a legacy 
discovery. The G
-
13 field includes four previously drilled wells three of which 
were successful. The wells drilled tod
ay have improved up around 25 million 
barrels of oil equivalent with a 500 meter oil column.
 
Today, we have a calibrated well database and in 2018 we acquired a new 
seismic survey. The previous wells were drilled up in 1999 vintage seismic 
survey. A new su
rvey has given us a much clearer image of the depositional 
system that delivered reservoir sand into the prospect area. This better 
resolution has enhanced our understanding of the trap model.
 
The new information is being key in identifying that the previo
us wells were 
drilled on what we now believe to be the edge of the main reservoir channel, 
providing considerable upside to the discovery.
 
This together with the stratigraphic element increases the resource potential 
to around 200 million barrels gross for
 
the field. The first well will test 
around 50 million barrels gross and expected to spud in the third quarter.
 
Slide 8 shows the significant progress we continue to make in Mauritania and 
Senegal. With our partners, we're building a major LNG business acr
oss the 
basin with 50 Tcf to 100 Tcf of gas initially in place, we believe we have 
enough gas to underpin three separate 10 million ton per annum LNG hubs.
 
The innovative development scheme, we're using at Greater Tortue 
Ahmeyim can be replicated to the ot
her two hubs: BirAllah and the Yakaar
-
Teranga using a design once build many approach.
 
Our exploration and appraisal activities this year are therefore focused on 
first expanding our resource base at Greater Tortue Ahmeyim which we've 
done with a successfu
l GTA
-
1 appraisal well. Second, defining the 
development area, securing a second LNG at Yakaar in Senegal where an 
appraisal well is planned, but next month after the rig completing BOP and 
rise and maintenance.
 
And third underpinning the next LNG hub in M
auritania, BirAllah we 
--
 
which 
we hope to do with the Orca well, which we expect to spud in October. And 
as I said in my opening remarks, the sell
-
down process we announced in 
February is progressing well and we expected to announce a transaction by 
year 
end.
 
Turning to slide nine, I'd like to highlight the substantial change in our 
shareholder base over the last two years, a shift that mirrors the rapid 
evolution of our business over the same period. In June, Blackstone sold 
their remaining position in Ko
smos. Blackstone was one of two founding 
shareholders and post their exit and that of Warburg Pincus earlier this year, 
we now have almost a 100% free flows and any private equity shareholding 
overhang is all but gone. Today we have a more diverse broader 
set of 
public equity investors.
 
With that enhanced float, U.S. assets and the U.S. domicile, we believe 
Kosmos should soon be eligible for more meaningful index inclusion with the 
benefits that will bring to our shareholder base. We've included the guidanc
e 
for the third quarter and full year in an appendix to the presentation and we 
encourage you to look at that when modeling the business for the rest of the 
year.
 
So turning to the final slide. In summary, 2Q was a record quarter for 
Kosmos, with productio
n and EBITDAX both over 50% higher compared to 
the same quarter last year. This significant growth over the last 12 months 
has been done with only a modest increase in leverage, perhaps most 
importantly for our shareholders with minimal dilution.
 
With the 
company's strong cash generation, we expect leverage to move 
toward our target range of 1 times to 1.5 times. And we look forward to a 
very second 
--
 
a very busy second half that is full of exciting catalysts, many 
of which could be transformational for th
e company.
 
Thank you. And I now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the 
session for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Round 
with BMO Capital Markets. Please pr
oceed with your question.
 
David Round
 
Good morning, Andy. Just a couple from me. The first one on Ghana. Are 
you able to add any further detail on drilling plans there? I mean particularly 
at TEN following the 14 well. And how do you currently see the sche
dule for 
the rest of the year and into 2020? And the second question, in the Gulf of 
Mexico. Obviously, quite a strong quarter and you've now added Gladden 
Deep, which looks like it's going to contribute this year. So how do we think 
about production in th
e second half? And what's your confidence around the 
full year guidance there?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Okay. Yes. Thanks, David. I think on Ghana, it'd be good to give you a sort 
of a full view of what we think the second half could look like. We're 
obviously disappoi
nted that we couldn't complete the EN
-
14 well. And we 
support the operators' decision to take a time out that previously had been 
problems on the prior well EN
-
10, where that completion was delayed by a 
month.
 
So I think taking a time out on TEN is actuall
y the right thing to do. And we 
need to come back with a plan for EN
-
14 with the right remediation. I think 
we also need to come back with an appropriate design for drilling and 
completing that we're confident can be delivered on time on budget. I think 
it
's important to emphasize on TEN this is an operational issue nothing to do 
with the reservoir. The reserves are there, we just need to make sure we 
can get at them in a cost
-
effective way.
 
What actually means, I think, from our perspective is that the 
rig will work 
on Jubilee for the rest of the year. We're about I think to start
-
up a producer 
on Jubilee J
-
23. I think there's some maintenance 
--
 
planned maintenance 
on the rig. And then, I think, there's a series of recompletions that would 
take you thro
ugh to the end of the year.
 
So the combination of that additional well capacity at Jubilee, together with 
the increase in the gas throughput on Jubilee to above 118 million standard 
cubic feet, should give us a sort of strong production on Jubilee and a go
od 
exit rate for Jubilee for the year end and into 2020.
 
And clearly from a Kosmos perspective, that's important. We have a larger 
share in Jubilee than we do in TEN, so it's important that we maintain a 
strong production base in Jubilee. So, I think that'
s sort of the Ghana story.
 
In GOM, yeah, we're very pleased, the business has outperformed our 
expectations 
--
 
outperformed our expectations obviously when we made the 
acquisition, it was a record quarter in production. And then through the year 
end, we've
 
got two more wells starting up, Gladden Deep and Nearly 
Headless Nick, which means that we should exit the Gulf with a strong exit 
rate in 4Q.
 
So, I think the Gulf 
--
 
it's been a strong performance and has obviously 
contributed to mitigating some of the i
mpact of TEN. And I'm genuinely feel 
pleased about the business we're building there from all dimensions. It's 
great team. We've managed to seize on I think in opportunity to get into 
some great prospects through the licensing round and through deals that 
we've done with some of the larger companies brought up the Kosmos brand 
to build.
 
And as I said in my remarks, we've got a five
-
year drilling inventory built out 
which is pretty neat given the acquisition is less than a year through. So, it's 
been a stron
g start from all dimensions in the Gulf.
 
David Round
 
Great, that's really helpful. Thanks Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from James Carmichael with Macquarie Group. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
James Carmichael
 
Hi good 
morning Andy. Just one quickly on the Gulf of Mexico. Just 
interested in what scale of resource you think you need to discover at 
Resolution to ensure that is stand at any production help rather than sort of 
simply tying it back to the Gunnison spar.
 
And t
hen also just in the event of that that Resolution well it doesn't work, 
would you still consider the Gatlinburg and Sioux Falls, et cetera as drill bore 
targets further in the future? Thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good questions James. I think it's important to loo
k at the standalone versus 
a newbuild. So, a standalone newbuild versus Gunnison I think is something 
that could be pursued almost irrespective of the scale.
 
The Gunnison spar would be an opportunity for us to use existing 
infrastructure. I believe it woul
d have the capacity even with sort of full 
success at a resolution and the surrounding prospects came in.
 
So, I don't think it's a scale thing. I think it's ultimately around what is the 
most economic decision 
--
 
full life economic decision in terms of uti
lizing 
Gunnison potentially debottlenecking it or is it about bringing in a newbuild? 
So, I think 
--
 
and the good news is we've got optionality there. We could go 
either route. And I think both are valid today.
 
And Resolution we have at around 150 million 
barrels. And then the 
surrounding prospectivity we could have up to sort of 0.5 billion barrels 
gross. So, this is a significant opportunity for us. And if Resolution were not 
a success, I think it's about individual prospects. It will not be about the are
a 
itself.
 
Obviously, the Gulf of Mexico will probably be around trap and therefore 
Sioux Falls et cetera, are the ongoing prospects, obviously, is still valid. So, 
we like the area. We like the scale and we like the ability with success to be 
able to tie 
-
-
 
to move forward with development quickly. And that to me is 
the thing that distinguishes the economics in the Gulf of Mexico. It's the time 
to production ultimately which is driving the high IRRs. And we would want 
to retain that optionality with success
 
on Resolution.
 
James Carmichael
 
Very helpful. Thanks a lot.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. Thanks James.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Richard Tullis with Capital One. Please proceed.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Hey thanks. Good morning Andy. Congrats on a nice 
quarter. Looking at the 
of the LNG Tortue sell
-
down process. Are bids still expected late summer at 
this point?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, Richard, it's been actually 
--
 
it's been a busy couple of months, I'd say 
on Mauritania and Senegal on the sell
-
down process. W
e announced that 
obviously in May set of the dayroom and the level of interest in the industry 
has been significant, which is a plus and a minus. It means, a lots of people 
going through the data room, lots of management presentations to work and 
that's th
e process that we've been working on.
 
So we've had interests from IOCs, NOCs trading houses. It's been 
interesting to me to see the diversity of the strategic interest in the assets. 
And I think that to me is the real driver. The importance of gas, actuall
y gas 
as a transition fuel, people's portfolio is not being balanced. How did they 
get access to it? And those have been the conversations that we've been in.
 
So we're working our way through that process. We're on track to get it all 
done. And therefore, 
we sort of remain on track to have 
--
 
we hope a 
transaction that we can announce by the end of the year. A lot of work being 
done and a lot of work to be done. But the level of interest that we've had in 
the process has really been strong. And therefore, w
e're hopeful that the 
--
 
by year end, we will have a transaction that we can announce.
 
Richard Tullis
 
That's helpful. And when you look at a potential transaction, what sort of 
structure could it take? Would you be looking for mostly cash in a deal, or 
wha
t would the parameters look like?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, look I think it's early days to talk about that. And I think you sort of 
--
 
I 
think hopefully you'll respect my position we should say. Look this is a 
competitive process. Different people will have differ
ent views and then 
therefore, we'll put different value on different aspects of it. So I think it's 
too early to say exactly how we're going to structure the deal. But I think 
that you are right to push the fact that we believe with the discovered 
resource
 
that there is in place a project that is moving forward Phase 1, 
Phase 2 and 3 in Tortue, a strong cash element is an important part of the 
bid. And I think that's clear. That's an important part of the transaction for 
us.
 
Equally while there are some pie
ces that are not fully described today. I 
think there is significant upside to the resource base in Mauritania for 
instance. So how do we encapture 
--
 
capture that? And there are 
mechanisms in which we can do that. So I think you're right to look at it as 
being a combination, but I think the things move when we FID it in 
December. Yes, we have a real project moving forward real value, real cash 
flows underpinned by resource with an appraisal well on Greater Tortue 
Ahmeyim that underpin that resource. So I t
hink the cash element of that is 
an important part of the transaction.
 
Richard Tullis
 
That's also helpful. I do appreciate the sensitivity there. And just lastly, how 
much of downtime you have factored into the Gulf of Mexico third quarter 
guidance range?
 
Andy Inglis
 
We have sufficient. We 
--
 
just to give you an indication the 
--
 
let's say as a 
Barry, the impact of Barry on a full year basis was 400 barrels of oil per day. 
Yes. And so we have built in that plus an incident and plus another event of 
a simila
r size. So I think we're well covered in terms of the impact from 
hurricanes.
 
Richard Tullis
 
All right, Andy. Well that's all for me. Thanks so much.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. Thanks.

Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please procee
d.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Hey, thank you very much. I guess the first question is you're getting to a 
period even at a lower oil price environment where we see a substantial 
amount of free cash flow generation of the model. And maybe spend some 
time talking about allo
cation of that free cash flow and how much you want 
to return to shareholders versus reinvest in the business?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Thanks, Neil. And I think we're being clear on this. I think at the Capital 
Markets Day and 
--
 
I think we're clear on following 
through on that plan. I 
think the first half is good for you to recognize the strong free cash flow 
from the company, which I think is distinctive. And it's something that we're 
absolutely focused on. That's what Tom and I are primarily focused on is 
ensur
ing that we deliver on that. And it's good to see 2Q comes through 
strongly.
 
We're paying a dividend. We've announced the $0.18 per year. And we've 
announced that it would grow in line with the growth in the business. So I 
think we've been clear about the 
return of the cash to shareholders through 
the dividend. And I think the next track then for the cash delivery will be to 
bring the leverage down into our target range. We're setting as we showed 
on the view graph around on a backward looking basis around 
too. Our 
objective at year end is to get to the one times to 1.5 

 
sorry 

 
by year end 
to get to 1.7 times to 1.8 times on a journey to get to one times to 1.5 
times.
 
So I think 
--
 
and the balance sheet strength has been a distinctive part of 
Kosmos' strat
egy. It's allowed us to be opportunistic when opportunities 
have made themselves available. And I think looking forward Neil, I think 
there will be opportunities from the organic success that we have. We've 
talked about the drill out in the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Success across all three of those prospects is significant in terms of the 
opportunities that will present the business. And clearly we have been 
opportunistic around inorganic opportunities. But I think to us the first thing 
is confidently underpin the d
ividend and confidently bring the debt down into 
the target range of one to 1.5. And on current prices excluding the any 
proceeds of Mauritania/Senegal where we're going to be at 1.7 to 1.8 by 
year end.
 
Neil Mehta
 
I appreciate that. And the 
follow
-
up question is, is this BBC Panorama story 
on Senegal, I think you guys have been very public as well as BP in your 
response to it. But can you frame out that risk for investors who are on the 
call? Because it is something that does come up, and by 
virtue of you 
showing conviction around the Tortue asset sale I would imagine that that 
you feel like that's still on course and won't be disrupted from these 
headlines. But I want to give you a forum to respond.
 
Andy Inglis
 
So let me 
--
 
I appreciate you a
sking the question. I think we were right clear 
in our response to the program. We feel it is a inaccurate and misleading 
portrayal of our business in Senegal.
 
BP has been equally clear and so has the Government of Senegal. As far as 
the Government of Sene
gal is concerned they're very focused on the 
governance of the sector, which Kosmos fully supports. They recently been 
very clear through their COS
-
Petrogaz the entity, which governs the sector 
that there is absolutely no intention to question the licenses
 
that have been 
issued to Kosmos or BP. And in fact the government is very much focused on 
ensuring that the project moves forward.
 
And that is the most important thing that we talk to with potential buyers as 
they come into the data room is the project is
 
absolutely proceeding as 
planned. The progress made on Phase 1 in terms of the contracts being led 
steel being cut and that propagation occurring and the pre
-
FEED work that's 
occurring on Phases 2 and 3. So nothing has changed.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Appreciate Ingli

Our next question is from Bob Brackett with AllianceBernstein. Please 
proceed.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Question around Equatorial Guinea and specifically slide 7. I guess, I'll start 
fairly specifically that fall block that you're targeting for S5. Is the
 
50 million 
barrel target all within that fairway in that fall block?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And then going broader I'll see what I'll get away with. I see a number of 
both penetrated and unpenetrated fall blocks and I see two fairways. One 
question
 
would be, what color on that chart represents lowest known oil? 
And how prospective do you think those two fairways are? So if S
-
5 is 
successful, what's the sort of scale of the follow on opportunity?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah. I think, yeah, good questions Bob. I
 
think that the 
--
 
I think if S
-
5 is 
successful where we would go next is sort of is up
-
dip. We haven't got 
across section for years. If you went up that which is going to the east on 
that map, the resource upside would come in from that up
-
dip stratigraph
ic 
trap. And that's where the new seismic data has actually allowed us to see 
additional resource.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And that unpenetrated fall block east of the G
-
13
-
2, is that prospective?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. It is.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah. So look. I don't want to go. A good call good questions, right? So I 
think we're targeting the first well in what we believe is the lowest risk 
compartment, which is where the S
-
5 well has been targeted. And then I 
think the success ther
e allows us to have a tie back, which is economic. And 
then from there with that in place we can then test the up
-
dip resource, 
which would add significant additional volume.
 
And I think the other thing is to sort of recognize. As I said in my remarks 
that
 
the original wells were drilled off seismic that was 20 years old. Actually 
20 years old, yeah. And so the step changing quality is huge.
 
So we have the ability to image it a little better. And clearly, one of the 
reasons why this wasn't pursued in those 
days by Hess and actually our 
team actually was in the Triton days, we're involved in that handover with 
Hess was because the facilities were full at cyber and Okume and there 
wasn't a space.
 
So I think this is going to be interesting. And I think there we
re 
--
 
there are 
other opportunities of a similar well that we're starting to define now on the 
back of the enhanced data set.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And sorry to pester with one final one. What do you think the economic 
cutoff is for a viable tie back in terms of 
reserves?
 
Andy Inglis
 
It's around 
--
 
it's around that 50 million barrel mark. Yeah, it's around the 
50 million barrel mark. Yeah, it's more than enough. So it is a good question 
Bob. We haven't been able to bid at century, but in terms of where we are of 
a
ll the pre
-
FEED work that we've done, we would say it's around that 50 
million barrel mark, yeah.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Great. Thanks, again.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. Thanks.

Our next question is from Al Stanton with RBC Capital Markets. Please 
proceed with your
 
question. Al Stanton with RBC Capital Markets. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes. Good afternoon guys. Just a very quick question on the Gulf of Mexico. 
You mentioned a number of times I think that you've got a 
--
 
an inventory of 
drilling targets for the next five years or six years. So does that mean your 
plate is full with respect to exploration? And any new additions we should 
anticipate in the Gulf of Mexico very much focused on adding reserves 
production and cash flow inorgani
cally?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great question, Al. I think we're in an enviable position. I think, we've built a 
really strong portfolio of opportunities. We've access really low cost. And I 
couldn't be more pleased that the way in which we took advantage. I think 
of 
real low lay in the Gulf of Mexico to do that. It's interesting to see almost 
--
 
post the acquisition sort of more interest now in the deepwater. I think we 
can't be timed it really well.
 
And I actually think there will be inorganic opportunities that will
 
come up. I 
think the majors, I think constantly reevaluating the portfolios. So I think 
the simple answer is to say anything that we add has to compete with the 
inorganic returns. And I think we've demonstrated, I think that those in 
organic returns are p
retty good.
 
So we have choices and it's great to have choices. And I believe we're not 
driven to do anything from an inorganic perspective. We will obviously look 
at things. And if we believe that any new additions can match the high
-
quality that we have i
nternally then obviously, we would look at it. And I 
think it's great to have built that foundation now. So I think it's going to be 
interesting times in the Gulf of Mexico. But I think discipline, discipline, 
discipline is huge important. And we 

 
and I t
hink we've demonstrated that 
discipline through our initial ownership and growth in the Gulf.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Good. All right, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please 
proceed.
 
Pavel Molc
hanov
 
Thanks for taking the question. It so happens that this year your drilling 
schedule just for the company as a whole is very backend weighted with 

 
I 
think four prospects between September and November, or something like 
that. Are you going to be sus
taining that pace of exploration activity into 
2020, or is it just kind of a coincidence that Q4 of 2019 has such a large 
number of exploration prospects?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah, good question, Pavel. Yeah. It's a little bit of it 

 
it's just the 

 
obviously, if
 
you think of it three of the five are Gulf of Mexico. Yeah. And 
actually there are three operated well from the Gulf of Mexico. So it's really 
post the acquisition of DGE, building the portfolio, high
-
grading it, making 
sure we're drilling the right thing
s, getting access to the Resolution hub with 
BP, access actually and sort of equity 

 
progressing the equity conversations 
with Hess on Oilfield. Moneypenny was sort of always in the program where 
it was. But actually, the two operated wells required us to
 
sort of get those 
deals done then get the rigs. And the other point to mention is, we use rigs 
of opportunities. So that 

 
we can get very good rig rates and so we're not 
locked into a program actually that's happening to drive the rig.
 
So I think this is
 
a feature of the spool up post the acquisition of DGE. Now, 
once we would clearly as I described got four or five very strong prospects 
outlined for 2020 in the Gulf of Mexico. So what you will see is a more 
rateable program. And then the 

 
what follow on
 
in EG will depend on 
success in EG
-
13 or S5. And then we will time that the basin opening wells 
as the data matures. So I think you'll see a more 

 
so the answer is you're 
going to see a more rateable drilling program through 2020 and 2021 built
-
off the b
ack of a more rateable program in the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. That's helpful. Back to the cash flow allocation question, if we just 
look at your Q2 numbers and annualize with Brent in the $60's your stock's 
trading at around three times 
cash flow from operations obviously pretty low 
multiple by anybody's standards. I'm curious, what your thoughts are on 
share buyback as an opportunity to perhaps balance that out with 
deleveraging?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yeah. We've 

 
we have used share buybacks in t
he past. We obviously use 
stock to proportion of the acquisition of DGE, and we brought 

 
bought that 
back at Tom, what a 40% discount actually to address the dilution in that 
deal. And as we talked about, we've grown the company by over 50% 
EBITDAX produc
tion quarter 2019 versus 2018 2Q, 2Q with minimal dilution. 
So we've used it opportunistically in that way. Yes, it remains an option, and 
I'm not going to rule it out Pavel. It remains an option. I think we've been 
clear dividend, get the debt in the righ
t place and then it remains an option I 
think after that. So we don't rule it out. We've clearly used it in the past. 
And I think depending on the share price performance it remains an option. 
Tom, would you like to add anything?
 
Tom Chambers
 
No. I think t
hat kind of summarizes Andy from where we stand.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. And we're clear the balance sheet strength for us is something that has 
been good for Kosmos since we went public. And it's helped us I think 
distinguish ourselves in the sector and that's o
ur dividend balance sheet 
strength. And then 
--
 
and I think and then share buybacks would be an 
option.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Great. I appreciate it.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks.

Our next question is from James Hosie with Barclays. Please proceed.
 
James Hosie
 
Hi
 
there. Good morning. Good afternoon depending where you are. I guess 
firstly, on the Senegal/Mauritania divestment, I'm just wondering the extent 
to which you feel the drilling activity you're planning there for H2 given 
these impact of sales process?
 
And
y Inglis
 
Yes, good question James. I think we've been careful on our remarks that 
we anticipate having the Orca result before we would announce a 
transaction. So, that's sort of what we believe would be the outcome. 
Clearly, if things were to accelerate, t
here are mechanisms in which you can 
--
 
commercial mechanisms in which you can cope with that. So, it doesn't 
become a rate determining step. It's simply one that we can accommodate.
 
James Hosie
 
Okay. So it's possible that you could see the timing of the a
nnouncement 
slip into next year just on the timing of activity?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No. Orca 
--
 
we'll know the Orca result this year.
 
James Hosie
 
Okay. And the second question I had on Jubilee and the gas throughput 
enhancement plans, can you may be give us some c
olor on the scale of the 
uplift of production capacity at Jubilee you expect to achieve from that?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. So if you 
--
 
I don't want to get too much into the engineering, but a 
few. Today, the gas handling is on Jubilee is constrained to around 16
0 
million to 165 million. It's sort of in those 
--
 
we would hope to through the 
debottlenecking get to 180 million to 185 million. So and then actually, the 
uplift you get on the oil side will depend on the sort of the margin or GOR of 
a well. But it's sor
t of 10,000 barrels a day of oil production if you saw that 
increase.
 
James Hosie
 
Okay. Thanks very much for that.
 
Andy Inglis
 
From existing wells. It's not new wells being brought on from existing wells. 
So, it's material. And the most important part is 
it sort of helps you going 
forward. It's a constant break that you get rather than it'd be one that sort 
of on decline.
 
James Hosie
 
Right. Very clear. Thank you.

At this time, let me turn the call over to Mr. Neal Sahah, Vice President of 
Finance and Treasurer at 
Kosmos Energy. Please go ahead.
 
Neal Sahah
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our first quarter earnings release, which is available on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website, we have als
o 
published a presentation this morning giving an update on our Mauritania 
exploration program which available on the kosmosenergy.com website as 
well and we anticipate filing our 10
-
Q with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis,
 
Chairman and CEO; Tom 
Chambers, Chief Financial Officer and Brian Maxted Chief Exploration Officer
 
.
 
Following our prepared comments, we will have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session. Consistent with prior calls, I request that you only ask one primary 
question
 
and one follow
-
up question. This will help ensure we get to 

within our one hour minute timeframe, please contact me later today.
 
Before we get started, I would like to mention that
 
this conference call 
includes certain forward

GAAP
 
financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
Company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and shoul
d be read in conjunction with the information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 

 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Thanks Neal and good morning every one. Th
is quarter months has started 
as an exciting period for the company. I Joined Kosmos a little over a year 
ago and since then we've made great progress n delivering our second 
inning. We started with strengthening the balance sheet to prepare for 
exploratio
n success, we have done that and now sit in a great financial 
position, we then strengthened the management team and streamlined the 
organization, we now have the people we need to execute our plan.
 
Lastly we've delivered on the exploration front. As noted
 

announcement, we made a significant discovery and even more important 



s.
 
As I go through my remarks today, there are three messages I want to 
emphasize. First, our world
-
class Ghana assets are progressing as expected 
and remain on track to double gross production by 2017. Second is 
significance of our recent Tortue West disc

financial position and ability to invest throughout the cycle.
 
First in Ghana, we saw consistently strong oil production in the first quarter 
with average gross production from Jubilee of over 103,000 barrels of oil per 
day. 

increased gas exports by end of the quarter exporting approximately 75 
million cubic feet of gas per day to the onshore gas processing plant in 
Atuabo.
 
The power plant downstream in Aboadze
 
continues to the bottleneck on 
additional export, we expect the insulation of additional gas by power 
generation is number one and in the second half of the year will elevate this 
issue. This should enable us to further increase gas exports allowing us to
 
push Jubliee production at FPO so capacity.
 

International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea, rejected [indiscernible] request 
to Ghana suspend all ongoing exploration and development operations
 
in the 
disputed area in which the TEN project is situated until the Tribunal gives its 
decision on maritime boundaries dispute which is expected in late 2017.
 
However Tribunal did order Ghana to suspend new drilling in the disputed 
area. Given all ten wel
ls that are planned to be in line at first or already 
being drilled, we see this orders having limited or no impact in the early life 
from the project. Late in the first quarter, we will begin completions program 
and in July subsea insulations are set to b
egin. The TEN project is now more 
than 55% complete ad remains on time and on budget to deliver first ore in 
the second half of 2016.
 
I now want to shift gears and provide an update on Mahogany, Teak and 
Akasa discoveries in the Greater Jubliee area. In Ma
rch, we submitted the 

Ministry of Energy and Petroleum and expect to submit a plan of 
development later this year as part of a full field development plan for 
Jubliee. We are currentl
y in discussions with the government of Ghana 
regarding the declaration of commerciality for the Teak and Akasa 
discoveries, in particular we see the Akasa discoveries having some 
subservice uncertainty which needs further study potentially over two year 
p
eriod in order to support a declaration of commerciality.
 
At this point, let me pause for a moment to speak about the recent 
discovery in Mauritania and its implications for our second inning portfolio. 
As reported last week, the Tortue
-
1 well in block C8 
offshore Mauritania has 
made a significant base in opening discovery. Volumetrically, the well which 
tested the Tortue
-
1 west structure has far exceeded our [indiscernible] 
expectations and has discovered a large scale gas resource.
 
Our acreage in both Mau
ritania and Senegal covers approximately 45,000 
square kilometers which we own 60%. This success validates our business 
strategy of creating value per shareholders through the opening of new 
petroleum systems with substantial follow
-
on exploration prospect
ivity. 
While gas terms in some African countries have been unclear contract terms 
in Mauritania and Senegal anticipate gas are explicitly set forth in the PSCs 
under our competitor globally.
 
Brian will provide more details on the discovery later; the impor
tant point to 
take away is the size of our acreage and the calibration of our seismic data 
have put us in a good position to drill a series of perspective follow
-
on 
exploration wells. As reported in March, the CB1 exploration well located in 
the Cap Boujdo
ur permit offshore West Sahara encountered hydrocarbons 
However, the discovery was non
-
commercial and the well was plugged and 
abandoned.
 
While non
-
commercial, we were able to derisk two of the major unknowns in 
the Frontier basin and working source rock a
n effective trap including a 
regional top seal, what we did not find was commercial scale reservoir, as 
the first one of the basin, we are encouraged by this initial well results and 
are now reworking our play and prospect models to locate on that potentia
l 
prospect in this basin.
 
Lastly, I would like to comment how well positioned we are from a financial 
perspective, in March we announced our borrowing based redetermination; 
we successfully included our TEN project for the first time. In April, we 
finalize
d our add
-
on secured note offering of $225 million, this offering 
provided us additional liquidity to further accompany for success. Pro forma 
for the note offering we have $1.9 billion of liquidity to execute our program. 
Additionally, the company continu
es to actively manage our hedging 
program as the end of April, we have approximately 12.7 million barrels 
hedged through 2017. We continue to protect our balance sheet and are 
taking the necessary steps to ensure we can execute our activity set.
 
And now, I

and then Brian will review the Tortue
-
1 well results. Tom.
 
Thomas P. Chambers
 
Thank you, Andy. Good morning everyone. Financial performance for the 
first quarter was strong and as 
Andy just indicated, the company acted 
proactively to strengthen our balance sheet to prepare for future success. 
We finished the quarter with two crude oil liftings generating revenues of 
$109 million for the quarter. This excludes derivative settlements 
of $51 
million over the quarter.
 
When you add our revenue to our settled hedges, it reflects a realized price 
of approximately $84 or $0.47 per barrel. For the quarter, we generated a 
net loss of $79 million or $0.21 per diluted share driven largely by 
exp
loration expense related to the CB
-
1 well, adjusting for the impact of 
realized and unrealized commodity derivatives, the company generated a 
net loss of $67 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the quarter.
 
On the cost side, operating expense in the fir
st quarter was $32 million or 
$16.90 per barrel sold versus $16 million in the first quarter of 2014. This 
was higher than our annual guidance due to the timing of work over activity 
in the Jubilee field. All planned activity for 2015 was completed during 
the 
first quarter and therefore we expect OpEx to normalize over the course of 
2015.
 
Exploration expense for the quarter was $99 million included were $84 
million of dry hole cost associated with the CB
-
1 exploration well on the Al 
Khayr prospect, cost rel
ated to a large 3D seismic survey in Senegal as well 
as ongoing seismic processing and interpretation expenditures throughout 

were $39 million compared with $40 million incurred durin
g the fourth 
quarter of 2014. [Indiscernible] and depreciation expense was $37 million or 
$19.48 per barrel of oil sold versus $23.94 per barrel sold in the first quarter 
of 2014.
 
Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2015 was $26 million; the 
majori
ty of the amount was related to current taxes in Ghana. 
Approximately $11 million of the taxes are related to the tax impact 
associated with the mark
-
to
-
market of our commodity hedges during the 
quarter. In the first quarter, we spent $168 million on CapEx
, excluding $30 
million of proceeds associated with our Mauritania farm
-
out, while this was 
recognized from an accounting perspective in the first quarter; we expect to 
receive those cash proceeds in the second quarter.
 
Kosmos exited the first quarter of 2
015 with $1.7 billion of liquidity and 
$407 million of net debt compared to $1.9 billion of liquidity and $213 
million of net debt as of December 31, 2014. The increase in net debt since 
year end 2014 is primarily driven by changes in working capital. Adju
sting 
for the $225 million add on issuance of senior notes in April, we would have 
had pro forma liquidity of $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2015. In terms of our 
guidance for the year, our previously issued full
-
year guidance remains 
unchanged including our
 
CapEx budget of $800 million.
 

 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Thanks Tom. As I make my remarks, I will be talking through the 
presentation provided on the website titled Mauritania Exploration
 
Update. 

-
1 Well Objectives on Page 3. Tortue well without a 
doubt is a world
-
class discovery and the first test of the outboard petroleum 
system in Mauritania. The well was designed to test Tortue West, which is 
part of the Great
er Tortue Complex as you can see depicted in the image. 
Pre
-
drill, Tortue West carried approximately a third of the estimated 
resource base of the Greater Tortue Complex and as Andy mentioned, the 
results have far exceeded our pre
-
drill volumetric expectat
ions.
 
The well importantly has also opened a new outboard Cretaceous petroleum 
system offshore Mauritania and Northern Senegal, which we have captured 
with our large contiguous 45,000 square kilometer position. With this 
discovery, we have also extended ou
r track record about forming the 
industry and opening up frontier basins.
 

preliminary analysis of drilling and logging results, Tortue
-
1 intersected a 
107 meters or 351 feet of net hydro
carbon pay in two pools. A single gas 
pool was encountered in the Primary Lower Cenomanian objective. 
Importantly, we discovered excellent reservoir throughout the Lower 
Cenomanian with multi [indiscernible] permeability and 20% to 30% 
porosity. A separate
 
zone, 19 meters or 62 feet thick was penetrated within 
the Secondary Upper Cenomanian target.
 
On Page 5 you can see a cross
-
section on the top reservoir structure map of 
the trap. The trap is a combination structural stratigraphic feature with dip 
closure
 
to the west and the channel pinch out to the east. Based on our 
preliminary analysis of the well results, which have been integrated with 
seismic information, we believe the resource base at Tortue West is between 
5 Tcf and 12 Tcf of recoverable resource,
 
with a mean of 8 Tcf.
 
The 5 Tcf case assumes gas is recoverable through the interval intersected 
by the Tortue
-
1 Well and conservatively assumes a 30% net to gross. The 
12 Tcf case is based on the projected gas water contact derived from both 
seismic data
 
and well
-
pressure information and assumes a 55% net grosses 
encountered in the well.
 
As shown on Page 6, at this size, Tortue West alone is potentially the largest 
associated or non
-
associated gas discovery offshore West Africa. As Andy 
mentioned, the oth
er differentiator is we have defined gas terms in our 
PFCs. The maritime boundary is not in dispute and precedence already exists 
for cross
-
border cooperation. As a result, we believe that as we move 

n of terms with or 
between the two governments.
 
Page 7 shows a section through the Greater Tortue Complex, which 
comprises three distinct tracking geometries. As noted the Tortue
-
1 Well 
tested Tortue West in which the Lower Cenomanian is the primary object
ive. 
Tortue East and North target primarily the Albo

Aptian more and ought to be 
tested by subsequent wells. The strong dependence of these prospects of 
adjacent Tortue
-
1 Well, particularly in regard to charge and trap as well as 
calibration of reservoir a
nd hydrocarbon presence by ABO, with this we 

Greater Tortue Complex. We believe in aggregate the Greater Tortue 
Complex has a resource potential between 6 Tcf and 22 Tcf.
 
On Page 
8 we outline our 45,000 square kilometer position offshore 
Mauritania and Senegal. The outboard cretaceous petroleum system we are 
targeting in both countries is located in a range of water depths from 1,000 
meters to 3,000 meters of water. The Tortue
-
1 We
ll results are of 
significance in terms of making a world
-
class discovery and substantially de
-
risking adjacent prospects in the Greater Tortue Complex.
 
More broadly, the well results is also important with respect to the 
exploration potential and the outb
oard Mauritania and Northern Senegal 
petroleum systems are haul for two reasons. Firstly, it proves the play 
concept of cretaceous reservoirs in combination structural stratigraphic 
traps, charged [indiscernible]. Fundamentally, Tortue
-
1 has proven a 
worki
ng hydrocarbon system. Also, the untested prospectivity includes a 
Cenomanian reservoir proven by Tortue
-
1 as well as deeper exploration 
targets with the potential for other source rocks.
 
Secondly, we now have excellent well to seismic calibration. The wel
l results 
confirmed our ability to define reservoir and charged presence as well as 
trap. The Top and Lower Cenomanian reservoirs penetrated within 20 meters 
of prognosis, and its thickness to within 10%. This provides us additional 
confidence in our futur
e exploration program given the predictive ability of 
the seismic.
 
In Mauritania, the next prospect we will drill will be the Marsouin prospect, 
which is located in the Central portion of the C8 well and fed by different 
river systems. As shown on Slide 9,
 
Marsouin is also very simple four
-
way 
structure; it has a strong similarity from a trap perspective to Tortue
-
1 and 

objectives and [indiscernible] Tortue
-
1 as well as deeper targets. In 
the 
event for success from a charge reservoir and trap standpoint Marsouin will 
further derisk the remaining potential we have identified in both Block C
-
8 as 
well as our C
-
12 Block to the north.
 
Slide 9 also shows an example of our Fastrack 3D structure l
ead data set 
from Senegal which is currently being interpreted. It clearly confirms 
structure leads with previously defined on 2D seismic. These display 
significant size as well as track geometry which strongly resembles the 
Tortue West discovery, potentia
l seismic attributes which could support 
reservoir and hydrocarbon presence.
 
Lastly on Page 10, we outlined our forward program through 2015, we are 
still on location at Tortue
-
1 and we expect the well to be completed shortly. 
Following a pre
-
agreed farm o
ut of the next rig slots of Atwood Achiever the 
rig will come back to us in the third quarter and we will drill our Marsouin 
prospect. Given the implications of the Tortue
-
1 well, we are in the process 
of planning an accelerated exploration of appraisal pr
ogram offshore 
Mauritania and Senegal.
 
An appraisal program is being planned to delineate the Tortue West 
discovery and an exploration program is being formulated to test the other 
prospects of the Greater Tortue Complex which extends into the St. Louis 
Of
fshore Profond Block in Senegal. We expected to fill our fourth rig slot this 
year with an exploration of price well on the Greater Tortue Complex with 
continuing exploration appraisal in Mauritania and Senegal through next 
year.
 
To summarize the Tortue
-
1 
well as a significant discovery for Kosmos, 
[indiscernible] the new outboard petroleum system offshore Mauritania and 
Senegal. Our position offers substantial exploration potential and we have 
captured the core of the trend, the 60% working interest and op
eratorship of 
all five large licenses. So as Andy indicated, we have placed ourselves in a 
good position to test this potential through a series of high impact wells 
which will enable us to determine the size and extent of the commercial 
resource in this p
art of our exploration portfolio.
 
Now I will turn the call back to Andy.

question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Good morning everyone. This is Zack [indiscernible] covering for Ed, real 
quick here. Thanks for taking the call. Has any of the work done at Tortue 
indicated any oil freeze in the region especially kind of as regard to kind 
of 

have gone back taking a look at the models and the results. How are you 
thinking about Marsouin and what changes are you making to your approach 
if any of there?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Hi
 

 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, hi Zack, before we drill to Tortue
-
1 the biggest uncertainty for us was 

basin which has got limited informat
ion particularly in the outboard at this 

interesting is that acreage to the north is bounded by an oil play in the 
shallow water part of Mauritania and to the south the recent can disco
very 
which is just south of our acreage in Northern Senegal is also oil. So without 
question, since we are framed by oil discoveries with north and south of our 
acreage whilst we made a gas discovery in Tortue there clearly is a lot of 
potential for oil as
 
well as gas in the space.
 
Q 

unidentified Analyst
 


monetizing that? Thank you.
 
Thomas P. Chambers
 
Ye
s, what I would say is its early days and in terms of the composition of the 


getting all the data on that b
ut I think just in short we manage our 
expectations. I think you should expect that this is a low CGR gas.
 


ave high 
deliverable wells. We have wells that are probably low CGR there for the 
subsea architecture, I think, is a lot simpler as a result. So, I think, what we 
need to do is go forth with the appraisal plans and as Brian indicated, we 
have a potential w
ell planned for the end of this year and then through into 
a full well program in 2016 and I think, now, the important thing now is to 
build a picture, build the resource base and integrate the well results into a 
comprehensive plan for the field, so early
 
days.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Perfect. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with 
Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Maybe if I could and be talk a little b
it 
about the resource range, I realized the importance of the net to gross in 
the gas water contact in terms of the range, but can you talk, maybe a little 
bit about do you assume different recovery factors at the various net to 
gross range points and then
 
maybe as a follow
-
up on that, you had 
mentioned in the start about Tortue West being about a third of the resource 
in the Greater Tortue Complex, but within the updated range, it seems to 
represent a much larger than a third portion relative to Tortue Nor
th and 
East. Can you talk maybe a little bit about what you assume for Tortue North 
and East and what the potential is there?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

 
Ryan Todd
 
Sorry!
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

ut today, I think, a relatively straightforward 
way to look at the resource. I think as you look at Tortue West itself, we 
know the 5 Tcf number, the low
-
end, is not setting a conservative view. 

 
conservative 


world.
 
And clearly we have another view, which is from what we believe is the 
inferred gas 
water contact, the porosity that we actually saw in the well and 
the net to gross that we saw in the well. So, those are of two bookends and 
I think they reflect subjectively what we have. And if you, sort of, take those 
bookends and take the deterministic
 
view and you compare it to what we 
had pre
-

 


we had originally. So, the increment
 
you can see is a result of the increment 


trying to give you, I think, is a credible range of resour
ces based on a 
credible set of assumptions.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Okay, that makes sense. So, at this point, the resource estimates therefore 
Tortue East and North are the same as what they were on pre
-
drill 
application.
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Yes, absolutely.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Okay.
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Which is, again is a sort of sensible place to stand at this point.
 
Ryan Todd
 

Mauritania Senegal relationship at this point. I guess, can you talk a little bit 
about 

play out when it comes to eventual development?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Yes, Brian and I visited both presidents, actually in the last week and so sort 
of have a first
-
hand knowledge, I thi
nk, of how they would see it. I think, 
the first thing to say is that the countries have a history of working together. 
In fact, the recent Banda project, which was a small gas field in Mauritania 
was going to be developed and actually power sold to both S
enegal and Mali.
 
So it illustrates the ability for two countries to cooperate particularly in the 
energy sector. And the working relationship between the NLC is strong and 
between the ministries. So I think that an important thing and they have a 
track rec
ord with things such as Banda. I think also on the Senegal side, 
they have a history of working cross border issues with Guinea Bissau, they 


sue was dealt with.
 

think signaled that that issue can be managed in a very practical way and 
clearly from both countries perspective, what they want is to see the 
development mov
e forward and this is not an acumen on the country, this 
would be absolutely the top priority. So that is what gives me confidence 
that this thing can be done in a sensible way and there is the history and the 
analogs that they can roll on.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with 
Societe Generale. Please go ahead with your question.
 
John P. Herrlin
 
Hi, Thanks. Going fo
rward, once you delineate Tortue better, is this the kind 
of gas where you could just bring it to shore or you have to go up to shallow 
or depths with the idea of an LNG type project, have you given any thought?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
John, again, good question.
 
Look, again, early days all right. But if you 


which from a fluid assurance perspective makes it an easier flu
id to handle. 



on our mind a

actually get the fluid properly characterize and then we can work itbut it 
certainly, it would make the development a lot easier because you can 
-
 
you 
have a very simple subsurface architectur
e as a result.
 
John P. Herrlin
 
Sure, Thanks. With you DSTs, some of the subsequent delineation wells or 
A1 DST?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
I think, again, among since inception, we would obviously want to establish 
connectivity could be that couple of ways with the 
DST with price attached. 
And clearly you probably want to get a better view of the CGL. So those are 

about in the future, John. But I think, our view today is we have a relatively 
simpl
e structure that requires whether the appraisal could be relatively 
straight forward. I think we want to make sure, we capture the data we 
need from each well, given that each well 
-
 

number of wells.
 
John P. Herrlin
 
Okay
. Last one for me. Are you going to basically re
-
process all the seismic 
now that you have now this track column delineating?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Hey, John.
 
John P. Herrlin
 
Hey Brian.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
The Mauritania survey 
which is proprietary obviously is fully processed. We 
have that is in place all are various attributes, the fast track, the Senegal 3D 
is still in the process of being processed and actually we only have the fast 
track deliverables at the moment and the re
st of it will be through later in 
the year. And that 3D survey will be integrated with Mauritania 3D surveys 
as that we effectively a single data set to work with. But there are obviously 
both state
-
of
-
the
-
art 3D surveys, the geology behaves extremely well
 
and 


 

same scale shown on that slide and
 


one little polygon, one big polygon at the border with Mauritania and 
Senegal but there is a lot of other opportunity around here particu
larly in 
Northern Senegal where the definition at the moment is only based on the 
existing 2D seismic. So we would expect to see prospect activity enhanced 
as we interpret new seismic. So it is interesting times for us.

Great, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with 
Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes good afternoon guys. I just wanted to go a little bit back to the 
beginning and just ask about why Tortue was picked, was it just the biggest 
structure with the brightest anomaly unfortunately in the deepest water and 
then what you get from here I appr
eciate you want to appraise this 
discovery but it is fair spectrum of maybe seismic anomalies where actually 
pledged once since the gas brackets and then look at other ones which 
perhaps might be more indicative of oil and high put them at hierarchy 
becaus
e ultimately I still think you would still rather have oil than gas?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

the approach that why Tortue first and then move forward from that.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 

s important that the context for the selection of the first well was this, 
we have the Mauritania for three years, we shot that 3D, it is fully 
processed, the prospectivity at this stage of the exploration program is 
defined and Tortue clearly was one of t
he lead prospects there.
 
We also had Senegal and we were not in the process of forming out Senegal, 


that puddin
g a well into Tortue was going to help us derisk not just 
Mauritania but also give us the calibration to evaluate the 7000 square 
kilometers of 3D in Senegal and so it was deliberately chosen as the 
prospect that was somewhat centralized. So the two positi
ons which 
obviously as we now go forward with the exploration strategy, we got to 
integrate as we get the full data sets combined together.
 

-
 
as the 
industry has been shown over the last few ye
ars, it was shown in the Gulf of 
Mexico many years ago, bright spot exploration are actually quite dangerous 
because it was pretty good at demonstration to presence of hydrocarbons 

s
cale reservoirs, we have this issue ourselves in [Indiscernible] and so the 
out petroleum analysis workflow is very much focused.
 
It is integrating the physical attributes with a solid robust geological story 
which predicts reservoir presence, quality arou
nd province, depositional 

integral to protecting reservoir in Tortue which is excellent and one of the 
great things about Tortue is the deliverability of these wells is going to be 
eno
rmous because of the reservoir quality and the reservoir effectiveness.
 
And so the future exploration program of course we will bear in mind the 
attributes including AVEO that will be part of our risking and ranking the 
prospect but it is not 
-
 
it is not t
he primary driver by any means and we will 
be probably drilling as many dense spots we drill, we drill bright spots as we 
go forward.
 
Al Stanton
 
Can I just ask one follow
-
up then? In terms of source rocks did you 
encounter any potential source rocks in 
this well?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 

really are anything from lake Jurassic all the way through to the 
conventional more well
-
known source rocks in this area, Cenomanian

Turonian, and it woul

rocks working. And over the area that we have, multiple source rocks work 
in either in the gas window or in the oil window. That would be our 
expectation.
 

market, to understand, as I said earlier to 
John, that running room on this new petroleum system is huge and I would 
be shocked for it all to be gas, just as I would be shocked for it all to be oil. I 




province. We see it as a province as a huge hydrocarbon province containing 
a lot of gas
 
and hopefully over the course of the next year or two we will 

 
Al Stanton
 

 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Again, I think it is early days. You know, what we need to do is ensure that 

edible appraisal program for a greater Tortue. We have a 
credible exploration program that fully delineates that area and then as 
Brian says, in the right way, we start an exploration program across the 
extent of Northern Mauritania to Northern Senegal, bu

of ourselves. This is all about insuring we do it in a disciplined way, we are 
efficient about integrating information.
 

second rig, we could get a second rig 
and we can design the program to fit. 



at that

Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with 
Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for taking th
e question guys. You mentioned the clarity on the fiscal 
terms in Mauritania. Can you quickly recap what they are and how they 
compare to what you have been getting in Ghana?
 
Thomas Chambers
 
Yes, you know, Pavel, well, what I suggest we do is we can go thr
ough it in 
a broad sense. What I would say is, I think, Neil can talk you through it in 
more detail off
-
line. The most important part is that the terms in the PSCs 
did anticipate gas. Quite often, I think, in West Africa there has been an 
issue with the te
rms not being clear whereas, I think, both whereas, both 
with Mauritania and the Senegal PSCs we anticipated it.
 
So, you know, the state participation is 10%. The cost recovery ceiling is 

profit gas. The 
state reimbursement of the contractor is phased. And what I would do is 

probably simpler if Neil goes through it with you in detail afterwards. Anyone 
else that wants t
o insure their modeling is accurate, they can do that.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Yes. No, quite clear enough. Then, can I ask a quick one about hedging. 
Given the extent of the Contango right now in the Brent Curve, are you 
looking at perhaps more for 2016 or subseq
uent years than you would have 
under normal circumstances?
 
Thomas P. Chambers
 
Yes, Pavel, we just added 2 million barrels for 2017. So, you know, the 
Contango nature of the curve is not lost on us. So, you know, we like to be 
in the market on a continual b
asis. So, we saw a chance to actually hedge 
some in 2017. So, we took 2 million barrels and got a 72.50 swap and we 


your 
question is yes.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. Appreciate it, guys.
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Great. Thanks, Pavel. Okay.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with 
Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Robert S. Morris
 
Thanks. And congratulations gentlemen on the Tortue discovery. Let me 
jump over to Jubliee, you mentioned that you had the gas rate up to 75 
million cubic foot a day, what would then be the rate of oil after the FPSO 

f it currently and where would you 
need to get that gas rate up to be able to take the ramp up the PSO capacity 
to 120,000 barrels a day?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

that we really need to 
do. One is the clearly the by moving gas from the 
reservoir, we are ultimately lowering the CGR which is good allows us to 
process oil. So there is a sort of time function as we produce the gas, the 
allowed CGR and therefore over time you will see an impro
vement in the oil 
rate. Clearly what you also need to do is support the reservoir pressure by 
water injection, so that you could maintain that oil throughput.
 

capacity, with a 75 million 
export rate, I think the way that you should think 
about it is that in the same half of the year, given that we expect that to be 
greater thermal power generation capacity at Aboadze, that if it turns up in 
time, that will allow us then in the back half of
 
the year to drive the gas 
rates up.
 
And then through time, you will see a lowering of the CGR, the pressure in 

uplift in the oil rate. So there is a time dependence here, the two t
hings 

 
Robert S. Morris
 
So given at where is the oil rate currently and what did it ramp up to by year 
end?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

headed towards the 120 

the year, we anticipate we have that production rate that appears capacity 

things remember of course is those are production rates t
hat they at the 

number is lower.
 
Robert S. Morris
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
All right. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Warn with 
BM
O Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Good morning, gentlemen. This Brendan Warn from BMO. Just a follow
-
up 
question, there is so much on the physical terms of as more just a 
relationship at the moment with Chevron related to 
Tortue, and can you just 
remind me what terms are right to be got and I appreciate its early days, 
appreciate you got a lot of follow
-
up drilling in potential in this region, 
having covered it since [indiscernible] days. Just your ability to form down, 
slo
w down. So what are the rights in terms for the government and should 
Chevron to backing at this point please.
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 
Okay well just sort of summarize that over beginning of the year, we 
announced Chevron forming into the Mauritania acreage and t
hat forming in 
30% by a disproportionate cost of the well which is on the Marsouin well. 
They have a right to back in post the discovery well on Tortue at the same 

anticipate Chevron m
aking that decision probably until the beginning of next 

 
So that sort of leaves us with a 60% share in Mauritania and that go to our 
strategy. The point is that as we look at it today, this i
s an area as areas 
Brian described every time significant remaining prospective, we have the 
financial position to be able to drill it down and our view would be, that we 
want to fully delineate the scale and quality of Mauritania acreage position 
and that

 
And clearly, as you we that, we believe we then have the option to make 
further determination at what level of equity, we would want to carry at a 
particularly at a development decision. So, what I say Brendan i
s, that this is 

have a partner such as Chevron, it is great.
 
We have a great working relationship and the two companies worked 
together very well. And as we forward we have the 
ability to the flex all level 
of equity spend and, as we see a commercial development becoming close to 

 
Brendan Warn
 
Okay, thanks. Then just one follow
-
up, just in terms of LNG export terms, I 
understand you got gas
 
fiscal terms for the out stream but just like a 
comment on terms of the value chain with the Mauritania as extents today?
 
Andrew G. Inglis
 

government on what that explore would be, so 
obviously very early days. 
What we would note is that in Mauritania is clearly proximate to Europe. This 
could be a significant gas resource which is proximate to a major market and 
therefore I believe has differential position in the market because of 
geo
graphic position.
 



the prel
iminary views of the Tortue

Officer; Brian Maxted, Chief Exploration Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief 
Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Manage
ment believes such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information
 
contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie, and good morning and afternoon, everyone. Before I move 
on to discuss the c

short review of 2017. Tom will follow later with the details of the 2017 
financials and the guidance for 2018.
 
2017 was a year of strong operational and strategic delivery and one of the 
most succes

more than 300 million benefitting from the BP deal in Mauritania and 
Senegal as well as reliable underlying performance.
 
We used the cash to diversify our production base with Equatorial Guine
a 
acquisition creating another source of growth as well as paying down debt to 
further enhance our credit metrics.
 
We completed the refinancing of our reserve base lending facility earlier this 
month and have $1.3 billion of capacity of self
-
funded, new or
ganic growth 
and potential inorganic opportunities.
 

immediately accretive and we now believe has a payback period of less than 
two years in the current oil price environment.
 
We ha
d over 200% organic reserve replacement in the year with production 
growth of around 66% largely from the ramp up in Ghana, but also taking 
into account one month of contribution from EG.
 
In exploration, we completed the second phase of drilling in the eme
rging 
Mauritania and Senegal basin, a program that has discovered around 40 Tcf 
of gas gross at a cost around $0.20 a boe. This includes the Yakaar 
discovery which was the largest hydrocarbon discovery of the year in 2017 
and has the potential to be a seco
nd LNG hub in the region.

three topics. Brian will then address the exploration portfolio. And Tom will 
close with the financials.
 
Turning now to Slide 3. Kosmos is a well
-
capitalized, pure
-
play deepwater 
compan
y, is ideally positioned to take advantage of the upturn in the 
deepwater sector. Starting from a macro level, the world needs more oil and 
gas to meet growing energy demand. This will come from both deepwater 
and shale.
 
The companies that were ultimately 
successful are those with the best 
acreage, the most favorable end returns and the lowest cost. In deepwater, 
lowest cost and reduced competition are making the sector more attractive. 
We have seen the majors returning, particularly in West Africa and Sout
h 
America.
 

deepwater driven in part by a retrenchment back to the U.S. on
-
shore. This 
means there are fewer players with Kosmos playing alongside the majors in 
these world
-
class basins
.
 
Whereas the shale companies are all starting to talk about cost inflation, we 
are still living in a deflationary cost environment in the deepwater and I will 
come on to talk about that shortly. Kosmos has used the downturn in the 
energy markets over the 
last few years to our benefit and is well positioned 
to take advantage of these changing market dynamics.
 
Through our countercyclical approach, we have remained focus on our core 
strengths; consistent disciplined execution of our strategy, deployment of 
in
novative development solutions and forming strategic partnerships where 
we leverage the expertise of others to deliver superior results.
 

from our production assets, development p
rojects and our exploration 
portfolio. We believe now is the time to invest in the deepwater and now is 
the time to invest in Kosmos.
 

through the downturn. We have high
-
margin p
roducing assets in Ghana and 
EG with an operating cash flow of approximately $40 per barrel at $60 per 
barrel Brent.
 

with the next phase of growth to increase production and cash flow. 
With 15 
Tcf of discovered resource we believe we have the gas in place to support a 
10 million ton per annum project.
 
The $533 million carry from BP funds a substantial portion of our share of 
the initial phase and establishes the 
infrastructure for the ramp up to full 
development. Initial discovered resource base from Teranga and Yakaar 
have the potential for a second LNG hub in the region.
 
We have a sustainable exploration program with a balance of proven, 
emerging and frontier ba
sin opportunities with multiple catalysts this year 
and the years to come with two to three wells expected per year.
 
In proven basins, like EG, we have short cycle tie
-
back opportunity. In 
emerging basins, we continue to prove up plays with significant fol
low
-
on 

Suriname.
 
And in Frontier basins where we capture major acreage positions to fully 

And behind all 
of this, we have a strong balance sheet and low leverage 
which enables the consistent execution of this strategy.
 
Turning now to Slide 5. The chart on the left
-
hand side illustrates the point I 
made earlier about the return of the majors to the deepwater. 
Kosmos is 
well positioned to play with and alongside these companies with one of the 
largest total acreage positions in West Africa and South America, excluding 
Brazil.
 
On the right
-
hand side, you can see how capital costs in the offshore have 
come down ov
er the last few years and are still falling through 2018 before 
modest inflation is forecast in 2019 and 2020. Contrast this to shale where 
capital costs hit a low during the downturn in 2016 and rose sharply in 2017 
which is forecast to continue for the n
ext three years.
 
Turning to Slide 6 where we look at the competitiveness of deepwater 
projects versus shale. In summary, the best deepwater projects compete 
with the best of shale. The chart on the left shows the breakeven price of the 
top quartile oil pro
jects around the world.
 
You can see from the light blue bar that the best offshore oil projects have a 
breakeven in line or even better in the case of Jubilee and the best of shale 
project which include the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian as 
wel
l as Viking, DJ Basin, San Juan Basin and the Eagle Ford shale plays.
 
The chart on the right is a reminder. The deepwater still makes up a much 
larger percentage of global supply than shale today and therefore is an 
important source of future supply growth
.
 

Jubilee Field which Kosmos discovered in 2007 with first production in 2010 
and the TEN fields we started production in 2016. These are big fields which 
continue to get bigger and we
 
have averaged a reserve replacement ratio of 
over 140% over the last three years.
 
Our production has risen steadily over 2016 and 2017 and is expected to 
rise further in 2018 as we resume drilling on both fields as a result of the 
ITLOS ruling and the Gre
ater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan approved 
in 2017.
 
Rig operations are expected to start imminently with the Maersk Venturer 
drillship. The initial program is sequenced to drill one producer at TEN to one 
producer at Jubilee and then completion oper
ations will begin at Jubilee.
 
For the year we plan to drill and complete four wells in the Jubilee and TEN 
fields. A second rig is under evaluation by the partnership and would 
commence operations later in 2018. This reflects the significant value
-
adding 
o
pportunity that exists in both fields.
 
The assets we have in Ghana are high
-
margin barrels and we expect this to 
increase further as we work with the operator to drive operating efficiencies. 
We should deliver further margin expansion in the future.
 
With r
egard to the Turret Remediation Plan, the partnership is aligned on the 
engineering solution. This involves a shutdown to stabilize turret bearing this 
quarter followed by work to rotate the vessel to a new heading and 
permanently spread more of the vessel
.
 
The Turret stabilization shutdown is being conducted in two phases, the first 
of which is complete and all production is back on line. The second phase is 
expected to commence around the end of the quarter and we anticipate the 
overall shutdown of oil pr
oduction for both phases to be around four weeks.
 
It is anticipated the gas system will be shut in for slightly longer to complete 
non
-
Turret
-
related maintenance. We now expect the rotation of the vessel to 
take place around the end of the year with minima
l impact to production in 
2018. As a result, we expect seven cargoes from Jubilee in 2018 and four 
cargoes from TEN.
 
Slide 9. I now want to move on to our production assets in Equatorial 
Guinea. We announced the acquisition in late 2017 and this transactio
n 
closed at the end of November with the final consideration of $460 million 
gross or $230 million net to Kosmos.
 

access to a proven oil producing basin which is well known to the Ko
smos 
team, as Brian and a number of other colleagues originally discovered the 
fields in EG before they were sold to Hess in the early 2000.
 

the existing producing reserves base; s
econd, the addition of new reserves 
to infill drilling; and thirdly, tie
-
back opportunities from the surrounding 
exploration blocks we accessed in parallel to the Hess acquisition.
 
Financially, the deal was highly accretive to Kosmos and we bought it at 2x
 
EBITDAX while trading at around 7x at the time of the acquisition. We 
acquired more high
-
margin barrels to complement the high
-
margin 
production we have in Ghana.
 

built on gross 20
18 production at 37,000 barrels of oil per day and as a 

two months, we are now forecasting 2018 production of 43,000 barrels of oil 
per day, an increase of more than 15%.
 
This in 
conjunction with a higher oil price has reduced the expected payback 
from around three years at the time of announcement to significantly less 

-
50 JV with Trident Energy 
whose expertise is in optimizing product
ion and driving costs lower, an 
example of Kosmos using innovative partnerships to create value.
 
On Slide 9, looking at the year ahead in Equatorial Guinea, we expect to 
maximize the value of the existing resource through production optimization 
of existin
g wells, waterflood optimization and the installation of electrical 
submersible pumps or ESPs which should help drive further production gains 
in 2019.
 
Production on the field is currently gasless limited and the installation of 
ESPs is expected to enable 
more fluid to be lifted and as a result increase oil 
production. On the exploration side, Kosmos would acquire 3D seismic over 
the W, S and EG
-
21 blocks with processing expected in the latter half of the 
year and drilling likely in 2019.
 
As you can see fro
m the chart on this slide, we will begin with infield and 
near field short cycle tie
-
back opportunity before looking at the potential of 
deeper, larger standalone prospects. The slide also identifies the value 
added from extending field life by deferring t
he timing of abandonment with 
further opportunities currently being worked to reduce the prior operators 
abandonment cost estimates.
 
Slide 11 summarizes our reserves and production across Ghana and EG, the 
foundational asset that underpin the base value of
 
the company. There are 
two important points to take away from this slide. First, despite material 
levels of production over the last three years we have continued to increase 
our 2P reserves with around 200 million barrels oil equivalent net to Kosmos 
at 
year
-
end 2017, an increase of over 35% versus year
-
end 2015.
 
Second, with the data prepared by our reserves auditor using PV
-
10, you 
can see that the 2P reserves less net debt underpins a base value of 
approximately $6 per share in line with our current sh
are price. This does 
not include the contribution of our 3P reserves which takes a number closer 
to $9 per share. This also does not include the Tortue gas development 

those sources 
of growth.
 
So turning to Slide 13 with an update on the Tortue gas development in 
Senegal and Mauritania where BP is leading the project. This is a world
-
scale 
gas project which we and BP plan to develop on our accelerated timeline and 

competitive.
 

signed earlier this month which now paves the way to the final investment 
decision around the end of the year. Tortue is a giant gas field with 15 Tcf 
resource which we expec
t to underpin at 10 million ton per annum LNG 
project with the first phase set to deliver 2.5 million tons per annum of LNG 
from a near shore LNG facility.
 
First gas is confirmed by BP and their 4Q results this month is expected in 
late 2021. Kosmos is lar
gely carrier in the first phase of development 
through the $533 million development carry which we have in place from 
when BP farmed into the field.
 
The chart on the bottom right shows this is one of the lowest cost LNG 
projects in the world. The quality o
f the reservoir means high flow rate wells 
around 200 million standard cubic feet per day resulting in a low well count. 
This in combination with the high density of the resource which reduces the 
subsea footprint leads to an efficient development.
 
Slide 1
4 shows the near
-
shore solution, the initial phase of development 
with a floating LNG vessel moored alongside a jetty protected by concrete 
breakwater in approximately 30 meters of water 10 kilometers offshore.
 
Gas will come from the field through our subs
ea pipeline onto a FPSO in 
approximately 100 to 200 meters of water. The FPSO will clean the gaps, 
strip any liquids before a second pipeline to the FLNG vessel.
 
With the ICA approved, the next steps towards FID include the front
-
end 
engineering which is u
nderway and where a number of key subcontracts are 
expected to be awarded in the coming weeks. The LNG marketing is also 
underway with gas sales agreements expected to be completed ahead of 
FID.
 

review our growth 
prospects from our exploration portfolio. Brian?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Andy. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Let me first 
turn to Slide 16. Exploration starts with strategy and driven by discipline and 
execution delivers results
. Our strategy is enabled by a focus on south 
Atlantic margin geography, deepwater petroleum systems and Cretaceous 
plays resulting in a concentrated portfolio with rifle shot drilling and a 
process maintained by organizational continuity.
 
This focus ensur
es we can leverage our people and their deep knowledge to 
create first mover advantage. Most importantly, this includes developing 
contrarian and technical ideas and pursuing countercyclical business 
initiatives to establish ahead of the industry wherever 
possible large acreage 
positions in selected places of choice.
 
In this regard and with the flexibility provided by our strong balance sheet, 
we have continued to consistently invest through the low commodity price 
cycle of recent years in contrast to indus
try at large as shown on the upper 
right image of Slide 16 and have developed a world
-
class portfolio of high
-
quality exploration opportunities.
 
Today, this comprises a balanced mix of proven, emerging and frontier base 
and assets including a key presence 
in each of the two recently opened giant 
scale, Cretaceous oil and gas petroleum systems offshore Mauritania and 
Senegal, Guinea and Suriname.
 
In drawing out this portfolio, we have firstly delivered a top quartile industry 
exploration success rate with an
 
overall commercial discovery record of 1 in 
5 in opening frontier basins as shown on the lower right image of Slide 16.
 

the success we have delivered from it today, we have clear lin
e of sight to a 
sustainable, high quality two to three exploration wells per year program.
 
I would now like to review each of the assets in the exploration portfolio 
starting on Slide 17 with our position in the proven inboard Rio Muni basin 
offshore Equat
orial Guinea. As you know, we secured a 6,000 square 
kilometer position consistent of block EG
-
21, S and W alongside our recent 
acquisition of the Ceiba/Okume field complex.
 
As Andy referenced earlier, our exploration team made these basin and 
discoveries 
15 to 20 years ago. With only limited exploration of the 
petroleum system undertaken since, we have the opportunity to leverage 
our subsequent learning and deliver further success from this underexplored 
basin in two ways.
 
Firstly to the East, the blocks i
nclude a near field exploitation opportunity 
comprising late Cretaceous upper slope and channel prospects as well as 
step
-
out exploration plays down sloped along trend. Together these provide 
short cycle time tie
-
back options to grow production of high
-
val
ue barrels 
you saw in the Ceiba/Okume production facilities.
 
And secondly in the West, there is scope for standalone exploration of lower 

exploring offshore at Santonian. To progr
ess these opportunities, a new 3D 
seismic survey was acquired this year ahead of drilling in 2019.
 

Senegal and Guyana, Suriname. As shown on Slide 18, our exploration 
program today offsh
ore Mauritania and Senegal is comprised of two phases. 
So far we believe we have discovered 40 Tcf of gas and delineated a further 
40 Tcf of gas.
 
Four discoveries have been made with an exploration success rate of 60% 
which including the big carry is equiv
alent to a finding cost of $0.20 per 
barrel of oil equivalent. This includes 100% success rate in the first phase 
which tested the inboard central anticline trend and involved three 
discoveries; Tortue, BirAllah and Teranga.
 
The recently completed second p
hase tested four prospects with one gas 
discovery Yaakar, the largest hydrocarbon find in the world last year and two 
unsuccessful wells Hippocampe
-
1 and Requin Tigre
-
1 providing a 1 and 3 
success rate on the southern Mauritania/northern Senegal gas trend.
 
For 
Lamantin
-
1 dry hole, we had no success with initial drilling on the northern 
Mauritania oil play fairway.
 
Despite the overall success rate in opening this basin, we were somewhat 
surprised that the recent drilling did not fully meet our hopes and 
expe
ctations and delivered even more finds, including for oil. This was 
particularly the case given the positive start to the outboard basin floor fan 
campaign with the Yaakar discovery and each of the subsequent prospects 
which failed to find hydrocarbons had
 
similar strong geophysical attribute 
support, including AVO.
 
Having matured the prospects during our extended exploration pause last 
year, there were all geologically valid and independent and moreover when 
drilled proved to be geophysically supporting ou
r decision to drill the wells 
sequentially.
 
Notwithstanding the results, this exploration step
-
up campaign to test the 
outboard has provided us with substantial new subsurface data. These data 
give us competitor advantage which we can leverage on our own a
creage as 
well as other blocks offshore Mauritania and indeed in other petroleum 
systems along the south Atlantic margin. Hence, our decision to limit the 
amount of information shed publicly.
 
Importantly working with BP, the interpretation and integration 
of these data 
will enable us to refine our understanding of how the petroleum systems 
work as well as providing calibration of our 3D seismic and its derivative 
products. This will allow us to explain the exploration outcomes and 
observations to
-
date and s
hould enhance our predictive exploration 
capability going forward.
 
Furthermore, these studies are enabling us to redefine the plays and rebuild 
our lead prospects inventory. We will take a second exploration drilling 
timeout through the rest of this year t
o complete this work as well as plan a 
third follow
-
on exploration campaign which we expect to start in 2019.
 
We anticipate this will focus on exploration appraisal in support of potential 
further gas ups in southern Mauritania and northern Senegal as well
 
as 
continue to search for oil in northern Mauritania.
 
Moving on, our 2018 exploration drilling program is set to restart next 
quarter the testing of our other emerging basin exploration project in the 
current portfolio, the Guyana
-
Suriname 
petroleum system as shown on Slide 
19.
 
As you know, this is the second of the two major Cretaceous basins that 
opened along the south Atlantic margin in the last three years or so. Here 
our 11,000 square kilometer acreage position in Suriname which is show
n on 
the lower left image of the slide comprises two blocks which offer up to five 
3D seismic defined independent play tests.
 
In aggregate, these are for a potential multibillion barrel potential. Two of 
the five play fairways will be tested in 2018. The f
irst well will test the 700 
million plus Anapai prospect in Block 45 as shown on the lower right 
schematic. This involves Albian reservoirs charged from similar source rocks 
and trapped in an early Cretaceous combination structural
-
stratigraphic 
feature, t
he key risks that trap and charge migration. We plan to spud that 
well in early 

 
second quarter 2018.
 
This will be followed by a well in Block 42 in the third quarter either on the 
late Cretaceous Aurora or Apetina trend. Both of these offer potential 
ext
ension as Liza
-
type stratigraphic play as depicted on the upper right 
schematic. Drilling is then expected to recommence in 2019 and beyond with 
follow
-
on exploration to test the other play fairways as well as in the event 
of success, early appraisal and d
elineation drilling of any discovery we might 
make this year.
 
Lastly, on Slide 20, we have two frontier basin exploration opportunities in 

Equatorial Guinea, they are based on our busines
s theme of second cycle 
exploration and a reentry into the Gulf of Guinea in the Transform Margin of 
West Africa.
 
In Sao Tome where we are pursuing Cretaceous based on floor fan plays in 
the outboard Rio Muni basin, we had initially secured a large entry p
osition 
of approximately 26,000 square kilometers in four blocks, including 5, 6, 11 
and 12.
 
On the acquisition, processing and early interpretation of the large 3D 
seismic survey as well as an updated petroleum system analysis, we 
currently are in the pro
cess of expanding this footprint with BP, as the 
successful drill bit [indiscernible] for blocks 10 and 13. Initial exploration 
drilling in Sao Tome is scheduled for 2019.
 

successfully acce
ssed five blocks at the end of last year including CI
-
526, 
602, 603, 707, 708. These cover approximately 16,000 square kilometers as 
an aggregate. A 3D seismic survey is being planned for later this year. 

2020.
 
In the meantime, our new venture initiatives continue as we seek to take 
advantage of the current industry environment, leverage our technical 
leadership and strategic alliance with BP to preemptively secure large 
acreage positions and strategic petr
oleum systems and therefore enabling us 
to build in high grade our current portfolio, ensuring quality through choice 
and delivery of success.
 
So in summary, the disciplined execution of our strategy continues to deliver 
a balanced pipeline of high
-
quality
 
exploration opportunities across proven, 
emerging and frontier basins enabling us to maintain a series of drilling 
catalysts continuing next quarter in Suriname and deliver exploration 
success.
 

 
Tom Chambers
 
Th
anks, Brian, and good morning and afternoon, everyone. As Andy began 
by saying and as our fourth quarter results demonstrate, 2017 was a strong 
year for Kosmos. In fact, it was one of our strongest driven by a full year 
production contribution from TEN whi
ch increased overall sales volumes to 
their highest level in our history.
 
This production level helped generate approximately 320 million of free cash 
flow exceeding our initial 250 million of guidance for 2017 prior to the Hess 
acquisition. A disciplined 
execution of the business plan kept costs and 
fourth quarter results broadly in line with guidance.
 
While commodity prices have recently improved, our commitment to full 
cycle returns, financial strength and robust liquidity remains steadfast as 
indicated 
on Slide 22. We plan to continue living within our means using our 
strong free cash flow to execute our growth plan and combined with our 
rigorous capital allocation process this will continue to set Kosmos apart 
from other independent E&P operators.
 
Our f
inancial strength is both the result of our successful strategy execution 
and an enabler of it. Through continuous and prudent balance sheet 

highest and lows of commodity price cycle.
 
Ou
r balance sheet strength is a true asset of Kosmos. We exited 2017 with 
low leverage and significant headroom on our debt covenants. We expect 
this to remain the case as we execute our growth strategy going forward.
 
We actively manage our debt maturities a
nd have no debt coming due until 
2021 when our high yield notes mature. Recently, we refinanced our reserve 
base lending facility or RBL which resulted in the borrowing base increasing 
to 1.5 billion, up from approximately 1.3 billion as a result of incorp
orating 
our EG assets into the base.
 
At the same time, we included an accordion feature which allows the 
borrowing base to expand by up to $500 million at our choosing once the 
Tortue project has taken FID. In addition, the RBL maturity is extended to 
Marc
h 2025 and the amortization does not begin until March of 2022.
 
The new agreement requires only an annual borrowing base 
redetermination. Our $400 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn 
and we expect to refinance it later this year before it mat
ures in November.
 
Our strategy is based upon a self
-
funded business model and the ability to 
self
-

testament to our disciplined capital allocation process and the ability to 
leverag
e partner funding.
 

high
-
margin producing assets is in large part the result of an active 
consistent hedging program which underpins the cash flow from our key 
assets allowing us
 
to fund our capital program and also generates significant 
value for the company since the oil price downturn.
 
At year
-
end plus recently executed hedges, we have had a total of 10.9 
million barrels hedged at an average floor of $54.67 per barrel for 2018 
and 
9.5 million barrels hedged at an average floor of $52.63 in 2019. We expect 
that hedging will remain a key tool we use in our prudent balance sheet 
management.
 
Consequently, our free cash flow generation, robust liquidity has allowed us 
to leverage the
 
low price environment to our advantage, enhancing our 
exploration portfolio with new opportunities and bolstering our production 
base through a significant acquisition of high
-
value producing assets at an 
attractive price. This provides us with a balanced
 
portfolio with growth from 
production, development and exploration assets.
 
As oil prices improve, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation 
and free cash flow generation. Despite increased CapEx in 2018, the result 
of increased activity with g
rowing operating cash flow and hedges in place, 
we still expect to be net cash flow positive in a $50 oil price environment.
 
Going forward, we now have a more balanced portfolio of production 
development and exploration opportunities and will continue our 
focus on 
the projects which generate the best return for our shareholders.
 
So in summary, with growing high margin production, free cash flow and a 
strong portfolio, Kosmos is poised to deliver continued growth and value for 
our shareholders.
 
Now before I 

address our 2018 guidance which was included in our press release and in 

full year numbers, so please follow up with our I
R staff if you have any 
questions.
 
In Ghana, we expect the total of 11 liftings including four from TEN and 
seven from Jubilee. This forecast contemplates a four
-
week oil production 
shutdown in the first quarter which commenced in early February.
 
Ghana OpEx is expected to average between $14 and $17 per barrel in 2018 
with quarterly fluctuations expected depending on the ratio of Jubilee to TEN 
liftings during the quarter, given the higher OpEx per unit at TEN which 
includes FPSO lease expense. Hig
her OpEx in 2018 is the result of not having 
any LOPI insurance proceeds to cover the additional operating procedures 
currently in place.
 
DD&A is expected to average between $24 and $26 per barrel and will also 
fluctuate quarterly depending on the number o
f liftings from each field. We 
expect to incur approximately $100 million of G&A expense with 65% cash 
and 35% non
-
cash in 2018.
 
The increase compared to 2017 reflects the significant credits received from 
the Jubilee operator during 2017 which reduced our
 
G&A as well as the fact 
that we have turned over operatorship to BP in Mauritania and Senegal.
 
Bearing in mind the difficulties of providing guidance on taxes, at $60 per 
barrel Brent and excluding the impact of unrealized mark
-
to
-
mark hedging 
gains and l
osses, taxes are expected to average $3 to $4 per barrel with 
100% being current. Non
-
dry hole exploration expense related to seismic 
acquisition and G&G costs is expected to average around $30 million per 
quarter.
 
In terms of 2018 CapEx, we anticipate spe
nding approximately 300 million 
consisting of approximately 110 million in Ghana which includes a provision 
for a second rig later this year, 180 million of exploration spending including 
$50 million for exploration drilling in Suriname, $80 million for se
ismic and 
processing across our portfolio to mature drilling opportunities for 2019 and 
beyond and $50 million for new venture activity. And finally, we have

of the ownership structure are being accounted for using the equity method 
of accounting. From a practical standpoint, this means that the net income 
from these assets appears in the equity method investment line of our

We hold our share of Ceiba/Okume via our 50% interest in Kosmos Trident

production guidance of 43,000 barrels of oil per day for 2018, all guidance 
given in the table represents 100% of the share held 50

50 by Kosmos and 
Trident.
 
The 10 cargo guidance, 5 net to 
Kosmos is based on net entitlement 
volumes from cost oil and profit oil under the terms of the production 
sharing contract, assuming a Brent oil price of $60 per barrel. OpEx per 
barrel is expected to range between $13 and $15 per barrel, DD&A at $24 to 
$2
6 per barrel including bases amortization. And taxes are expected to 
range between $11 and $13 per barrel or 60% cash.
 

Andy for his closing remarks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Tom. So to s
ummarize. Kosmos has a balanced portfolio of 
production, development and exploration with multiple sources of growth in 
all three of these areas. Our high
-
margin production assets in Ghana and EG 
continue to deliver growth. Our 2P reserves from Jubilee, TE
N and EG 
underpin our current share price. Our big fields continue to get bigger, so 
our 3P resource offers significant additional upside.
 
The Tortue gas project provides the next phase of growth for Kosmos. 
Following the recent ICA approval announcement a
nd guidance by BP, we 
expect the project to take FID with initial phase around the end of 2018 with 
full field development providing further upside.
 

in attractive geographies, Kosmos 
has a sustainable exploration program 
with the balance of proven, emerging and frontier opportunity which offer 
multiple catalysts in 2018, 2019 and beyond.
 
And finally, we can execute this activity set cash flow positive at $50 per 
barrel Brent in 2018 an
d we have the balance sheet strength and liquidity 
going forward.

[Operator Instructio

Bank. Please proceed.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Thanks. I appreciate all of the incremental detail on the presentation. Maybe 
first up one on Tortue. What do you need to see, what does the timeline look 
like over the
 
course of 2018? What are the steps that you need to achieve to 
reach FID later this year?
 
Andy Inglis
 

position to move forward with FID. That obviously involves letting the key 
subcont
racts for the phases of the project which involves the subsea, the 
FPSO knocking out the liquids, the breakwater near shore and then the gas 
processing solution for the LNG. And as I said in my remarks, you can 
anticipate seeing those contracts being let o
ver the coming weeks. From an 
engineering perspective, that gets us to FID around the end of the year. And 

putting out a request for proposals for the gas sales and anticipate again 


Kosmos, national oil companies. And therefore what typically is a problem 
for getting a LNG project th
rough to FID is the complexity of the project, the 
complexity of the partnership and the competing interest. We have none of 


st the lowest cost gas 
today from North America and a world
-
class operator in BP that has the 
wherewithal now to complete that FID work in a timely fashion.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Thanks. On the gas sales, the market seems to be improving in terms of 
finding buyers for
 
gas sales across the global LNG market, particularly if you 
look into the early time period there. Any thoughts on how you would 
characterize the market? I know BP can take volumes as part of the 
portfolio. To FID the project, how much 

 
is there a thresh
old that you would 
look at in terms of gas sold under contract or would you be willing to FID the

-


ve always held the view that the market was going to open 
up in the earlier part of the next decade rather than the middle and I think 

initial phase is 2.5 million tons per annum. It


an important factor. And I think the third point is just to remind you that 

, we are 
going out to compete for proposals from other trading houses, actually other 
IOCs, so it will be a very competitive process. But I think your overall tone is 
correct. I think I felt the gas market is going to be undersupplied in the early 
part of 
the next decade. That is the case I believe today and therefore the 
ability to move forward with the project that people have confidence in now 
because of the simplicity of the partnership, a quality operator that can 
execute and a low cost of gas will ena
ble this to move forward.

Great. Thanks.

between the two assets this year. Can you talk about maybe 
the trajectory 
of the production of both those fields not just over the course of 2018 but I 
guess maybe as we look into 2019 as well? What does the timeline look like 
on a production ramp and as you look at full field development across both 
of those, I g
uess how should we expect that to proceed over the next couple 

 
Andy Inglis
 

This is great news. The objective in Jubilee is actually to fill the fac
ility. And 

barrels of oil per day. And with the drilling resuming full field, that would be 
the objective. And that ramp up is going to occur through '18 into '19. Same 
story really on T
EN. We were clearly 

 

because [indiscernible] back to drilling, ramp up through '18 into '19. The 

the production level beyond the facili
ty limit which is 80,000 barrels a day. 



into '19.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Thank you.

All right, thanks, Ryan.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Please proceed.
 
Charles Meade
 
Good morning Andy to you and the team there or maybe good afternoon as 
appropriate. I want
ed to ask first a question about the EG assets. I think you 
touched on this just briefly in your prepared remarks, but can you talk a 
little more about what the source or what the drivers of that uplift between 

at now, I think there was 
37,000 to 43,000 barrels a day. Does that reflect just the performance of 
the assets and the facilities before you got your hands on them, or perhaps 
does that instead reflect the ESP plans that you spoke about?
 
Andy Inglis
 
No, Ch

actually. I think that one of the things we believe in strongly at Kosmos is 
sort of creating the right partnerships and we were clear with these assets 
that we needed to partner with some
one who had that detailed attention in 
terms of running the assets on a day
-
to
-
day basis. Trident or the ex
-
Perenco 

phase was really going into every single well looking at the dis
tribution of 
gas lifts and actually optimizing it. And I think it was just a new set of eyes 
coming to the field with probably a slightly different mindset that created 

started 
that yet. Would anticipate a program of about six ESPs in the first 
phase, around three this year in 2018 and three in 2019 and that will sort of 
sustain and offer the potential to continue to grow the production level into 

e seismic over the hole of the Ceiba/Okume 
field which is sort of Block G plus the peripheral blocks W, S and 21 in '18, 
processing it back half of '18, beginning of '19 and that will allow us to start 

he short cycle 

separate prospects that can be tied back in a short period of time. So as I 


y had the opportunity to drive production up higher than we 



opportunity to add value from the 
infill and the tie
-
back opportunity. Literally there was sort of no real 
exploration done for around 15 years. So Brian and the team are anxious to 
get their arms around it.
 
Charles Meade
 

hat detail. And then the second question, I 
think this is for Brian. Brian, I recognize that the need to be circumspect 
when you consider the composition offshore, Mauritania and Senegal and 

 

anything you would care to add about how your last three wells maybe have 
cast your earlier discoveries in a different light? And if this has changed your 


e done to
-
date?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Charles. Listen, I think you have to stand back a moment and just 


p
hases, one which was completely successful and one which was less so. But 
those are just two fairways with the key prospects on those two fairways 

in front of us now in terms of
 
unlocking this basin which still remains very 

as often happen in these cases, as you learn and understand matters below 

ork, that opens up 

 
the reasons for those not working opens up the case for why other things 
that you may previously have not prioritized actually will work. And so as 


ng the lead prospect inventory as I mentioned in the script and 
are looking to essentially enter a third exploration appraisal phase next year. 

success rate last year which is in of i
tself of course in these kind of basins is 
still pretty good and top quartile, but we set ourselves extremely high 


s basin is 
anywhere written off. There is still a significant amount to play for both in 
the gas fairways to the south in southern Mauritania and indeed in what we 
believe is a working oil petroleum system to the north in northern 

t we will now focus on.
 
Charles Meade
 
Thank you, Brian, for those comments.
 
Andy Inglis
 
All right. Thanks, Charles.

Our next question is from Rafal Gutaj with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Please proceed.
 
Rafal Gutaj
 
Good morning. Thank you. So on Slide 22 where you outline your leverage 

Could you give us a sense of how likely you are to use that to grow 
inorganically and would you be expanding on yo
ur core asset position if you 
were to use it, or whether a new country entry possibly be on the cards? 

set yourself kind of a soft cap on exploration of two to three wells per yea
r. 
What kind of shape would your balance sheet need to be before you consider 
shareholder returns be it kind of regular or one
-
off, and is that something 
that would require to be online first? Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Hi. Thanks, Rafal. A lot of questions wi
thin questions there. Look, if I just 
sort of stand back, what I would say first and foremost I think is I hope 


est 
at very high margin barrels, in a development project in Tortue which is 
world class and can be super scale at 10 million tons per annum and then 
finally the exploration programs. So we have a very strong set of assets 
today in which to invest. We have
 
demonstrated our ability to do good 

look at those opportunities. They have to be ones where we can truly add 
value through the right partnerships and our core expertise. We will c
ontinue 



something which is of a s
imilar quality that is accretive and actually has the 
growth prospects that EG has. So I think my first point is really around the 
strength of the portfolio and our ability to invest. And I think as you start 
then to look at distributions going forward, wh
at I would say is that 
ultimately today we see the ability to invest at a high quality in Kosmos and 
those plans are clear and I think the strategy is being well laid out for you 
today and that will be our first call on capital. Going forward, if you have 

delivered the success we anticipate from exploration then potentially, but I 

strategy of growth that w


and the ability for it to create opportunity for us when some of our 
competitors are focused entirely on repairing their balance she


that will support the growth of the company for the long term.

Our next qu
estion is from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Please 
proceed.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Andy, nice summary in the earlier 
remarks highlighting the attractive deepwater cost structure. What 
conditions and/or commodity price
 
do you think begins to possibly drive 
drilling and development costs higher in the deepwater regime?
 
Andy Inglis
 


 
the activity set. 


drilling, whether it be construction. And I think it will take a while to work 
th
rough. So we see sort of modest inflation going forward rather than a kick 


things to invest in. And I t



through the downturn and are continuing to do that and continue to
 
have 

work in a $50 to $60 world and be very efficient in that world and I think the 
prospects as it were going forward in that environment are good. So the 
thing that I would actual
ly look at is rather than the inflationary pressures, 

able to deliver. And I think in a sense, the mid cap stepping back from the 
deepwater is a blessing for us because we have the
 
ability now I think to be 

majors today and ensuring that our portfolio is strong for the long term.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thank you, Andy. And just one more. In EG, only spending minimal C
apEx 
this year, less than 10 million. What level of yearly spending could you 


sort of spending leve
l could get you to that level?
 
Andy Inglis
 

step up in capital to sort of get to that level really through the ESP program 
I spoke about for the six ESP conversions is relatively mo
dest. I think the 

2020 when we start the infill program, drilling program. So I think you can 
sort of 

 
I would say we can reach that sort of 50,000 barrel a day level with 
a r
elatively modest level of capital, sort of well
-
worked capital. I think in a 
very small font on that graph, we talk about the rates of return from that 

a small rise but relatively 
modest. And then in 2019 you would see 

 
back

Our next question is from Alwyn Thomas with Exane BNP Parib
as. Please 
proceed.
 
Alwyn Thomas
 
Good morning, guys. My first question just to clarify on the free cash flow, 
Tom, if you could just help us out here. I think based on the 2018 guidance 

t 350 

if there are any other moving parts in that that I might be missing. And my 
second question is really around Suriname. Perhaps based a little bit on sort 
of rebasing expect
ations after the Mauritania/Senegal campaign. Looking 
into Suriname, Brian, could you possibly just re
-
clarify what you see as the 
key risks are and perhaps what chance of success you think we should apply 
to these at this stage, that would be very helpful
? Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 

pick up Suriname.
 
Tom Chambers
 
So I think at $60 free cash flow, the biggest things that you want to just pay 
attention to are the hedges because they impact the $60 case. But that 

say that we are free cash flow
ing at $50, $55 and $60, so you can kind of 

perspective.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Okay. Brian, on Suriname.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes. Thanks, Alwyn. The way you think about our position is Suriname is as 
we 
kind of outlined in the script really is two separate bocks, two separate 

Cretaceous play. So this is essentially a non
-
proven play in what we believe 
is a proven or what we know is a p

reservoirs charged from either the proven source rocks further north and 
beyond or from deeper source rocks. So charged to some extent is a risk 
particularly around migration. It sits on the banks of the basin. And I would
 
say that is the key risk trap 

 
trap is always a risk but the key play risk will 

and proven plays in Guyana as the image on the slide tries to portray. And 
so the life of the Ape
tina trend, the Aurora trend are a long trend in adjacent 
channels to Payara and Liza and Turbot, et cetera. And so we are pursuing 
very similar type of dominantly stratigraphic features which are 
geophysically supported. And of course you may recall a cou
ple of years ago, 
Hess joined us in Block 42 and they are bringing all of their knowledge and 
calibration from the Guyana area and bringing that learning to bear on our 
analysis of Block 42 where we have multiple prospects and the reason we 

pecific one identified thus far is that we are blessed with a 

the right exploration strategy is and what the right well to drill first is. But 
there again trap is almost certainly go
ing to be the key. Trap and migration 
is going to be the key risk on any one of those prospects that is drilled.
 
Alwyn Thomas
 

chance of success is appropriate?
 
Brian Maxted
 
No, we 

 
Alwyn Thomas
 
Okay.
 
Andy Inglis
 


out 1 in 4, 1 in 5 and over a course of yea


Suriname the program will test four or five independent prospects over 

dri

sure that we mature the prospects to the quality that delivers that outcome.
 
Alwyn Thomas
 
Okay. Thank you, guys. I just have one very quick follow up. At Equatorial 
Guinea, since y
ou took over, have you upgraded the reserves at all from 


 
Andy Inglis
 

literally 

 
I 


-
end reserve process but it 

the last two 
months. So the answer is sort of early days on that.
 
Alwyn Thomas
 
Okay, no problem. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please 
proceed.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for taking the question,
 
guys. You provided some interesting 



 
and obviously Liza and the other 
discoveries in Guyana, to what extent should we look at those past 
disco
veries as really templates for what you guys will be doing later this 
year?
 
Andy Inglis
 

the last question about the nature of the tests in Suriname, but we can give 
a little 
bit more color.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes. Pavel, the great thing about the two blocks is that as you know in all of 
our projects we look for play diversity. And we mentioned in the script that 
we got four or five play fairways in this block that we want to explore
 
before 
we can say that we fully tested it. And in that regard and probably Anapai 
given its position and given its geological objective is the most distant from 
what has been found to
-

nature of the pl
ay and the support in the prospect for potential 
hydrocarbons. The Block 42 is in the same upper Cretaceous basin as the 
existing discoveries in Guyana which are in 

 
all of which expect Turbot 
really are in one main channel system. And so we are exploring
 
adjacent 
channel systems depending on the same play types, the same play elements 
of trap, reservoir and charge just in a separate fairway. And so obviously the 
dependency between those prospects and the Liza
-
type features is great 
when it is in Anapai. A
nd so in some respects I think some of our partners 
view those prospects as lower risk than for example the big prospect in 

oil basin and so we got multiple shots on goal to open 
up our part of this 

we have 50% with Chevron in the Anapai prospect, so high
-
worth equity and 

materia
l to Kosmos.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
And one more following up on kind of the comparison between the two 
countries. Earlier this year we saw the fiscal terms on Liza contract coming 

terms in Suriname. But if you can give any compare and contrast to what 
you saw from the Liza contract to give a sense of what Suriname might look 
like?
 
Andy Inglis
 


y competitive in our portfolio when compared to Mauritania or 

that it has to work in a breakeven price of 30 to 50 and therefore be 


absolutely in that place and not quite as good as Liza but very competitive.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, helpful. Appreciate it.
 
Andy Inglis
 
All right. Thanks, Pavel. Operator, any more questions?
 
Operator
 
Yes. We have one last questio
n from Niki Kouzmanov with Jefferies. Please 
proceed.
 
Niki Kouzmanov
 
Hi. Good morning and good afternoon, gentlemen. Just very quickly on 
Tortue, I was just wondering the 2.5 million tons per annum, does that 
include any domestic sales [indiscernible] inte
rnational energy sales? And 



plans to 
fund the increment project financing or own balance sheet full year 
refinancing? Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
You broke up slightly on the first question, Niki, but I think it was basically 
saying is it fundamentally about LNG sales? And the answer is yes, 2.5 
m
illion at LNG sales. I think ultimately there will be some domestic gas, but 

-
generating capacity into power in both 
countries is just a relatively small number of the overall throughput of the 
scheme. Important for the
 
country but not actually impactful to the 




predict exactly where the number is going to come out. But I think the 533 


financing
 
which is a critical part of the project in a sense BP can pay their 
way, we can pay our way. Clearly we have to work with the NOCs to get 
them on board, but fundamentally you have the financial capacity within the 
partnership to move this forward which is
 
one of the distinctive attributes of 
this project.
 
Niki Kouzmanov
 
Thank you.

Greetings, and welcome to the Kosmos Energy First Quarter 2019 Earnings 
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. A 
brief question
-
and
-
answer session will follow the formal presentation. 
[Operator 
Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
 
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jamie Buckland, Vice 
President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
 
Jamie Buckland
 
Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us
 
today. This morning, 
we issued our first quarter earnings release and the slide presentation to 
accompany today's call. Both materials are available on the Investors page 
of the kosmosenergy.com website. Our 10
-
Q will be filed with the SEC 
today. The slid
e presentation reviews the progress we have made against 
the strategy we set out at our Capital Markets Day in February with a 
particular focus on the Gulf of Mexico, the latest addition to the Kosmos 
portfolio. Joining me on the call today and to go throu
gh that material are 
Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Chambers, 
Chief Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expecta
tions. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP measures in our discussion. Management believes such measures are 
important in looking at t
he Company's historical and future performance, 
and these are commonly referred to industry metrics. These measures are 
provided in addition to and should be read in conjunction with the 
information contained in our financial statements prepared in accorda
nce 
with GAAP and included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Slide 2. Before I 
talk about the highlights for the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to
 
remind 
you of the key messages we delivered at our Capital Markets Day in 
February.
 
First, our business model generates significant cash. With strong margins 
across our portfolio and a disciplined capital program, we expect to generate 
approximately $1 bi
llion of free cash flow over the next three years at $60 
per barrel Brent. This excludes any proceeds from our planned sell down in 
Mauritania and Senegal, which will provide significant upside. Over the same 
period, we expect to grow production at a CAGR 
of 8% to 10%. Second, we 
have a deep inventory of infrastructure
-
led exploration or ILX opportunities 
that we expect to drive near
-
term growth. Our 2019 four
-
well ILX program 
in the Gulf of Mexico has begun, and later this year we expect to drill our 
first
 
ILX prospects in Equatorial Guinea.
 
Third, we have a world
-
scale gas resource in Mauritania and Senegal with 50 
to 100 Tcf gross of gas in place in the basin. Our basin open discovery at 
Tortue reached final investment decision in December, which created 
a value 
inflection point. At the Capital Markets Day, we announced our intention to 
sell down our interest in the basin from around 30% to 10%, and we've 
been very pleased with the level of industry interest. Fourth, creating 
asymmetric value through basin
 
opening exploration remains at the heart of 
our business model. We have a deep diverse portfolio of opportunities, which 
will continue to mature high grade and test. In 2019, we're drilling one
-
well 
Orca and expect to drill two basin opening tests per yea
r from 2020 
onwards.
 
Overall, our 2019 exploration program includes six wells targeting net 
prospective resources of approximately 500 million barrels oil equivalent, an 
amount roughly equal to our year
-
end 2018
-
2P reserves. And finally, our 
approach to pr
udent balance sheet management has not changed. Our 
balance sheet strength gives us the financial flexibility to properly manage 
the business to create shareholder value and to invest in high return 
projects irrespective of short and medium
-
term commodity 
price cycles.
 
Turning to Slide 3. I'll now provide an update on the progress we've made 
against that agenda. In the first quarter, we delivered around 59,500 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day of production which is above the midpoints of 
58,000 to 60,000 g
uidance we gave in February, and we remain on
-
track to 
achieve our guidance for the full year, which Tom will talk about later in the 
presentation. In Ghana, Jubilee is currently producing around 100,000 
barrels of oil per day. The gas reliability issues I
 
mentioned at our Capital 
Markets Day have been addressed by the operator with a reliability of the 
system enhanced with the spare high
-
pressure compressor now available.
 
However, oil production rates remain constrained by gas handling. We 
continue to pres
ent opportunities to the operator to increase the gas 
handling capacity and we are hopeful that we'll implement these 
enhancements, thereby enabling Jubilee oil throughput to reach the 
nameplate FPSO capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. At TEN, 
prod
uction increased when the EN
-
10 well was brought online and the field 
is currently producing around 70,000 barrels of oil per day. We expect to 
reach the facility capacity of 80,000 barrels of oil per day when a further 
producer is brought on
-
stream around
 
the middle of the year.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico, the routine dry dock work on the Helix Producer was 
successfully completed on
-
time, increasing production from the GOM once 
the vessel was bought back online. Production levels were further increased 
when the
 
Tornado
-
3 well was brought online adding around 9,000 barrels of 
oil equivalent per day gross. In Equatorial Guinea, our ASP program is on
-
track adding around 2,500 barrels of oil per day gross to offset decline. We 
expect to complete two more ASP convers
ions around the middle of the 
year.
 
Shifting to cash generation; we remain on
-
track to deliver significant amount 
of free cash flow in 2019. At $60 per barrel Brent, we expect to generate 
approximately $200 million of free cash flow before dividends, incre
asing to 
around $350 million at $70 per barrel Brent. First quarter CapEx was $110 
million, and we remain on
-
track to spend within our full year 2019 CapEx 
guidance range of $425 million to $475 million. At current prices, the year
-
end forecast net leverag
e will be around 1.4 times, within our target range 
without any contribution from the Mauritania
-
Senegal sell down. Our strong 
free cash flow generation supports shareholder returns, and in the first 
quarter the Company paid it's first quarterly dividend o
f approximately 
$0.045 which equates to $0.18 per share for the full year.
 
Turning to Slide 4; staying on highlights for the quarter, we recently started 
our infrastructure
-
led exploration program with Gladden Deep. The well was 
spud [ph] in March targetin
g a deeper horizon below the existing Gladden 
discovery with the well results expected later this month. Gladden Deep is 
the first of four wells in the Gulf of Mexico this year which together target 
around 100 million barrels net to Kosmos. In late March, 
we participate in 
Lease Sale 252 where the apparent high bidder on 9 of the 10 blocks upon 
which we bid, more on that later.
 
In Equatorial Guinea, we're continuing to mature our G
-
13 prospect 
targeting 25 million to 200 million barrels oil equivalent poten
tial. We've 
secured a rig option for drilling and expect to spud the well late in the third 
quarter. In Mauritania and Senegal, momentum continues from the FID of 
Tortue in December. Tortue Phase 1 is on
-
track, all contracts are now 
awarded, construction w
ork has commenced on the FPSO and Keppel has 
received final approval from Golar to commence construction of the Gimi 
FLNG vessel. Furthermore, BP recently awarded the pre
-
FEED work on 
Tortue Phases II and III to KBR, demonstrating progress in those 
subsequ
ent phases which should reach FID next year.
 
Regarding our previously announced plans to sell down our interest in 
Mauritania and Senegal to around 10% from our current 30%, we received 
considerable industry interest from around 15 large highly credible 
co
mpanies; so you see the significant strategic value in gas assets and the 
size and quality of the resource. The process has been formally launched, 
the data rooms open, and we would expect formal bids by the end of the 
summer.
 
Basin
-
Opening Exploration rem
ains central to our strategy at Kosmos. We 
plan to drill the Orca well offshore Mauritania in 3Q, which if successful 
would prove up another 10 million ton per annum LNG hub in Southern 
Mauritania. During the quarter, we entered Congo Brazzaville signing a
 
PSC 
on the Marine XXI block, and we deepened our position in Equatorial Guinea 
by acquiring the remainder Ophir's interest in the EG
-
24 block.
 
Lastly, as I've said before, our approach to manage the balance sheet has 
not changed in the first quarter, we p
ushed our debt maturities and 
increased our borrowing costs 
--
 
and decreased our borrowing costs by 
refinancing the notes that were due in 2021 with a new lower coupon notes 
due 2026.
 
Moving on to Slide 5; the Gulf of Mexico is the most recent addition to 
the 
Kosmos portfolio. So I'd like to provide some more color on that business 
unit, where there has been significant amount of activity so far in 2019. We 
entered the basin in September, and our expectations at the time of the 
transaction have been exceede
d. The Gulf of Mexico is one of the world's 
most prolific oil and gas basins; and despite it's maturity, new technology 
and new ideas continue to yield new discoveries and more resource under 
development. There is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in the b
asin and the 
high density of underutilized infrastructure makes GOMs economics 
attractive. This is the right basin to broaden Kosmos's deepwater portfolio, 
and now is the right time; the competitive landscape has never been better 
and service costs are att
ractive. With few companies focused on the basin 
and fewer possessing the capabilities to explore that, Kosmos is well 
positioned to become a leading independent in the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Turning to Slide 6; I'd like to focus on the recent Gulf of Mexico leas
e sale. 
The semi
-
annual lease sales are a low
-
cost option to organically generate 
prospects which will keep our exploration inventory full of opportunities for 
many years to come. Kosmos was an active participant in the last lease sale 
in March 2019 captur
ing a significant amount of resource at low cost. In 
Lease Sale 252, we were the parent high bidder on 9 of the 10 blocks we bid 
on, securing multiple prospects that support five potential new hubs. 
Combined, these prospects held an estimated 420 million b
arrels of oil 
equivalent gross or 290 million barrels of oil equivalent net of unrisked 
resource.
 
The chart on the bottom of the slide shows the significant increase in bidding 
activity since we acquired DGE, providing the team with the commitment 
and fund
ing to bid on attractive pipeline of prospects.
 
Slide 7 shows the significant progress we've made in the last six months 
since we entered the Gulf of Mexico. Kosmos and DGE have very similar 
entrepreneurial cultures, so we were able to quickly and successf
ully 
integrated the team; adding a strong ILX capability that enhances our 
business. Shortly after we closed the transaction, we made a discovery at 
Nearly Headless Nick of subsequent and expanded our seismic dataset. 
We're already driving strong productio
n growth through bringing new 
development wells online, we are also deepening our prospect hopper 
through developing partnerships and participating in the lease sales. The 
growth opportunity basin is significant and we plan to drill four to five wells 
per 
year targeting 65 million to 100 million barrels of oil equivalent of unrest 
net resource per year.
 
With the recent lease sale success, we have over five years of future drilling 
inventory, which will require approximately $60 million to $100 million of ne
t 
exploration CapEx per year.
 
Slide 8 shows the depth of our Gulf of Mexico prospect inventory in more 
detail. We're targeting to build resource initially around three new hubs; the 
Resolution hub which I described at the Capital Markets Day, the resolutio
n 
well is planned for 4Q this year. A Central Mississippi Canyon hub 
commencing with the oil field test, also planned in 4Q this year and 
supported by strong list of prospects in the immediate area. And finally, 
Vida, Zora hub underpinned by prospect asset
s in the last lease sale with the 
first test planned in 2020.
 
I'd now like to turn the call over to Tom to discuss the balance sheet, our 
shareholder base and guidance. Tom?
 
Thomas Chambers
 
Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, 
Kosmos financial 
strength underpins our ability to execute the plans Andy just discussed, and 
this financial strength is in enduring asset of Kosmos. Being good stewards 
of our balance sheet means keeping healthy liquidity in reserve and properly 
managing 
our debt so that through significant commodity price fluctuation, 
our team can focus on executing our strategy.
 
In 2018, we successfully refinanced both our reserve base lending facility 
and our revolving credit facility, both of which were oversubscribed 
and 
resulted in lower margins and fees. In April of this year, we issued $650 
million of high yield notes at par with a coupon of 7% and 8%. We utilized 
the proceeds to pay
-
off for 7% and 7.8% high yield notes that were due to 
mature in 2021 and paid down 
a portion of our revolving credit facility, 
decreasing our cost of capital and moving the bond maturity to 2026; this 
ensures we have no near
-
term debt maturities until 2022.
 
Slide 10 illustrates a substantial change in our shareholder base over the 
last t
wo years, a shift that mirrors the rapid evolution of our business over 
the same period. During this changing of the guard, our shareholder base 
has transitioned from being heavily weighted towards private equity 
investors to a more diverse broader set of 
public equity investors with a 
significant increase in float. With that enhanced float, U.S. assets and U.S. 
domicile; we now believe Kosmos should soon be eligible for more 
meaningful index inclusion with the benefits that that will bring to our 
sharehold
er base.
 
Looking at Slide 11; as Andy said, our first quarter production averaged 
above the midpoint of our guidance range. As expected, we lifted two cargos 
in Ghana, 1.5 cargos in Equatorial Guinea, and Gulf of Mexico production 
averaged approximately 18
,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day with the 
scheduled drydock of the Helix Producer impacting Tornado production, but 
still above guidance range. Likewise, our first quarter financial results were 
in line with our first quarter guidance.
 
CapEx during t
he first quarter was approximately $110 million. The first 
quarter was impacted by a large working capital adjustment; the result of 
timing differences between fourth quarter accruals and first quarter cash 
payments, including the cash payment of prior yea
r tax in Equatorial Guinea. 
We still expect to generate approximately $200 million of free cash flow at 
$60 Brent before dividends, and at $70 Brent we would expect to generate 
approximately $350 million of free cash flow before dividends this year. As 
suc
h, the free cash flow generation is heavily weighted towards the second 
half of 2019.
 
During the second quarter, there is a short planned shutdown at TEN and 
Delta House as well, and new wells coming online, and we expect production 
to ramp up from first q
uarter levels. In the second quarter, we expect to lift 
three cargoes in Ghana and one in Equatorial Guinea, while the Gulf of 
Mexico production is expected to average between 23,000 and 25,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day. With no further shutdowns p
lanned, 
production during 2019 is expected to ramp continually each quarter and our 
full year 2019 production guidance remains unchanged at 69,000 to 73,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day. The cargo on Gulf of Mexico specific 
guidance is shown for the f
ull year 2019 in the footnote at the bottom of the 
slide.
 
And operator, that currently concludes our prepared remarks, and we'd like 
to open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question
-
and
-
answer session. 
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of 
David Round with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
David Round
 
Hi, I've just got a couple of questions actually. If I could start with the 
o
bvious one that was a pretty relevant transaction announced last night with 
Dayton and Oxy [ph], just wondered what your thoughts were there in 
terms of read through that for Ghana? And the second one on Gulf of Mexico 
actually, you're obviously doing a lo
t of work with BP and as mentioned with 
Chevron in the statement as well, but are there other opportunities to 
partner with some of the active super majors in the region?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Thanks, David. Yes, well, obviously we're digesting the news of the 
con
tingent offer from Total for Oxy's [ph] potential assets in Ghana, 
Mozambique and Algeria. I think, for me, if you take the headline number of 
8.8, I think the world's probably got a view of Algeria being worth around $2 
billion. So, $6.8 billion against t
he Ghana assets and the Mozambique assets 
and I think what it 
--
 
for me the obvious point is that, you know, the world is 
attaching real value to quality cash flowing assets in Ghana, and a large gas 
resource in Africa. We are 
--
 
clearly, in our portfolio 
have very similar assets 
and from a gas perspective, we have a project in Mozambique which has 
reached FID and is moving forward. So I think to me, it simply demonstrates 
the strategic value that the industry places on some key parts of the Kosmos 
portfoli
o.
 
In terms of the second question on the Gulf of Mexico, I think that you 
picked on an important point that part of our business model is our ability to 
work as an exploration partner with the majors. We're demonstrating now 
with BP, with Shell, and as yo
u say with Chevron. And we bring, I think, real 
exploration expertise. So I think we see opportunity in the lease sales as 
we've demonstrated but we also see opportunity to work with the majors on 
their portfolios. And I think the fundamental point that un
derpins that is, the 
competitive landscape in the Gulf of Mexico is really good, there are very few 
players today. And I think we bring something new to the picture in the Gulf 
of Mexico, and we've demonstrated that in the last six months with the pace 
at 
which we've built the prospect inventory.
 
So, as I said in my prepared remarks, the transaction has really exceeded 
our expectations, we felt that going in. But the 
--
 
but our ability to move 
really and build the portfolio on all fronts has really exceeded
 
our 
expectations.
 
David Round
 
Great, makes sense. Thanks, Andy.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Emily Chang
 
Hi, it's Emily Chang on behalf of Neil here. First question I h
ave for you guys 
is, when we think about the high cash flow potential at $70 Brent 
environment, and the potential cash flow injection from the Mauritania
-
Senegal sell down; can you guys talk a little bit about the capital allocation 
strategy, maybe potenti
al for high dividend payments or any acceleration to 
capital spend that we could expect to see, whether that's exploratory or 
development spend?
 
AndrewInglis
 
Yes, thanks Emily. As we discussed at the Capital Markets Day, I think the 
first use of the cash f
low will be to get the balance sheet into the target 
range of 1 to 1.5. Our prices were to sustain at the $70 per barrel range, so 
I said we get to the top end of that range, additional proceeds in Mauritania 
would allow us to get to the lower end of that 
range, potentially beyond it. I 
think the second source of cap 
--
 
the use for capital would then be; do we 
have high quality organic opportunities in the portfolio that could demand 
capital. And I think, the Gulf of Mexico has got some important wells to d
rill 
over the next one to two years, and I think if we were successful 
--
 
more 
successful, I see them we're planning 
--
 
we're planning a 50% success rate 
on those wells which is sort of slightly worse than we've done on average. 
But if we had success there
 
--
 
these are high
-
quality rate
-
of
-
return projects, 
40% to 50% rate
-
of
-
return; and I think that would be the obvious place for 
us to go back to shareholders and say that we wanted to increase our capital 
spend.
 
So I think those are the areas we're going to
 
focus on initially, and we've got 
some work to do to get ourselves down to the bottom end of that debt range 
which gives us the flexibility then to appropriately respond to the external 
environment and respond to the opportunities that we generate organic
ally.
 
Emily Chang
 
Great, that's helpful. And just a quick follow
-
up, just on Jubilee, can we 
--
 
can you guys discuss the gas handling capacity improvements that have 
been made during the past quarter and how we should expect to see 
production of that asset
 
tracking throughout the yield?
 
AndrewInglis
 
Yes, sure. I think, again, as I said in my remarks is doing around 
--
 
it was 
around 100,000 barrels of oil per day. There are a couple more wells to be 
added that will come on sort of late in 2Q and then in 
3Q; they'll help sort of 
sustain that oil rate. The real challenge is around the gas capacity. Now, the 
operator has done work in the first quarter to improve the reliability of the 
gas system; so we now have an additional high pressure compressor 
availabl
e. But at the moment, the gas handling is constrained at around 150 
million standard cubic feet per day. I think if you go back to the operators, 
Capital Markets Day in December, the plan was 160 million cubic feet per 
day, and they had an objective, I thi
nk, to get 
--
 
to be better than that to 
get 170 million cubic feet per day. So, that's the work that we're doing now 
with the operators, it's hard to get from 150 million to 170 million cubic feet 
per day, and that will unlock additional oil capacity in th
e facility.
 
Emily Chang
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein 
Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Bob Brackett
 
I had a question around the Mauritania
-
Senegal sell down. You mentioned 
15 lar
ge credible companies. Can you refresh from Capital Markets Day the 
idea of; A) potentially finding a different type of partner than a technology 
partner like BP. And could you talk about, B), making that transaction tax 
efficient? Has any of that changed 
in terms of your thinking?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
No, Bob, it hasn't. I think when we are at the Capital Markets Day, we sort 
of talked about sort of four groups of potential buyers of the asset. I think 
there the 
--
 
there is a pool of interested companies that are
 
NOCs, they see 
the ability in our particularly 
--
 
in an non
-
operated position with a very 
strong operator for them to participate in the future of the development of 
this gas resource. The second obvious pool is IOCs. And there are a number 
of IOCs involv
ed. The third bucket is around gas buyers, aging gas buyers, 
we'd see access to get 
--
 
see access to the upstream resource and the 
trading potential around that asset. And then, the fourth bucket is sort of 
large, large independent. So we've got a real mix
 
of our potential policies 
that have come through.
 
And as I said in my remarks, the data result 
--
 
data room is open, the 
process has kicked off, the management presentations have started, and 
we're genuinely encouraged by the depth of the industry respons
e.
 
Bob Brackett
 
A follow
-
up on ILX and the notion of future hubs. To be clear, when you talk 
about future hubs, this would still be ILX, i.e. they would be near or tied 
back to existing producing assets; is that the right way to think about it?
 
Andrew Ingl
is
 
Yes, that is the right way to think about it Bob, yes. And, it's you know, 
there was a significant amount of unsold infrastructure and as I said, again 
in the capital markets I think I used the statistic that over 50% of the 
infrastructure is 
--
 
70% inf
rastructure is less than 50% full. So is there 
significant opportunity there and clearly we're targeting opportunities that sit 
around those hubs and multiple opportunities tie
-
backs, so you create the 
competitive advantage.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Great, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One 
Securities. Please proceed with your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Just a couple of quick questions. So we've recently heard about a couple of 
M&A transactions in the Gulf of Mexi
co. Do you see meaningful remaining 
deals available, say, over the next year or so?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes. Look, I think there will be further consolidation, there will be further 
opportunities. But from our perspective, I think we've done what we 
intended to 
do, which was the DGE transaction was about a company, not a 
set of assets. We built a great capability with the addition of DGE, and we're 
very pleased at the rate at which we've actually deepened that prospect 
inventory. So, I think our bias today is aro
und doing this organically, 
growing organically rather than inorganically, given the depth of our 
opportunity set. So, clearly we will continue to screen all the activity that's 
out there. But I think one of the messages we want to get across today is 
the 
Depth of Portfolio we've built quality and in portfolio, and the ability to 
significantly grow our Gulf of Mexico business from executing our strategy.
 
So I'm really pleased at what we've achieved in the first six months, and 
that obviously biases our view
 
to future inorganic activity.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thank you, that's helpful. And you have several Gulf of Mexico wells planned 
over the next couple of quarters, what are you seeing on the cost trend side 
compared to, say, second half of 2018?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Jam
ie [ph] will lead change. We've got 
--
 
we're just actually taking the rigs 
on as we speak for the operated wells that we'll drill in 3Q and 4Q, but we're 
seeing some very competitive rates. So we're not seeing any increase in the 
supply costs.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Charles 
Meade with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.
 
Charles Meade
 
Good morning, Andy and Tom, and to the rest of the team there. Thank you. 
Andy, is 
--
 
on the Maurita
nia
-
Senegal sell down, is there a scenario you can 
reasonably you thin imagine whereby you go through this whole process and 
decide to actually completely sell out or exit the position? And if so, what 
would that have to look like price wise or whatever ot
her relevant features?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes. I think, Charles, it's more strategy than it is around the commercial 
basis. I think, we see an important role actually in continuing to be a partner 
in Mauritania
-
Senegal. We were there at the beginning as we're i
n unlocking 
the basin. And as you start to think about the whole process of moving a 
deal like this forward, it's an important message to both governments that 
we're here to stay and that we will continue to add value to the partnership 
through our relatio
nships both with the operator BP and with both 
governments. So, I think we feel very comfortable around the 10% holding, 
temps and holding. Our objective is that it is a sort self
-
financing option, 
where we can grow a significant position, 10% of $30 milli
on ton per annum 
potential it's no small thing for a company of Kosmos's size.
 
So, I remain very positive about Mauritania and Senegal. We have the big 
gas resource there. There is still further exploration drilling, I think, around 
the potential for a whi
le. So we see this as something that we will add value 
to buy remaining part of the partnership and that is good for the country and 
it's good for the partnership. I think we will create more value for the 
partner coming in as a result.
 
Charles Meade
 
And t
hen if I could ask a question about your new position offshore Republic 
of Congo. Can you give us a sense for what data currently exists or whether 
it's an old 3D or 2D and where you're going to what that first step in your 
process is going to be and perha
ps what we should kind of timeline we 
should think about?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
So and we've entered the base and as you say with the one PSC on Marine 
21. We will shoot new seismic, so that will be the first step of the process. 
There is a reasonable database in 
the 
--
 
from existing 2D but we will shoot a 
new 3D. And the play is very much in the sort of genre of what Kosmos is 
done. We have a new concept and which we're excited about, and we see 
potential for an area that has been under explored by the industry. S
o it is 
the typical way we go, which is to go in at a low
-
entry costs with the seismic 
option. And will 
--
 
it's of [indiscernible]. The link is then do an important 
build out in Guinea opportunities outboard of the ILX range of cyber in a 
queue may the lin
k is then to say it's may the baby code of now Congo be. 
So this is a disease portfolio that can support two quality wells per year and 
Congo will be part of that.
 
Charles Meade
 
Thanks for the detail.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great. Thanks, John.
 
Operator
 
O
ur next qu
estion comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond 
James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for taking the question. Can I just ask at a high level, you guys are 
operating today in three countries, producing in three countri
es, you're 
drilling in another one; you have two more, Sao Tome and Suriname for 
2020, and then Congo and then maybe up beyond that; so I think that's 
eight countries or so total. Is that enough? In other words like, is that 
--
 
are 
you kind of at a level w
here you've diversified the geographic footprint about 
as much as a company of your size would realistically want to handle?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Good question, Pavel. I think, you know 
--
 
as you look at the production 
base today and it was a slide that we had at
 
the Capital Markets Day, we've 
grown the production from this 2016 at just over 20,000 barrels a day up to 
a target this year of 69,000 to 73,000; so significant growth, but actually we 
diversified it from simply one country, Ghana to the Gulf of Mexico, 
Equatorial Guinea and Ghana. So from a production perspective, I think 
we've built the necessary diversification and now we've got multiple fields as 
well. And if you look at the diversification from the Gulf of Mexico, the 
portfolio there, Equatorial Guin
ea, the same; so we've gone from literally 
two fields in Ghana to having that right distribution. And that enables us you 
know despite the challenges in Ghana to keep our production guidance for 
the year actually. So, I feel good about that.
 
We've got a wo
rld class development in Mauritania and Senegal, which as 
we discussed, is going to be a near
-
term source of value
-
add through the 
sell
-
down process but it's a long
-
term growth opportunity and that has scale 
and it has focus. So it is 
--
 
you can't do many 
of these big projects and 
having a company like BP lead is a way for us to sort of remain focused in 
what we do. And then, you've rightly talked about the depth of the Basin
-
Opening Exploration where we have multiple opportunities. I think we've got 
the ri
ght depth of that portfolio now. And the bit that I'm most excited 
about, which is the ILX portfolio, has got real depths now. We're talking 
about a prospect inventory of five years drilling four to five wells per year, 
targeting 65 million to 100 million 
barrels of resource, which is 
--
 
the 2P 
currently in Gulf of Mexico is 82 million, I think
 
So, it gives you a sense of 
--
 
I think, we've got real diversification now but 
it's thematic. We're clear about where the production growth is going to 
come from, we
're clear about where the long
-
term growth is going to come 
-
-
 
from gas, and we're clear about how we can deliver a continuing near
-
term 
production growth from the ILX while retaining the asymmetric upside from 
the base and opening opportunities. So, yes, 
hope we've got the balance, 
right? I believe we're pretty well
-
balanced today, and the important point is 
now to deliver. That's a great portfolio, we just need to programmatically 
deliver the cash, and that means managing the capital.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
And 
in that context, and now that you're in eight countries and I suppose in 
the past you've even had a footprint in others; of all the places you're in at 
the moment, which from a fiscal term perspective, is the most advantaged?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
It 
depends on the price, it depends on nature of the capital going in. Look, 
I'm not going to pick a favorite child because they're all equivalent. But 
actually, there is an important point, Pavel, is that we 
--
 
part of our 
screening criteria is that we go in
to sort of frontier areas where we know we 
can pick up large acreage positions because we're going in at early entry, we 
can get good fiscal terms, and they all compete. We regard them all as top 
quartile when we look across the deepwater portfolio.
 
Pavel 
Molchanov
 
Fair enough. Appreciate it.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great. Thanks, Pavel.

Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton with RBC. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Good afternoon. It's just a very quick question, actually. You're talking about 
a balanced portfolio and also you seem to be talking down the potential for 
further deals in the Gulf of Mexico. On Slide 8, you used the title target 
working interest; so I wa
s wondering what sort of portfolio rationalization or 
additions that type will suggest for your key hubs?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think, look 
--
 
this is very different, Al. What I talked about was around the 
corporate deals of Gulf of Mexico. So, clearly with any 
exploration prospect, 
it depends. As you know, on the Gulf of Mexico, a prospect can be split over 
several licenses; so you don't always get 100% of it. So, some of the 
prospects will have natural partnerships that come from it. Others, we may 
want to brin
g in a partner because it may give us access to a piece of 
infrastructure. So, as you're well aware, pre
-
drill, there is always 
optimization of the working interest which will be around the acreage 
position and the way that the core prospect hits several b
locks, the ability to 
get access to a piece of infrastructure or there may be a swap where we 
want to get into a prospect and this is a way of creating a win
-
win.
 
So that's the intent of the titling there is to say that we're targeting material 
positions, 
but we will obviously 
--
 
the working interest in any one prospect 
will vary just because of the way that commerce is done in the Gulf of 
Mexico.

Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to 
turn the floor back over to 
management for closing comments.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Thanks everyone for joining us today, and we'll have the IR team will be in 
their offices if you need any further clarifications. Appreciate it.

Good day everyone, and welcome to Kosmos Energy's Fourth Quarter and 
Full Year 2015 Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being 
recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance 
and 
Treasurer at Kosmos Energy.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning we issued our fourth quarter earnings release which is available on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com Web site. We anticipate fil
ing 
our 10
-
K with the SEC later today, which will also be available on our Web 
site.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared 
comments, we will hav
e a question
-
and
-
answer session. Consistent with 
prior calls, I request that you ask only one primary question and one follow
-
up question. This will help ensure we get to everyone on the call. If there are 
questions that we aren't able to get to within our
 
one
-
hour timeframe, 
please contact me later today.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements hav
e been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance, and t
hese are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our 
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At t
his time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Neal, and good morning everyone. 2015 was a successful year for 
Kosmos. Our basin
-
opening well at Tortue set the tone for the year and 
marked the beginning of a successful series of exploration
 
and appraisal 
well.
 
We also made significant progress in Ghana, where Jubilee continues to 
deliver, and the TEN development remains on budget and on schedule to 
produce first oil in the third quarter. As we look forward to the rest of 2016, 
we are well po
sitioned both operationally and financially to create value for 
our shareholders.
 
As I go through my remarks today, there are four points I want to 
emphasize. First, Kosmos has the financial strength to invest through the 
cycle focusing on activities that 
will create long
-
term value. We remain 
disciplined in our capital allocation and will continue to protect our balance 
sheet.
 
Second, our Ghana asset provides both high margin cash flow and significant 
growth. We expect net production to grow around 50% fro
m 2015 to 2017.
 
Third, we're just beginning to unlock the value and potential of our acreage 
offshore Mauritania and Senegal. We have had three major gas discoveries 
thus far and remain convinced of the basin's potential for significant oil 
resources as we
ll.
 
And fourth, we continue to plan for the future by high
-
grading our 
exploration portfolio. We view this period in a price cycle as a time of 
opportunity.
 
I'd like to begin by highlighting the strength and stability of Kosmos' 
business model. Possessing 
the financial robustness to manage through 
market turbulence is the fundamental part of the strategy for a resource 
company that has a long
-
term vision. In a world of price volatility, it is 
essential.
 
Since inception, Kosmos' business was designed to exec
ute through the 
cycle. The quality of our assets and our prudent approach to managing the 
balance sheet over the last five years has meant that we enter the downturn 
with a solid financial foundation.
 
Over the course of 2015, we've maintained our liquidity
 
position and 
continue to protect our balance sheet, enabling us to enter 2016 at position 
of strength. We have robust liquidity, low leverage, and a well
-
hedged 
production profile. This position combined with declining CapEx and growing 
production enables
 
Kosmos to continue to execute a strategy and take 
advantage of the current environment.
 
Today we announced our expected investment program for 2016, $650 
million, which is nearly 20% reduction from last year. $200 million of the 
budget is allocated to Gha
na, approximately $250 million is directed towards 
exploration and appraisal activities in Mauritania and Senegal, and the 
remaining $200 million is allocated to other exploration.
 
The work program that underpins this level of capital has been high graded 
essential activities that create the most value. We are continuing to exercise 
capital discipline by ensuring we only drill exploration wells when the 
prospects have been fully matured as demonstrated by the fact we have 
only drilled six frontier explorati
on wells in our 12
-
year history, and opened 
up two basins at 33% success rate.
 
In Ghana, our capital will focus on delivery of the TEN projects and Jubilee 
asset maintenance, both of which underpin our growing high margin 
production base.
 
In Mauritania and
 
Senegal, our 2016 program is centered on the efficient 
appraisal of the Tortue discovery, testing our top ranked oil prospect inboard 
Senegal and acquiring additional seismic to further define the oil 
prospectivity of these high potential licenses.
 
Given 
the better
-
than
-
expected results from the Guembeul
-
1 well in the 
Tortue West structure and based on the anticipated success of the Ahmeyim
-
2 appraisal well, which is currently drilling, we believe we will shortly define 
sufficient resource to win, underpin
 
a world
-
scale LNG project. As a result, 
we do not expect to drill anymore appraisal wells in Tortue West this year 
after Ahmeyim
-
2.
 
In addition to successfully delineating and appraising the substantial gas 
resource, we remain focused on unlocking the oil
 
potential of Mauritania and 
Senegal. We see three independent oil
-
prone fairways in the basin, which 
are located inboard Senegal, inboard Mauritania, and the outboard of both 
Mauritania and Senegal.
 
Early last year, we completed our first seismic program 
inboard Senegal. 
Based on our interpretation of the well results and evaluation of that seismic 
program, one standout oil prospect has emerged which we have named the 
[Teranga] [ph] prospect. We are now planning on drilling this prospect 
immediately post A
hmeyim
-
2. Post the [Teranga] [ph] well which we 
anticipate will be completed in the second quarter this year, we plan to 
pause our drilling activity until 2017.
 
In 2016, we will complete two additional seismic surveys in the outboard of 
Senegal and Maurita
nia. We expect that the full analysis of our prior and 
ongoing seismic acquisition will be complete in 2017, and when combined 
with information acquired from the [Teranga][ph] well will enable us to drill 
our best prospects first on the remaining two indep
endent oil tests. Ensuring 
we take the time necessary to fully evaluate the prospectivity is a critical 
part of our exploration strategy; more on this in a moment.
 
Lastly, our exploration CapEx will be focused on high
-
grading our portfolio. 
This will inclu
de additional seismic in Suriname, which we still believe has 
significant potential. The acquisition of additional licenses in Sao Tome and 
new ventures. Also included in the exploration CapEx is the cost related to 
the Atwood Achiever, even though additio
nal drilling is planned in the second 
half of 2016.
 
With $650 million of capital expenditure in 2016, we expect to end the year 
with liquidity of approximately $1.3 billion, assuming an average Brent price 
of $35 per barrel for the year. 
Importantly, we expect to still be well within 
our covenants with moderate leverage of approximately 2.5 times net debt 
to EBITDAX. This positions us very well to achieve our strategic objectives 
and invest counter
-
cyclically in contrast to the industry.
 
I
n 2017 and beyond, we plan to live within our cash flows. We expect Ghana 
to be near full production and we should have additional capital flexibility as 
Ghana spending declines following a multiyear period sustained investments.
 
Kosmos entered the downtur
n in strong financial position and we continue to 
rigorously allocate capital to execute our strategy through the cycle creating 
a long
-
term value while maintaining balance sheet strength.
 
I'll now shift to Ghana where the industry mantra that big fields g
et bigger 
continues to hold true for our Jubilee field, which delivered strong reserve 
replacement of over 100% for the third consecutive year. The reserve 
additions more than offset any negative impact from pricing reflect the truly 
world
-
class quality of
 
the reservoir. Production also remained strong with 
Jubilee averaging gross sales of 106,000 barrels of oil per day sales in the 
fourth quarter, approximately 102,500 barrels of oil per day sales for the 
year. This led to Kosmos lifting its ninth cargo fo
r the year in December. Gas 
exports continue to progress averaging approximately 92 million cubic feet 
per day during the fourth quarter and ended the quarter at over 110 million 
cubic feet per day.
 
Following a recent inspection of the turret area of the J
ubilee FPSO by 
SOFEC the original turret manufacturer, a potential issue was identified with 
a turret bearing. As a precautionary measure additional operating 
procedures to monitor the turret bearing and reduce the degree of rotation 
of the vessel are bein
g put in place. SOFEC will now undertake further 
offshore examination and until our work with SOFEC determine what further 
measures will be required. Oil production and gas export is continuing as 
normal.
 
The TEN project, our second major oil development i
n Ghana is now over 
85% complete and remains on budget, on schedule with first oil in the third 
quarter of 2016. The FPSO sales in Singapore on the 23rd of January and is 
expected to arrive in Ghana shortly.
 
Additionally, completion of the development well
s in on schedule with six 
well completed to
-
date. After the FSPO arrives in Ghana field hookup and 
commissioning activities are expected to begin. Over the next 12 months, 
we expect significant production growth from Ghana with the TEN 
development expected
 
to push gross productions more than 200,000 barrels 
of oil per day. As a result, we expect net production to Kosmos increase 
around 50% from 2015 to 2017.
 
In 2017 and beyond, we believe growing production and declining capital 
spending requirement should 
result in significant cash flow generation 
providing Kosmos with substantial financial flexibility.
 
I will now shift from our Ghana operations to provide an update on the 
outboard Mauritian and Senegal basin which we opened in 2015. We believe 
the basin to
 
be one of the largest opened in the world over the last 15 years 
and will be source of our continuing growth. Our basin
-
opening discovery 
with the Tortue
-
1 well on the Tortue West structure in April was the second 
largest discovery in the world in 2015 an
d marked the beginning of a series 
of successful follow
-
on wells.
 
Last month, the company announced the results of the Guembeul
-
1 well 
which was our first discovery offshore Senegal and our third consecutive 
successful exploration well continuing our 100% 
exploration rate in the 
basin.
 
At the field level, Guembeul significantly de
-
risked reservoir, continuity, and 
connectivity Tortue suggesting we discovered a single large accumulation of 
gas. In addition, this well proved the existence of excellent quality
 
reservoirs 
in the Albian zone which his critical to ensuring the commerciality of 
resources in the interval.
 
Accordingly, the Guembeul discovery enabled us to increase our Pmean 
gross resource estimates in both Tortue West and the Greater Tortue 
complex, 
which we now estimate at approximately 11 Tcf and 17 Tcf of gas 
respectively.
 
As mentioned during our second quarter 2015 conference call, the granting 
Tortue towards commercialization requires working parallel on both below 
ground and above ground priorit
ies. At that time we declared our top 
priorities to be proving a commercial threshold of resource with a limited 
number of exploration and appraisal wells, fostering the development of an 
intergovernmental cooperation agreement to Mauritania and Senegal an
d 
lastly crafting a credible development strategy. Now less than 12 months 
later, we've made significant progress in all fronts.
 
From a resource perspective, it's our current view that if the Ahmeyium
-
2 
well comes in on prognosis we will approve an approxi
mately 15 Tcf of 
resource in the Tortue West's structure alone, given the higher net to gross 
and additional high quality pay in the Albian. Based on this, we do not plan 
to drill any further gas exploration or appraisal wells as we don't believe 
additiona
l resource of the 15 Tcf will add material value today.
 
We've also made much progress above the ground. Last month the 
Company announced that Kosmos entered into a Memorandum of 
Understanding with Petrosen and SMHPM the national oil companies of 
Senegal an
d Mauritania. The document outlines the principles of an 
intergovernmental cooperation agreement for the joint development of the 
cross border Greater Tortue resource.
 
The MOU sets out the frame work to rapidly conclude the required 
commercial and legal te
rms to enable early development of the field thereby 
maximizing value for all stakeholders. This represents an important step in 
demonstrating the country's willingness and ability to cooperate. With our 
successful appraisal program and the support of both
 
governments the initial 
gas development continues to gain momentum.
 
Concurrently we're reviewing a number of development options for the 
substantial resource. We are evaluating traditional partnering solutions such 
as working with the major as well as any
 
development solutions which 
involve pondering with contract developers. In this regard, I'd like to give 
you a brief update on our partnership with Chevron who held a 30% interest 
in our Mauritania acreage and an option to bank into our Tortue acreage.
 
Ch
evron has made us an offer to back and it is currently being evaluated. 
Discussions are ongoing and at this time we cannot comment any further. 
We have a substantial resource here which we have added value to through 
our successful appraisal program so the
 
key for us will be selecting the 
optimal option which creates most value for our shareholders.
 
Many have asked why we are moving forward with an LNG development 
given the presumption on long lead times to first gas as well as the current 
view of an over s
upplied LNG market. On both of these issues we have a 
differentiated view. In addition to basin
-
opening exploration accelerated and 
phased development are in the Kosmos DNA, in particular we view our 
discoveries in Mauritania, Senegal, and the potential to
 
use that LNG 
technology for initial development as an alleges to our Jubilee experience 
where Kosmos created significant shareholder value through the deployment 
of a phased development approach or accelerate first production 
--
 
ultimately maximizing valu
e enhancing the returns of the projects.
 
Historically, LNG projects are taking 10 to 20 years from discovery to first 
gas. Projects have moved slowly largely due to lack of part alignment, lack 
of government support, and project complexity. Kosmos plans to
 
do things 
differently. We believe that Tortue like Jubilee is a large simple structure and 
this coupled with new technology should allow for accelerated development.
 
At LNG technology is changing project cycle times much like FPSO 
technology once did and 
could be a viable development path for the first 
phase of Tortue. Moreover, we are at an historic low for development costs 
which further benefit the long
-
term cost competitiveness at Tortue Gas.
 
As for LNG supply/demand we agree there is a short term over
 
supply. But 
beyond 2020 we believe that supply gap closes sooner rather than later 
based on new market entrance and new technology. While a significant 
amount of attention is focused on India and China, the LNG demand from 
new market entrance is expected 
to be a larger component of global LNG 
growth in this decade.
 
This is driven by two types of economies, first large economies like 
Indonesia who require gas in excess of current production, exporters who 
are now becoming importers. And second, other market
s which may not 
have the capacity to build a large regas facility but with the growth of FSRUs 
can access the market.
 
FSRUs are increasingly popular alternative to typical onshore regasification 
and can be deployed on short notice in areas where LNG regasi
fication was 
previously unavailable. It's interesting to know that FSRUs now make up 75 
million tons per annum of demand which represents around a quarter of 
total LNG demand.
 
The world is getting gas, and we believe there will be a market for low cost 
gas
 
by Tortue in the future. The global gas market is changing. We believe 
the combination of a world class resource and innovative development can 
form a very competitive gas project.
 
Beyond commercialization of Torture our folks in Mauritania Senegal remain
 
on unlocking this truly super major scale hydrocarbon province. Based on 
our post well results and available size mix we remained convinced that the 
basin has significant prospectivity for both gas and oil.
 
As I previously discussed, we've identified thre
e independent fairways that 
have oil potential. The first well we'll test the Teranga prospect which has 
emerged as our top oil prospects in the inboard Senegal fairway. Teranga 
appears very similar to Tortue in terms of reservoir entrap. From a reservoir 
perspective drilling to
-
date has confirmed the presence of well developed 
stack reservoir systems in the Cenomanian and Albian associated with the 
Senegal River fairway.
 
We've also demonstrated the combination of structural stratigraphy closures 
provide ef
fective traps in these structural trends. The key difference between 
Teranga and Tortue is that Teranga appears to have access to old mature 
Albian source rocks in this location. This will be an important calibration 
point that should enable us to continue
 
to refine our understanding of the 
petroleum system.
 
After we drill this well we plan on taking a pause in drilling activity until 2017 
to integrate the well results and seismic data ensuring we continue to drill 
the best prospects first and 
allocate our capital prudently.
 
A rifle
-
shot exploration approach has always been an essential part of our 
strategy and a key differentiator of the Kosmos. In the current environment 
it's more important than ever to do our homework to ensure we drill the b
est 
prospects first.
 
Lastly, I'd like to remind you that Kosmos remains committed to new 
ventures and a continued high grading of our exploration portfolio. In 2015 
you saw us exit one area right before we entered another. It's natural 
turnover reflex to r
eality that everything in our portfolio has to complete the 
capital. In 2016 we continue to invest in our exploration portfolio 
countercyclically to the industry. Less competition and lower commodity 
prices create opportunity for Kosmos to acquire acreage 
that was not 
available previously.
 
In Sao Tome we recently added to our position with a forming agreement for 
two more blocks. This brings our total position in Sao Tome to approximately 
25,000 square kilometers over four blocks adjacent to a proven petrol
eum 
system that our team knows intimately. In Suriname we are planning to 
shoot an additional 3D survey of a block 42 which is adjacent to the Liza 
discovery offshore of Guyana.
 
This additional data should enable us to high grade the prospectivity of near
-
term drilling. The current environment makes this a very good time to build 
a portfolio with good fiscal terms and minimal commitments as well as quite 
size make it low costs the mature prospects.
 
So in conclusion, the combination of Kosmos' financial stab
ility our world 
class asset in Ghana, our Torture discovery and exploration upside provides 
Kosmos with significant opportunity during the current down cycle.
 
We will protect our balance sheet and financial position to ensure we can 
continue to execute our
 
plan. We have a long record of being good stewards 
of capital, and there are no plans to change that.
 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Tom to update you on the 
financials.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thank you, Andy, and good morning everyone. As Andy men
tioned, we 
exited 2015 in a favorable financial position. Total corporate liquidity was 1.8 
billion at year end versus 1.9 billion at year end 2014, and we are very well 
positioned to execute our plans in 2016.
 
We finished the year with nine crude oil lift
ings, three of which occurred in 
the fourth quarter in line with our revised guidance issued on the third 
quarter conference call. This generated full year 2015 oil revenues of $447 
million, excluding $225 million of derivative settlement. When you add our
 
revenue to our settled hedges, it reflects a real life price of approximately 
$78.73 per barrel in 2015.
 
Fourth quarter and full year revenues were down compared to 2014, 
primarily as a result of lower oil prices. At the end of the year the company 
was in
 
an underlift position, having sold approximately 117,000 barrels less 
than our entitlement.
 
For 2015, we generated a net loss of $70 million, or $0.18 per diluted share 
and in the fourth quarter generated net income of $24 million or $0.06 per 
diluted sha
re. Adjusting for the impact of one
-
time items that affected the 
comparability, the company generated a net loss of 66 million or $0.17 per 
diluted share for the full year of 2015, and net income of $18 million or 
$0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quar
ter.
 
On the cost side, operating expense in the fourth quarter was $30 million or 
$10.50 per barrel sold, representing a sequential decrease to a level more in 
line with our second quarter rates. For 2015, we averaged operating 
expense of $12.34 per barrel
, above our annual guidance is the result of 
higher workover expense and non
-
routine maintenance on the FPSO, 
including expenses to repair the gas compressor in the third quarter of 2015.
 
Exploration expense of $24 million for the fourth quarter was largel
y related 
to our ongoing 3D seismic work in the outboard Senegal area as well as 
ongoing seismic processing and interpretation resulted in full year 2015 
exploration expense of $156 million.
 
Full year general and administrative costs, including non
-
cash eq
uity
-
based 
compensation remained at $137 million, which is in line with our guidance 
for the year, and essentially flat with 2014 levels.
 
Fourth quarter G&A was approximately 20% lower on an absolute basis, but 
more importantly our $15.98 per barrel rate w
as 14% lower than our fourth 
quarter 2014 rate. This was favorably impacted by the addition of proved 
reserves at year end, the result of positive field performance at Jubilee. This 
rate will have a positive impact on the earnings in 2016.
 
Taxes decreased 
in 2015, largely as a result of lower oil pricing. It's 
important to note that our deferred taxes fluctuated over the year based on 
the mark
-
to
-
market value of the hedges, making it very difficult to predict 
our overall tax position. This will again be the
 
case going forward in 2016.
 
We continue to maintain our strong hedge position, and at year end, our 
hedges had a mark
-
to
-
market value of approximately $238 million. 
Currently, our roller hedges totaled 12.9 million barrels with approximately 6 
million bar
rels hedged in 2016, 6 million barrels hedged in 2017, and 1 
million barrels hedged in 2018. Our 2106 hedging program reduces 
commodity price exposure, or approximately 60% of our 2016 production 
with average floor prices of $81.67 per barrel based on Bren
t.
 
The company's robust hedging program is a part of our strategy to protect 
our cash flows, balance sheet, and liquidity. Maintaining adequate financial 
liquidity is critical to our business strategy as it provides the capacity to 
internally fund our deve
lopments and growth programs in Ghana, as well as 
our exploration and appraisal program even in this current environment.
 
Another indication of our balance sheet strength is the recent affirmation by 
both S&P and Fitch of our corporate debt rating as the s
table, despite a 
recent rash of credit downgrades.
 
So as we enter 2016, we enter with a strong balance sheet and liquidity 
position, allowing us to execute on our $650 million investment program. We 
expect to exit 2016 with approximately $1.3 billion of li
quidity, based on our 
CapEx guidance and assuming Brent averages $35 per barrel for the year.
 
Our borrowing
-
based re
-
determination process is currently ongoing and will 
be completed by the end of March. At this time we do not expect a material 
change in ou
r borrowing base over the course of 2015. Although pricing will 
drive some decreases in availability, borrowing capacity of TEN should 
increase as we achieve first oil. This should more or less offset most of the 
changes to borrowing availability due to pr
ices in 2016.
 
At this time, I would like to transition to our expectations for 2016. 
Consistent with the operators' guidance we anticipate 2016 production to 
mirror 2015 levels, resulting in Kosmos selling a total of nine cargos of crude 
oil. This includes
 
a two
-
week shutdown of the FPSO in the first quarter of 
2016, which is expected to decrease average field production by 4000 
barrels of oil per day, as well as the period of reduced water injection 
capacity during the first half of the year, which is curr
ently being addressed.
 
During the fourth quarter 2016, we anticipate selling our first cargo from 
TEN, which would result in Kosmos selling in total of 10 cargos for the year, 
and 11% increase from 2015 levels. We expect cargo sizes in 2016 to 
average appr
oximately 95,000 barrels per cargo.
 
On the cost side, we anticipate total production operating expense for the 
year to average $12 per barrel, which includes both Jubilee and TEN. For the 
first three quarters of the year we expect Jubilee operating expense
 
to 
average approximately $10 per barrel. In the fourth quarter we expect OpEx 
to increase as we begin to sell ten cargos given the 10 FPSO lease costs, 
include in LOE plus the fact that some one
-
time operating costs will come 
through at start
-
up.
 
G&A cost
 
for the year ending 2016 are expected to be slightly lower than full 
year 2015, as a result of the decrease in equity
-
based compensation 
expense. We expect that DD&A should average around $19 per barrel, as we 
begin to depreciate TEN, post first oil.
 
Bear
ing in mind the challenge of giving growth on taxes, assuming Brent 
remains at $35 per barrel, we anticipate cash taxes will be lower than 2015 
levels, while deferred component will vary driven by the mark
-
to
-
market 
position of our hedges.
 
Overall, we 
expect taxes to range from a $1.50 to $2.50 per barrel on 
average for 2016, excluding deferred taxes associated with the mark
-
to
-
market position of our hedges.
 
With regard to our $650 million capital program, as Andy described earlier, 
200 million is the e
armark for Ghana, the majority of which will be spent on 
the TEN project, 250 million is the earmark for exploration and appraisal 
activity in Mauritania and Senegal, and 200 million is currently earmarked to 
other plant exploration activity. This amount i
ncludes capital allocated to 
new ventures, seismic acquisition, and costs associated with the Achiever.
 
Other 650 million, about 200 million of the total is expected to be treated as 
exploration expense; two
-
thirds of which is forecasted in the second half
 
of 
the year.
 
As we execute our strategy, we're committed to maintaining the strength of 
our balance sheet and creating value for our shareholders through the cycle.
 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we would like to turn it over 
for questions, 
operator.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Great, thanks. Good morning and good results, gentlemen. 
Maybe you 
addressed this some in the comment, but can you walk through a little bit 
the 
--
 
I guess what you would view as your potential options for either the 
development or the modernization of the resource at Mauritania and 
Senegal? I know that that is 
potentially an option right now for Chevron on 
the backend. At what point do you 
--
 
would you consider opening up to a 
broader process to take market interest, and what would be the potential 
timing in terms of how you think about timing and development ov
er the 
next couple of years?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, good morning, Ryan. Well, look, I think the first thing is I think we are 
confident as a result of the appraisal drilling that we've conducted today, 
and if Ahmeyim
-
2 comes in on prognosis, you know, on West To
rtue, we've 
got 15 Tcf of gas in what we believe is a very simple launch gas 
accumulation. Therefore, fundamentally we have a resource which we 
believe is cost competitive [indiscernible] from an upstream perspective, but 
I think it's important that we do 
enough work to understand the most cost 
effective way from midstream solution. And as I said in my remarks, I think 
we see the rapid rate at which FLNG technology is moving forward that it 
can provide us with a very cost effective midstream solution.
 
So I 
think the first 
--
 
the workover in the next quarter will be to integrate 
the appraisal work, and around midyear I think we would have done the 
conceptual thinking to outline what we believe will be a demonstration of a 
cost effective resource. At that poin
t, we'll then decide the route we go. I 
think there is a route around partnering with a major, we discussed 
Chevron; we are in discussions. It will be great to work with them, but there 
were several other majors that are also seeking to get an entry into t
he 
position. So we have added a lot of value here through the appraisal 
program. And I think it's important that we evaluate the route through a 
potential farm
-
down to a major, and equally well there are other solutions 
available today, a contracted develo
per approach where we would seek a 
different development partner. So I think you can probably see us coming to 
a decision on that in the second half of the year. I am not sure we need to 
go into a sort of public data room on this. We know who it is we want
 
to 
work with, and I think it will be a smaller conversation rather than a larger 
conversation.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Great, thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe on spending, can you talk 
about what the level 
--
 
I appreciate the color in 2016, I guess can you talk 
a
bout the expectations for what happens to capital spend in 2017, how 
much rolls off, what's kind of the minimum level spend or an appropriate 
level of spend looking into 2017? And then, maybe you talked about cash 
flow neutrality from 2017 forward, is that
 
--
 
what level of capital and oil 
price does that assume?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Look, what I would say on that, Ryan, is 
--
 

through a period of very heavy spending in Ghana with sort of getting TEN 
up and running. In 2017, clearly tha
t spend rolls off and we see positive 
cash flow coming out of Ghana. What I am not going to do is give you the 
price tag on which we are working in '17, or therefore what is the exact 
point of cash flow neutrality, but what we do have in '17 is significant
 
financial flexibility. And I think that's the big message coming back to you is 
that discipline around the environment of the time, and we're not predicting 
a high price environment. We are predicting quite a moderate environment. 
And given that moderate 
environment, the cash flow that would be coming 
from Ghana, given the limited amount of CapEx going in, the exploration 
program will be tailored to that. And I think that will still give us the 
opportunity of drilling the right wells in the right order.
 
So
 
I believe we are actually at that sweet spot now of being able to run the 
business in the right way. And I want to come back and make a big 
emphasis on my remarks which we is we're a rifle
-
shot exploration 
company, we do our homework well, and we drill pr
ospects when they are 
ready. And I believe the maturation of Mauritania and Senegal versus a free 
cash flow coming from Ghana will enable us to get that synced up.
 
Ryan Todd
 
That's great. What is the net roll off in capital in Ghana year
-
on
-
year as you 
loo
k into '17?
 
Andy Inglis
 
The net roll off, so if you look at Ghana spend today is a couple of hundred 
million dollars and a majority of that is on TEN. Clearly, we have limited with 
sort of no drilling on TEN in the first year, limited drilling on Jubilee, 
that's a 
significant reduction.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Right. Thanks, Ryan.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with 
Societe Generale. Please proceed with your question.
 
John Herrlin
 
Yes, thanks. Andy, could you be little bit more specific on [Teranga] [ph] in 
terms of the size of the prospect, I mean, what are you looking for there? 
Can you describe it more?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, I think so if you go to 
--
 
and I'll say more about this duri
ng the week 
when we were in [indiscernible] with some pictures, but if you can think of 
the 
--
 
this is the Cayar Profond block, John. The [Teranga] [ph] prospect is 
fed by the Senegal River system. It's the same depositional system that has 
fed Tortue. So 
we have got sort of confidence now through the seismic on 
the Cenomanian reservoir system. So, it's a Cenomanian reservoir target. 
They are structured very similar to [Teranga] [ph] at the structural 
stratigraphic trap.
 
The big difference between the two i
s that we're in the southern part of the 
Senegal basin. This is where we believe the Albian source is oil mature, and 
that's the key difference between the two prospects where 
--
 
and we have 
the Cenomanian over line directly what we believe is an oil matur
e Albian 
source, which is feeding the prospects, and the prospect size is about half a 
billion barrel.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay, great. Next one from me is with Chevron, is there is a drop dead date 
in terms of you giving a yea or nay to the backend agreement?
 
An
dy Inglis
 
No, there isn't. Chevron failed to make their mandatory election to back in to 
the Mauritania blocks by the original required date. And as a consequence, 
they have withdrawn 
--
 
they have made us a counter
-
[proposal] [ph] which 
we are currently di
scussing with them. It would be great to work with them, 
but as I said to Ryan, we've got significant interest from other majors.
 
So for us, it's really about ensuring that we find the best way forward now, 
and since 
--
 
over the last year, as I said, a lot
's happened here. We drilled 
three successful wells. We have updated our petroleum system analysis. We 
know a lot more about the basin now. It's got significant potential. And 
therefore, we need to find the right partner for the long
-
term. So that's 
where 
we are, John.
 
John Herrlin
 
Great, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with 
Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
 
Edward Westlake
 
Yes, good morning, and congratulations on the results that you 
[indiscernible] the 12 months. Just express question on the floating LNG, 
obviously, an onshore scheme would have the ability to have larger scale 
where FLNG tends to be smaller. I mean, maybe walk through the plan if 
you do go down an FLNG route, I mean p
resumably you need three, four 
vessels to produce that type of resource.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, what's interesting, Ed 
--
 
and it's great question, is 
--
 
and I sort of 
worked at this for a quite a long time in my career, I think the industry has 
gotten into a min
dset of sort of big is beautiful, and it's credit projects that 
are actually too large. And therefore, this idea that you are going to get 
efficiency through scale hasn't been born through. And I think that's the 
result actually of the last sort of five ye
ars of development where scale 
actually hasn't led to efficiency. So I think it's time to think differently. And 
our approach is to say that there is a cost competitive size, and I think it's 
probably in the 2
-
3 million ton size.
 
Clearly if you then sort o
f design one and potentially build two, you get a 5 
million tons and actually you can scale beyond that. So, I think it's a 
question about you can create the same scale and actually think you can 
create the same scale at lower capital inputs than trying to
 
do the large 
project first.
 
And I think the industry has demonstrated irrespective of the operator that 
the large scheme hasn't delivered the capital efficiency. So I think that's my 
mindset here. And I don't think that starting with a more modest scheme 
necessarily negates the fact that you can't build it rapidly to a 10 million ton 
scheme if that is what supported by the resource which I think it clearly 
would be. So that's the thinking. It's a very simple point, but I believe we've 
done enough work now.
 
I am thinking through some of the concepts and 
learning from history that I think there is a more efficient way of doing it.
 
Edward Westlake
 
And it would make a lot sense in terms of looking at how the whole 
environment for that asset actually works?
 
Andy
 
Inglis
 
Yes, absolutely. Yes, you add to it therefore ability to sort of bring some 
[indiscernible] gas to the country earlier; it enables you to establish a 
working environment in countries that are relatively immature from a 
development perspective. So, 
it has lot of other collateral advantages. But 
the core thesis is what is the most capital efficient way to do this. And I 
don't believe big is necessarily right because big means complex and 
complex has led to massive overrun.
 
Edward Westlake
 
Okay. So sec
ond question is more related around the turret and the bearing 
in Jubilee and obviously Tullow is the operator. Obviously, one strives to a 
lot of reading as to what would happen and how just good it is workout if a 
bearing is going fail, but maybe just wa
lk us through what would be the 
worst scenario if say the bearing did fail and need to be replaced?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, well, look, we talked to you about it I think it was on Thursday. It's now 
Monday, right? So, we want to be very open in the disclosure whi
ch is what 
we did. What's happening now is there is a bunch more diagnostic work 
going on. And I think to be honest, Ed, we need to go through that piece of 
work and really understand what it is we are dealing with. And from there, 
we can clearly describe 
what the worst case scenario is from 
--
 
I think it's 
actually it will be premature to speculate about that. And therefore, I don't 
want to do is get ahead of the issue. I think what we need to do is do the 
work. We've got a lot more investigation work to d
o properly describe the 
potential issue. And when we've done that, we can come back to you and 
describe the scenarios. And I think genuinely you have got to give us a little 
bit of time to do that.
 
All of that said, there are many potential 
solutions spread mooring is a 
potential solution in water depth than the mid ocean condition. So, there are 
many potential solutions out here. So, 
--
 
and in the meantime of course, 
most important thing is that with a vessel heading being controlled by turr
et 
production continues as normal. Okay?
 
Edward Westlake
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gamboa with 
Tudor Pickering Holt. Please proceed with your question.
 
David Gamboa
 
Hi, good morning gentlemen. I have two 
questions please. So the first one 
just a clarification I guess around the Mauritania and Senegal LNG project. 
You mentioned how probably around midyear we will have some sort of idea 
of concept selection of best midstream solution for the project. I was j
ust 
wondering if you could give a bit more color around any further milestones 
that you would need to see for 
--
 
before taking an FID on this project and 
some idea around the timing of this. I believe you said probably second half 
of the year you probably 
would be deciding on the procedure for just to 
confirm.
 
And the second one, just on Jubilee, you have mentioned how big fields get 
bigger on time 
--
 
I think you guys mentioned in the past that Jubilee could 
reach around 120,000 barrels per day or probably 
even reach more above 
that main pipe capacity, but guidance for this year is around 100,000 barrels 
a day, just north of that. I just was wondering if you could give us some 
color of your thought around how the field group will perform in the future if 
you
 
still think the table has reached that 120,000 barrel per day mark 
exceeded, and if so, how long can that be maintained? Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, David. Let's start with the Jubilee question and come up to margin in 
Senegal. Just wanting to clarify a p
oint which we continue to make, which is 
120,000 barrels a day is the production number and there is a shrinkage 
factor to go from sales to production. So, actually in the fourth quarter we 
had 
--
 
our gross sales were around 106,000 barrels a day, which ac
tually on 
a production basis is probably 
--
 
you get the math wrong now, but about 
112,000
-
113,000 barrels a day. So, actually in the fourth quarter, the field 
was pretty close to its 120. And of course that's an average for the quarter. 
So on certain days 
it was absolutely that.
 
So, it's a mathematical problem that we need to keep going around, which is 
the conversion from production to sales, and then sales with maintenance 
build into it, which is really the issue for 2016 is that we've got a two
-
week 
shut
down. So we can't do the math when you put the two
-
week shutdown 
into it, you take the exit production rate from the fourth quarter of 2015, the 
numbers are pretty close. I think and internal piece is the production is 
going to be a little lighter I think 
in the first half, where we're catching up on 
some injection issues that we've had, but fundamentally the capacity is that. 
So I think's the 
--
 
the field continues to perform, and what I would highlight 
is the gas export has been remarkably reliable actual
ly, given the nature of 
the system through to the gas pile generation. So that to me was one of the 
big risks that we have to remove in 2015. So I think that's the Jubilee 
production story.
 
In terms of Mauritania and Senegal, again, just to be very clear, 
David, what 
I said was we're the process now of integrating on knowledge of the gas 
resource with the final appraisal well, our gas appraisal well, which is 
Ahmeyim
-
2. We then put that with the early thinking we got on the most 
competitive way to develop t
he resource, the concept thinking, that sort of 
going to come together by mid
-
year, and in parallel we are in discussion 
with a number of parties about that potential participation. We would make 
a decision on that participation in the second half of '16. 
And that would 
allow us then to move forward with the necessary work in '17 to bring this to 
an investment decision. So I think the investment decision in some ways 
out, at least for the backend of '17. So what we are looking to do I think is 
first is what
's the right way to develop this resource and ensure we've got 
alignment with the potential partner around that.
 
David Gamboa
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with 
Raymond James. Please proceed w
ith your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So kind of a high
-
level one first, 
from the first field you started up to the second, it's been roughly six years, 
do you have a sense of how long it will take for your next devel
opment, 
whether it's LNG or perhaps something else to get to production?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great question, Pavel. I would say that it's going to be the early part of the 
next decade; there maybe that six
-
year cycle is probably right.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, and 
--
 
okay, fair enough. And is there any realistic prospect that 
something other than Mauritania LNG could come at ahead of the LNG 
project? So, is there anything on deck that could be an accelerated 
development versus LNG?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well, clearly, there is 
lots of ins and outs in that. If I take the question 
maybe how it's input, I will be looking at inorganic opportunities that could 
potentially accelerate. We obviously continue to throw all possible 
opportunities. We believe we create value through our dif
ferential quality of 
our exploration portfolio, and focus on ensuring, we are targeting big things 
that work at a very competitive oil price and therefore, and we believe the 
things that we will test in Mauritania and Senegal, the three oil test will 
absol
utely be competitive in that regard.
 
So the question is if we had an oil discovery what it can be time
-
wise with 
the process of monetizing Tortue, and I think the answer would be if it is a 
scale on the court and we believe that, then absolutely it could.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
All right, fair enough. I appreciate it guys.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Right, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Petr Grishchenko with 
Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Hi guys, 
thanks for taking my question. Just one question with liquidity, 
what do you expect result of the March re
-
determination look like? In your 
mind, are there any commitment amortizations for next year?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes. Well, I will pass it over to Tom, Petr.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yes, Petr, there is no amortization this year or in '17. And obviously the 
March re
-
determination will be dependent on what the actual price deck is, 
and we have just started those discussions, but overall we think it will be 
relatively de mi
nimis. And when you get to the September re
-
determination 
we will have TEN added to the approved reserve base. So, overall year
-
on
-
year, we think we will be in pretty good shape.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Got it. And you mentioned two and a half times leverage, I b
elieve, in '15, 
what do you see most drawing on the revolver?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Drawing mostly on the revolver, is that what you said?
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Yes. What do you see in the drill down in the revolver?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Most of those come 
--
 
we're not going to d
rill anything on the revolver. It 
will all be out of the RBL.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 

 
Andy Inglis
 
Typically about 400.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
400, got it. And lastly if I may, I'm looking at your 
--
 
given the 
[indi
scernible] and reserves, can you provide a color on the revision of 
estimates of 10 million in prudent reserves?
 
Andy Inglis
 
I'm not following your question.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
You have revision and estimates in the prudent [technical difficulty] 10 
million.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Right.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
And I'm just wondering what portion I guess if you can sort of provide more 
color, like, what amount was declined in reserves due to lower oil prices 
versus increased due to reserve economics?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well, I 
mean, Petr, come back with 
--
 
you can chat with Neal later, but I 
think the basic story is that we are seeing reserve growth in Jubilee more 
than offset the price deck and that's where the growth is coming from.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Okay, great. That's all I h
ave guys.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Probably an important point to emphasize is that despite the lower price 
deck, that was reserve source at Jubilee, which led to the more than 110% 
reserve replacement across the Ghana asset.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yes. Petr, most of that was re
served, there was very little price intact.
 
Petr Grishchenko
 
Interesting, thanks a lot guys, thanks.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Okay, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of 
Al Stanton with RBC. Please proceed with you
r question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes. Good morning, guys. Just a question about the decision to park the rig, 
in terms of when the decision was made and also why, I mean it's obvious 
why, but in terms of whether that was a eureka moment, and with the issue 
of timing
 
to return to drilling wells, you have accelerated the well in Senegal, 
why is [indiscernible] to accelerate the wells in Mauritania and drill them 
ahead of the previous schedule, do the math a little bit quicker on prospect 
sizes and probabilities?
 
Andy I
nglis
 
Look Al, I know 
--
 
I guess it's all good questions, I think the fundamental 
part, which I hope was clear was on remarks is that we believe very strongly 
as a company around the discipline of the exploration process via patrolling 
system analysis work
, that allows you to properly evaluate the prospectivity 
and drill the best prospects first.
 
The acreage in Senegal and the seismic that we had 
--
 
there we shot in 
2015, you know, what came from that is that our understanding of Teranga, 
it's the same Sene
gal river system, allowed us to get a lot of confidence in 
the reservoir, allowed us to get confidence with the shopping [ph] 
geometries. And therefore with a combination of the well results in terms of 
the geochemistry gave us confidence that we had a rea
l potential in the 
South.
 
I think what we are saying on the other prospectivity is that we see three 
independent tests, but we need to do further work, and our further work in 
the outboard requires us to shoot additional seismic, which drives the timing 
of
 
those wells. And clearly in the North, we've got further work to do on the 
reservoir system, [indiscernible] river feeding and the Senegal River feeding. 
So I think this is all about ensuring that we do the right work, remain 
disciplined about it, and [in
discernible] driven, and that will be a 
fundamental way in which we work. So we still see real valid tax on the 
inboard Mauritania, outboard Mauritania and Senegal, but there is going to 
be further work, and we think that work will be completed in 2017, no
t this 
fall.
 
Al Stanton
 
So, when drilling restarts in 2017, should we expect you to drill the 
prospects you already identified, or should we expect other things to 
--
 
either come into the portfolio or come 
--
 
reach the similar stage of maturity?
 
Andy Ingli
s
 
Well, look, today I'd like to say we haven't paid the prospects. We see an oil 
test in northern Mauritania, and we see an oil test either in the outboard of 
Mauritania or Senegal. And then I think we are clearly shooting seismic in 
Suriname his year on B
lock 42. I think that will high grade into an oil 
prospect, and we have the existing prospects, which is already 
[indiscernible] in Suriname. So I think they're going to be live. If there is oil 
test, we're going to have to figure out the right order to do
 
those tests. 
Some of that will depend on partners as well.
 
Al Stanton
 
If I may, can I ask one last question. You're in a similar position on the 
development side, being rig
-
rich, should we push the teak area and the 
Greater Jubilee continue 
development further to the right as well, or do you 
see that happening in 2017 as well?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Well, in terms 
--
 
we have submitted the plan of development for Greater 
Jubilee, which includes mahogany and teak. We're not in discussions with 
the governm
ent. So I think the timing of that will depend on the pace at 
which those things move forward.
 
Al Stanton
 
Fair enough. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Okay. Thanks, Al.

Good day, everyone and welcome to Kosmos Energy Fourth Quarter 2019 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Jamie Buckland, Vice President of 
Investor Relations at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Jamie Buckland
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to you all for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our fourth quarter earnings release and a slide 
presentation to accompany today's call. The materials are available on the 
investors' page of ou
r website.
 
Joining me on the call today, to go through that materials are Andy Inglis, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief Financial 
Officer.
 
During today's presentation, we will make forward
-
looking statements that 
refer to our e
stimates, plans and expectations. Actual results and outcomes 
could differ materially due to factors we note in this presentation and in our 
UK and SEC filings. Please refer to our annual report, stock exchange 
announcements and SEC filings for more detail
s. These documents are 
available on our website.
 
At this time, I will turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Thanks, Jamie and good morning and afternoon to everyone. Before I turn 
to the agenda, I would like to acknowledge Tom's retirement, which was 
a
nnounced today. Tom has done an incredible job as CFO for Kosmos over 
the last five years. He'll be replaced by Neal, a 10
-
year, Kosmos veteran 
who many of you know already.
 
So turning to today's agenda, I'm going to focus on three areas. First, a look 
bac
k at 2019 operational and financial performance; Second, integrating 
climate risk into Kosmos' strategy; and third the plan for 2020.
 
Turning to slide 3, in 2019, Kosmos delivered on all of its key targets for the 
year. On safety, we reported no lost time 
or recordable incidents, best
-
in
-
class performance. Financially, we delivered approximately $250 million of 
free cash flow exceeding our forecast. In Mauritania and Senegal, we made 
excellent progress on the Tortue development with Phase 1 around 25% 
compl
ete at year
-
end.
 
In exploration and appraisal five of the seven wells drilled during the year 

row, a reserve replacement greater than 100%, demonstrating the quality of 
our asset base
. On the following slides I will focus on these areas in more 
detail.
 
Turning to slide 4, safety, the fundamental value of our business underpins 
our license to operate. As you can see on the slide, 2019 was one of the 
most active years in company history,
 
with five wells drilled in Equatorial 
Guinea and the Gulf of Mexico as operator, more than 1.7 million man hours 
in total. It was a record year for safety with no lost time or recordable 
incidents demonstrating that zero is possible.
 
Slide 5 focuses on ou
r financial performance in 2019 and shows we delivered 
on our key metrics. Kosmos generated around $250 million of free cash, 
exceeding our target at $200 million, despite the operational challenges we 
experienced in Ghana. Importantly, this is the third c
onsecutive year of 
strong organic free cash flow generation, almost $600 million in total over 
the last three years, demonstrating a key attribute of our business model.
 
As you can see on the right hand chart, we've used that free cash flow to 
reduce debt.
 
As a result of strong cash generation and CapEx control, 
leverage has continued to fall, ending the year at around 1.8 times. We paid 
out inaugural dividend of $0.18 per share in 2019 and this morning, we 
announced our first quarter dividend of $4.05 per 
share consistent with prior 
quarters.
 
Turning to slide 6, our exploration appraisal program was successful, with 
five positive results from the seven wells drilled. Total resources net to 
Cosmos was around 380 million barrels oil equivalent, or 80% of the 
480 
million barrels oil equivalent targeted at the beginning of the year. These 
drilling results came from three different business units, which highlight the 
depth of opportunities we have across the portfolio.
 
We had a 100% success rate in Mauritania and
 
Senegal with the GTA 1 well, 
and Yakaar
-
2 appraisal wells, and the Orca
-
1 exploration well, which is the 
largest deepwater hydrocarbon discovery in 2019. In addition our 
infrastructure
-
led exploration or ILX delivered a 50% success rate in 2019, 
in line w
ith our expectations, with success in the Gulf of Mexico was Gladden 
Deep and Equatorial Guinea with the S
-
5 well.
 
Turning to slide 7, our development projects in Mauritania and Senegal 
continue to move forward. At Tortue we advanced Phase 1 of the project
s to 
approximately 25% completion at year end with all key work streams on 
schedule. We remain on track to deliver gas in the first half of 2022.
 
The signing of the SPA with BP Gas Marketing in February was an important 
milestone as it finalized the offtak
e for all Phase 1 gas and enabled Kosmos 
to book 1P reserves, materially increasing our proved reserve space.
 
For Phases 2 and 3 we have made significant progress with BP on finalizing 
the development concept to increase the LNG capacity from 2.5 million t
ons 
per annum to approximately 10 million tons per annum. The concept will 
leverage the Phase 1 infrastructure and the near shore location with a goal 
to deliver highly cost competitive LNG scheme with one of the lowest carbon 
intensities in the world.
 
On 
Yakaar
-
Teranga the Yakaar
-
2 appraisal well proved up the southern 
extension of the field, confirming the world scale resource in place. We are 
working with partners to develop the resource. We are applying an initial 
Phase 1 domestic gas power project supp
orting Senegal's plan to merge on 
by replacing higher carbon diesel with natural gas.
 
At Birallah, the Orca
-
1 one exploration well discovered 13 [ph] TCF of gas 
materially increasing the size the Mauritanian resource potential, to around 
50 TCF of gas in p
lace. Importantly, this well the risk more than enough 
resource to underpin a third LNG hub in the region.
 
Turning to slide eight which look to the evolution of Kosmos' reserve based 
in recent years. This year, the company announced a 1P and 2P reserve 
rep
lacement to greater than 100% highlighting the quality of our underlying 
assets. This is now the seventh consecutive year of greater than 100% 1P 
reserve replacement.
 
There are two important takeaways from this slide. First, the diversity in our 
reserves h
as increased significantly since 2016 when we had just Ghana. 
Through exploration success and strategic acquisitions in EG and the Ghana, 
the Kosmos reserves have grown at over 50% annually, both on a 1P and 2P 
basis. With over 550 million barrels oil equi
valent of 2P reserves, our 
reserves to production ratio is around 22 years, one of the best in the 
industry for a mid
-
cap E&P company. It is driving and increasingly diverse 
portfolio means Kosmos no longer relies on a single field or geography to 
drive pe
rformance.
 
Second, with reserve bookings in Mauritania and Senegal, Kosmos now has a 
much more balanced mix of oil and gas. Through continued progress and the 
developments in Mauritania and Senegal, the gas components line to 
increase naturally overtime.
 
T
hat wraps up the summary for 2019. I'd now like to move on to the next 
section of today's presentation, our approach to integrating climate risk into 
our strategy. Kosmos has always recognized the impact of climate change 
and the role played by humanity. I
t's the defining issue of our time and 
requires urgent action from everyone, governments, civil society and the 
private sector. We know that investors and stakeholders want to understand 
the risks that climate change presents to our business, as well as th
e actions 
we're taking support the energy transition and deliver to power its goals.
 
I want to focus on our role in tackling this challenge on the importance of 
gas in the transition, and how our innovative approach as a company brings 
wider social, econom
ic, and technological benefit. We don't have all the 
answers for how a business like ours can fully adapt to tackling climate 
change as part of the broader ESG agenda. But based on the extensive work 
we've done so far and our engagement with shareholders a
nd others, we 
believe a midcap E&P like Kosmos can indeed play an important role and 
make a difference.
 
Turning slide 10 with resources and operations mostly in developing 
countries, especially in Africa, Kosmos faces the jewel challenge. How do you 
provide the affordable energy needed for economic development and social 
progress and do it while reducing carbon emissions. This challenge is 
especially stark in our host countries where demographics will drive 
increased demand for energy.
 
Africa is expec
ted to double its current population and grow by more than 1 
billion people by 2050, representing more than 50% of the worldwide growth 
projected during that time. These men and women aspire to a standard of 
living and that we take for granted, which was b
uilt on hydrocarbons. Many 
African leaders have made this point on behalf of their citizens, who often 
lack the basic necessities for a decent and secure line. Kosmos can promote 
that economic development and social progress by providing affordable 
energy 
and helping countries accelerate their transition to cleaner sources of 
energy through oil to gas and renewables.
 
With our partner BP we're working on this agenda in Mauritania and Senegal 
through our natural gas development projects. Our goal is to delive
r the 
lowest carbon LNG projects providing affordable gas to the local population 
and connecting to their considerable future capacity for renewables, 
especially solar and winds. This leads to our purpose as a company, a 
purpose that has the creation of so
cial value at its heart. First Kosmos is 
going to supply the energy needed today. Demand forecasts show the world 
will need oil for the immediate future and we can provide oil with advantage 
low cost short cycle and at the lower end of carbon intensity in 
its production 
for every barrel that is saved.
 
Second, Kosmos, is going to find and develop cleaner energy for tomorrow, 
our portfolio will have a greater focus on gas, while I fully expect the energy 
mix to maximize the use of renewables. The world cannot
 
achieve the Paris 
goals without natural gas playing a major role in the energy transition. 
Natural gas emits about 50% less carbon dioxide than coal in power 
generation. It's more reliable than wind or solar.
 
And finally, Kosmos is going to continue worki
ng in the right way as a force 
for good in our host countries, supporting economic and social progress. By 
saying true to this purpose, we believe we can generate attractive long
-
term 
shareholder returns and advance the societies in which we operate, while
 
working in a sustainable way.
 
Turning now to slide 11, we take our cue from the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals, which provide a template for how actions can impact 
the greater good. Kosmos contributes to all sustainable development goals, 
but in some ar
eas the impacts are larger. For example, in Mauritania and 
Senegal, as I mentioned earlier, our natural gas projects are being develops 
with a potential tie into renewables. They will provide affordable and cleaner 
energy that both countries can use to dev
elop their economies, reducing 
poverty and improving infrastructure.
 
Across our footprint in Africa, we employ 100% local nationals in our offices, 
providing meaningful work and economic opportunity, while also promoting 
gender equality. Through the Kosmos
 
Innovation Center, we're fostering 
innovation in sectors like agriculture, as well as investing in young people, 
who aspire to be entrepreneurs.
 
Turning now to Slide 12, our business principles shape how we manage the 
company. They support strong ESG perf
ormance and a reinforced by 
underlying policy. Some of which are industry leading. For example, Kosmos 
has been at the forefront of contract transparency for nearly a decade, 
commanded by key NGO partners, such as the extractive industries 
transparency ini
tiative. As far as we know, Kosmos is the only oil and gas 
company that published all its petroleum agreements with host countries.
 
In addition, we publish our payments to government to the project level. We 
take these actions, because they're the right th
ing to do. And because we 
believe resource revenues are more likely to be managed, in the best 
interest of citizens, when payments and receipts are made transparently, 
and when you can promote accountability.
 
I share these examples, because I want to show 
you that Kosmos is not 
afraid to be progressive. We're not afraid to be transparent. We are 
committed to bringing a similar approach to how we manage climate change 
risks.
 
On Slide 13, you can see an overview of our climate policy, which has now 
been publi
shed in full on our website. It represents an integrated approach 
to managing climate related risks, but follows the recommendations of the 
Task Force on climate
-
related financial disclosure, or TCSD. The policy is 
fully embedded in our business from the b
oard to day
-
to
-
day operations to 
have an impact, you need the right governance structures, clear 
performance targets, and the plan for eliminating or mitigating emissions, 
engagement and transparency are essential.
 
Slide 14 shows our governance model and t
ransparency commitments. The 
governance structure ensures that climate change gets attention it deserves 
at every level of the company. As part of the governance, we have set 
performance targets links to compensation, a way to hold everyone including 
mysel
f and the rest of my leadership team accountable for delivering on 
climate related initiatives.
 
Regarding transparency, we have made several commitments to help 
shareholders better understand the work we're doing. In addition to 
submitting data to CDP agai
n this year, we will publish our first climate risk 
and resilience report that expands upon the information we share today and 
aligns with TCSD recommendations, and Salisbury guidelines. To provide 
broader information about our ESG related activities, it a
lso published a 
comprehensive sustainability report that builds on our historic disclosures in 
an easily accessible format.
 
Turning now to slide 15, I want to talk about how we look at our current 
portfolio through a climate lens first, from a Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 
perspective. Kosmos is well positioned to thrive during the energy transition. 
The portfolio is built on a foundation of advantaged oil and gas, both low 
cost and at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of carbon intensity in 
production. A ready 
[ph] barrel of oil or cubic foot of gas is the same and are 
the better than most. The low carbon future advantaged oil and gas will be 
the first to be purchased and the last to be shut in.
 
The chart on the left shows how our oil producing assets in the Gul
f of 
Mexico, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea compares to the global average in 
terms of carbon intensity. In particular, I want to point out the 
competitiveness of the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico versus the Permian. Based 
on an expert third party analysis of publ
ic data, carbon intensity is twice as 
high in the Permian basin compared to the Gulf of Mexico. The advantage 
stems from the natural aquifer drive which requires no gas or water 
injection, and the abundance of existing and available infrastructure, no 
rout
ine flaring and no fracking.
 
The chart on the right shows how the three phase Tortue project compares 
to other notable LNG developments. The project is expected to be at the 
lower end of the carbon intensity scale with future phases benefiting from a 
fleet
 
of renewable power.
 
Slide 16 describes the work we're doing to measure, reduce and mitigate 
emissions from our current portfolio. We calculate our scope 1 and scope 2 
operated emissions and today we announced our goal to achieve carbon 
neutrality for thes
e emissions by 2030 or sooner. The maintenance target 
we will work with our service providers such as drilling and seismic contracts 
will minimize our carbon footprint. Any emissions that cannot be eliminated 
will be mitigated through nature
-
based solution
s.
 
We have more work to do on scope 3 emissions. The first step is to develop 
a trusted methodology for measuring our scope 3 emissions across the value 
chain, particularly the end use of our product. This is challenging for a pure 
upstream company, becaus
e we don't always have clear line of sight into 
where our oil is refined, or how the derivative products are used. 
Nonetheless, we know scope 3 emissions are ultimately the governing 
yardstick if we are to help meet Paris goals. I pledge today that we will
 
provide a plan for addressing them once we have completed the work to 
understand the scale of the issue as it applies to Kosmos.
 
Turning to slide 17, on mitigation we have joined two establish reforestation 
projects, one in Ghana on one located along the 
US Gulf Coast, with carbon 
credits allocated to these projects through an agreement with Shell. In 
addition, and in keeping with our role as an offshore operator, we're putting 
our entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to innovation behind a leading 
edge b
lue carbon initiative. Blue carbon is the ability of tidal wetlands and 
sea grass habitats to capture and store CO2 acting is vast carbon sinks.
 
We're investing in a Louisiana company Tierra Resources, which is at the 
forefront of wetlands restoration, and
 
blue carbon markets. Tierra runs a 
project that redirects treated municipal wastewater on 850 acres of project 
lands accelerating tree growth and soil carbon sequestration, supporting 
biodiversity and increasing coastline resilience. Tierra has also devel
oped a 
novel approach to quantifying the benefits of restoration activity, proving its 
impact on climate change.
 
The sequestration capability of blue carbon still needs to be fully recognized. 
This is precisely the kind of innovative thinking required to t
ackle climate 
change. With our strong above ground expertise, owned by the Kosmos 
Innovation Center and other initiatives we're planning to support the 
expansion in this groundbreaking work to other areas along the U.S. Gulf 
Coast, and other countries wher
e we operate.
 
Slide 18 describes the way we're fully integrating climate risk into our overall 
business strategy through scenario analysis. There's no universal 
methodology for climate scenario analysis and approaches continues to 
evolve. In Kosmos, we've 
developed a reverse process supported by a 
leading independent sustainability firm and with guidance from climate 
experts across industry, the investment community and civil society.
 
In our climate modeling, we looked at the ways in which different transit
ions 
to a low carbon economy could impact the value of our assets. We've 
selected three external publicly available scenarios outlined in the 
International Energy Agencies 2018 World Energy Outlook as the basis for 
our analysis, including a sub two degree 
scenario aimed at delivering the 
Paris goals.
 
The Independent Sustainability Advisor critical resource model how the 
transitions outlined under each of these scenarios would impact three value 
drivers, hydrocarbon prices, country risk and fiscal take. Thes
e value drivers' 
changes in hydrocarbon prices have the biggest impact on valuations. 
However, we recognize that energy transition will have other effects. We 
therefore incorporated two additional factors country risk and fiscal take in 
the countries where
 
we operate into our scenario analysis.
 
Important to note that the purpose of these scenarios is to better 
understand the relative impacts on our portfolio and these are not company 
asset forecasts.
 
Slide 19 shows the potential impacts that the climate sce
narios could have 
on the net present value, or NPV of our assets, thereby testing the resilience 
of our portfolio to climate risk. So what did we learn? First, our portfolio is 
resilient, under the sustainable development scenario, at sub two degree 
world 
all of our current projects remain strongly NPV positive. This reflects 
the climate resilient portfolio that can continue to meet global energy 
demand.
 
Second, our oil assets which are generally short dated see very limited 
impact in their NPVs. Our Gulf o
f Mexico and Ghana assets see almost no 
value erosion. Both assets are relatively short
-
dated; the Gulf of Mexico 
having fast paybacks and Ghana having license expiry in the mid
-
2030s.
 
Third, country risk and fiscal take in the different climate scenarios 
may 
have some impact. Our Equatorial Guinea asset could face greater potential 
value erosion in Ghana despite a similar production line given the greater 
dependency of Equatorial Guinea on oil revenues.
 
Fourth, our Mauritania Senegal LNG assets provide cleaner sources of energy 
into the long term. The NPV of our Mauritania Senegal assets is impacted to 
some degree under the sustainable development scenario as a result of the 
asset's longevity. However, th
e impact is not significant, largely because 
natural gas is recognized in these scenarios to be a key energy source for 
meaning global energy demand over the medium term.
 
Fifth, long
-
dated oil exploration faces significant value erosion, and 
experiences th
e greatest value impact under the scenarios. This exercise has 
led to strategic decisions regarding our portfolio as noted on slide 20. In the 
immediate future, we will continue to meet current demand for oil through 
short cycle infrastructure led explorat
ion in the proven base into the Gulf of 
Mexico and Equatorial Guinea, because new discoveries in these areas can 
be tied back to existing assets on accelerated timelines at low cost with 
lower overall carbon intensity in production.
 
To remain relevant thro
ugh the energy transition, we intend to increase the 
gas weighting in our portfolio with exposure to around 5 million tons per 
annum of LNG net Kosmos, versus 3 million tons per annum if we sold down 
to 10% across the Mauritania Senegal basin. To achieve t
his we plan to 
partially monetize other Mauritania Senegal assets in order to fund them 
with a larger interest in the Torture development.
 
As I said earlier, I believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition, 
and therefore retaining a larger
 
interest in Torture is the right thing to do. It 
has all the characteristics of a successful LNG project, cost competitive, 
lower carbon intensity is set to begin production at the right time in the 
market.
 
In addition, we will not pursue new basin openin
g oil exploration. We have a 
strong portfolio of frontier opportunities in Namibia, South Africa, Sao Tome, 
Equatorial Guinea and Suriname. We will efficiently test these opportunities, 
but not seek access to new frontier oil basins.
 
In essence, we'll use 
our short dated oil production to finance move towards 
medium to long
-
term natural gas projects, all while delivering shareholder 
returns. We believe these portfolio decisions meet both our financial duties 
to our shareholders, and Kosmos' purpose and resp
onsibilities to all 
stakeholders.
 
On slide 21, to summarize this section before moving on. Kosmos has a role 
to play in the energy transition. And our approach will bring innovation and 
new technologies to the challenge. We're responding fully to the UN 
Su
stainable Development Goals by providing affordable and cleaner sources 
of energy and investment to fuel economic growth in less advantaged 
countries. We have a clear policy on managing climate
-
related risk with 
board level oversight and executive accounta
bility.
 
It's our goal to achieve Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality for our 
operated emissions by 2030 or sooner, including by developing innovative 
nature
-
based carbon capture projects. We are committed to measuring and 
addressing Scope 2 emissions. We
 
will publish later this year, a TCSD 
aligned climate risk and resilience report that is consistent with our 
transparent approach to doing business.
 
We have completed a robust risk analysis resulting in actions to continue to 
expand our short cycle ILX por
tfolio, increase natural gas weight in our 
portfolio and stop seeking access to new frontier oil basins. With that 
purpose and strategic direction for the company, I'm now allowed to look at 
our activity set for 2020 and the associated targets.
 
Turning to 
slide 23, which is our forecasted production by geography for 
2020. Company
-
wide our production range for the year is 62,000 to 70,000 
barrel oil equivalent per day or 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at 
the midpoint. In Ghana, as you're aware, the
 
operator published initial 2020 
guidance last year following a change in senior management. Since then, 
we've worked with the operator to address the issues outlined in their 
December press release and we're making good progress.
 
At Jubilee, the fundament
al issue is that oil production is limited by the 
associated gas rate. The first step, we've taken to increase the oil rate is the 
gas handling expansion project, which was successfully completed in early 
February and has enabled higher gas throughput. Dai
ly production levels 
around 90,000 barrels of oil per day now been achieved. Work is also 
underway to increase the reliability of gas compressors, which should enable 
us to continue producing at this rate.
 
As we increase the gas production capacity, we als
o need to focus on 
lowering the gas oil ratio or GOR of the reservoir to further enhance the oil 
rate. We're tackling this on two fronts and are making good progress. First, 
improving the reliability of the water injection pumps, which increases the 
voidag
e replacement and provide the necessary pressure support needed to 
lower the field wide GOR. Second, increase the gas off take from the field by 
working with the government to ensure more Jubilee gas is used for 
domestic power consumption.
 
In addition, we 
have a rig contract the first six months of the year in Ghana, 
and expect to add one producer and two water injection wells in Jubilee, 
which should further support field performance. As we highlighted in our 
recent reserves press release, the underlying r
eservoir performance of 
Jubilee has been strong. So resolving the facility issues to drive better 
performance remains our priority.
 
On TEN, we're currently drilling a producer well on Ntomme which should 
increase production when it comes online in April. A
t Enyenra, we're working 
with the operator to understand the water injection response to the reservoir 
to optimize the location of wells post 2020. As a result, we estimate 
production rates from Ghana in 2020, at 27,000 to 29,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent 
per day net to Kosmos. The lower end of our range encompasses 
the operator's December guidance.
 
In the Gulf of Mexico production remains strong setting a new record in the 
fourth quarter with a tie in a Gladden Deep and Nearly Headless Nick. We're 
currentl
y drilling an info world in Kodiak which we expect to come online in 
early 3Q. Our forecasts range for the GOM in 2020 is 24,000 to 28,000 
barrel of oil equivalent per day.
 
In Equatorial Guinea we're currently working through the upgrade of the 
Okume facil
ities required for Phase 2 of our ESP program, which we 
anticipate will begin in 4Q. Later this year, we plan to drill our first two in fill 
wells as part of Yakaar program that will likely continue into 2021. Net 
production for the year is expected to be 
11,000 to 13,000 barrel oil 
equivalent per day.
 
Turning to slide 24, I'd now like to focus on our ILX portfolio in the GOM and 
EG starting with the Gulf of Mexico. As previously communicated, we expect 
to drill three ILX wells in 2020 and five high graded 
prospects beginning 
midyear. Spencer and Tiberius are two prospects in Keathley Canyon within 
tie back of the Lucious Spar that could potentially be drilled with a single 
well.
 
Spencer will test the Pliocene prospects, while Tiberius will test the Deeper 
W
ilcox prospect. We have also high graded the Zora, Honey Ryder and 
Highland Rim. Zora and Honey Ryder on Miocene amplitudes in the new mini 
basin adjacent to Odd Job field. Highland Rim is also another Miocene 
amplitude in tie back range of Devil's Tower. 
All of these prospects share 
similar financial characteristics, tie backs to existing infrastructure resulting 
in high return fast payback projects.
 
Turning to Slide 25, this looks to the depth of the portfolio we built in the 
GOM since the acquisition. Th
rough a combination of lease sales and farm
-
in 
activity Kosmos now has 23 prospects across 71 blocks or approximately 
375 million barrels oil equivalent of net unrisked resource in total. To put 
that in context, this resource potential compares to around 8
0 million barrels 
of met 2P reserves we currently have booked. At Deep Hopper the 
opportunity amounts to over five years of future drilling inventory, at three 
to four wells a year. We will continue to pursue attractive opportunities in 
future lease rounds
, where we continue to experience low levels of 
competition.
 
Turning to slide 26, maybe now to Equatorial Guinea. Following the S
-
5 
discovery now named Asam, we are advancing the development concept and 
integrating well results and the final seismic volume
s into our models. Then 
half year we are focused on optimizing the development concept. Asam was 
our first ILX target, identified from a fast track portion of the new seismic 
across all of our blocks in EG. In March, we expect delivery of the final PSDM 
se
ismic volumes, and there are several leads that have been identified, as 
you can see on the map on this slide. Through 2020, we will continue to 
analyze this data and high grade ILX opportunities ahead of drilling as early 
as 2021.
 
Turning to slide 27, pos
t the successful exploration appraisal campaign 
2019, Kosmos now has three very distinctive and material assets in 
Mauritania and Senegal. Tortue is currently under development, is on track 
to deliver the first gas in the first half of 2022. In 2020, we ex
pect to move 
the project to around 70% completion by year end.
 
The Yakaar/Teranga hub is in the appraisal phase and we expect to begin 
pre
-
feed work on the Phase 1 domestic gas scheme during the year. Birallah 
is the newest of the three hubs with around 50
 
TCF of gas in place now 
derisked, with the Orca
-
1 success. BP Kosmos and SMH PM [ph] will begin 
appraisal activity in 2020.
 
As I discussed earlier in the presentation, our position in the world class 
Mauritania and Senegal gas basin, a source of low cost,
 
lower carbon LNG, is 
core to the strategy of the company. And we've decided to retain a greater 
interest in the Tortue project. We still have more gas resource than a 
company of our size can develop and we're focusing on monetizing either a 
smaller portio
n of Tortue or a larger portion the remainder of our Mauritania 
Senegal portfolio, to fund the increased interest in Tortue with a goal to 
deliver a self
-
funded long
-
term source of cash flow to the company.
 
With the right portfolio management, we believe w
e can retain close to the 5 
million tons per annum while keeping the balance sheet of the company 
protected. It's worth remembering the fundamental characteristics of an LNG 
project. Once they are on stream they deliver reliable very good cash flow 
for man
y years, which provides a solid foundation for the company. Each 
additional 1 million ton per annum of LNG post development could deliver 
free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million dollars per year for 20 plus 
years.
 
Buyer interest in the three assets 

process of sharing the data required for the 2019 exploration appraisal 
activity. Buyer pool includes end users utilities and super majors.
 
Slide 28 looks at our basin opening exploration portfolio, which includes w
ell 
defined quality exploration opportunities in promising basins, Sao Tome and 
Principe, in our Equatorial Guinea, Namibia and Suriname. Our objective is 
to test these basins with key wells in 2020
-
2021, ensuring our capital is 
used efficiently.
 
In 4Q 202
0, we expect to drill the Jaca prospect in Block VI offshore Sao 
Tome and Principe. Jaca is a four way prospect, which is the ABO support 
and it's one of several similar prospects in the area. Our partners in the well 
are Shell following their recent farm 
in in GOM and the National Oil 
Company.
 
We then plan to drill in Namibia and Suriname in 2021. In Namibia we are 
partnered with Shell and NAMCOR and we have several cretaceous prospects 
in PEL 39 where Kosmos has a 45% working interest. We're working with 
our partners to finalize our drilling plans in 2021. In Suriname where we're 
partnered with Hess and Chevron, we're encouraged by Apache's recent 
success in the Block to the South. There are several other important wells 
being drilled in neighboring blocks
 
during 2020, which will provide important 
data points as we high grade the prospect for drilling in 2021.
 

potential in these three basins is over 6 billion barrels 
equivalent. The 
strategic challenge is to ensure that with success, these resources can be 
developed in an accelerated timeline with low cost and low carbon.
 
Turning to slide 29 which looks to the capital plan for the year, as we've 
done in previous years,
 
this slide sets out the CapEx breakdown by 
geography and by expenditure time. The capital expenditure budget for the 
base business i.e., excluding Mauritania and Senegal is $325 million to $375 
million and will be primarily focused on maintaining the exis
ting production 
base, with growth coming from ILX. As a result, we would expect free cash 
flow pre
-
dividends of $150 million to $200 million at $60 Brent in 2020.
 
In Mauritania Senegal, total CapEx during the year after [ph] 30% working 
interest is expecte
d to be around $250 million, which is second half weighted 
after we've used up the BP development carry. We expect to fund this CapEx 
from proceeds from one of the previously discussed farmout transactions.
 
Turning to slide 30, the guidance for the year, w
e have split the 2020 
guidance into current quarter and full year guidance as we've done in the 
past. I don't plan on covering everything on the slide but one aspect I would 
like to mention is the timing of cargos. We expect 10 Ghana cargos in total 7 
from
 
Jubilee and 3 from Sen [ph] and 4.5 from EG.
 
That concludes today's presentation. So to summarize on slide 31, Kosmos 
performed well in 2019 with safe operations and strong cash delivery. We're 
integrating climate risk into our strategy and see the energy
 
transition as a 
major opportunity for a progressive companies like Kosmos to play a role in 
achieving the Paris goals and be part of the solution. And finally, we see 
2020 as another year of strategic progress for the company underpinned by 
strong free ca
sh flow delivery.
 
Thank you and I now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the 
session for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of 
Charles Meade with Johnson
 
Rice. Please proceed with your question.
 
Charles Meade
 
Good morning, Andy to you and your team there.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Good morning, Charles.
 
Charles Meade
 
I want to just go clarify something you said in your in your prepared 
comments and I just want to see 
if you would elaborate a little bit more on 
it. So I get that you're not going to sell the full 
--
 
the 20% targeted working 
interested at least in this Tortue LNG but you did identify the possibility that 
you may would sell some smaller portion and I wonde
r if you could kind of 
confirm that's the right interpretation and then help us understand how 
you're making the decision about how much you're going to sell in this 
Tortue of LNG.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes, thanks Charles. If you look at the assets that we've got
 
in Mauritania 
and Senegal we have three distinct assets at different stages of their 
maturation. We got the project going in Tortue, phase one going well first 
gas targeted for '22, Phase 2 and 3 to follow. We then got an appraisal 
project in Senegal, Yak
aar/Teranga had success with the appraisal of the 
Yakaar and we have a concept being worked for early gas to power 
supporting the government's transition to allow a common future. And 
ultimately we have Orca, which is the third, which is another world clas
s LNG 
opportunity.
 
So three hubs and if you took our to 30% share, 10 million tons, you've got 
around 10 million tons of potential. Ultimately we believe something about 
half that size is the right size for Kosmos around 5 million tons. And we're 
weighting
 
that to the projects that are going to sort of deliver earlier cash 
flows, which would be a slightly higher weighting in Tortue.
 
So the sell down process is proceeding well. We've got sort of three distinct 
assets. They each have different optionality for
 
buyers. And I think it's a 
combination of a different attributes to the assets has broadened the buyer 
pool for us and it gives us the optionality as Kosmos to tune the portfolio 
into one which we believe is ultimately the best for our shareholders.
 
So th
at's the process that we're going through. And we feel good about 
building a future for Kosmos, which has these core LNG assets at its heart.
 
Charles Meade
 
Got it, and then if we could talk about the not seeking to enter new oil 
basins, is this is it right
 
to think about this as a kind of implicitly a call on 
your part or on the part of the company that the economics ultimately even 
though LNG is 
--
 
spot LNG is weak now, but ultimately economics of LNG 
developments are going to be important more attractive 
than oil 
developments.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, that's absolutely the point we're making and I think it's written by sort 
of two drivers. I think we, as you saw in the presentation we have done a lot 
of work to conform with the CKD requirements to understand cl
imate risk. 
And we're putting out a full report later in the year. But what it 
fundamentally sort of centers, if you see a world where you can see peak oil 
demand, ultimately, you're facing a world where the margin for oil is going 
to be challenged. I thin
k the world for gas is different. I think you're going to 
see growing demand.
 
And I think it's quite interesting that Shell went out with their presentation, I 
think last week they talked about the doubling for 
--
 
doubling of LNG 
demand in the next 20 year
s. And if you think about the length of time it 
takes to get to an LNG project going, I think that's a very simple significant 
prognosis. So the world of oil is going to be driven by things that are 
ultimately low cost. They have to be low carbon in that p
roduction, but also 
short cycle things where you know, you can get your money back. And that's 
where we're going to focus on our exploration and we've got a really good 
portfolio.
 
We believe in a long term demand for gas that is resilient, but actually lot
s 
of gas in the world. So, you've got to be low cost and low carbon to 
compete. And ultimately, the challenge is around in that frontier oil base and 
if you are sort of entering it, trying to get access today. You shoot a seismic, 
you ultimately get to som
ething where you have an exploration success, 
maybe by the middle of this decade. Then you go through the project phase 
and near the end of the decade, significant infrastructure and clients you 
have to enumerate and pay back in a world where there is marg
in pressure.
 
So this is fundamentally about where we believe we can allocate capital 
deliver the best returns for our, for our shareholders. And in the broader 
sense for all stakeholders, it is about playing our role to a transition 
supporting a lower carb
on will, ultimately you will need more renewables 
and more gas.
 
Charles Meade
 
Got it. Thank you. That's the detail I was looking for.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Right. Thanks, Charles.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with 
Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little about the contingency planning? 
I'm thinking particularly if Brent is in 60 and if the farm out proceeds don't 
arrive, how do you balance the call
 
on CapEx against cash flow?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes, so the first contingency plan is over around hedging off. So, we've got 
60% of our 2020 production hedged at $4.59. So 
---
 
about 20% of 2021 
slightly higher around 60. Yes. So we've actually got a very well h
edged 
position, which allows us, to manage what I think is an uncertain future at 
the moment in terms of oil price volatility.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And then in terms of the farm out proceeds not arriving?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think it's a question of timing, and it. We
're working hard through the 
process at the moment, we've got a number of options that are out there. 
So, the contingency it's all about, the pace of the various other various 
options. So we remain optimistic that we've got enough options there to be 
able 
to deliver the outcome that we're forecasting.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Okay, I guess my sense of contingency planning is what happens when the 
optimistic view doesn't occur. So in the case where the call on CapEx is $250 
million, but free cash flow is $150 million to
 
$260 million. Do you use the 
balance sheet, you use debt, how do you square those two?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes, ultimately we have to pull back on it. We've done an awful lot to repair 
the balance sheet over the last couple of years. So, liquidity sits at over 
$800 million. So we've got the balance sheet strength, we remove your time 
to get it down to around 1.8. So ultimately, we Got the full box option of the 
balance sheet if we have to, but ultimately it is about ensuring that we can 
move through with the sel
l down processes and move forward on that basis.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Okay, great. Thank you for that.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
All right. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Round with BMO 
Capital Markets. Please proceed with your ques
tion.
 
David Round
 
Hi, Andy. Thanks for the presentation. Just got a couple on West Africa and 
the first one at Jubilee. I think you talked about plans to try and maintain 
production matter around current levels, which would be a pretty good 
outcome given w
here guidance has gone through, but I was just interested 
in the dynamic with the operator. Particularly at the moment, given the 
leadership changes there and your ability to actually do a lot of the work you 
actually want to do and you talked about earlie
r?
 
And maybe the second one, just to follow
-
up on the sell down process, I 
think, you've said the preferences for Tortue is around access to the near
-
term cash flows. But have you seen significant different levels of interest for 
each hub and there's somet
hing like there are others hiring place number 
make it a more attractive and marketable asset?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes, good. Thanks, David. I'll take two questions starting off with Tortue. 
Clearly, there's been a lot of change, changing the senior leadership, 
they've 
obviously announced significant downsizing and new people and post 
actually have many levels within. So I think, overall, we actually see the 
change in organization and in a positive way. The conversations that we've 
had over the last couple of mon
ths have allowed, I think, real progress to be 
made on the agenda that we've outlined and on Jubilee it's pretty simple 
agenda.
 
It's literally get more water in the ground to lower the GOR. It's about 
ensuring that you can handle a higher gas 
capacity and the project to the 
bottleneck, the tank system was successfully executed earlier this month. 
And then they sort of work with the government to take more gas out of the 
system. But overall, I feel as though there's real progress been made. And 
feel that the approach, the Tortue taken, it's pretty pragmatic and 
addressing the right issues.
 
When it comes to Tortue and the broader conversation around the sell
-
down 
of the assets, I think, as you rightly said, they're very different. And I think, 
one
 
of the challenges we had when we had the initial marketing was that we 
actually haven't had the success with the appraisal of Tortue or the appraisal 
of Yakaar or the exploration's successive.
 
So you've got three very distinct assets and I think breaking 
it out in three 
packages has allowed us to have very different conversations, or some that 
the looking at the exploration potential and the sort of long dated nature and 
the asset and the exploration upside. Now, there was an act of Deeper Act in 
play and 
Birallah of the week that's yet to be tested. So though there are 
options that certain players are looking for. Others are looking for a near
-
term source of LNG production, which sort of brings you to the Tortue about.
 
So I think, overall, we would start 
-
-
 
I would say that the sell down process, 
because of the different attributes and the assets is 
--
 
it has been 
--
 
has 
actually been being strengthened, because of the distinct buying 
requirements, of the different people that are involved.
 
And I think the 
other thing I would say has changed massively as we've 
gone through the process is. from an ESG perspective, the world is actually 
pretty different a year off from when we started and I think a greater 
alignment around the role of renewables and gas will p
lay in the future is 
causing a different conversation as well.
 
David Round
 
Okay. Thanks Andy. I appreciate it.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with 
Capital One Securities. Please proc
eed with your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations to Tom and Neal. Andy, 
when you look at the total company production profile until Tortue Phase 1 
arrives, do you look at it as kind of a flattish production level simil
ar to 
2020?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
No, we see growth coming from the ILX, opportunities, and we've seen 
growth, actually in the Gulf of Mexico. When we took the asset on it was 
doing slightly less than 25,000 barrels a day, we're forecasting in a range, 
up to 28,00
0 barrels a day for this year. So, and that come from the tie back 
the initial successes that we have in Gladdens and Nearly Headless today. 
So, these things are relatively fine time to production.
 
So, in terms of the medium term, the growth is going to co
me from ILX 
success. So we've got a three well program in the second half of 2020 in the 
Gulf of Mexico. We got the work that we're doing on the Asam discovery in 
Equatorial Guinea, that coming on, and then also in Equatorial Ghana we've 
got a program even
tful wells supported by the ESP.
 
So I think the growth in the near term is going to come through from those 
short dated, faster payback, ILX development type opportunities. And then 
you have the growth coming in from the start of Tortue phase 1.
 
Richard Tu
llis
 
Okay, that's helpful. So, the way to look at his growth in 2021 and kind of 
flattish in 2020?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think, not actually in 2020, I think that's the guidance that was given today 
is for obviously 2020. And then growth thereafter.
 
Richard Tull
is
 
Okay, and then I'm going back once again to the form down process. What 
are you looking at for the near term milestones? I mean, when do you think 
you might be able to announce something definitive there?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
All right. I'm not going to box my
self and sort of negotiate in a way where I 
set myself false deadlines that I have to make the next level market. We're 
clearly focused on the outcome, which is to ensure that we deliver what we 
need to deliver to deliver the cash outcome for 2020 and that
's the goal.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Okay, that's fine. Thank you.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with 
Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Thanks for 
taking the question. You talked about hoping for gas for the local 
economy in Senegal. Just to clarify what percentage of the Tortue project 
output will be going into the domestic market? And do you have a sense of 
what the pricing on that will be?
 
Andrew 
Inglis
 
Yes, the Tortue 2 is relatively minor it's 35 million tons a cubic feet will go to 
Mauritania. 35 million tons a cubic feet will go to Senegal, and any other 
pricing will be driven by the uptake pricing from LNG, but it is a very, very 
small 
percentage of the revenue stream very small.
 
Ultimately what you're looking to do in the future is Mauritania is a relatively 
small country, population 4 million. If power demands are relatively low and 
so a 35 million square feet gives them a significant 
base load of gas power, 
where they can display the current diesel in the power station [ph], but then 
actually link that to a solar fee and a wind fee, which provides then a very 
quick and rapid transition to a cleaner powered economy. But they start 
from 
the place of having a very low population base today which means that 
the physical quantity is quite small.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
But one more question on the ESG strategy to get to that net zero by 2030, 
do you plan to use carbon capture at any of your operatio
ns?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes, no, what we're going to use is nature based solutions, which is what we 
--
 
what I talked about in the presentation part. So we [indiscernible] and 
used the Scope 1and scope 2 definition operated activities about 8,000 tons 
of Co2 equ
ivalent in 2019. That's driven primarily by using other methods of 
capture. So nature based versions of the ones we are going to focus on, 
why, because we are actually, they have a broader ESG impact in the 
countries in which 
--
 
we got a reforestation proj
ects in Ghana, there are 
reforestation projects in Gold Coast.
 
And they employ people, they provide investments, they improve the local 
environment. So those are things that we are focused on. And we are also in 
stages, with the blue carbon approach we're 
taking to restoration in the Gulf 
of Mexico is a really 
--
 
another really novel of product, which has broader 
applications. So it's how do we pull those technologies, emerging technology 
together with our operating footprint and we're confident that we can
 
get to 
net zero on an operative basis by 2030 or sooner.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, thank you very much.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilson with 
Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ma
rk Wilson
 
Hi, good afternoon. And my question is I'd like to just go back towards 
where we were last year in the CMD and there was three longer term or 
medium
-
term outlooks, put out the 8% to 10% growth in production $1 
billion free cash flow at $60 Brent 
to 2021. And a target leverage at between 
1 to 1.5 times. Now there's been a lot of things that have gone very well this 
year, arguably. Ghana is the only non
-
operate position that is 
--
 
has really 
been the backward step. So I just like to know where those
 
three, 2021 
targets stand and is it only Ghana that has been the change, if indeed there 
has been a change.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes, I think when you look back at that market, a lot of change. I think in 
terms of 
--
 
when we were talking about [indiscernible], w
e were talking 
about only holding 10% of our vertical position in Mauritania. So I think 
we're targeting holding a larger amount. I think the ultimate sort of rate of 
growth in a production sense, which is dependent on the growth of the 
portfolio coming in
 
from Mauritania and Senegal is unchanged.
 
I think probably the front end is slightly flatter, which is ultimately around 
the pace of the ILX delivery in the Gulf of Mexico. So I think, if you were to 
look at the list of things that you've raised. I think 
absolutely Ghana is less 
than we'd anticipated in that. I think it's 
--
 
we're headed in the right 
direction and we need to demonstrate the delivery from the operator. But I 
believe it's headed in the right direction. And I think the other delta will just 
b
e the individual phasing of the ILX projects.
 
Mark Wilson
 
Okay. Thank you. If I could follow
-
up to ask you about the carbon neutrality 
target, a very ambitious target by 2030 puts you at the forefront of such 
targets, I'd say on a timeline. Could we ask ab
out a capital commitment that 
might be required with investments into these natural solutions? And could 
you tell us what the actual investment in shared resources is?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes, thank you. Look at it overall, yes, Kosmos benefits from having a 
rel
atively small operate footprint. So from that Scope 1 to Scope 2 
perspective, say about 80,000 tons of CO2 equivalent in 2019. And it will 
vary depending on the quantum of drilling this pursuit. But with efficiency 
drives, plus the investments in the natur
e
-
based capture solutions, we've 
got a very clear plan on how we get to carbon neutrality by 2030 or sooner. 
And the investment levels are less than $5 million per annum together. 
That's the level of expansion we would envisage in the nature based 
solution
s.
 
Mark Wilson
 
Got it. Okay. And is that the level you've invested to
-
date?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
It is, no, we're ramping up to be fair. We have a 
--
 
I'd say that look 2020 
will be the first year of actual dollars into a nature based solution.
 
Mark Wilson
 
Got 
it. Okay. Okay. And then lastly, if I may, just one last question on 
Ghana. I just like to know about the production levels at the moment at 
90,000 [ph]. Clearly, that means there's a gas solution getting a lot more 
sustainable. I'm just wondering how the 
offtake scenario 
--
 
offtake levels of 
gas, of course, the FPSO work, I've been to look through to 2020 or is it a 
case that the government has given a greater flexibility to flaring?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, now there's a lot going in Ghana. As I said, I think 
we're headed in the 
right direction. What they 
--
 
with the operator successfully done the capacity 
expansion, which allows you to flow more gas through the system, there are 
some other operational issues that are going on in the first quarter but not 
assoc
iated direct with our operations that are picking operation of the 
Western gas pipeline, and then there's also a plant shut down at the gas 
plant.
 
So as you go through those operational issues, they do affect the ability of 
the government to obtain the gas
. So the government has given a 
dispensation for flaring while those issues are going on. And then the other 
item which the operators, I think taking the right approach is now we 

overstressed 
the rest of the system and so the focus now is on the reliability 
of the gas compression.
 
So you you're right to point out that the cost of flaring this concession is 
high with the gas rates but our objective is to establish 
--
 
once all the 
maintenance and
 
so on is done onshore to 
--
 
and system is fully reestablish 
that the government will actually increase the gas offtake rates.
 
Mark Wilson
 
Thank you very much.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great, thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Al Sta
nton with RBC. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes, good afternoon, guys. Can I just try and nail down some numbers in 
terms of the tortue costs and carrier and make sure that I've understood 
what you mean by post BP carry. So I'll give you m
y understanding and then 
you can correct me. So the way I understand it is that your $500 million 
carry from BP will be used up by the middle of the year, and then you're 
going to spend $250 million in the second half. So assuming even spending 
across 2020
, that's your investment 30% on Tortue is $500 million. And 
then if that's right, how complete will the project be, at the end of this year, 
given it started at 25%? What will it be and what should we be expecting in 
terms of spending in 2021.
 
Andrew Ingli
s
 
Yeah, you got the numbers about right. So if you think about it on a post BP 
carrier runs out about mid
-
year, and our exposure of full 30% is around 
$250 million. And at that point, the projects is about 70% complete.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay, fine, so I can do t
he other math between now and then.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
You do the math.
 
Al Stanton
 
And then if I can just ask this second question, can you see the three 
projects in Mauritania and Senegal, competing with each other and would 
you be happy to have different stak
es in competing projects?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, we will. And I don't think they compete. It's quite interesting. I think 
in Mauritania, there's work to be done in terms of fully describing the 
potential of the hub, the exploration that will take place. So th
at is kind of 
the focus there, how did you leverage the learnings from Tortue to sort of 
carry that forward?
 
Ultimately, in Senegal, you have a project where you will bring forward a 
domestic gaskey in accordance with the Senegal Sao Tome which is 
ultimately about how do they tie in a very different population base to 
Mauritania. So I think they're going to be driven by the individual needs of 
the country, rather than competing as individual projects. They're all good 
investments in themselves, and 
will be driven by an aligned view of how the 
countries want to take them forward.
 
So I think at the end of the day, when you look at it from that perspective, 
having different percentages into different pieces is absolutely feasible. 
You're not going to be
 
in a situation where one is being held to ransom for 
the other project to go ahead. It isn't going to work like that. They have 
very different agendas being driven by ultimately, the different colonies of 
the countries and how they want to see their road 
resources develop.
 
Al Stanton
 
Cool, thank you.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great thanks Al.

Good day everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's First Quarter 2017 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, 
let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance and 
Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator and thanks all of you for joining us today. This morning, 
we issued our releases regarding our first quarter earnings as well as the 
Yakaar
-
1 well results, which are available on the Investors page of the 
kosmosenergy.
com website. We anticipate filing our 10
-
Q for the first 
quarter of 2017 with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; Brian Maxted, Chief Exploration Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief 
Financia
l Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with the forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in 
our earnings relea
se and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain the non
-
GAAP financial measures in our 
discussion. Management believes such measures are important in looking at 
the Company's historical and future performance and these are commonly 
referred to indu
stry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to and 
should be read in conjunction with, information contained in our financial 
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our SEC 
filings.

Andrew Inglis
 
Thanks Neal and good morning everyone. Kosmos is off to a strong start in 
2017 and we have been diligently executing our plans to achieve the 
financial and operational objectives we set out at the beginning of the year.
 
In summary, strengt
hen our financial position and deliver explorations 
success. During the first quarter, we continued to generate free cash flow 
and delivered on our promise to reduce leverage, paying down $150 million 
of debt. We're on track to generate $250 million of fre
e cash flow in 2017 at 
just $50 per barrel, we remain one of the few E&P companies generating 
significant free cash flow, keeping Kosmos in a solid financial position.
 
Operationally our work in Mauritania and Senegal is off to a strong, building 
on the pos
itive momentum created by the BP transaction. I work grows on 
the development of Tortue is making good progress, enjoying the course 
that we achieved several important milestone. In late March, we started our 
second phase of exploration drilling ahead of s
chedule on what is one of the 
highest impact exploration programs in the industry over the next 18 
months. With a positive result in Yakaar we announced this morning, we've 
maintained our 100% exploration success rate and are now six for six in the 
basin.
 
Importantly, we are at the front
-
end of an exciting multi well, multi basin 
and exploration program.
 

and then discuss our progress in Mauritania and Senegal.
 

 
call over to Brian, who will provide additional details on 
the Yakaar
-
1 well and its positive implication for the rest of the basin. Lastly, 
Tom will review the financial results of the quarter and our solid financial 
position.
 
Turning to Ghana, which und
erpins our near
-
term production and free cash 
flow growth. At Jubilee revised offloading procedures continue to work as 
planned and our insurance coverages are effectively mitigating the financial 
impact of this year. The FPSO was temporarily spread moored
 
at its current 
heading in late February, which has removed the need for tugboats that 
were previously on station to provide heading control.
 
During the first quarter growth, sales production averaged approximately 
82,500 barrels of oil per day under the r
evised operating procedures. The 
ultimate long
-
term solution remains under evaluation by the partnership. At 
TEN production averaged approximately 50,000 barrels of oil per day over 
the first quarter is on track to meet the operators 2017 guidance. High 
pr
oduction level have been achieved for periods throughout the quarter, as 
the partnership continues to optimize facility throughput and oil production.
 
I'll now turn to Mauritania and Senegal operations where we continue to 
have exploration success and wher
e we remained focused on advancing the 
Tortue gas development. In late March, we began a multi
-
well exploration 
program that will have some of the largest prospects banks identified by the 
industry in the last several years.
 

our first well in the series Yakaar
-
1 has 
made a major gas discover. Reaffirming our view that the basin holds 
significant prospectivity and will continue to grow.
 
While Brian will review the specifics relating to the well, there are several 
important take
aways I want to highlight. Firstly, approximate Pmean 20 Tcf 
of gas discovered between Yakaar and Teranga, create the opportunity for a 
second cost competitive LNG hub in Senegal in addition to the Tortue 
development. Second, Yakaar
-
1 further derisked the 
key play element of the 
basin for fan fairway demonstrate the play contact works. Although the 
industry perception was that degradation of reservoir might be expected as 
we journey further outboard, to think highly porous and permeable 
reservoirs encounter
ed at Yakaar prove otherwise. In addition the proven 
effectiveness of the seal and trap provides an important positive read
-
through for our prospectivity in the basin, the bulk of which resides in similar 
basin for fan setting.
 
Third our view of the basin 
underpinned by geologic model remained sound. 
What we found in Yakaar was a gas with similar to what we encountered at 
Tortue and Teranga and within the pre
-
drill uncertainty range based on 
preliminary analysis. Key to this was a higher thermal gradient we
 
encountered at the Yakaar
-
1 location, which we believe is due to increased 
eating in the Yakaar area. Given the size of our entire position, there will be 
a range of outcomes across the acreage, but we remain confident there is a 
combination of oil, liqui
ds and gas to be found on our blocks with a focus on 
liquids and oil in our Northern Mauritania acreage.
 
Fourth, our seismic and AVO tools continue to accurately predict reservoir 
and hydrocarbon as demonstrated by 100% success rate. As we continue 
our sec
ond phase of exploration drilling, this gives us additional confidence 
around our remaining prospectivity and we expect to maintain a high 
success rate as a result of our well calibrated tools.
 
Today and as I told you, the Kosmos/BP partnership remains foc
used on 
delivering a low cost LNG project with FID expected in 2018 and first gas in 
2021. We continue to expect Tortue to be the first development project, 
given we have completed appraisal drilling, the project planning is well 
advanced and a development
 
concept is already been agreed by the 
partnership. The development concept accelerates first gas production and 
its scalable providing the opportunity to add capacity as demand for LNG 
grows.
 
During the first quarter, we achieved several key milestones th
at are 
prerequisite to progressing towards FID. The initial development concept 
envisioned by Kosmos for Tortue, which we achieve to deliver a full cycle 
breakeven for less than $5 per Mcf is now being validated by BP. The 
partnership is also initiated oth
er workflows such as metocean studies as 
well as geotechnical and geophysical work along the proposed pipeline route 
from the field to initialize location, whether midstream liquefaction facilities 
are planned. The design of and the planning for the Tortue
 
drill stem test or 
DST is complete. We expect to mobilize the rigs Tortue in the coming weeks.
 
With this work in advanced stage, we expect the decision on a midstream 
solution in the middle of this year. The partnership also continues to meet 
regularly wi
th the host government and respective NOCs of Mauritania and 
Senegal to progress the intergovernmental cooperation agreements or ICA 
and the unitization agreement. We expect formal speed work to begin later 
this year, post the DST and the approval of the I
CA by both governments. 
After the first quarter ended the partnership structure was further simplified, 
when BP purchased the ownership share of our minority non
-
operated in 
Senegal. This transaction leaves the Kosmos/BP partnership even more 
strategic in 
line on the vision for gas development and exploration 
throughout the basin.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Brian discuss the result of the Yakaar
-
1 well and 
our upcoming exploration program. Brian?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Andy. As Andy mentioned our second p
hase exploration program 
off
-
shore Mauritania and Senegal, which is designed to define and test the 
detached basin floor fan fairways of the airport protection petroleum system 
is progressing well. Indeed Kosmos together with our partner BP is leading 
the 
industry and exploring this emerging deepwater theme along the Atlantic 
margins, so obviously an giant and supergiant prospects.
 
Acquisition of our 3D seismic surveys is now complete and the data at 
various stages of processing. In March, we spud the 
Yakaar
-
1 the first in a 
series of four independent wells that we plan to drill through the first quarter 

-
1 results, as one of the recent 3D 

ions 
specifically and respectively in regard to the further derisking and increasing 
hydrocarbon potential of the basin floor fan fairways, including further north 
in Senegal, a long trend in Mauritania.
 
As a reminder, Yakaar
-
1 was designed test the lake C
retaceous space in 
floor fan approximately 50 kilometers west of the Teranga
-
1 gas discovery. 
The fan comprises a series of extensive amalgamated channelized sending 
any reservoir systems that will seal in formationally and trap those as very 
graphically s
tructurally as well as charge from a deeper build Cretaceous 
Neocomian
-
Valanginian source.
 
As Andy mentioned Yakaar is a significant gas discovery. The well 
encountered a gross 120 meter or 394 feet hydrocarbon column, which 
includes 45 meters or 148 feet 
of net pay. The reservoir comprises three 
stacked high quality channel sands with excellent porosity and permeability. 
Gas water contact was encountered in the lower zone. The reservoirs which 
are ample supported extend over a very large area, approximatel
y 280 
square kilometer in size. Most likely Pmean resource is estimated at 15 Tcf, 
which volumetrically met the pre
-
drill expectation. Indeed the Yakaar
-
1 is 
understood to be the largest hydrocarbon find in the world to date in 2017. 
Preliminary estimates 
based on the fluid pressure grades and a right size 
sample measurements, suggest the gas or the CGR or condensate gas ratio 
in the Tortue to Teranga range.
 
As noted earlier, Teranga
-
1, the Yakaar
-
1 well has discovered a Pmean of 
approximately 20 Tcf of gas
 
in the KR [ph] performing block in Northern 
Senegal and this volume provides the opportunity for a second major 
independent LNG project in the country. We together with BP will now begin 
work on an appraisal plan for the Yakaar discovery. As you may recal
l our 
pre
-
drill hydrocarbon charge model predicted a higher chance of liquids at 
Yakaar. However, as Andy mentioned the well encountered a substantially 
higher geothermal grade than anticipated, which we now make believe 
maybe due to increased heating asso
ciated with the adjacent Dakar across 
the fracture zone or a Cape Verde swell as is evidenced by the 
preponderance of sales intrusions in this part of the basin.
 
This heating has caused the primary and deeper Valanginian cogging source. 
Within the journey 
of the Yakaar
-

sure. Any oil or liquids generated with frac to gas a deck and therefore with 
little or no contribution from the shallow Albian or CT sources, which will 
mature in this faster basin, the result is 
a gas with a lower liquid content.
 
That said and although we can expect the charge model to continue to be 
refined locally as new geological information becomes available, we consider 
it still to be fundamentally sound. Importantly, we now believe that hig
her 
geothermal grade is encountering Yakaar
-
1 will result in the northern part of 
Senegal, having a higher propensity for gas. However, we are of the view 
that the geothermal gradient produces north from the factory zone to 
Mauritania. This is supported by
 
the 10% encountered during clearly in 
board to the north inward to the north, including well being in adjacent to 
our Mauritania acreage.
 
Modeling the same trend in thermal gradient reduction towards the airport 
areas, so the north in Mauritania, then the
 
Valanginian
-
Neocomian into the 
source, may not be exposed to temperatures required to crack oil to gas. 
Allowing for a higher liquid content in the base of floor plan prospects over 
the north in Mauritania. Based on this we remain resolute in our belief i
n the 
oil and liquids and potential, the Cretaceous petroleum system, particularly 
in Mauritania, with the vast majority approximately 75% of our many 
prospects resigned. This is due to the modeling of a less mature deeper, 
Valanginian to Neocomian source 
or coupled with a progressively greater 
contribution from and mixing with the younger Albian and CT sources in 
board.
 
As a sixth exploration in an appraisal well offshore Mauritania Senegal, the 
Yakaar
-
1 discovery maintains 100% success rate, confirming th
e predictive 
powers of 3D seismic view of maybe another tool. Importantly, also further 
derisks from a place standpoint, the ample based on fairways, during our 
first exploration campaign where reservoir presence, thickness and quality 
as well as, our debt
 
trap effectiveness including seal and pin shaft. The 
Yakaar
-
1 well together with the 3D seismic calibration, it provides how to a 
large extent it used all of this play concerns from outboard basin floor fan 
fairways that are focused on that second phase e
xploration drilling program.
 
In addition to further derisking of the outboard basin floor fan fairways we 
believe that hydrocarbon potential can be much could be much larger than 
previously thought. Acquisition of our new 3D seismic, which target outboard 
Mauritania including of Block C8, C13 and C6 and C12, as I mentioned 
earlier is now complete. These early process volumes an interpretation 
products are becoming available.
 
As expected these data of confirming the lease and prospects identified 
previously 
on the regional 2D seismic ad in many cases these prospects are 
significantly larger than originally thought due inpart the greater resolution 
provided by the 3D seismic versus the 2D. Furthermore you prospects 
continue to be identified. A good example of 
one such prospect is 
Hippocampe in the northern part of Block C8 offshore Mauritania. The head 
of count prospect comprises a series of very thick extensive stack basin floor 
fans of Cenomanian and Albian age trapped in a combined structural 
stratographic c
losure and charged by the mixing of hydrocarbons from 
Valanginian to Neocomian and potentially Albian sources.
 
Both reservoir targets are very strong seismic attribute support the 
hydrocarbons including calibration AVO. If a camp has a premium resource 
est
imate of over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. With respect to the 
forward outlook achieve the rig schedule as planned, the next operation will 
be the Tortue Field drill stem test. This is expected to extend through early 
August. Subsequent to this, gi
ven our objective in finding oil and/or liquids, 
we will shift our exploration focus to Mauritania for the charge related factors 
discussed earlier. In this regard, the two reasons, we are considering testing 
the hit the time [ph] immediately following on 
the DST, rather than directly 
on as previously planned.
 
Firstly, Requin requires more time to fully define the material drilling. 
Secondly, because of the more optimal position and potential size of the 
Hippocampe prospects. We will then complete the full 
well second phase 
exploration drilling program with Lamantin and Requin Tigre. However as 
always drilling order is subject to change based among other factors on 
exploration drilling outcomes and ongoing subsurface technical work.
 

 
brief update on the rest of our exploration portfolio, 
where work is ongoing particularly in Suriname and São Tomé to material 
both are is which we regard as oil provinces for the drill
-
ready stage. At a 
time when conventional exploration particularly dee
pwater, as well as, oil 
and gas discoveries are at an all time historic low, Kosmos in typical 
contrarian counter
-
cyclical fashion remains focused on opening the next 
petroleum system. In this regard, we continue to be one of the most active 
explorers toda
y, including in terms of our 3D seismic and drilling. We are in 
the process of shooting over 30,000 square kilometers of 3D this year. This 
represents over 20% of contracted deepwater global 3D acquisition.
 
Offshore Suriname we are currently processing the
 
new 3D seismic acquired 
earlier this year of Block 42 and part of Block 45 in support of going up to 
two wells in Suriname in 2018. Early volumes and interpretation products of 
this new 3D seismic are being received and just as we are seeing in 
Mauritania
 
and Senegal, this is confirming the multi
-
billion barrel potential, 
we previously identified on regional activity.
 
Importantly and very encouragingly based on recent offset drilling including 
both successful, the Sinopec discovery along trend in Guyana an
d the 
unsuccessful, the Kolibrie dry hole Blocks in Suriname, which by the way are 
results we both predicted. We are now able to positively and negatively 
calibrate the 3D seismic attributes including AVO, with these outcomes 
further derisking our key pros
pects. These include Aurora in Block 42, 
Anapai in Block 45, both of which are just very strong and now calibrated 
seismic AVO support for the presence of hydrocarbons.
 
In sales São Tomé, are approximately 16,000 square kilometer 3D area, 
which is the larg

by an operator offshore West Africa is more than 50% complete and is 
expected to finish next quarter.
 
Moreover as one of the few active explorers, we're also learning a new ideas 
are being develo
ped to generate industry leading exploration contexts and 
themes. These create competitive advantage and allow us to execute our 
proven concentrated portfolio arrive with short exploration strategy in 
frontier emerging basins and in so doing replenish and 
hydrate our portfolio 
through active new venture initiatives.
 
So in closing we are very excited about how we are organically building the 
company through deepwater exploration. We continue to significantly grow 
discovered hydrocarbon resource base offshore
 
Mauritania and Senegal with 
100% success rate and the future potential in this very large Cretaceous 
petroleum system continues to increase with new 3D seismic and well 
results.
 
Furthermore, in our efforts towards the new petroleum system, the new 3D 
seis
mic calibrated by recent offset drilling results continue to further derisk 
the prospect invention in Suriname, which really represents a proven play 
extension to the recent industry success in Guyana. Or provide drilling 
opportunities in 2018/2019.
 
In sum
mary, at Kosmos the prospects that are preparing to drill and the 
debt of the portfolio has never been better.
 

first quarter results.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thank you Brian and good morning
 
everyone. A positive free cash flow trend 
continues into 2017 and Kosmos remains focused on improving our already 
solid balance sheet and maintaining our liquidity. At the beginning of the 
year, we announced our plan to generate approximately $250 million
 
of free 
cash flow based on a $50 Brent price and to you use these funds to pay 
down debt and build liquidity. We're delivering on that promise having paid 
down $150 million of debt through the end of March and a further $50 
million to the end of April. An
d are well on our track to reduce our overall 
net to debt to approximately $900 million by the end of the year.
 
At the end of the quarter we have $1.3 billion in total corporate liquidity, 
including capacity on our RBL and RCF facilities, as well as availa
ble cash. 
During the quarter, we completed the semiannual redetermination of our 
borrowing base, which as expected resulted in a decrease of approximately 
$150 million to $1.3 billion. The new borrowing base which is effective April 
1, reduces total liquid
ity to $1.2 billion. The reduction in RBL capacity is 
driven by the remaining production of the lone life under the facility, but is 
more than sufficient for us to run the business. While at the same time, 
reducing undrawn commitment fees and associated in
terest expense. That 
said we plan to extend our facility and add back that liquidity prior to March 
of 2018, the period in which amortization of the current facility commences.
 

crude oil liftings both from Jubilee in line with our guidance given on the 
year
-
end call. This generated first quarter 2017 oil revenues of $103 million, 
excluding $11 million of derivative settlements. When you add a revenue to 
our sell hedges, it reflec
ts the realized price of approximately $58.12 per 
barrel in the first quarter. First quarter revenues were up compared to the 
same quarter in 2016 as a result of higher realized oil prices, as well as, 
reduced production related downtime at Jubilee.
 
During
 
the quarter, we also received $48.5 million of net LOPI proceeds in 
line with guidance. For the first quarter, we generated a net loss of $29 
million of $0.07 per diluted share. Adjusting for the impact of one
-
time items 
that affect comparability includin
g a $38 million mark
-
to
-
market hedging 
gain the company generated a net loss of $43 million or $0.11 per diluted 
share.
 
On the cost side, operating expense for the first quarter was $20 million or 
$10.06 per barrel versus $29 million or $15.50 per barrel i
n the first quarter 
of 2016. For the quarter, this included approximately $16 million in regular 
operating expense and $9 million of costs attributed to the revised operating 
procedures offset by $5 million in insurance recoveries. Exploration expense 
$106
 
million for the first quarter included one
-
time rig related expenses of 
approximately $90 million, which includes the costs associated with the 
stacking of the Atwood Achiever and the catchup payment associated with 
the cancellation of the Atwood Achiever
 
contract extension.
 
In addition, exploration expense included $16 million of ongoing seismic and 
geological and geophysical costs. General and administrative expenses were 
$16 million during the first quarter, slightly down compared to the same 
period in 
2016. The result of lower non
-
cash stock
-
based compensation and 
carried costs as a result of the BP transaction. Depletion and depreciation 
expense for the quarter was $35 million or $17.70 per barrel, a slight 
increase from the prior year period. The resu
lt of a higher depletion rate 
arising from a decrease in Jubilee Field proved reserves in the fourth quarter 
of 2016.
 
Compared to the fourth quarter DD&A decreased by almost $7.50 per barrel 
primarily attributable to lifting only cargoes from 
Jubilee in the first quarter, 
which has a lower depletion rate than the TEN field. Taxes were $22 million 
or approximately $11 per barrel with almost 100% on a differed basis. We 
continue to maintain our strong hedge position and currently our hedge has 
to
taled approximately 11 million barrels with approximately 5 million barrels 
hedged in 2017 with an average floor price of $59 per barrel. And 
approximately 6 million barrels hedged in 2018 with an average floor price 
of $53 per barrel.
 
The company's robust
 
hedging program remains a key component of our 
strategy to protect our cash flows, balance sheet and liquidity. Before I turn 
to guidance, there's one housekeeping note I'd like to address. As a part of 
the first quarter 2017 transaction in Senegal with B
P we assigned our 
interest in our petroleum contracts in Senegal to our affiliate company 
Kosmos BP Senegal Limited or KBSL, a corporate joint venture entity in 
which we own a 50.01% interest. Our investment in KBSL qualifies for the 
equity method of accou
nting. From a practical standpoint, on our balance 
sheet you will see a reduction in our property and equipment line. And the 
addition of a new equity method investment asset in the other asset section 
of the balance sheet. This reflects our cost basis in 
the joint venture. There 
is no near term impact to our income statement.
 

production guidance of 11 cargoes net to Kosmos including eight from 
Jubilee and three from TEN remains unchanged
. For each of these remaining 
quarters in 2017 we anticipate lifting two cargoes from Jubilee and one from 
TEN. Cargo sizes are expected to be approximately 950,000 barrels. Also on 
the revenue side, we still anticipate receiving net LOPI proceeds of 
appro
ximately $70 million during the first half of 2017. Based on our current 
production forecast, $49 million of which has already been received in the 
first quarter.
 
With regard to our previous $175 million net capital program announced 
earlier this year, we 
have now decreased our 2017 budget to approximately 
$150 million after refining the cost estimates for our work program for the 
year. $75 million is earmarked for Ghana. The majority of which is expected 
to be spent on Jubilee and $75 million is earmarked 
for planned exploration 
activities including new ventures, seismic acquisition and geological and 
geophysical technical fees.
 
Our remaining guidance on operating costs, depreciation, taxes and G&A 
have not changed. As we execute our strategy, we are commit
ted to 
maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and creating value for our 
shareholders through this cycle. Kosmos remains in a solid financial position 
and we will continue to focus on the execution of our plan for the remainder 
of the year.
 
That con

call for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes a line of Bob Morris with 
Citi. Please state your question.
 
Bob Morris
 
Thank you. Cong
ratulation, Andy, Brian and team on Yakaar discovery. As 

what is purely black oil prospect. But as you come back and look at the 
Requin prospects there, you've already discovered a
bout 20 Tcf of gas, you 
highlighted the reasons why you have a lower condensate to gas ratio there. 
But two parts to my question, one at what point do you say look we've 
already discovered enough gas and as we look at all the LNG projects 
coming on in the 
world when is enough gas and do we continue that there 
may be shift to oil prospects as we identify those, post Hippocampe 
prospect. And then two, I thought I recall you last quarter saying you 
needed CGR ratio of about 50 barrels per million cubic foot to
 
be economic. 
So, I guess my question now is with where his CGR is today. What would be 
the breakeven natural gas price so to speak to move forward with 
development of these projects or for future projects if you do make more 
gas discoveries here?
 
Andrew I
nglis
 

exploration program and our objective of targeting liquids as we get all. I 
think in terms of Yakaar, I think you should see it as a second LNG hub in 
Senegal. Yakaar with
 
Teranga is probably around 20 Tcf of resource and as 

an LNG stream with the condensate flow rather than being a liquids recycling 
project. We see similar economics with Tortue
 
versus and a Teranga, a 
Yakaar I think to be cost competitive today, a $5 per Mcf, FOB is the target. 


 
actually advantage from the scale perspective. It has similar reservoirs to 
Tortue and therefore comes with high deliverability wells. So further 
appraisal at the Yakaar required now, but fundamentally the target there in 
terms of being a cost competitive
 
use source is no different.
 
So that answers, I think your second question and if I just go to Brian for 
the first question, which was about what are your plans targeting liquids and 
oil as go north in Mauritania?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, thanks, Andy. Good morn
ing Bob. I think the first point to note is that 

frontier base enough. This is 2,100 Gulf Mexico block, so it's a very big area. 
But as we drill wells, we now about six in the gr

slowly understand the area and the first point I would make is to your point 
to be honest, is that northern Senegal clearly is a giant gas resource area for 
us. We've now made, you include Tortue three discoveries, out of three in 
Northern Senegal in the two blocks. And Requin Tigre, which is a 60 Tcf 
prospect that's been further derisked by Yakaar
-
1 significantly, remains 
undrilled. So, a giant gas resource in that area, but to your point, we are 
focused on funding oil and liquids.
 
And that's one of the reasons from a play 

 
I think we started to understand the petroleum system in good detail in 
Northern Senegal. We still have very little understanding in northern 
Mauritania where we've got 
limited number of penetrations. So, Hippocampe 

away from Yakaar. It gives you a sense of the scale of the space. And if 

r understand the 
presence of source rocks, the quality, their maturity, their timing of 
migration et cetera, which will start to allow it to get a really good handle on 
how the petroleum system is working up there and more important and as 
importantly. The
 
nature of the contribution from the two shallow resource 
rocks, the Albian and the CT, which we haven't yet tested because in the 
wells that we drilled, the CT and Albian has always been immature or at best 
very marginal mature for the Albian. So, that's 
one reason, this mixing of 
the shall hydrocarbons with the deeper hydrocarbons we think is going to 
give us a good chance of finding liquids to the north. Deeper count though 

We

area in general northern C8, C6, C12, we believe it's got a good opportunity 
to find liquids and oil and the explorations program is going to shift to that 
area for the first test we b
elieve would hit account at this point.
 
Bob Morris
 
Great now it makes sense and again congratulations, just very quickly, but 
the first LNG train down south coming on 2021 what would be the date or 
timing second LNG train?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Well, I think it's 

later. I just because they probably to work, who would be required So, I 
think it's probably in middle of the next decade.
 
Bob Morris
 

ay in Boston.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. 
Please state your question.
 
Ed Westlake
 
Yes, good morning and congrats on the discovery. Just on Hippocampe really 
small question, start with on timing, obvious


 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah some time around, late third quarter, August timeframe at the moment 
is the thinking.
 
Ed Westlake
 
For spudding?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, 
spudding, yeah, yeah. A little early or mid third or fourth quarter when 
we get down.
 
Ed Westlake
 
Right. And then, if maybe one for Tom on financial capacity, and obviously 

this year
 


Senegal plus São Tomé, plus Suriname. So, maybe just a talk of plus 
obviously at some point starting to put money into 
a development less the 

range of capital spend that you might see in say, 2019 or maybe some 
general comments about managing liquidity?
 
Tom Chambers
 



-

more to go this year and then Suriname in 2018, so suffice it to say though 

orward planning 
on the ability to continue to develop these successes. But a little too early 
right now to disclose any detailed plans.
 
Andrew Inglis
 

DD&A expand in 2017 and a goo
d piece of 2018 depending on the follow
-
on 
exploration success we will have in Mauritania and Senegal. So, and then of 

around $2 billion through to first gas. So, the carry is 533, so t
herefore, we 
are well supported in that in terms of the development. So, I think the good 

success, then we actually did the BP deal to ensure that at a sort of 30% 
operating inter
est we could carry on with the program. So, I feel good about 
how the strength of the balance sheet through 2017 and 2018. The ability 
for us to be fully, apart 30% through Tortue. Then, obviously we have 
options and the further success on how we would man
age that in 2019. But 
I see this as an opportunity not a problem.
 
Ed Westlake
 
Helpful clarification, and just one small one. Do you think Yakaar, Teranga 
will be suitable for the same sort of development idea where you do a near 
shore sort of floating LNG 


good for power stations.
 
Andrew Inglis
 

probably in cont
extual sense is that, as Brian said, we kind of announce the 
blocks in Senegal and Saint Louis and Cayar, I think to be gas. And similar 

exploration to be done, which would be the gi
ant Requin MT growth for our 
prospect. So, I think what you're going to see is we're going to come to that 

2018 I think. I think when you got out that well down, you'll be ab
le to look 
at the total resource there and it may result in a sort of different long
-
term 
approach, which may be an onshore scheme actually. Why you got early gas 
established the market through the Tortue development and then you come 
back to a larger sche

think what we have to think about really with the government of Senegal is 
that we have a large resource there and how do we most effectively develop 
that both the sort of near term objective as early 
gas, which is to Tortue 
versus a long
-
term objective about a potentially sort of world scale resource 
and what the right development scheme for that.
 
Ed Westlake
 
Congratulation. I caught about in time.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, you did. Thanks, Ed.
 
Operator
 
Than
k you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with 
Capital One Securities. Please state your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks. Good morning to everyone congratulations as well. Looking at the 
liquids component in Yakaar. Andy could you revi
ew the potential approach 
be it related to that from the BP form
-
out agreement and how should we 
look at that piece of the puzzle?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Well, Richard, I think is a little early, okay. We know to be clear, we have 
great preliminary result from NBTs
. So, until we get the actual lab results 
then I think it would be wrong to speculate, so I will have a confirmed actual 

i.e. no different. And then I think when we have that, we 
can then model it 
and give you the flow
-
through. Look, we going to condensate stream from 
Tortue, that clearly be a condensate stream from the development of Yakaar 
and Teranga and that will be contribute, there will be a contribution from the 
royalty that
 
we have under the BP agreement. But to quantify it today, I 
think is a little early, I think you need to give us a bit more time to work 
that.
 
Richard Tullis
 

when could the group
 
resume drilling at TEN and possibly even look to raise 
the production outlook from there?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Well, I think Richard you'll see the group actually getting back to drilling 

eventuality now. But as you know the rig market is quite accessible today in 
terms the ability to get rates. So, I think you'll find it moving quite quickly.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Okay. And then just lastly, how long do you expect the Tortue drilled stem 
test to 
take?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
We have it in the program at the moment, sort of being around 75 day 

about 60 days for each of the wells in the program around 75 days for the 
drill stem test.
 
Richard Tullis
 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anish Kapadia with 
Tudor Pickering, Holt and Company. Please state your question.
 
Anish Kapadia
 
First question is really on the kin
d of state of the market. We saw recently 
Exxon and Mozambique, they implied gross value for books, so they went 
into a very first $11 billion for an LNG development. So, just trying to 
seeing, how do you see the effective landscape in Senegal and Mauritan
ia 
how that changed over roughly kind of last 12 months? And how it actually 
changed since the BP deal?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Well, look, Anish, I think what our business model is about, we go in the 
frontier basin is early. They were before the industry spotted i
t. So they get 
rich positions and Brian described to you the size of the acreage position we 
have. Clearly with a successes we've had it's become actually very 

gained the block in Senegal
. The acreage is now, the basin is now being 
derisked and then that clearly makes it more competitive. So, we welcome 
new entrants, which is great, we have the second super major in Senegal, as 
well as, BP which I think illustrates the quality of the of th
e acreage of the 
industry sees that. I would anticipate similar things occurring in Mauritania, 
the good news for the Kosmos of course, is that we were in there first. 
We've got the great position and we captured what we believe is the core of 
the basin. B
ut I do think your observation, the flow of IOCs coming is a 
demonstration the quality of the acreage.
 
Anish Kapadia
 
Thanks and second question on Suriname. Say it sounds like from the 
comments earlier on the call, encouraged by both of recent well results
, both 
positive and the negative one. It sounds to me like your prospects grilled 
ready and alignment. So, I was just wondering, what was, and I suppose 

on your prospects in Su
riname.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, again, great question I'll hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 

early, processing products, interpretation products from the 3D. But as 

 


seeing. The AVO volumes actually I've just very recently come in in
-
house. 
They themselves incredibly encouraging as well, b
ut it's all got to be put 
together and the prospects of mature take much of the rest of this year to 
do that. We were very encouraged by the offset drilling. We all went down 

base
 
of the slope, and where our long trend directly from the recent Exxon 
Mobil discoveries in the same kind of fairway.
 
So, with those two calibrations that we can compare against the AVO that 
we're seeing and on our key prospects that's what gives us the, I
 
guess, is 
the added confidence that what we're dealing with here are very strongly 
supported seismically, supported AVO prospects. In terms of the rest the 
timing, in Suriname, we have one block with Chevron at 50/50 and we have 
a second block with Chevro

for us beyond the definition of the prospectivity is to bring the alignment of 
the partnership. Show that we can make sure these prospects stand today 
on the shelve for too long. But get drilled obviously, 

Kosmos, where quickly in an oil province is Suriname. That's obviously 
important to us so, and given the scale of the prospects, which are multi

T
hank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with 
Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Hi good morning team. The first question is just around Jubilee. Can you just 
talk about your production expectations for Jubilee for t
he balance of this 
year and then into 2018 as well.
 
Andrew Inglis
 

58,000 barrels a day, eight [ph] cargoes.
 
Neil Mehta
 
I know they are obviously issues last year, but can we just 
talk about how 

 
Andrew Inglis
 
Is that Jubilee okay.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Yes Jubilee.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
In Jubilee, we've actually progressed the repair of the spread mooring of the 
turret with 
the spread mooring. We now have the tugs that we're holding it 
on station have now departed, so we have the vessels turn more. That 
obviously provides stability in the current in the configuration. We still are 
using the shuttle tankers to off load the cru

improvement there for in the operating performance we sort of underpin the 
number that I gave you.
 
Neil Mehta
 

exploration. But I want to go back to I guess the firs
t question that was 
asked that just up the global gas macro and just how are you thinking about 
that piece of the business that the market appears to be well supplied for 
the foreseeable future. And so how do you think about this discovery, that 
Yakaar dis
covery and the context of a market where there is a lot of supply 
out there?
 
Andrew Inglis
 

the world is looking for a lighter hydrocarbon and we can see all the super 
majors
 
lightening their barrel. BP have an objective, Total has a similar 
objective, Exxon has a similar objective. You see now Exxon actually make 
string of gas acquisitions, P&G now in Mozambique. So I actually think gas is 

 
long
-

quality gas is what actually distinguishes one gas resource from another. 
And so you are right plenty the gas around, as growing gas demand. The 
gas that will get to market is the low cost gas.
 
And we believe both i
n Tortue, and now in Yakaar and Teranga we have gas 

important point here is that in the quality of the reservoirs that we have, the 
scale of production that are going to come fro
m those wells are very 

right at the front of the cost curve.
 
And we have a development partner in BP now that can absolutely develop 
and deliver that and it has the marketing ski
lls to make that that gas gets to 
market. They were the buyer of the of the energy. So you put all that 

quality of the resource, the simplicity of the partnerships, the right skills
 
and 
development and the right marketing. And I think we have a partnership and 
the resource that absolutely has all of the attributes.
 
Neil Mehta
 

obviously has come down in the back end 
of 2018 and 2019 but is your 
approach to hedging to take more for pro rata approach? Or you just sort of 
hedge into the curve or will you take a more tactical approach to hedging? 
Just can you talk about the strategy around blocking and barrel?
 
Tom Chamber
s
 


outcome. And so in essence we are hedging a significant proportion of our 
barrels to ensure that we have 

 
Neil Mehta
 

 
Tom Chambers
 
Right thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond 
James & Associates. Please state your q
uestion.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 

economics for the first phase of the LNG project, you said, I think, sub
-
$5 
kind of breakeven. What assumptions for fiscal terms does that assume? 

t be very specific, but I suppose have you finalized with 
both the Senegal side and the Mauritania side what the fiscal terms on the 
LNG development look like?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes Pavel. I think the great news with both of the PACs that we in both 
countries 
that have an anticipated gas than have the fiscal terms of gas.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, understood. Then a small housekeeping item, exploration expense in 
Q1 $100 million, obviously relatively high number, by historical standards. 

 
that you would anticipate for the rest of the year 
given your lower CapEx in particular?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yes Tom do you want to do that?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Can you just kind of remind 

 

for me real quick?
 
Pavel 
Molchanov
 
Yes, sure, exploration expense in Q1 $100 million which is relatively high 
quarterly number. I'm guessing it's not going to stay that high for the rest of 
year, but any thoughts on what you would anticipate for Q2, Q3, Q4?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Yes Q2, Q3


 

seismic expense in some typical G&G expense. So that will be in the $20 
million range. The first quarter was a big one with the rig stacking and the 
rig cancelation catch up payments, so those ar
e behind us now and so it 
should be just normal G&G expense going forward.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Right, appreciate it guys.
 
Andrew Inglis
 

-
up on that. Pavel, I mean, from a exploration point, given 
the six for six on the exploration field at th
e moment [indiscernible] we are 

said, most of our major seismic programs are in place this year and early 
next. But $100 million a year is about what we are trying to run this 
busi
ness at for the exploration expense, or exploration spend, 
notwithstanding [indiscernible].
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nikola Kouzmanov with 
Jefferies. Please state your question.
 
Nikola Kouzmanov
 
Good morning gentlemen. I
n preparations on Yakaar, this morning. Two 
questions on that, I suppose, and a question on Jubilee. I know you've 
already referred some of it. On Yakaar, in timing around appraisal and if 
you're going to be looking to sort of delineate the gas discovery, 

to look for potentially more liquid zone within that 220 area of discovery?
 
And then if it's an onshore development supposed to be big development, do 
you expect the economic threshold of 50 CGR to decrease from the price 

just in terms of Yakaar, but also Requin
-
Tigre?
 
And then on Jubilee, the operator talked about you are talking about a 12
-
week shutdown for the final spread mooring but that's going to take place in 
2017. How does this impact your guidance on the eight car
goes and if there 
is any impact actually? Thank you.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Right thanks Niki. I think just in terms of appraisal timing, I think our 
objective going forward in terms of the drilling program is the DST and then 
the three tests: Hippocampe ; currentl
y, Lamantin; and then Requin
-
Tigre. I 
think we want to drill Requin
-
Tigre, it'll be an important sort of further test 
of the outboard system in Senegal. It will allow us to understand, I think, 
the basin floor fan setting there from a gas perspective. I th
ink with that 
knowledge, it will then come back, the appraisal of Teranga and Yakaar. It'll 
take us a while to get through all the well result to fully understand Yakaar 
and develop the appraisal programs.
 
So I think appraisal will actually occur in 2018. 
So next year. Then back to 
the onshore or the potential for onshore in Senegal. Our view of the basin 
today, and obviously, it could change with the Requin
-
Tigre's result is, its big 
gas and with big prospects, in particular Requin
-
Tigre to drill. If it is
 
successful, that's enough gas to drive a large onshore scheme.
 
In terms of economics, I think it's early to speculate. I think I do have a 
personal view on it, which is there's something about small is beautiful. And 
with the Tortue development, we're usi
ng a very innovative approach by 
using a very innovative approach by using a standard industry solution: 
design one, build many. We're driving through standardization. We're driving 
cost effectiveness into a small scheme. I think the approach to the onshor
e if 
we do an onshore development, it will be very much aligned around that 
thinking, where we need to ensure we're standardized, we're not stick 
building, and we develop something which has scale and efficiency.
 
So I think, again, I believe we have someth
ing which is cost
-
competitive 
really because of the quality of the reservoir, the big gas rates, et cetera.
 
And then finally, on Jubilee, I think its early days. We've clearly done the 
work to stabilize the turret by removing the tugs and doing the mooring
. 
There's further work to be done now, which the partnership is conducting as 
to whether the vessel needs to be rotated and when. And that work is 
ongoing, but we feel that our view of 8 cargoes is our best view of the 
future.
 
Nikola Kouzmanov
 
Okay thank y
ou. Thank you very much.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Alright, great. Thanks Niki.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Al Stanton with 
RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Good afternoon. I'll be quick 
actually. So just two questions on the 
exploration campaign. First of all, 75 days for a well test. I mean, what 
should we see as a good result for Tortue drill center?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think the first result in test is sort of twofold. What we're trying to
 
do is 
actually get some liquids, some gas to surface, so that we know exactly the 
fluid composition we're dealing with. We need to have the basis of design for 
the LNG facilities. So in essence, we're looking at fluid sampling. And then 
the second thing w
e're looking at is just well deliverability so that we can 
optimize the well design. But I don't think there's a big piece of information 
to come from the reservoir. It's really underpinning the basis of design to 
ensure that we've got the right fluid char
acteristics, and we've got the right 
well designed.
 
Al Stanton
 
And then is there a bond burning rate that you would require?
 
Andrew Inglis
 

are very high rate. And so what we're do
ing is ultimately ensuring we've got 
the right well design in terms of completion type rather than fundamentally 
saying we need a particular rig.
 
Al Stanton
 
And then finally, you talking about Requin
-
Tigre extending into January. So 
is that a hint of a rig
 
extension or second phase of drilling with a different 
rig?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Well the Requin
-
Tigre extending into January.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
And our rig contract ends in November.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes.
 
Andrew Inglis
 

 
Al Stanton
 
Yes I will then okay.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
That will be inappropriate to do that.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay thank you.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Alright thanks Al.

Good day everyone and welcome to Kosmos Energy's Third Quarter 2017 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, 
let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance and 
Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our releases regarding our third quarter earnings, which 
is available on the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website. We 
anticipate filing o
ur 10
-
Q for the third quarter with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; Brian Maxted, Chief Exploration Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief 
Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like 
to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with the forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in 
the earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refe
r to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
Company's historical and future performance and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in ad
dition to and 
should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial 
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our SEC 
filings.
 
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks Neal and good mornin
g everyone. 2017 has been a strong year for 
Kosmos. We maintained our focus on growing the value of our company and 
delivering superior returns to our investors while strengthening our balance 
sheet. We ramped our production at the TEN fields, solidified o
ur partnership 
with BP in Mauritania and Senegal and acquired an exploration and 
production position in Equatorial Guinea that is immediately accretive.
 
Over the next few years three key attributes will differentiate Kosmos 
enabling us to continue to deliv
er superior returns to our shareholders. First, 
we build an exploration portfolio of unparalleled scale for a company of our 
size. Each opportunity has been accessed and evaluated using a rigorous 
and disciplined process resulting in four high impact quali
ty prospects that 
are planned to be drilled in the next 12 months. Second in our portfolio we 
have a combination of defined growth opportunities from producing assets 
and scattered resources all of which are characterized by their top quartile 
full cycle b
reakeven cost. And third, we continue to maintain our robust 
financial position and strong liquidity allowing us to invest counter cyclically 
and grow the company at time when supply costs are lower.
 
We would like to update you first on our exploration por
tfolio which remains 
as strong as it ever has been. Our position of Mauritania and Senegal 
combined with our Suriname, Sao Tome acreage is very promising providing 
a program of opportunities to deliver significant success. While everyone is 
unlikely to be 
successfully in frontier exploration our goal is to deliver 
focused high
-
quality exploration program which means we will only drill the 
best prospects. Last week, we announced the result of Hippocampe
-
1 well in 
Mauritania.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Br
ian to discuss the results and implications of 
the well in more detail as well our ongoing exploration activities. Before I 
provide you with an update on the rest of our business.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Andy and good morning, everyone. As we disclosed last w
eek in the 
press release Hippocampe
-
1 was a dry haul. Our post well analysis which is 
ongoing suggested the well failed mostly likely due to a lack of charge 
access, more on this in a moment. Hippocampe
-
1 was a second of four 
independent tests designed to 
fully evaluate the key prospects of different 
fairway of the basin floor fan. Along the western outboard portion of our 
acreage offshore Mauritania and Senegal. Each fairway includes a different 
combination of reservoir and charge systems. The Hippocampe w
ell was a 
significant step out from our other discoveries. Approximately 110 
kilometers from Tortue and 60 kilometers from Marsouin.
 
Hippocampe
-
1 was designed to test low Lower Cenomanian Albian reservoirs 
charged by the deeper Valanginian, Neocomian sourc
e and the last mature 
part of the kitchen. Here we anticipated that lower heat flows related to our 
acreage further south in Senegal will present a stronger chance for liquids or 
oil. In several respects, our understanding of geology proved correct. Firstl
y, 
the well encountered the target intervals on prognosis and importantly the 
sands in the Lower Cenomanian as well as the upper Albian were exceeding 
our expectations in terms of both thickness and quality. This outcome 
extends the proven actual extent of
 
the basin floor fan fairway nearly 200 
kilometers from Hippocampe
-
1 to the Yakaar discovery.
 
Given the quality of the reservoir targets coupled with the fact that they 
were also buried more deeply than in other wells drilled to
-
date. The well 
outcome also
 
extends the depth window for commercially successfully 
exploration. Secondly, we also encountered a lower thermal grade and test 
predicted pre
-
drill compared to our discoveries in southern Mauritania and 
Senegal. This is consistent with our thesis that we
're more likely to find 
liquids and oil along the western flank of our acreage charged by the deeper 
source.
 
As I mentioned, while it's still early days in our post well fairly announces its 
continuing, we believe the most likely reason for finding brines 
on filled 
sands with no hydrocarbon shows in the prospect is due to a localized lack of 
charge migration, access from the deeper Valanginian, Neocomian source to 
the low Cenomanian and upper Albian reservoirs in this part of the 
petroleum system.
 
We believ
e this due to a combination of several factors including the 
presence of verticals seals, the prevailing pressure regime and the maturity 
of the source rock i.e. another gravity oil and liquids and not mobile as lean 
gas. Together these drivers may have en
sured less buoyancy and coupled 
with greater barriers to vertical migration. Blended charge access more 
difficult. Our post well analysis has also focused on explaining the false 
positive AVO anomaly. The first we've encountered in the basin. We believe, 
t
he AVO signature at Hippocampe instead of being the highly reliable 
hydrocarbon predictor. It has proven to be another part of the basin, here's 
it is only lithology indicator. This we believe is due to differences in rock 
properties and seismic velocities
 
in this part of the fairway.
 
While the use of AVO as an exploration tool remains valid and what continue 
to be an important into de
-
risking our prospects, it will be need to employed 
with greater caution going forward. This is particularly important when 
the 
two is not calibrated by approximate wells. Where we need to ensure that 
the geophysical attributes is supported by the fundamental geology. Turning 
to the forward program in Mauritania and Senegal. As a result of the 
independence of our prospects, pri
marily in relation to charge but also 
reservoirs our forward program remains unchanged. Our next well, 
Lamantin, is an independent test with a different charge model and different 
reservoir target and remains our best chance of finding oil in this petroleu
m 
system. The well spuded over the weekend and we expect results within 60 
days. Lamantin is targeted in the younger Campanian age reservoir located 
uniquely above oil mature Cenomanian and Albian source rocks. It is not 
dependence on the deeper source and
 
we do not expect any major virtual 
seals at separate at source rocks from the reservoir which should reduce 
migration risk.
 
Although this well has another significant step out, the AVO is calibrated by 
well approximately 20 kilometers away. Following Lama
ntin, we will test the 
Requin
-
Tigre prospect a super giant basin full fan located down dip of Tortue 
and long trend from Yakkar. The well is located in the same geological 
setting as Yakkar and benefit from good AVO calibration with successful 
offsetting w
ells. as we've discussed in the past, we expect the geothermal 
grade into this fairway to be higher and similar to that encountered in the 
nearby Tortue and Yakkar discoveries suggesting Valanginian, Neocomian 
sort rocks there to be gas mature and therefor
e facilitating vertical migration 
from the deep resort to the lower Cenomanian and upper Albian reservoir 
target. With 2 billion to 3 billion barrel oil test at Lamantin, the 62 cf gas 
thrust in Requin
-
Tigre we believe this basin has the potential continue
 
to 
grow significantly.
 
To conclude, I want you to provide an update for you on the progress during 
the last quarter of the rest of our exploration portfolio. Turning first to 
Suriname, we expect to drill two exploration wells next year one in Block 45 
and
 
one on Block 42. On Block 45 we plan to test Anapie 750 million barrel 
oil prospect. This involves early cretaceous reservoir strapped in a 
structural
-
stratigraphic along the flank to begin on Suriname basin. On Block 
42 we're in a high number of high qua
lity prospects that we alongside our 
partners are evaluating for drilling next year. We plan to spud Anapie the 
second quarter of 2018 followed by the high graded prospect in 42 in the 
second half of 2018.
 
Recent drilling in the basin both positive and neg
ative as proved additional 
validation of our geological and geophysical models. Secondly in Sao Tome 
last quarter, we completed the acquisition for approximately 16,000 square 
kilometers proprietary through these seismic. The results of the very early 
proc
ess seismic volumes are encouraging particularly in confirming the 
presence of multiple stacked reservoir plate fairways as well as number of 
potential large combination structural
-
stratigraphic traps. We expect to 
continue through next year to evaluate th
is prospectivity ahead of planned 
drilling in 2019.
 
Given we've already demonstrated the presence of the working petroleum 
system through something of oil in the islands as we've previously reported 
we continue to be very excited about this opportunity. We
 
expect that 
they're maturing for drilling of the exploration opportunities in Suriname and 
Sao Tome in 2018 and 2019 respectively together with follow
-
on wells in 
Mauritania and Senegal well enable cost most of the inactive explorer with 
two or three high
 
impact exploration wells each year through to the next 
decade.
 
In addition, we continue to actively pursue strategic new ventures for drilling 
in 2020 and beyond both independently as Kosmos and together in 
partnership with BP as part of our exploration a
lliance. We're strongly 
leveraging our leading edge knowledge, sharing new ideas, countercyclical 
initiatives together with the capabilities of the Kosmos big combination to 
identify and access new exploration opportunities and we expect our efforts 
to bea
r fruit soon.
 
At this time, I will turn the call to back over to Andy.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Thanks, Brian. I'll turn my focus to production growth from our existing 
portfolio producing assets and discovered resources. In Ghana, we've 
achieved two important mileston
es which position the assets for growth in 
2018 and 2019. We recently received approval for the Greater Jubilee Full 
Field Development Program and also received a favorable ruling from the 
International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea or ITLOS in late Septe
mber with 
regard to TEN fields. These milestones paved the way for the partnership to 
drill additional development wells in both fields starting 2018.
 
Related to Jubilee, during the last quarter has been strong averaging growth 
sales of 
approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day. However, it is 
important that we received approval of the Full Field Development Program 
and in addition to allowing drilling to resume it extends the unit boundary to 
include the Mahogany and Teak fields. It e
stablishes price for gas produced 
at the field after the foundation volume and it allows Kosmos to book 
additional reserves to the year end.
 
Alongside the increase and production, the Jubilee partnership continues to 
work on resolving FPSO turret bearing i
ssue. We've been working hard with 
our partners and the government to ensure shutdowns our as completion as 
possible and minimize downtime. From an original shutdown of up to 12 
weeks this year, the partners have now agreed to shorter shutdown of 
approxima
tely four weeks of the two periods in early 2018 for stabilization of 
the turret.
 
Planning for rotation of the vessel is ongoing is expected to result in a short 
shutdown around year end 2018. At TEN, gross sales average approximately 
60,000 barrels of oil
 
per day during the third quarter with the existing 
limited wild stock. With a favorable ruling delivered by ITLOS in late 
September we now expect to resume drilling on the field in early 2018 to 
increase production levels towards the FPSO capacity.
 
As I d
iscussed on our call two weeks ago, we also announced our strategic 
entry in Equatorial Guinea through establishing an exploration and 
production position. Members of our exploration team discovered the Sabre 
field nearly 20 years ago and as a result, Kosm
os has differential knowledge 
of Remuni [ph] basin and a special relationship with these assets. Principe 
basin was opened very little exploration has taken place. We bring 
-
 
our new 
thinking and apply modern technology to maximize the value of these 
asset
s. The producing assets Sabe and Ekume [ph] fields add additional 
source of low cost, high margin production the Kosmos portfolio which 
increases our current production by almost 50%.
 
Our partnership with Triton Energy allows us to focus on what we do best
 
exploration while Triton focuses on the defined resource upside through 
optimizing production operations and targeted infill drilling. The assets 
generate significant free cash flow which enhances Kosmos strong financial 
position and improves our financia
l metrics. We acquire the asset to very 
attractive valuation and the transaction is immediately accretive. We expect 
to update you on our plans after closing later this year.
 
In Mauritania and Senegal work on Tortue continues and the partnership has 
made s
ignificant progress. I'll remind you that just one year ago we were 
finalizing our Farm
-
Out to BP which we announced just before year end and 
they've rapidly taken control of the project, demonstrating the importance of 
bringing the right partner at the ri
ght time. In late August, we completed the 
drill stem test or DST on the Tortue
-
1 well. The positive results from the DST 
confirm that the Tortue fill is a world class resource validating assumptions 
that underpin our development concepts. The well floated
 
a sustained 
equipment constrained rate of approximately 16 million cubic feet per day 
during the main extended flow period which minimal pressure drawed out 
providing confidence in well designs that reach capable of producing 200 
million standard cubic fe
et per day.
 
The DST results confirmed and a connected volume to well consistent with 
current development scheme which together with high well rate is expected 
to result in a low number of development wells compared to equivalent 
schemes. Initial now to the
 
fluid samples collected during the test indicate 
Tortue gas is well suited for liquefaction given low levels of liquid and 
minimal impurities. The combination of how high well rates large connected 
volume per well together with gas well suited for liquefa
ction is why we 
believe Tortue is one of the lowest cost pre
-
FID Greenfield LNG projects. 
With regard to the ICA, that's full engagement by both governments to 
approve the agreement at a timely fashion aligned for FID in 2018 and first 
gas in 2021.
 
To achi
eve this extensive pre
-
FEED work is currently ongoing and 
approximately 70,000 man hours of engineering work have already been 
invested. So, in summary, we have a strong growth agenda for our 
producing assets recently strengthen with our acquisition in EG 
as well as 
clear path to first gas from our discovered resource in Mauritania and 
Senegal.
 
Lastly, I'd like to discuss our strong financial position through the end of the 
third quarter we've already delivered over $200 million of free cash flow and 
are on
 
track to exceed our full year guidance of $250 million excluding the 
recently announced EG transaction. Our enviable free cash flow generation 
and solid liquidity have allowed us to invest through the cycle and take 
advantages of opportunities counter cyc
lically. Our recent entry into 
Equatorial Guinea is a clear example of our strategy in action.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third quarter results.
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thank you, Andy good morning, everyone. Our commodity prices have 
recently 
improved, our commitment to full cycle returns, financial strength 
and robust liquidity combined with our rigorous capital allocation process will 
continue to set Kosmos apart from other independent E&P operators. We 
plan to continue living within our mean
s using our strong free cash flow to 
execute our growth plan. With regard to liquidity, we exited the quarter with 
approximately $1.3 billion in total corporate liquidity including capacity on 
our RBL and RCF facilities as well available cash.
 
Through the 
third quarter, we repaid $250 million of debt and exited the 
period with $890 million of net debt. We plan to continue maintaining 
significant headroom in both our RBL and RCF facilities by ensuring we 
extend the facilities between RBL amortization begins 
or the RCF reaches 
maturity. We also anticipate adding incremental RBL capacity by 
incorporating the EG assets once the transaction closes.
 
Now I'll turn to the results for the quarter. We finished the quarter with 
three crude oil liftings, two from Jubile
e and one from TEN in line with our 
guidance. This generated second quarter 2017 oil revenues of $151 million, 
excluding $12 million of derivative settlements. When you add our revenue 
to our sell hedges, it reflects a realized price of approximately $55.5
7 per 
barrel sold in the quarter.
 
Third quarter revenues were up compared to the same quarter in 2016 as a 
result of lifting two more cargoes in the quarter. The third quarter, we 
generated a net loss of $63 million or $0.16 per diluted share, adjusting fo
r 
the impact of one
-
time items that affect comparability, including a $27 
million mark
-
to
-
market hedging loss, the company generated net loss of $37 
million or $0.09 per diluted share.
 
On the cost side, operating expense for the third quarter was $39 milli
on or 
$13.33 per barrel versus $14 million or $14.33 per barrel in the second 
quarter of 2017. This included approximately $36 million of regular 
operating expense and $7 million of cost attributed to revise operating 
procedures, offset by $4 million in in
surance recoveries. Exploration expense 
for the third quarter was $37 million which included $21 million related to 
the difference between rate charge to the partnership and the contracted 
rate for [indiscernible] associated with the Hippocampe
-
1 well and 
covered 
under our BP Farm
-
Out transaction. The remaining expense was primarily 
attributable to ongoing seismic in geologic and geophysical costs incurred in 
Mauritania, Sao Tome and Suriname.
 
Also in the quarter, other expense net totaled $5 million most o
f which were 
non
-
cash charges associated with the exploration activities of KBSL. Our 
joint venture BP in Senegal. We've now agreed to unwind the JV, which we 
expect to occur in the fourth quarter allowing our activity in Senegal to be 
accounted for under 
the normal proportionate consolidation accounting 
method. General and administrative expenses were $20 million during the 
third quarter inclusive approximately $10 million of non
-
cash equity based 
compensation.
 
Depletion and depreciation expense for the qu
arter was $73 million or 
$25.01 per barrel consistent with the second quarter and three liftings. 
Taxes were a benefit of $2 million and included a deferred benefit of 
approximately $8 million. Hedging continues to play a key role in supporting 
our balance
 
sheet, strength and environment of volatile oil prices. As of 
September 30, we had approximately 14 million barrels hedged from 2017 
to 2019. We plan to hedge the EG volumes consistent with our strategy to 
ensure we deliver the projected cash flow out of 
that project and to lock
-
in 
payback within three years.
 
In summary, we continue to maintain a solid balance sheet which allows us 
to execute our planned work program, preserve our financial flexibility and 
fund our ongoing operations and growth initiatives
 
to enhance the value of 
Kosmos for our shareholders.
 
With that, that concludes our prepared remarks and now operator we'd like 
to open the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the l
ine of Charles 
Meade with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.
 
Charles Meade
 
Brian, this maybe perhaps be best for you. I recognized it's early days in the 
post the Hippocampe well and then we're also dealing with the limitations of 
this median
 
that we don't have any visuals we can refer to, but I'm hoping 
that you can talk a little bit more about what you learned with the after this 
dry hole and how it has perhaps changed your view of the risks and the 
prospectivity of the basing. I recognized 
that all these prospects have 
independent risk, but at least my point of view it seems like what they share 
is perhaps the same size of chute and certainly you're thinking about how to 
high grade these prospects. So, can you just elaborate little bit on yo
ur 
prepared comments there?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Certainly, Charles. I'll be happy to. I think the first point to note is all of the 
prospectivity that we've defined in this current drilling program we see as 
independent and that's deliberate because what we want 
to do, is to test all 
of the elements of this petroleum system in this initial exploration phase in 
the out board, that's the first point to note. So, the read throughs from 
Hippocampe to the rest of the prospectivity limited or zero. So, as I 
mentioned in
 
the prepared remarks the program isn't changing at all.
 
The second point to note, is this was probably our most significant step out 
into the basin. And whilst we've had obviously good consistency and success 
thus far and this was our first dry hole, one 
has to remember how big this 
petroleum system is, we're talking several hundred kilometers long and 100 
kilometers wide and it is very difficult to expect a basin of that size to be 
perfectly confirming across its extent. So, the fact that we saw some 
chan
ges in the rocks as we went outboard and further to the north and west 
in this basin, was no major surprise, but that was one of the reasons for 
drilling this well early, we felt it would give us significant information on 
better understanding the petroleu
m system itself particularly in the Northern 
part of Mauritania. And whilst we got all right, the objectives of there 
-
 
qualities I mentioned. The one thing we didn't get right or didn't work for us 
was the AVO, it was our first force AVO and we're working
 
through that right 
now.
 
We do believe we'll be able to fully understand it, we do believe it is where 
our question related to sonic and density variations both within the reservoir 
and in the enclosing shales relative to the wells that we drilled 
to
-
date and 
the question here will be, how do we then explain geologically those 
geophysical changes both stratigraphically and geographically across the 
base and that is part of the work program that we really just started.
 
And as I mentioned on the call,
 
the next well independent in the sense 
-
 
that 
they have different reservoir objectives and all they have different source 
rocks feeding them and or they're in a different geological setting and or 
calibrated by offsetting wells more so than Hippocampe was
. So I think 
overall it's just an occupational how you're going to drill dry holes and often 
times you learn a lot more from dry holes than you do from successful wells 
and that is absolutely the case here and I think the results that we got are 
significan
tly enhancing our understanding of this basin which hopefully will 
translate through to a continuing degree of significant success across the 
basin where there is much more potential to touch on our last point much 
more potential still to test. This was a 
big prospect. It had big follow
-
on 
prospectivity in the area, but it was just on potential hub of many hubs that 
-
 
defined across this basin and so we see significant remaining potential to 
test here in the next two or three years to add on to the obviousl
y the 
significant resources that we've discovered and delineated to
-
date.
 
Charles Meade
 
Brian, that's great. Thanks for sharing. I'm sorry?
 
Brian Maxted
 
No just wanted to make sure that answers your question, Charles.
 
Charles Meade
 
It does, a lot of great 
detail on your elaboration there and just one small 
quick follow
-
up. You mentioned in your prepared comments that you found 
the lower thermal gradient at Hippocampe, was that consistent what your 
modeling was for Lamantin or was it just right in line bette
r or worse.
 
Brian Maxted
 
It's absolutely right in line and consistent with the geological model that we 
went through in some detail after the Yakkar result actually, while we were 
explaining that why that was lean gas and not oil. And importantly one 
possi
ble read through you could argue from Hippocampe it's confirmed the 
geothermal gradient that we're using in the Northern part of Mauritania that 
underpin the switching on/off this, the Albian and Cenomanian, Turonian 
source rocks in that area which are obv
iously the key source rocks for 
charging the Lamantin prospect itself.
 
Charles Meade
 
Great. Thank you, Brian.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with 
Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
 
Bob Morris
 
Andy my firs
t question with regard to TEN, now that you've got ITLOS 
approval, at one point you'd talked about further expanding the facilities 
there to reach 100,000 barrels a day which you'd indicated have the 
capacity to reach, how does that play in and what is the
 
likelihood that 
ultimately you can get to that sort of production level?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, thanks Bob. I think the first objective for the partnership is to 
commence drilling to build the well stock. We intend to do that early in 
2018, we're out procuring 
a rig to do that anticipated starting on TEN at the 
beginning of the year. I think the comments read around then building the 
well stock is ultimately to test the full capacity of the FPSO. It has a name 
plate capacity of 80,000 barrels a day, but we have 
tested at liquid 
throughput rates which are higher than that. So, I think the objective of the 
partnership will be to build the well stock and then to be able to test it at the 
FPSO capacity and then hopefully with successful drilling is to be able to test
 
it beyond that. So, I think the real message is that I think there's real 
potential for improving production from TEN in 2018 through 2019.
 
Bob Morris
 
Okay, good and my second question is, you mentioned that the Hippocampe, 
AVO indicated lithology and not
 
hydrocarbons are you're still studying that to 
try and understand that, but as you figure that out how likely is that to give 
you better insight into the AVO on the other prospects to better determine 
what they're indicating just given the distance to thi
s, is there going to be 
from what you learn ability to high grade to better understand that AVO 
elsewhere across the basin.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, I'll let Brian cover that and I think, there's one big message to take 
away from the if you like the AVO false posi
tive is the frank that about 
calibration. We have in Lamantin well that is 20 kilometers away, so we feel 
good about the calibration on Lamantin. We really feel good about the 
calibration in the Requin
-
Tigre area given the analog setting of the Yakaar 
and 
then up the slope Tortue. So I think as a non
-
geologist my big takeaway 
in the use of tool is, is the importance of calibration and then as you step 
away as we did with Hippocampe maybe 80 kilometers away from the 
nearest calibration there is more work to 
be done to be able to calibrate it 
and therefore that is going to be the challenge now as it were, but as the 
basin gets drilled up, we're going to have more and more point to calibration 
which means the two itself will become I believe more predictable. B
ut 
Brian?
 
Brian Maxted
 
I think, Andy hit the nail on the head there. It's about two things, it's about 
understand what drives the AVO and what we've done so far, we've been 
able to successfully replicate the AVO response with the rock properties and 
seismi
c losses that we saw in Hippocampe
-
1 and it does give a false positive 
in other words brine filled sand gives you a positive AVO, close to AVO 
response. It does improve when you put hydrocarbons into it and so there is 
a subtle difference which pre
-
drill w
e didn't recognize. So, there's no 
question the driver for the AVO here is potentially denser rock, higher 
seismic velocities causing a varied response that 
-
 
in hydrocarbon bearing 
sands, but the key is to calibration and this well didn't have a calibrati
on 
within 60 kilometers of it. And Lamantin has a calibration within 20 
kilometers of it and Requin
-
Tigre is well calibrated the south by Yakaar and 
well calibrated to east by Tortue, where we see similar seismic velocities 
occurring.
 
So, we think at this 
point in time that we've got sufficient calibration in 
Lamantin and in Requin
-
Tigre for those AVOs to actually be true 
hydrocarbon predictors as oppose to lithology indicators.
 
Bob Morris
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes 
from the line of John Herrlin with 
Societe Generale. Please proceed with your question.
 
John Herrlin
 
Couple quick ones for Brian. Did you do any side wall cores on the sands at 
all?
 
Brian Maxted
 
We did John, we have enough obviously. That's a crucial piece
 
of information 
that helps us to understand why are these rocks denser than we thought, 
they were going to be. We have got the side wall core issues, we haven't got 
the analysis in yet but that [technical difficulty] as you rightly point, will be 
an import
ant part of our post drill analysis.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay then with EG if I remember correctly because you're affiliated with it a 
long time ago after 
-
 
has bought the properties they had some issues with 
the compartmentalization do you have any thoughts on t
hat? I think they did 
Siba [ph] if I'm not mistaken.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes. I mean 
-
 
my recollection on it. It was a long time ago, but part of the 
early problems were caused by not having water injection in place alongside 
the initial oil production and I thin
k whilst the compartmentalization was 
demonstrated those compartments were large enough in off them 
themselves to justify individual producer injected well pads and we think 
there's a significant amount of overlooked potential in 
-
 
unsweat or 
undeveloped c
ompartments in Siba [ph] and that's one of the sources of 
value that we see in the project among many others.
 
John Herrlin
 
Great. And last one for me is on gas price. Are you going to be able to 
disclose what gas price you'll be selling for is or is gas co
uldn't be produced 
in Ghana and you don't get it report, what's the potential net back for you?
 
Andy Inglis
 
John its Andy. Post the foundation volume of 200 Bcf gross the agreed gas 
price is $2.35 MMBtu which on a Mcf but $2.35 on an MMBtu basis.
 
John Herr
lin
 
Great. Thanks very much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Warn with 
BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brendan Warn
 
I guess just if I switch to Suriname, you made a couple of comments 
obviously t
here's been a number of positive rolls from led by Exxon, you 
recently had Talos unsuccessful one and I think it was Apache earlier this 
year, can you just talk through what have you learned from both sets of 
rows in terms of what you'll be chasing over yo
ur drilling next year and 
second quarter.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Great. I'll let Brian handle that. Good question, Brendan.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks Brendan. Yes, you have to think about the, as you know when we go 
into these basins we look for play diversity so Block 42 
and Block 45 are 
different plays. 42 to the west is essentially a play extension of the Lisa 
fairway and so the recent drilling Exxon and partners have been doing in the 
southern part of the stone river block are directly and geographically in read 
through
 
to our acreage and of course as you know we have paths involved in 
Block 42 as well for the primary reason of bringing that calibration into the 
partnership and so with that direct read through but the results are very 
positive, the play is working in sou
thern part of the most recent well 
[indiscernible] is right adjacent to Block 42 to show that the play is working 
up to the borderline there's no reason it should stop working at the 
borderline, so a good positive direct read through.
 
And then when you go 
further east, we've had the recent Raku well that 
Tullow and partners drilled which is east of Block 45 in the Anapie prospect. 
The Anapie prospect is on the flanks on the Guyana
-
Suriname basin and the 
first point to note Raku prospect is actually on a int
erbasin hike 
[indiscernible] which is largely bold of the reservoir systems that we are 
chasing in Blocks 42 and 45. Not just the reservoir system but the charge 
systems as well and so we always struggled with understanding how the 
geologic story in Raku g
eophysical story which is part of the story that really 
excited the operating and art is in Raku.
 
There is no read through really for Block 45 or deeper Block 42 from Raku. 
As I mentioned in the remarks it calibrates our interpretation that we didn't 
expec
t to see reservoir in that area, we thought charge was going to be very 
difficult, but it was charge that's it's probably charge from either from 
another port or deep depth which might explain the gas condensate. So, in 
Anapie in Raku we have really good s
tory which complements the strong 
geophysics and the AVO responses so we're hopeful that they are, the 
independence is there versus certainly the Tullow well and the Dependence 
is there versus the Exxon well. So, we remain extremely bullish and exciting 
ab
out that potential that we'll drill out next year.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Okay thanks and then my second question, if I just come back to Mauritania 
or Mauritania and Senegal and just you already given up that 
-
 
in know BP 
are the operator in terms of the developmen
t, but update on where the 
signing of the border agreements up to concept selection. Just what sort of 
catalyst should we be expecting before the year end or end of fourth quarter 
in regards to Tortue, if you can please?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, sure 
Brendan. I'll pick that up and talk about in two parts the projects 
and then the intergovernmental cooperation agreement. I think on the 
projects BP have actually made significant progress really short period of 
time. It's less than a year ago, since we an
nounced the BP Farm
-
in 
Mauritania and Senegal in that time the rounds of engineering significantly, 
they've spent around 70,000 man hours as I said in my remarks completing 
the concept select. And if you think about a project to get to first gas, you 
got t
o go through sort of four stages appraise, select which is all about the 
concept, define which is about the front end engineering takes it to FID, 
execute, first gas. So where are we in that timeline, the praise is done 
completed with the DST, positive res
ults, select sort of done, BPX back to go 
through select, define gate by year end. They've taken all the big 
engineering decisions we need to do to finalize the concept for example the 
exact location of the break water on the border then a bunch of soil su
rvey it 
allow us to be comfort into the break water is properly positioned.
 
So yearend we have select done that will analyze to go out to define which is 
about the front end engineering and some sort of pre
-
qualification is taking 
place with various vendor
s to enable us to do that. the define program is 
around sort of nine, 12 months which allows FID by year end 2018, 36 
months of execute it takes you to post gas at the end of 21. So, I think all of 
that we're on track. I think to me it demonstrates sort of
 
the rigor and 
discipline that BP brings to the project as a super major, it has helped us 
enormously I feel decision we made during BP, at the time we did was 
absolutely right.
 
For the intergovernmental cooperation agreement as I said in my remarks 
full e
ngagement by both governments. They're aware of the need to finalize 
it in a timely fashion to allow FID 2018 [technical difficulty] agreements in 
terms of what the agreement should say, its supported by both ministries, 
both countries, both NOCs. But more
 
importantly supported by both 
President's. Both BP and Kosmos. Have those personal assurances. It's now 
actually the process of getting a National Treaty approved by both 
governments which requires process in a sense of degree of bureaucracy 
across severa
l ministries including finance, foreign affairs, etc. and I think 
it's honest to say given the novel nature the agreement is taking longer than 
we anticipated. But we have absolute engagement from both countries, 
absolutely engagement down from the Preside
nt and it's clear that both 
Presidents are targeting year end to get it done so that we can therefore 
more forward through the FEED process.
 
So, a lot of progress, is it all done yet? No, but the process of having BP and 
they're driving it now I think it's
 
made a huge difference.
 
Brendan Warn
 
That's great. Thanks a lot.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rafal Gutaj with Bank 
of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
 
Rafal Gutaj
 
I've got two questions both on 
Ghana. If I may. First one just on TEN and 
the 60,000 barrels a day that you achieved in the third quarter. Just thinking 
back to earlier in the year. I think the intentional is to keep the field running 
at about 50,000 barrels a day, owing to some pressur
e issues on the 
Enyenra so the question is basically, could you give us a little bit more color 
how you achieved that and should we expect that run rate to continue over 
Q4 and into Q1 ahead of further drilling. And then coming to the greater 
Jubilee Full 
Field Development Plan. I wondered if you could give us some 
more color now that the plan has been approved on CapEx kind of first oil 
and then incremental production and when we should expect that. And also, 
what is the associated reserve booking with tha
t at year end 2017? Thank 
you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Lots of questions there, Rafal. I think but on both hand, I think what you've 
seen and the improvement in the production rate is actually about an 
organization becoming more innovative. With actual inability to sp
end 
[indiscernible] so we've been looking at ways in which we can optimize the 
field looking at a different flowing bottom role pressures, different injection 
regimes, etc. And I think hats off to the partnership for getting the 
production level up to 60,0
00 barrels a day. We clearly, the objective is to 
sustain that through the fourth quarter. Again, I think the real important 
that is not the fourth quarter production but the ability then to start the 
build
-
up of new well stock and then the increase in pro
duction that would 
carry through 2018.
 
The loss of potential in TEN and I think we've demonstrated the performance 
of reservoir through being able to maintain a 60,000 barrel a day production 
rate in the third quarter despite the very limited well stock, t
hat we had. On 
the greater Jubilee full field development program. It's too early to give you 
all the guidance where what we do know is that, we have a rig coming to 
Ghana it will initially spend time on both TEN and Jubilee. We're working 
with the partner
ship at the moment to look at bringing in the second rig in 
2018 to accelerate the drilling because we see there is real potential there. 
So, I think, we need to conclude those conversations in the partnership and 
then as customary we will give you the gui
dance in our 4Q results in 
February for 2018 from all the dimensions we just talked about, which our 
CapEx production, reserves, etc.
 
I think the great opportunity there's real opportunity in both fields now given 
the ports that we have in drilling or awai
ting the full filed development 
program on Jubilee and ITLOS drilling issues to now sort of get back to 
business and start pushing on the production rate.
 
Rafal Gutaj
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molc
hanov with 
Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
On EG, at both Jubilee and TEN as analyst we've been accustomed to 
modeling your production as a function of cargos, right. Certain number of 
cargos each quarter. Is that going to
 
be how it works with EG or is there 
going to be kind of more steady state production run rate that we can expect 
from quarter to quarter?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Pavel, I think 
-
 
behind that is Tom. But I think you'll get by. All right we're 
going to give you product
ion numbers and clearly from a cash flow 
perspective you want to be able to model the cash received that will give 
you guidance on the cargoes. Tom?
 
Tom Chambers
 
That's right, Pavel. We're going to give the fact that it will be countered for a 
bit differen
tly, we're going to provide some extra details that to allow you to 
understand what the production is, what the cargos are, what the operating 
G&A expenses of the partnership? So, we're currently working our way 
through that and we'll have the detail for y
ou on our next call into the 
-
 
at 
the fourth quarter call in February.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay, just a quick follow
-
up on to help kind of sequence out the catalyst we 
should be thinking about for 2018. Requin
-
Tigre spuds in Q1 of 2018 and 
then you mentioned t
he two prospects in Suriname, did I miss anything that 
supposed to spud next year or is it just those three?
 
Andy Inglis
 
In terms of the big exploration wells, Pavel you docked obviously three big 
wells in 2018 from an exploration perspective. Requin
-
Tigre
 
as you say 
spuds in 1Q, you then got most likely the Block 45 well which took you and 
then Block 42 to 3Q.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Very clear. Appreciated.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gamboa with 
Tudor, Pickering and 
Holt. Please proceed with your question.
 
David Gamboa
 
I have two keys. First one, we thought Andy you were very clear talking 
about the next catalyst for the project. I just wanted to double check 
something with you. I think earlier this year you mentioned
 
or it was 
mentioned that a potential mix range solution could be announced by mid
-
year and we haven't seen that yet. I was wondering what have been the 
delay, if you can comment around that and if you expect this to potentially 
be a risk toward FID at sli
pping into 2019 and alongside thought you, if you 
could give us some color around how being to pre
-
market the gas, how's the 
market at this point in time in terms of getting good price for that gas 
previous to first production.
 
And then second one, just if
 
you could give us a sense of TEN ramp up 
towards the FPSO plateau and given the pressure issues that have been 
mentioned and the pace you expect to drill this new wells that we should 
expect the field to reach plateau within the first half or second half 
of the 
year. Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, great. Thanks David. If I go back the Tortue questions first. The 
question about the Midstream solution is part of the concept select process 
which BP been rigorously following. One of the key decisions that phase o
r 
etc for phase praise is like define, execute the concept work was to fully 
work through the Midstream solution. I think we've made with BP a decision 
on the concept that we want to carry through into the defined stage i.e. 
what is the first vessel that w
ill be used on the FLNG for the FLNG solution 
and so with the completion of the concept work by the end of the year, that 
is now done.
 
In terms of gas as you know, we have BP in the project one of the reason we 
brought BP in, is that they have the ability 
take Tortue gas and add it to 
their global portfolio. Clearly independent of that we're testing the market 
for other solutions that will be competitive with a BP option and going out to 
other potential buyers of the gas. That process is started and it actu
ally 
moving long at quite a good pace actually so, it's a great thing about this 
partnership is it really simple partnership. Ourselves, BP national oil 
companies all absolutely aligned in terms of the outcome and so I think, I 
don't see the gas marketing 
being the rate defining step to get us through 
FID. We're well balanced in that process.
 
In terms of TEN ramp up, as you say we gave you full guidance when we 
come to our earnings in February but you should anticipate a ramp up to the 
fatter rates in the s
econd half of the year rather than the first half of the 
year. All right.
 
David Gamboa
 
Right. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Al Stanton with RBC 
Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Brian, 
can I ask couple questions about Lamantin? Can we learn a bit more 
about the prospect? I mean the size range 2 to 3 billion barrels, it's quite 
wide. I was wondering what the key drivers were in terms of whether there 
is a base case structural trap and an 
upside strat trap and also as you did 
talking about Suriname there's been a lot of lessons learned from the sort of 
Ghana [ph] or and Tullow vintage worlds of the past. So is there anything 
you've really learned from drilling in the vicinity that is helpin
g you more 
than just the AVO's. I think if your confidence on this prospect.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Hi, Al. Brian here. In terms of the range of potential size of Lamantin. It's 
primarily 
-
 
the shape and extents of the trap and the definition of the trap is 
actually
 
very good. And so, the variation in terms of potential is really driven 
by the internal geometry and particularly the net pay, net gross, net pay and 
distribution across the trap, which is quite a large trap. So that really reflects 
its that's uncertain r
eally reflects to the range of volume, that we're closing 
for Lamantin because if you recall in this area, we're in a bit of a different 
reservoir system then we are further south and we're getting much more 
influence from the [indiscernible] river as come
 
further north as oppose to 
Senegal river site which is quite well calibrated in predicting reservoir 
thickness and quality from the existing wells. So that's what drives the range 
of volumes for Lamantin. In terms of risk and the de
-
risk part of the AVO, 
two things I mean we've mentioned now couple of times one in the context 
of our own prospects and one in the context of the dry holes or others and 
it's very important to have the geological story and the geophysical story 
support each other.
 
The geophysic
al story in Lamantin we believe is different from Hippocampe 
and the reason we believe that is because we have a well about 19 
kilometers away [indiscernible]. Which didn't quite get down to the 
Campignian primary objective, but it got into some sense seve
ral hundred 
meters above its horizon and so what we got is a calibration on the seismic 
velocities and the rock properties. The well was a dry hole it was, but it had 
hydrocarbon shows in it. And so, it's enabled us to calibrate geophysically 
the sands in 
a water bearing situation and then obviously compare that with 
the sands that we got in Lamantin
-
1 in the [technical difficulty] response of 
those and we see a clear difference.
 
So, unless we got a significant change in the geophysical parameters or the 
ro
ck property parameters within that 20 kilometers we've much better 
calibrated than we were in Hippocampe. Much more calibrated in the sense 
we're further south in the Tortue, Teranga, Yakaar. The second point to note 
is, is the geological story is differen
t. And in particular we're dealing with 
proven oil source rocks, you recall the deep Valanginian, Neocomian system 
is still speculative we're still haven't penetrated it, we know it's there, but we 
haven't actually penetrated it. We've actually penetrated 
the CT and Albian 
source rocks in the basin, we know that they're prone and we believe that 
they will mature in the drainage area of Lamantin trap. They directly 
underlie the Campignian reservoir and so migration which we believe was a 
big program in Hippo
campe should not be a problem in Lamantin. And so, 
the geological model is quite different than Hippocampe and much more 
consistent and supportive of the geophysical story that we're seeing in the 
Lamantin prospect itself. So, for those reason.
 
Al Stanton
 
And will this will make or break the prospect?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Will make or break the Lamantin prospect for sure. We have a number of 
prospects along this trend some in other different reservoir system, some 
with other different track geometries. They have so
me dependency but won't 
necessarily be written off if Lamantin is a dry help for example. So, there will 
be other potential to possibly test going down the road, but this an obviously 
a very important well kind of play fairway area opening well in this nor
thern 
part of basin which we haven't yet drilled. It is well over 100 kilometers not 
of Hippocampe again giving you a sense of the scale of this basin. So, an 
important well for us.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question 
comes from the line of Richard Tullis with 
Capital One Securities. Please proceed with your question.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Andy, going back to the EG acquisition that I guess is looking all the more 
attractive with each dollar uptick in Brent oil price. Are ther
e development 
exploitation opportunities that could be somewhat fast tracked to keep 
production up or even increase from current levels next year and especially 
given the improving Brent oil price?
 
Andy Inglis
 
Yes, Richard if you think about the phases of 
what we're doing, all right. 
We're fully understanding the ability to bring some of near field opportunities 
to the existing infrastructure either through exploration, new prospects and 
infill drilling. To do that, we're going to shoot a new seismic survey
, modern 
technology across the surrounding blocks SW and 21 as well as across the 
field. From there we will high grade the drilling opportunities which we would 
start pursuing in 2019 which will be a mix of those potential tie back 
prospects and infill opp
ortunities and we see from the data that we have 
from the existing 3D and some lines across WS and 21, we see significant 
potential for that. But we want to make sure we've high graded it, we've 
done it in a very rigorous way drilling the best things first
. So that's really 
2018 is the dart and 2019 will be the execution. So, what has 2018 become, 
2018 is really about improving the recovery of the existing developed 
resources. As we said on the call it's actually the fields production today is 
gas lift cons
trained, it's at a certain point on the water 
-
 
can't lift any more 
fluid to go further, we need to increasing water injection, you got to be able 
to life it, so you got to be able to put more lift capacity in, how you're going 
to do that it's about conver
sion of the gas lift wells to ESPs, so that's a big 
focus of 2018 really is about advancing that program and that's what we 
intend to do.
 
So obviously the transition of operatorship from ourselves to the Triton
-
Kosmos joint venture and then it's' about get
ting on with optimization of the 
current gas lift and then the conversion of the key wells to water lifts, to 
ESPs that allows us to increase the water injection capacity. So, I think your 
comment is well made, which is hell of a good time to product. Plen
ty of 
opportunity to do it, but we're going to go through it in a sort of phase 
approach which is the best opportunities today driving that near term 
production is from increasing the lift capacity and then we're going to follow 
it up with the continuation
 
of the program into 2019, so supplemented by 
the infill and then the near field exploration.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thank you, Andy that's helpful and that's all from me. Appreciated.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Niki Kouzmanov wi
th 
Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
 
Niki Kouzmanov
 
Maybe if we can go back on TEN, very quickly. I just wanted to confirm with 
you, if you have had permit to specific well locations to start treating as soon 
as you get the rigging early 2018 a
nd then just in terms of gas, you talked 
about Jubilee gas after the foundation volumes, but what about gas from 
TEN including sales gas and actual production that you might need to inject. 
And then maybe if you can just go to more 
-
 
I've seen this morning
 
you 
confirmed the C18 Block farm
-
in there's been in media recently people 
talking about Kosmos maybe taking interest in deal which I think is on a 
different Block, but just you can give us a bit of update on what you see in 
C18 which you think is just out
 
for Lamantin, for the partner side any 
exploration during this time, at this stage and so on? Thank you.
 
Andy Inglis
 
If we just go back to the questions around TEN, is yes, we do have very 
clear objectives to drill as you were the inter [indiscernible] lo
sses around 
little hard on the field. We've obviously had the benefit of the over a year, of 
production which has allowed us to look at the dynamic response of the field, 
which actually the positive when you then come to high grade the drilling 
opportuniti
es to identify the ones that are going to have the most impact. 
So, whilst negative the worse and positives by having early production, 
which analyses to pick the well locations which are going to have the most 
impact. So those well locations are well defi
ned and which would allow us to 
start drilling on TEN in early in the year. So that's kind of done, the 
-
 
in 
terms of TEN, the gas price for both associated gas and non
-
associated gas 
was agreed so there's no further work to be done on that. We have to sor
t of 
finalize the gas sales agreements on there. But in terms of pricing of that, 
that's already been done.
 
So really the optimization of the field will be about integrating the depletion 
planning which is ultimately about ensuring that you're maintaining 
the 
reservoir pressures through water injection and then being able to optimize 
the gas off take and as you know from Jubilee we didn't have the gas off 
take there at day one, it certainly created more challenges in creating that 
right balance. On Mauritan
ia and Senegal, on Mauritania Block C18 you're 
correct. We finalized the farm
-
in, we're planning on shooting seismic in 
2018. I think permits are on place in there and Brian will add a few more 
detail comments.
 
To us I think your same comment around often 
surrounding acreage, is that 
we see Mauritania as a large unexplored basin with significant potential and 
we're at this front end I believe the exploration program to fully define it. 
Let's remember we only have seven wells in the whole basin now. We have 
with Hippocampe, Marsouin two wells. In Tortue, four wells. In Mauritania in 
a huge piece of acreage. And I think that's the message that I want to leave 
with you about the rather get into the detail. Is that we see it as a significant 
basin, multiple sour
ce rocks, multiple reservoir systems and unexplored. So, 
what we're doing is, ensuring that we position ourselves at the front end of 
that entry by getting into the best acreage at the beginning which is 
ultimately when the strategic battle is won. So C18 
is part of that. we see 
potential for different targets around the TF area, as well TF itself and we 
believe we've got differential knowledge today as a result of our drilling 
campaign but also of all the work we've done on the petroleum system and 
we aim 
to optimize that at the front end of this basin which is when the real 
value is created. So, you can expect us to continue this type of acreage 
build.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes, Niki I think just add
-
on to that. I mean a nail on the head again. It's a 
big petroleum
 
system and it's going to continue to get bigger and I 
mentioned in the remarks that the result of Hippocampe well, it probably 
extended the exploration of commercial exploration window deeper than we 
previously imagined. The upper part of the exploration 
window is really 
defined by the TF area, you got to recall, remember that the TF play is 
actually no different many of the plays that we're pursuing in the cretaceous 
further out board, it's just more of a channel system as oppose to a slow 
basin full fan 
system but it's the same geological processes. So, we see 
potential all the way from the early part of the cretaceous all the way 
through to Miocene in this base, we believe the basin is going to get bigger it 
is going to have hiccups like Hippocampe. But 
overall it is going to expand in 
terms of its potential and the entry into C18 is a good example where we 
leverage in our insight and our knowledge and our capability to essentially 
restart the exploration program and C18 is very much for us a potential 
co
ntinuation of the Lamantin trend further north over the mature Albian and 
CT source kitchens and we saw things in there that the incumbent partner 
didn't see and ourselves and BP [indiscernible] formed in to that acreage 
now. So, it will be good follow
-
on 
opportunity for us in the event that 
Lamantin works.
 
Niki Kouzmanov
 
Understood. Thank you very much and just briefly on TEN, so are you 
expecting gas production and gas test to start soon or is that something 
that's going to be pushed back into 2018 as wel
l?
 
Andy Inglis
 
The gas sales agreement needs to be finalized as I said we got a gas price, 
the gas sales agreement needs to be finalized. Once the gas sale agreement 
is finalized which is not faraway gas production in sense, gas sales will be 
possible.
 
Nik
i Kouzmanov
 
Understood. Thank you.

Good day everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Second Quarter 2017, 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, 
let me turn the call over to Neal Shah, Vice President of Finance and 
Treasurer at Kosmos 
Energy.
 
Neal Shah
 
Thank you, operator and thanks all of you for joining us today. This morning, 
we issued our releases regarding our second quarter earnings, which are 
available on the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website. We 
anticipate filing ou
r 10
-
Q for the second quarter with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call today are Andy Inglis, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer; Brian Maxted, Chief Exploration Officer; and Tom Chambers, Chief 
Financial Officer.
 
Before we get started, I'd like 
to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with the forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in 
our earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refe
r to certain the non
-
GAAP financial measures in our 
discussion. Management believes such measures are important in looking at 
the Company's historical and future performance and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided i
n addition to and 
should be read in conjunction with, information contained in our financial 
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our SEC 
filings.
 
At this time I'll turn the call over to Andy.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Thanks Neal and good morni
ng everyone. In my remarks today, I want to 
highlight three things that differentiate the future prospects for Kosmos.
 
First, in a $50 world, Kosmos has and continues to generate significant free 
cash flow. As of the end of the second quarter, we've genera
ted 
approximately $170 million of free cash flow. Additionally, as we announced 
this morning, we had further reduced CapEx from $150 million to 
approximately $100 million, demonstrating our continued focus on capital 
discipline. With production in Ghana re
maining strong, we're confident in our 
ability to deliver in excess of $250 million of free cash flow this year in a $50 
oil environment.
 
Second, we hold a substantial and growing acreage position offshore 
Mauritania and Senegal, a world class basin with s
ignificant undrilled 
potential for both gas and oil. Our activity here is progressing on two fronts, 
advancing the Tortue gas project and to reach FID in 2018 and first gas in 
2021, as well as our continued exploration program offshore Mauritania and 
Seneg
al, where we plan drill three more high impact wells targeting super 
giant prospects starting later this month.
 
Third, our exploration portfolio beyond Mauritania and Senegal is rich in 
opportunity, particularly in Suriname and Sao Tome, where we've been 
m
aturing prospects for drilling in 2018 and 2019. The current environment 
has created a tremendous opportunity for us to build and high grade an 
exploration portfolio aimed at repeating our basin opening success of the 
past.
 
As a result we believe Kosmos re
presents a compelling investment 
proposition both in terms of its upcoming exploration program and the 
development of recent gas discoveries. Consequently, as announced last 
week, we believe now it the right time to obtain a secondary listing on the 
LSE to
 
broaden Kosmos's international investor base. We selected the LSE 
for our secondary listing because of its strong liquidity, reputation with 
transparency and participant's knowledge of the role of frontier exploration 
and development in our industry.
 
I'll
 
begin my review of the second quarter with Ghana, which continues to 
generate the cash that underpins our business growth. At Jubilee, growth 
sales averaged approximately 86,000 barrels of oil per day in the second 
quarter of 2017. During the quarter sale
 
reached an important milestone 
having cumulatively produced more than 200 million barrels of oil. In this 
station we've injected over 320 million barrels of water and our current 
order cut is only 7% supporting our view of the Jubilee as a world class 
res
ervoir and will continue to grow.
 
The partnership is agreed on the need of stabilize the FPSO turret bearing 
which is expected to cause shutdown that should commence around the end 
of the year. The operators estimate that his shutdown will take 
approximate
ly five to eight weeks in 2017, but we continue to work with the 
partnership to shorten this duration. Planning for other remediation work 
namely, vessel rotation and CALM buoy installation is ongoing and expected 
to occur in 2018 and 2019 respectively.
 
Th
e Jubilee partners are focused on minimizing the field downtime 
associated with this work and he operator estimates total downtime required 
of less than 12 weeks cumulatively for the stabilization, rotation and CALM 
buoy installation. Work continues with t
he Government of Ghana to update 
the greater Jubilee full field development plan and the partners remain on 
track to resubmit the plan to the government with approval expected later 
this year. Approval should allow drilling at Jubilee to resume around the 
end 
of the year and would enable us to book additional reserves as we've only 
booked1P reserves for Phase 1 so far.
 
At TEN, gross sales during the quarter averaged 45,000 barrels of oil per 
day, while field and facilities optimization efforts resulted in p
roduction levels 
regular exceeding 50,000 barrels of oil per day. In June, final commissioning 
and testing activities demonstrated that the TEN FPSO and fields can deliver 
volumes in excess of the vessels 80,000 barrels per day name plate 
capacity. We've l
imited well capacity, full year gross sales guidance of 
50,000 barrels of oil per day remains unchanged as to our expectations for 
the three lifting's net to Kosmos.
 
However, we expect production to increase to plateau post the ITLOS ruling. 
The final ruli
ng for ITLOS is expected by September and is anticipate the 
drilling could therefore resume around the end of the year subject to the 
outcome of the Tribunal's ruling.
 
I'll now turn to the world
-
class space in offshore Mauritania and Senegal 
where we remai
n focused on advancing the Tortue gas development and 
fully testing the considerable potential basin through our exploration 
program.
 
Mauritania/Senegal is a largest new petroleum system opened in the last 15 
years along the Atlantic margin. We have alread
y proved that this basin here 
is world class and truly differentiated. With just six wells, we have grown the 
discovered gross resource base for approximately 40 trillion cubic feet. Our 
ongoing technical evaluation and recent 3D data support our view that
 
our 
discovered resource base will continue to grow as we continue to drill.
 
I'll focus first on Tortue, where our partnership remains aligned on delivering 
a low cost LNG project with FID on track for 2018 and first gas in 2021. We 
believe there's no bett
er time to developing a project like Tortue, indeed the 
partnership is leveraging the current market environment along with a novel 
contracting strategy to deliver one of the lowest cost pre
-
FID LNG projects in 
the world.
 
We have several workflows currentl
y underway to meet this timeline. We 
have this drill stem test or DST, which is ongoing and expected to be 
completed this month as planned. The purpose of the DST to demonstrate 
reservoir performance, provide information that will enable us to optimize 
the
 
number of wells and define process, design parameters critical to 
beginning the FEED process later this year. The early results from the test 
validate the key parameters on well rates, reservoir connectivity, and fluid 
composition that underpin the prefer
red development concept.
 
In addition, we continue to progress the commercial agreements principally 
the intergovernmental cooperation agreement, or ICA, and the unitization 
agreement and unit operating agreement with both governments. The ICA 
has been agre
ed by both national oil companies and official government 
approvals and now are being sought from the various ministries as 
evidenced by the inter
-
ministerial meeting in Senegal that being reported 
recently in the press.
 
Over the past months, my team and I
've spent considerable time with both 
governments, including President Aziz and President Sall and we are pleased 
to see continued progress. It's clear to me that both governments remain 
committed to delivering the ice yet a timely manner to allow this pro
ject to 
proceed on the timeline we have described. The project is also making 
headway on the midstream having previously agreed the near shore 
development concept with BP during the first quarter, the partnership is 
currently in negotiations for the midstr
eam solution. These negotiations are 
ongoing and may expect the timing of the midstream provider selection to 
coincide with the commencement of FEED later this year.
 
Beyond Tortue, we continue to explore in the outboard portion of our blocks 
integrate data
 
from recent wells and process and incorporate newly acquired 
3D seismic volumes. Last quarter, we announced the results of our Yakaar
-
1 
exploration well, our sixth consecutive successful one in the basin, which 
marked the beginning of a multi
-
well program
 
to test some of the largest 
prospects identified by the industry in the last several years. In addition to 
be the largest discovery of 2017 in creating a second LNG have been the 
region, the Yakaar results further de
-
risk the key play elements of the basi
n 
for fan fairway demonstrating that the play concept works. This is a positive 
retreat for subsequent wells in our drilling program, which reside in a similar 
geologic setting.
 
Our seismic and AVO tools, critical elements of our play and prospect 
analysis
 
continue to accurately predict reservoir and hydrocarbons and give 
us further confidence in our upcoming drilling. We now have all of our 
acquired 3D in
-
house and the quality and potential of our prospectivity is 
growing as our seismic interpretation prog
resses. We're also seeing 
previously identified prospects improving in definition as evidenced by the 
high level of calibration of our AVO to prospect structure across our next 
three tests.
 
So the team is exciting to resume its running program once the Tor
tue DST 
is being completed later this month with a focus on understanding the oil 
source rocks in the basin. We expect to spur the first of these wells, 
Hippocampe around the end of this month.
 
Let me remind you that Hippocampe is located in Block C8 of 
Mauritania and 
it's comprised of a series of stack basin floor fans in a combination of 
structural stratigraphic trap providing potential for more liquids rich gas 
and/or oil. The well is targeting Cenomanian and Albian age reservoirs 
charged by the Valang
inian, Neocomian and potentially Albian sources. Both 
reservoir targets displayed very strong seismic attribute support for 
hydrocarbons, including calibrated AVO, which conforms to structure. 
Hippocampe is a good example of our prospect to continuing to g
row. We 
previously described Hippocampe as a prospect with a p
-
mean resource of 
over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent or 12 trillion cubic feet of gas 
equivalent. We now believe the potential in and adjacent to into Hippocampe 
is significantly larger ha
ving received an integrated new seismic data into 
our analysis.
 
After doing Hippocampe, we plan to Lamantin in the fourth quarter. 
Lamantin is a basin for fan comprised of campaign age reservoirs, which 
stratigraphically younger than our other prospects in
 
charge from a 
Cenomanian
-
Turonian, Albian oil prone, oil mature source systems. We have 
now received fast
-
track 3D process gathers, which display good distinctive 
AVO in support of the prospect. We continue to view Lamantin as our best 
chance of finding b
lack oil in the basin, given its location in the heart of the 
Cenomanian
-
Turonian, Albian source systems and estimate the p
-
mean 
resource size is 2 to 3 billion barrels equivalent.
 
Following Lamantin, we planned Requin Tigre in Senegal around the year 
end.
 
Requin Tigre is the 60 tcf test of a large basin and for fan, which we 
believe is lighting to more gas prone given its proximity to Tortue and other 
results in Senegal.
 
Aside from my active drilling program, we continue to see opportunities 
grow our exist
ing position of the basin where we have a competitive 
advantage through our proprietary understanding. Given our view that the 
northern part of our Mauritania acreage is likely to more oil prone, we have 
recently farmed into Block C8 in Mauritania, which i
s northwest of our 
current acreage. This additional acreage expands our position in the 
Cenomanian
-
Turonian and Albian oil fairways and provides additional play 
diversity in the basin. We plan to acquire seismic on the block as soon as 
logistically possibl
e potentially around the end of the year.
 
I will now turn to the rest of our exploration portfolio beyond Mauritania and 
Senegal, we have an exploration portfolio rich in opportunity. And within this 
portfolio, we are maturing prospects for drilling in 201
8 and 2019.
 
Suriname is our top opportunity and we plan to drill two wells here in mid to 
late 2018. 3D seismic acquisition is complete and we've received interim 
process volumes in
-
house confirming the multi
-
billion barrel prospectivity of 
the basin. In B
lock 42, our work in combination with our partners, Hess and 
Chevron, has validated our previously identified Aurora trend on the eastern 
portion of the block and has identified additional prospectivity on the Apetina 
trend located on the western portion o
f our block. In Block 45, our 700 
million barrel oil prospect stand out drilling opportunity and recent additional 
seismic has enhanced this definition.
 
In Sao Tome, we're nearly 85% complete with our 3D seismic acquisition, 
which is the largest undertaken
 
in the company's history. Our position here 
is compelling because of its location outboard of the proven Rio Muni basin 
offshore Equatorial Guinea and between the oil seeps on the islands of Sao 
Tome and Principe themselves. We're pursuing a similar basin
 
for a fan 
concept that we have successfully unlocked in Mauritania and Senegal, 
pending a review of the 3D seismic, we plan to drill here in 2019.
 
Beyond Sao Tome, our objective is to create a sustainable rifle
-
shot 
exploration program that delivers econo
mic value and it's up $50 world. This 
objective is enabled by two things. First as an active explorer, we can 
leverage our learnings to new basins just as we leverage the learnings from 
Mauritania and Senegal to acquire our acreage in Sao Tome. Similarly, 
we're 
pursuing new ideas and concepts to create opportunity in other basins along 
the Atlantic margin for drilling early in the next decade.
 
And second, this access is supported by the current market conditions with 
less competition, lower costs, and gover
nments eager to attract a world
-
class explorer. In support of this, I'd like to discuss the formation of the 
Kosmos BP strategic exploration alliance. This expands our relationship the 
previously Mauritania, Senegal, and The Gambia to create a broader Atla
ntic 
margin explorer
-
developer partnership.
 
Our agreement creates the opportunity for long
-
term organic growth for 
both parties through the execution of a joint frontier and emerging basin 
exploration strategy. This alliance will leverage Kosmos' regional 
exploration 
knowledge, ideas, and concept generation capability together with BP's 
deepwater development capabilities, as well as the above ground 
relationships and reputations of both companies.
 
The Kosmos, the alliance enhances our ability to explore mor
e efficiently by 
leveraging the technical resources of BP and reducing cycle times in the 
event of exploration success. We're excited about the creation of the alliance 
and I expect to update you with new developments going forward.
 
So, in summary, we are 
in a great position to continue to deliver shareholder 
value by generating free cash flow in the $50 dollar world and over the next 
18 months, we plan to drill five prospects that are among the industry's 
most significant exploration wells and the world's 
two most promising 
offshore hotspots. The same time period we are progressing the Tortue gas 
developments with FID, which we expect to be one of the lowest cost 
Greenfield LNG developments.
 
I will now turn over the call to Tom to discuss our financial resu
lts. Tom?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Thanks, Andy and good morning, everyone. Kosmos enjoys a strong 
financial position that's enabled us to execute our plan to unlock new 
petroleum systems and to grow the reserves, production, and the value of 
our company organically. 
Our commitment to financial strength and robust 
liquidity and our dedication to rigorous capital allocation continued to 
differentiate Kosmos.
 
As Andy alluded to in his opening comments, the trend of strong cash 
generation continued through June delivering
 
approximately $170 million of 
free cash flow, which was used to repay $200 million in debt. Combining our 
lower cost assets with the commitment to rigorous capital discipline means 
our business can thrive in a $50 world.
 
This morning we renounced to revis
e capital budget of $100 million down 
from $150 million earlier this year. This reduction is driven primarily by two 
factors. First, our team has been actively working with Tortue to optimize 
the FPSO remediation and other activities at Jubilee.
 
This has r
educed both the estimated downtime for stabilization of the turret 
and also the capital required for execution of the other activities. And 
secondly, there have been some one
-
time accounting credits from the 
operator in Ghana attributed to previous accrual
s that were in excess of 
actual amounts incurred.
 
As a result, we expect 2017 CapEx of approximately $100 million of which 
$75 million remains committed to exploration with only $25 million now 
attributable to Ghana. Turning to liquidity, we exited the qua
rter with $1.2 
billion in total corporate liquidity, including capacity on our RBL and RCF 
facilities, as well as available cash.
 
As I just mentioned, we repaid $200 million of debt in the first half of 2017 
and then exited the period with approximately $9
45 million of net debt. We 
plan to continue maintaining significant headroom on both our RBL and RCF 
facilities by ensuring we extend the facilities before RBL amortization begins 
or the RCF reaches maturity.
 
Now, I'll turn to results for the quarter. We f
inished the quarter with three 
crude oil liftings, two from Jubilee and one from TEN in line with our 
guidance. This generated second quarter 2017 oil revenues of $136 million, 
excluding $13 million of derivative settlements. When you add our revenue 
to ou
r sell hedges, it reflects a realized price of approximately $51.21 per 
barrel sold in the quarter.
 
Second quarter revenues were up compared to the same quarter in 2016 as 
a result of lifting two more cargoes including a TEN cargo during the quarter. 
Durin
g this quarter, we also received $10 million of net LOPI proceeds, 
which is slightly less than our guidance due to stronger than anticipated 
Jubilee field performance. Our LOPI coverage for the current claim is now 
complete with this last payment.
 
For the 
second quarter, we generated a net loss of $8.5 million or $0.02 per 
diluted share, adjusting for the impact of one
-
time items that affect 
comparability, including a $25 million mark
-
to
-
market hedging gain, 
accompanying generated net loss of $8.4 million o
r $0.02 per diluted share.
 
On the cost side, operating expense for the second quarter was $22 million 
or $7.41 per barrel versus $20 million or $10.06 per barrel in the first 
quarter of 2017 as a result of greater cost control and a one
-
time accrual 
adjust
ment from the Jubilee and TEN fields' operator.
 
For the quarter, this included approximately $34 million of regular operating 
expense and $5 million of cost attributed to revise operating procedures, 
offset by $17 million in insurance recoveries. Finalizin
g the OpEx related 
LOPI claim during this period accounts for the large insurance recoveries 
recorded in the quarter. Going forward, there will be no insurance offset 
from our LOPI coverage to the increased revised operating costs related to 
this claim.
 
Ex
ploration expense for the second quarter was $20 million and primarily 
attributable to ongoing seismic in geologic and geophysical costs incurred in 
Mauritania, São Tomé, Suriname. Also in the second quarter, other expense 
net totaled $8.4 million, which i
ncluded $6.4 million of non
-
cash charges 
associated with the exploration activities of KBSL.
 
General and administrative expenses were $15 million during the second 
quarter, down approximately 25% compared to the same period in 2016, 
driven by carried costs
 
as a result of the BP transaction and a one
-
time 
accrual adjustment from the Jubilee field's operator.
 
Depletion and depreciation expense for the quarter was $72 million or 
$24.85 a barrel. The per
-
barrel rate reflects an increase from the prior year 
peri
od, which was a result of lifting a cargo at TEN where the depletion rate 
is higher than Jubilee.
 
Taxes were $24 million or approximately $8.14 per barrel with over 80% 
deferred. We continue to maintain our strong hedge position and currently 
our oil 
hedges total approximately 13 million barrels with approximately 4 
million barrels remaining hedged in 2017, approximately 6 million barrels 
hedged in 2018, and approximately 3 million barrels hedged in 2019. The 
company's robust hedging program remains a 
key component of our 
strategy to protect our cash flow's balance sheet and liquidity.
 
I'll now turn to our guidance for the rest of the year. Our 2017 production 
guidance of 11 cargoes net to Kosmos including eight from Jubilee and three 
from TEN remains u
nchanged. Breach of the remaining two quarters, we 
anticipate lifting two cargoes from Jubilee and one from TEN. Cargo sizes are 
expected to be approximately 950,000 barrels.
 
On the cost side we are decreasing our total 2017 production operating 
expense, i
ncluding the impact of anticipated insurance reimbursements for 
Jubilee to approximately $13 per barrel. This is down from $15 per barrel. 
We therefore expect our operating expense with the revised procedures to 
average $16 per barrel in the second half of
 
2017.
 
We also now anticipate lower total G&A in 2017, driven primarily by a 
decrease in cash G&A. Our 2017 full year G&A guidance is now $95 million, 
down from $100 million with the same 55%, 45% cash and non
-
cash split 
respectively. We are now three year
s into this low
-
priced oil cycle and while 
many in the industry have had to modify their business plans to raise 
expensive capital, Kosmos is continuing to execute our plans.
 
We have a solid balance sheet, which allows us to execute our planned work 
progra
m with the potential to drive significant organic growth through the 
drill
-
out of our best
-
in
-
class prospect inventory and the development of our 
significant gas discoveries.
 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, operator, we'd like to open the 
call fo
r questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question
-
and
-
answer session. 
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the line of 
Brendan Warn with BMO. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brendan 
Warn
 
Yes. Thanks gentlemen and thanks for the update. I just wanted to touch on 
the DST results obviously that's been ongoing and you've been announcing 
results before the end of the month. I just want to be really clear my 
understanding what you will be a
nnouncing sort of what you can tell us of 
results to
-
date and just how important it is for the formulation of any 
development plans at all go into the FEED process please.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, good morning, Brendan.
 
Brendan Warn
 
I'll have a follow
-
up questi
on.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, now, clearly the DST is ongoing and we anticipate completing it on 
plan by the end of the month that will enable the spudding of spreading of 
Hippocampe. In terms of the early results from the test as I described in my 
remarks, I th
ink there were three things that we're looking at one is well 
rate. The second is reservoir connectivity. And the third is fluids and across 
all those three dimensions, the early results from the DST underpin the key 
assumptions that went into the preferre
d development concept that we have 
taught you. So for me that's the most important thing. We now are armed 
with the understanding now and the definition that enables us to progress 
with FEED and that FEED is clearly being targeted at the development 
concep
t that we've discussed and underpins the way forward to produce one 
of the lowest cost Greenfield LNG projects pre
-
FID. And all of that is to do 
with fundamentally the quality of the reservoir in terms of high well rates, 
well connected reservoir, and good
 
fluids.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Okay. And just in follow up then I'll stay on call it Tortue and the LNG 
project, you sort of mentioned a noble strategy for the gas or the contract 
for the off take for the gas, if you can just expand on that comment? And 
just what e
lse do we need to see in terms of the process as we go through 
FEED, do we need to see BP call it contracting this gas as a catalyst or a 
need before FID? Just for those in the market could call it believe this 
project in the current LNG call it oil price 
environment.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
As we discussed at the time when we announced the BP deal, there were 
many dimensions to it. There was a dimension about bringing in a world
-
class developer that actually believed in industry led solutions and could 
therefore tar
get a low cost development scheme. That's clearly proceeding. 
We also had access to a company that is a potential buyer of the gas that 
has a large gas portfolio, they could integrate the Tortue gas into their gas 
off take. So we have that as an option tha
t is clearly being further 
developed. As a potential buyer of the gas and we're in conversations 
between ourselves and the government about that as an option but clearly 
evaluating other options against it. But for me one of the most important 
things is th
at we have access to BP's overall gas portfolio to initiate that 
project. And as we've seen by other actions that they've taken in the market 
in terms of accessing gas supply, they believe that's an absolute market for 
this gas at the beginning of the next
 
decade.
 
Brendan Warn
 
Thanks for that. Thanks for the update.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Right. Thanks, Brendan.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Charles Meade
 
Good morning, Andy, to 
you and your whole team there. I wanted to ask a 
question about this BP exploration partnership or alliance that you have. I 
can readily imagine a lot of the benefits that you would get from this 
expanded partnership, but I'm wondering if you can tell us a
bout how you 
thought of that maybe some of the opportunity cost that maybe go along 
with it nothing specifically that you might not have the ability to do up a 
bake off, for example, the Sao Tome, the way you did in Mauritania and 
Senegal. So can you give 
us a little your take on the benefits and what you 
gave up with that?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Interesting, Charles, for me this is about the ability to just sort of seize a 
moment in time to be able to build a sustainable portfolio that works in a 
sub$50 world and I
 
feel that today is an important time to go out and really 
seize those opportunities. And so by building it with BP, there is an 
opportunity to do more today as a result of having the technical resources to 
draw on. There is clear opportunity to do more be
cause the upfront costs are 
lower. This is targeting selected geographies on a 50
-
50 basis, so the 
upfront costs are lower. And then with success, you have the opportunity to 
move to development quicker. You pick your development operator and so 
there is t
hat sort of interregnum as you continue to explore potential praise 
and then bring in a development partner. So those are the factors that we 
way in moving forward with the alliance. And I think in today's world, I 
believe that this is a very positive step
 
forward for the reasons that I've 
described, the ability quote do more, the ability to do it with less upfront and 
the ability to move faster in the events of success. And I think a read 
through of course is that I think it's a positive for the relationsh
ip that we've 
developed in Mauritania and Senegal. Initially we thought about Mauritania, 
Senegal and The Gambia the fact that we want to broaden out I think 
demonstrates that that partnership is working well.
 
Charles Meade
 
Got it. That's helpful, Andy. An
d then if I could ask a question about this 
Block C18, can you maybe perhaps in a similar thing, can you talk about 
how that process went, what you're bringing to that partnership and 
especially in the non
-
op world?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think this is as you kno
w I believe Mauritania and Senegal is a world
-
class 
basin. I think that we're at the front end of opening that basin up. We have 
proprietary knowledge of the basin, its charge system, its reservoir systems 
throughout our six wells and we're leveraging that
 
knowledge into new 
positions. We've grown the acreage position in Mauritania beyond our initial 
three block position when we brought in Block C6 and this is just the next 
step, the block was already taken, so we've gone in a non
-
operator world. 
But it's a
ll about our belief that there's more to go in Mauritania and 
Senegal. And we want to optimize our 
-
 
and grow our position there.
 
Charles Meade
 
Got it. Thanks, Andy.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Great. Thanks, Charles.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from line of Richar
d Tullis with Capital One. Please 
proceed with your questions.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks. Good morning, Andy and Tom. Congratulations on a solid quarter. 
Andy, when you look at the TEN project and you spoke about drilling 
resumption upon eventual ITLOS ruling,
 
how many wells could be needed to 
reach the 80,000 barrel a day gross production level and what sort of timing 
could you be looking at there on a sustained basis?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
I think, Richard, it's a limited number of wells. I think we have actually 
mov
ed the 
-
 
in the last sort of month and a half, we've moved the rate 
actually significantly above the 50, towards the 80,000 barrels a day with 
the existing well stock. So we're talking about a very limited number of wells 
to be able to get it there. And th
en it's a question about a disciplined 
application of capital to ensure that we maintain that. We've also obviously 
tested the facilities above the 80,000 barrels a day. So I think the question 
that follows is with additional drilling, could you push it be
yond nameplate of 
80,000 barrels a day, but it's a limited number of wells.
 
Richard Tullis
 
And then shifting over to Jubilee, the earnings release mentioned 
expectation of increase in proved reserves once the development plan is 
finalized and approved. Wha
t magnitude of 1P increase could you likely see 
there?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, I think, Richard, what we need to do is get the development plan 
submitted and then we'll come forward with those numbers. But I think that 
the way to conceptualize it is to see tha
t that development plan is targeting 
the full potential, the full resource potential of the Jubilee field that it will 
describe the drilling programs that would underpin that. And obviously with 
that development plan approved, we can then move towards the 
sequential 
booking of those 1P resources.
 
Richard Tullis
 
Thanks very much, Andy. That's all for me.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Right. Thanks, Richard.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. 
Please proceed with your questions.
 
Ry
an Todd
 
Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of thoughts on upcoming exploration wells, 
you ran through some of the details around the next couple of wells out 
there of Hippocampe and Lamantin. Can you maybe give a little more color 
on how the prospects 
differ from 
-
 
in terms of your expectations from what 
you've drilled to date differences and similarities and I know you've given 
ranges but maybe anything else you can share on?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Okay. Yeah, thanks, Ryan. I think you sort of 
-
 
the first thing
 
these are 
based on four fans, Yakaar was the first one. And I think the most important 
thing about Yakaar was a, it was a big find in terms of gas resource, build 
that second hub with Teranga in the south of Senegal, but what it proved 
was the concept, th
e prospect concept works, in particular the reservoir 
quality was there. So I think that was the 
-
 
remember this is up four
-
well 
program and we drilled the first one. So one is we've proved that the 
reservoir quality was there. And that's clearly a key ele
ment that of moving 
forward. As you then look at the three wells to be drilled, I think I would 
differentiate them from a sort of gas to oil potential. The third one to be 
drilled which is Requin
-
Tigre is in the south, it's in Senegal, it's adjacent to 
Yak
aar and our view would be that it is most likely a gas, but a large 
prospect, but most likely gas. You then go to the north of the basin in 
Mauritania where we have the proven CT source rock, Lamantin is a source 
by that we believe and therefore we see Lam
antin as our best opportunity 
for black oil. And then in Hippocampe, we have another sort of separate test 
of the source rocks in the Valanginian, Neocomian and Albian source rocks in 
a different setting from Yakaar and Requin
-
Tigre and we think there is a
n 
opportunity therefore because of the different source setting for that to be 
the potential of our liquids rich gas. So I think those are the distinctive 
nature of the three prospects. And they're all world scale. We see an AVO 
supported conformance to st
ructure and Requin
-
Tigre that's 60 tcf resource. 
We see Lamantin as being a 2 to 3 billion barrel oil resource and 
Hippocampe 12 ts of gas or 2 billion barrels of liquids. So that's the range. 
And I think they're all very separate tests. And I think at the
 
end of that 
program we will have generated a significant increase of our knowledge of 
the basin having sort of drilled from the southernmost part to the 
northernmost part and both the prospects on the channels on the slope as 
well as the basin full fan. S
o this is a critical next stage of the exploration 
program and one that we're clearly very excited about given the recent 3D 
seismic that we've just got in
-
house.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Great. Thanks. And then maybe a similar type question on Suriname, it 
looks like we
'll get some activity there in 2018. Can you talk a little bit about 
how 
-
 
what are the similarities in the prospects in Suriname that you're 
targeting relative to some of the success that we've seen in Ghana basin, 
similarities and differences between wha
t you're targeting the other 
successes that we've seen in the region there?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Very similar. I think we see the same reservoir systems, we have same 
source rock and clearly we're benefiting from the success that eggs on Hess 
had in that we now h
ave calibrated AVO. So we see a lot of similarity and it's 
the same structural stratigraphic traps, the same reservoir systems as I 
said, same source rock and therefore we see a very strong read through.
 
Ryan Todd
 
Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks.
 
Andrew
 
Inglis
 
Ryan, thanks.
 
Operator
 
The next question is from the David Gamboa with TPH Partners, proceed 
with your question.
 
David Gamboa
 
Hi. This is David Gamboa of TPH. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a 
quick one on Tortue please. You guys mentioned FID
 
still expected for next 
year first gas still in 2021. If I'm not wrong you mentioned earlier during the 
year that we could potentially see a midstream solution announced by 
middle of this year, I was wondering if you have any update for us on how is 
that 
tracking, what are the milestones? And you mentioned you would 
announce a midstream solution by around the time you start the FEED 
process, I'm just wondering what's the latest on selecting the midstream 
solution for the project please.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah,
 
I think you've seen two things sort of coming together, I think the 
completion of the DST gives us confidence in the fluid composition that's 
clearly a key important part of selecting the midstream solution. So I think 
the key to having access to that dat
a now allows us to actually do the 
necessary prequalification and verification of that solution. So what you're 
seeing Dave is a coming together in a time sense of sort of quote complete 
DST, have the necessary knowledge to optimize the development in a gi
ven 
well right reservoir connectivity fluids that plays into the ability then to kick 
off FEED and that enables you then to be able to decide on the midstream 
solution. So that the coming together now of that information in the sense 
nothing's changed the 
objective is to be able to get to the end of the year 
with that in place so that the FEED can stop.

Our next question is from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. 
Plea
se proceed with your questions.
 
Bob Brackett
 
My question on the secondary listing, I can see the rationale behind it. Can 
you talk about the size potentially of it and the uses of it clearly your 
balance sheet doesn't need additional equity?
 
Andrew 
Inglis
 
Bob, I think this is a very sort of straight forward I think rationale and the 
rationale is around few things. I think one is we feel now is the time to 
access new shareholders given the strength of our story. It's a story as I've 
described in my re
marks built around a real point of departure in terms of 
the exploration program over the next 18 months probably five of the 
leading wells to be drilled in the industry in the two hottest basins in the 
industry today. Clearly of that eighteen months the p
rogression of the 
Tortue development to two FID and a very strong balance sheet, so as you 
say it's not about raising equity, this is actually about broadening our 
international shareholder base and removing some of the structural barriers 
to owning our st
ock. And we have a very strong story I believe to attract 
those investors.
 
Bob Brackett
 
But is the idea to use this issuance to drain down some of the private equity 
money that they don't share, is that the logic?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
No, it's not. I think 
it's you know as I said it's good for all seasons. I think 
the story is strong today and we believe we want to go out and tell that 
story to investors that currently count on those shares.
 
Bob Brackett
 
And so, if you're neutral on the issuance, would you t
ake the London
-
based 
issuance and repurchase shares in the US?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Bob, this is Tom. We are not planning on entering any new shares with this 
listing. So, there is no new shares that are going to go out at all.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Okay. No new shares. It
's just literally just easier access for foreign 
investors?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Correct. That's it.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
You got it, Bob, yeah.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Very good. And then a quick follow
-
up on the DST. Can you comment on 
sort of the peak rate you've observed so far
? Are you waiting to disclose 
that?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
No. Waiting to disclose that like in, say, is the rates we've observed and this 
has fully underpinned the rates that we've assumed in the development 
scheme. These are high rate wells.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Say 100 
or 200 million cubic feet a day?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
We'll advise you later, but we've talked about well rates that are capable of 
200 million cubic feet.
 
Bob Brackett
 
Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Nicky Kouzmanov with Jefferie
s. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Nicky Kouzmanov
 
Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Most of my question have been actually 
asked. But maybe just a couple of clarification points. One is on the sort of 
next milestones and steps to feed. You talked about the 
ICA. What about the 
unitization? Would you need a unitization agreement signed before you 
actually get into feed? Is that unitization agreement just between you guys 
or the governments or the national oil companies have to get involved as 
well? And then on
 
the BP partnership, is it just looking for new licenses or 
would you be able to sort of cross farming into existing position that you or 
BP might have along the target margin? Thank you.
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Okay. Yeah. Hi, Nicky. I'd take the last 
question first. This is about targeting 
new things. Selected geographies, Atlantic margin, 50
-
50 partnership, so 
we're targeting new things. In terms of Tortue, the key staff is getting the 
ICA approved. As you say, it's been agreed by the government. It's
 
been 
agreed by the national oil companies. Now we need approval of the various 
ministries, government approvals, there's a process being kicked off in 
Senegal and you are seeing sort of news reports on that. And there is a 
similar process going on in Maur
itania. The unit operating agreement will be 
between the national companies and ourselves.
 
Nicky Kouzmanov
 
Great. Thank you. And would you be announcing any of these once they are 
completed or?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Sure. Yes, we will. Yeah, yeah.
 
Nicky Kouzmanov
 
Great. Thank you. Thank you, Andy.

Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin with Societe Generale. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
John Herrlin
 
Yeah. Hi. Just some quick ones. Regarding the LOPI insurance, you said
 
in 
your release that you're going to receive a payment in August. How much, 
Tom?
 
Tom Chambers
 
Well, the August payment is reflected in, actually in that. We'll give the $10 
million that we had for 
-
 
that we put in our production and we'll get the last 
-
 
t
he second quarter increased cost of work, which I think was around $17 
million.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay. Then with your London listing, how much is that going to run, how 
much do you think the cost will be?
 
Tom Chambers
 
It's actually very cheap, because it's a s
tandard listing. So, what we can do 
is we can use all of our US filings to satisfy the London listing. So, the actual 
listing itself will be $2 million to $3 million a year.
 
John Herrlin
 
Okay. Great. And last one from me on Hippocampe. How long will it tak
e to 
reach TD?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
We've typically said the wells are around 60 days. So, we've used that as a 
ready reckoner that we'll work on so, we anticipate spudding later this 
month and then 60 days.
 
John Herrlin
 
Great. Thank you, Andy.

Our next question is from the line of Al Stanton with RBC. Please proceed 
with your question.
 
Al Stanton
 
Yes. Good afternoon folks. A couple of questions if I may. Just on the listing 
in London. The thing is people have asked 
about it. Is it purely an instruction 
or is that secondary pricing taking place at the same time?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
No, it's purely an instruction.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. And then, Tom, in terms of the costs on exploration, I had back of the 
envelope rig rate that w
as going to result in you paying a fair amount 
through the second, third, and fourth quarter. I notice Atwood saying that 
you are paying less in the 595. I was wondering if it's materially less and 
perhaps that's why some of the saving has come from 
-
 
for 
the outlook for 
rest of the year?
 
Tom Chambers
 
The 595 is applicable all the way through the current contract, which expires 
in November.
 
Al Stanton
 
And then would the wells continue through December and January? Is that 
-
 
do you take a deal on that?
 
Andre
w Inglis
 
No. We are still in discussions about a new contract if we were to continue 
with Atwood.
 
Al Stanton
 
Okay. Cool. And then finally if I may, I don't expect you to tell us what 
projects you're looking at with BP. But can you tell us some of the thing
s 
that you wouldn't look at perhaps geographically and geologically? I mean 
would we expect to see you talking presold [ph]?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
As you say, I don't want to give away all the thinking. If you just sort of go 
back to the strategic logic of it is t
hat Kosmos is core area of expertise, the 
Cretaceous and the Atlantic margin and actually this is about leveraging that 
knowledge conceptual thinking with a deeper technical resource base from 
BP and the ability to sort of split it upfront in terms of acce
ss costs and then 
be able to move it faster.
 
So, now we remain focused on the things that have actually brought Kosmos 
success today, which is deep knowledge of the Cretaceous. And as I said in 
my remarks, we managed to leverage that thinking from a Ghana 
perspective into Mauritania and Senegal. We've actually leveraged that 
thinking in terms of the basin for fans, the quality of reservoir outboard into 
our concept in Sao Tome how do we apply similar thinking into other 
geographies. So, it's very much about
 
same discipline being able to move a 
little faster than if we were just doing it ourselves.
 
Al Stanton
 
Thanks, guys.

The next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. 
Please proceed with your question
.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from me. On the alliance 
with BP, how will the prospects be selected between the two sides and is 
there a mechanism for sort of abstaining if one side is interested in drilling 
and the ot
her is not?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, yeah, clearly there is a sort of default sort of divorce course. So, we 
have a pre
-
nup. But this is not about that actually, Pavel. I think this is 
about two companies that see things pretty similarly. We've 
demonstrated 
that in Mauritania and Senegal and the ability then to sort of leverage that 
joint thinking into new geographies. Clearly if one party sees something that 
the other party doesn't want to pursue, then they can go along. But our 
objective is cle
arly to do things together.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. And when is the first location as part of the alliance decided?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
The line broke up. Is the first location decided? Is that what you?
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
When do you anticipate making a 
decision on the first prospect that's part of 
the alliance?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
We've already got lots of ideas. So, in terms of areas we're targeting, we 
clearly have selected geographies that we're now working. We're clearly not 
going to divulge those today. A
nd when we make our first points of access, 
we'll obviously make them known to the market.
 
Pavel Molchanov
 
Okay. I appreciate it.

The next question is from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please 
proceed with
 
your question.
 
Neil Mehta
 
Good morning, team. First question is just about how you guys think about 
your hedging program. Can you talk about that with the curve around $50 a 
barrel right now over the next couple of years and that being a level where 
Kosmo
s' economics look relatively attractive? How do you think about 
locking of that?
 
Andrew Inglis
 
Yeah, I'll let Tom follow up. I just said a bit of concerts done. I think that to 
me it's fundamentally about the ability to conduct our business in a $50 
world 
and being confident in our ability to do that and therefore it is a kind 
of flow that we're looking to secure and we're now being bounded by an 
upside which we could capture the points is higher. I think we've done a 
very good job since the inception of Ko
smos to ensure that we had a balance 
sheet that was capable irrespective of the price environment of executing 
the strategy. And in that regard, the kind of nothing's changed, so we see an 
uncertain future in terms of price and we want to ensure that we pr
otected 
the core of the strategy and our ability to execute that by having hedges in 
place that are priced appropriately. Tom?
 
Tom Chambers
 
That's very good Andy, but Neil what I've added to that is, Andy said that we 
want to be able to make sure that the 
business works at $50. So we're 
protecting the downside of $50, so we're also looking and making sure that 
we don't totally block ourselves out of the upside. So we're also looking at 
the upside and we're taking what the curve gives us. In fact, what you'l
l see 
in my remarks that we talked about 
-
 
we've just hedged 2019, we put 3 
million barrels on to 2019 and again it's the same similar philosophy we've 
had along protecting that downside, so the business works in the $50 world, 
but also allowing access to 
the upside should we see a rise in oil prices, so 
that philosophy continues. We've got 6 million barrels in '18 hedge, we'll 
continue 
-
 
before the year is out, we'll finish hedging off 2018 to the tune of 
somewhere between two thirds and 75% of our forecas
ted volumes for 2018 
and then we'll continue on into '19. So the hedging philosophy has served us 
very well in the past. We've collected, since 2015 we've collected over $400 
million worth of proceeds from our hedging program and it's allowed us to 
keep ou
r balance sheet strong and allowed us to continue doing the 
exploration that we need to do that allows us to continue to make the 
interest coverage. So we have no plans on changing that at this point.
 
Neil Mehta
 
That's great, guys. And then the follow up q
uestion is just around cash 
sources and uses. With your operating cash flow providing a base line plus 
the formal proceeds, you're going to be generating a decent amount of free 
cash flow. So I want you to talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking 
about the uses of that cash flow, especially an early look into 2018 at this 
point, recognizing there's a lot that's moving around and so how should we 
think about kind of the '18 CapEx level. And then also how do you weigh the 
return of cash to shareholde
rs if you think the stock is fundamentally 
undervalued via buybacks or given the stability of cash flow coming from 
Africa, how do you think about the dividend? So can you talk philosophically 
about that and maybe drill into wherever you can here?
 
Andrew I
nglis
 
Yeah, I think you sort of pull the question upon. I think the 
-
 
if you look at 
the history of the company, we were very I think thoughtful about entering 
the current downturn sort of post '14 and the restart of the drilling program 
was a very strong 
balance sheet. And we use the period from when 
production started in Ghana in 2010, that four year period to pay down debt 
and we enter that period therefore in advance of an activity set that if it 
delivered success we were able to follow through on it. A
nd I think that's 
-
 
it's a huge important point about our business model is that exploration 
success without the ability than the follow through with appraisal and stay in 
the development, the value will not come through to the shareholders. So I 
feel very
 
strongly that in terms of what we're doing today is using the cash 
flow again to pay down debt, which is what we're doing at the moment. And 
then the strength of that balance sheet is at anticipation of a five well 
program that we believe has real potenti
al to deliver success and therefore I 
follow program. So from my mind I'm thinking about the sources and uses of 
cash in a strategic sense around how we allocate capital and the allocation of 
capital will be to high quality projects that will come through 
from one 
organic program and the ability to have a strong balance sheet enables us to 
fully participate in

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy First Quarter 2013 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, 
let me turn the call over to Brad Whitmarsh, VP of Investor Relations at 
Kosmos Energy.
 
Brad 
Whitmarsh
 
Thanks, Brenda. And thanks all of you for joining us today. This morning, we 
issued our first quarter earnings release, which is available on the Investors 
page of the kosmosenergy.com website, and we anticipate filing our first 
quarter 10
-
Q with
 
the SEC later today. Joining me on the call with our 
prepared comments are Greg Dunlevy, Executive VP and CFO; Darrell 
McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Maxted, our CEO.
 
Following our prepared comments we will have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session.
 
[Operator Instructions]
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earn
ings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Management believes these 
measures are important in looking at the company's historical and future 
performance and these are commonly referred 
to metrics in the industry. 
These measures are provided in addition to and should be read in 
conjunction with our information contained in the financial statements 
prepared in accordance with GAAP and in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I'd like to turn the 
call over to Greg.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared comments this 
morning, I'll review our strong financial performance for the first quarter and 
provide a brief update on our expectations for the remainder of 2013.
 
Overall, our financial performance for the quarter was in line with our earlier 
expectations, including the sale of 2 Jubilee crude oil cargoes. Total 
revenues for the period were $228 million or an average of almost $115 per 
barrel of oil sold.
 
On the cos
t side, oil and gas operations expense for the first quarter 2013 
averaged slightly above $12 per barrel and include certain costs associated 
with drilling rig equipment maintenance. Excluding this amount and certain 
well work over activity, our underlying
 
operating cost was less than $7 per 
barrel, reflecting a benefit of a strong increase in production starting late last 
year.
 
Exploration expense for the quarter was $23 million and included amounts 
related to our ongoing 2D seismic acquisition offshore Ma
uritania as well as 
significant seismic processing and interpretation expense related to 
Suriname and Morocco. We also acquired additional seismic in other areas 
during the first quarter in support of new ventures' efforts as we focused on 
continuing to ad
d strategic new areas to our high
-
impact exploration 
portfolio.
 
As disclosed previously, approximately $10 million of the first quarter 2013 
exploration amount related to the Sapale well. G&A, depletion and interest 
expense amounts were all consistent with
 
our previous expectations.
 
Tax expense for the quarter was $44 million, reflecting strong income 
generated in our Ghana operations. During the first quarter, we effectively 
utilized the majority of our remaining NOL in Ghana and have now moved in 
to a cas
h taxpaying position.
 
Financial results for the quarter also included the impact of the $6 million 
derivative loss which primarily was related to the unrealized change in the 
value of our derivatives contracts. Net income for the period was $0.05 per 
share
.
 
Our strong underlying performance was also reflected in our cash provided 
by operating activities which totaled $67 million after reduction of $61 
million for net change in working capital. This working capital changes 
essentially represent timing change
s in our payables accounts. Excluding 
this, our operating cash flow exceeded our capital expenditures for the 
quarter, which totaled approximately $100 million.
 
Our cash balance as of March 31, 2013 remained robust at approximately 
$500 million, and we end
ed the quarter in substantially the same liquidity 
position as the end of last year with approximately $1.1 billion in capacity 
between our cash and debt availability.
 
With Jubilee generating substantial current and future cash flows, combined 
with our exi
sting liquidity, we continue to be well
-
positioned to internally 
fund our forward operating program, including our growing plans in Ghana, 
as well as our transformational exploration program.
 
At this time, I'd like to provide some brief comments on our exp
ectations for 
the remainder of 2013. Beginning with our CapEx program, we are still 
anticipating total capital spend of approximately $525 million for the year. 
We have sold 3 cargoes Jubilee oil thus far in 2013 and still anticipate selling 
9 cargoes net 
to Kosmos for the full year. Our current expectations are for 4 
liftings in the first half of the year and 5 in the second half.
 
All of our full year cost items remain generally within prior guidance. Our 
Exploration expense guidance, which does not includ
e any risk projection of 
well results, provides a quarter
-
to
-
quarter fluctuations primarily as a result 
of the timing of seismic and G&G expenditures. In the second quarter, we 
anticipate an increase in Exploration expense from the first quarter, mostly 
re
lated to our ongoing 2D seismic acquisition program, offshore Mauritania, 
where we also plan to commence a 3D program in June.
 
Tax expense is often a bit more challenging to guide to. We anticipate our 
total tax expense per lifting going forward to be cons
istent with our amount 
from the first quarter this year, particularly if Brent remains $100 per barrel. 
The amount of our current tax versus deferred will still fluctuate somewhat 
quarterly however, we would anticipate moving to a higher current portion 
to
wards the latter part of the year. The first quarter was a good start to the 
year for Kosmos, as we generate strong cash flows and maintain substantial 
liquidity to execute our future plans. Now I will turn the call over to Darrell 
for an operations review
.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Thanks, Greg. As mentioned, strong performance at Jubilee has continued 
through the early part of 2013, with the field exhibiting continued high well 
deliverability, good reservoir communication and conductivity and high FPSO 
uptime. P
roduction averaged approximately 104,000 barrel of oil per day for 
the first quarter.
 
On the Phase 1A program, we continue to be encouraged with the 2 
producing wells currently online, seeing no degradation of 
--
 
or scaling 
effects in either of the wells t
o date. The first of these wells have now been 
on production for over 5 months, given our further encouragement that the 
modified drilling and completion designs are working well. Our 
implementation of the Phase 1A program was impacted significantly in the
 
first quarter by extended downtime of the Transocean cycle energy rig, 
which resulted from a number of equipment maintenance issues. The drilling 
rig has now resumed activities and we anticipate executing the remainder of 
the program throughout 2013 and i
nto the early part of 2014.
 
Jointly with our partners, we continue to work on the assessment of 
potential debottlenecking opportunities on the FPSO. Near
-
term plans 
include rewheeling the gas compression system, which is expected to be 
completed by the end
 
of the third quarter of this year. In addition, we 
continue to study longer
-
term options for production enhancement on the 
FPSO analyzing all of the major components and systems, including gas 
injection, water support and oil capacity.
 
Looking forward, we
 
anticipate production to exit the year at a record level, 
supported by existing well deliverability, FPSO debottlenecking, as well as 
the additional Phase 1A producers to be brought online through the year. We 
are prepared to commence gas export to the on
shore gas network system 
when it is completed. Previous indications suggested that the gas system 
would be fully operational towards the latter part of this year. However, 
given the possibility of delays beyond the end of the year, we are currently 
studyin
g multiple options to ensure sufficient gas handling capacity. We 
continue to discuss with our co
-
venturers and the government, the path 
forward for the approval of the 10 plan of development, which was 
submitted in November of last year. The FPSO and subs
ea tender reviews 
are both in the final optimization phase with awards expected upon PoD 
approval.
 
During the first quarter, we successfully drilled the Enyenra
-
6A appraisal 
well, nearly 3 kilometers south of the Enyenra
-
4. Results of the well, which 
inclu
ded 18 meters of net pay, indicate a deeper than expected oil water 
content. Enyenra
-
6 has now been suspended for future use in the 10 
development program.
 
On the West Cape Three Points Block, we continued to mature our appraisal 
and delineation plans for 
Mahogany, Teak and Akasa areas. We recently 
received an extension of the Teak appraisal period, which further aligns the 
appraisal of this field and supports the ultimate development as a tieback to 
the Jubilee FPSO. Combined, our Ghana assets represent a 
world class 
petroleum system and a platform from which we will grow the company. Let 
me now hand it over to Brian.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Thanks, Darrell. I want to transition today's discussion from the ongoing 
production and development programs in Ghana, to 
our high
-
impact 
exploration program elsewhere, which focuses on marking new petroleum 
systems in the near future.
 
Earlier in 2013, we have taken a number of strategic steps in progressing 
our exploration plans. These include a further expansion of our inve
ntory of 
high
-
impact opportunities and a maturing of existing assets, the drill
-
ready 
stage. The prevailing competitive environment for high
-
quality exploration 
opportunities continues to be very intense.
 
Accordingly, we are leveraging our strategic insigh
ts and contrarian thoughts 
to try and differentiate ourselves in identifying new options to stay ahead of 
the industry. This strategy is expanding our technical playing field on that 
business of horizon. Ultimately, with us transitioning from primarily a W
est 
African explorer to more of an Atlantic margin player going forward. We're 
expanding our geographies and pursuing alternative exploration themes in 
support of building a portfolio which exposes Kosmos to multibillion barrel 
potential over the next seve
ral years.
 
We have an active new ventures program going on and we're aggressively 
pursuing a number of attractive opportunities. Most recently, execution of 
our strategy has led us into the highly perspective Porcupine Basin, offshore 
the West Coast of Ire
land, where we were able to sign multiple farm
-
in 
agreements earlier this year. This opportunity provides us the chance to 
leverage our technical understanding and explore an overlooked, forgotten 
basin with a new perspective. Previous drilling in the area
 
was proven in 
working hydrocarbon system, with both oil and natural gas generated 
primarily by Jurassic salt rocks. To date, the industry has overlooked the 
Cretaceous hydrocarbon hydrocarbon potential.
 
Spec to these seismic data suggest the number of siz
able stratigraphic plays 
with significant upside which we'll target with a 3D program later this year. 
In addition to the Ireland capture, we have a number of other near
-
term 
new venture possibilities underway, all focused on building out our asset 
invento
ry to deliver substantial drilling opportunity each year going forward. 
The first of these drilling opportunities is currently ongoing at the Sipo

prospect on shore Cameroon and Ndian River Block. Drilling had progressed 
slower than anticipated, however,
 
we are now approaching the targeted 
depth and we anticipate results relatively soon.
 
In support of maturing our existing assets to the drilling stage, we're in the 
midst of executing these seismic programs and integrating interpretation of 
the state into 
our or petroleum system analysis. At the same time, we are 
focused on attracting strategic license partners to our areas to join our 
exploration efforts, mitigate risks and manage costs. In Mauritania, we're 
leveraging our exploration understanding to purs
ue a similar petroleum 
system concept to the Tano Basin in offshore Ghana. We're in the process of 
acquiring seismic data with 2D shoot [ph] currently underway that will cover 
the entirety of our 27,000 square kilometer position. Data acquisition for 2D 
sh
ould be completed later this month, and we then anticipate to launch 3D 
program to commence following this.
 
Across the Atlantic in our offshore Suriname position, we have recently 
received a fast track processing volume and anticipate the final data set to
 
proceed later this year. We are pleased with the early look at the 
prospectivity from what we've seen today. Our plans on moving forward 
quickly to commence a multi well drilling program offshore Morocco, as early 
as late this year. In the Agadir basin, o
ur interpretation of the most up
-
to
-
date pre
-
stack time and depth seismic volumes are very encouraging. The 
southern acreage continues to be de
-
risked through reprocessing, and as we 
refine the prospectivity of this massive 50,000 square kilometer position
, 
we'll be targeting petroleum systems with very substantial potential.
 
Critical steps in the preparation for drilling included finalizing all our 
prospects, securing rig capacity and completing the farm
-
out of our acreage. 
These processes are all currentl
y underway.
 
Through the identification capture and maturing of our exploration portfolio 
to the drilling stage, we are delivering substantial risk value upside for 
Kosmos. Combined with our reserve and production growth opportunity in 
Ghana, I'm confident 
we're building the right exploration portfolio which we 
believe will continue our track record of creating significant shareholder 
value through a new field discovery and follow

It's Brendan Warn from Jefferies. I guess asking a question a
bout your 
activities on the horizon and certainly focused on Morocco, and I appreciate 
it's still early in terms of starting that program, but can you give us some 
sort of indication of, call it, net perspective resource that would be tested 
over 2014? And
 
you may want to frame it in just in this number of wells or 
exploration spent in the region please?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes. It's Brian. We're in 2 potential petroleum systems in offshore Morocco, I 
think, as you all know, in the north in the Agadir basin whi
ch is a pre
-
 
and 
post
-
 
salt play, and then to the south, we've got a larger tradition [ph] 
offshore southern Morocco, which covers the guts of the Aaiun basin. And 
both of these are multibillion barrel opportunities. We did release some 
potential numbers o
n Southern Morocco as part of our IPO prospectus a 
couple of years ago. We continue to refine the potential in terms of both 
volume and indeed, in reducing risk and we're very pleased with the 
progress we've made in those assets. In the north, the evaluati
on is now 
coming together, that the acquisition of the acreage was, in the last couple 
of year, as you know, we're now going to final versions and volumes of our 
seismic data in, and that's coming together very nicely and the geologic 
concepts with which w
e entered that basin are being proven out from the 3D 
seismic programs that we've acquired. So that we've got, as we hope to 
have in all of our strategic opportunities, significant play diversity and 
multiple prospects to test in, in what is an aggregate, 
a multibillion barrel, 
untested, albeit frontier portfolio but with all the necessary elements of our 
working petroleum system present. The key issue is obviously, when and 
how are we going to test that prospectivity. We've indicated previously to 
the mark
et that will be as early as the end of this year. We currently, in the 
midst of a procurement program, for a rig or rigs to undertake that program. 
We expect that program to continue through 2014, and probably, the 
exploration of these basins will be in a 
series of phases. I don't expect 1 or 2 
wells to condemn these petroleum systems, and I think to fully test or as we 
say, give the geology a chance to work, we'll be seeing several wells needing 
to be drilled over the course of several years.

Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. In terms of 2014, so you see one rig just drilling back

to

back across 
a couple of your regions, I'm just trying to frame what do we price in, in 
terms of the upsize for 2014?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, I thin
k you need to think of it in terms of we've got 2 opportunities; 
north and south Morocco, we hope to test both. In the south, we have 
several place [ph] plays and play fairways [ph] to test, but there is more 
dependency in the south than in the north. And 
therefore, we see probably 
the initial program involving more wells in the north over the course of the 
first phase of the exploration program, both to test the post
-
sell 
prospectivity and the presell prospectively as well.

With Cameroon, when do you expect the well's 2D and has it, even though 
you've had delays is it working out with your seismic model?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes. C
ameroon has proven quite challenging both from a logistical 
standpoint, above the ground and then drilling, as I mentioned in the notes, 
is going a little bit slower than we'd anticipated. But we are close to target, 
as I mentioned, but we'd expect to be f
inished sometime later this month. 
Assuming that we don't encounter any major, further major drilling issues. 
We've just shot a VSP in the well, and that has confirmed the structural 
configuration of our primary target trap. And we're encouraged from the 
o
bservations in the well, thus far, but we haven't yet reached the target. But 
we expect [indiscernible] in the next couple of weeks.

With respect to Morocco and partnering, are you trying to 
partner to get, 
perhaps, exposure to other basins or just get a cash paying partner?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
The answer to the cash paying partner is it's always nice to get, to leverage 
returns, of course, through farm
-
ins or farm
-
outs. But our priorities are 
--
 
the first point you mentioned of potential swapping acreage is a priority, 
probably more of a secondary priority. What we fundamentally focused on is 
getting the right partner that's going to join us in the right exploration 
program, which as we talked ear
lier with Brendan, is about staying the 
course to test frontier basins that have significant play diversity. In other 
words, we don't want to drill just 1 well and walk away and we need 
partners that we feel are strategically aligned to us and technically 
aligned in 
the way they about exploration and that's our priority. As well, of course, in 
the event that we're successful at the scale we hope to be, we would hope to 
have a partner on board that has got both the balance sheet and the 
technical and operati
onal capability to be significantly contributing through 
the appraisal development production stages.

Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Crédit Suisse.

Just a quick quest
ion on Ghana, just obviously, you and Darrell have 
mentioned, the Enyenra has got the deeper oil wells contact. I guess, you 
probably refer to the operated about fishing [ph] in case that's changed your 
view of the results potentially, maybe just to remind
er of what you think the 
TEN development holds?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, Ed, let me make a couple of comments and then maybe Darrell can add 
on here. Yes, it's always nice to drill delineation wells down there [ph] and 
find more oil than you anticipated. I thi
nk we have a reasonably good handle 
on the static side of the TEN project in terms of volumes. The key issue in 
terms of recoverable reserves in TEN is around recovery factor and field and 
performance and how many wells do we need to drill and ultimately w
hat 
the recovery factors are. Of course, to understand that better, we need to 
switch the field on, which is what the development is all about in terms of 
phasing it to allow us to understand how this reservoir performs, and then 
optimize the full field de
velopment. So we are encouraged by the appraisal 
[ph] results, but ultimately, the final answer is going to be as it's beginning 
to be in Jubilee, with understanding the dynamic reservoir performance of 
this field.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
I agree with that, tha
t the dynamic piece of it is the key item and the upside 
we saw in some volume within the range that we previously talked about 
P10, P90.
 
Edward Westlake

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay, and I guess, and any additional math, any updates on Jubil
ee 
reserves which you could share from the production data from the wells that 
you're drilling?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
No specific update, we will just continue to say that we've got this wonderful 
problem of debottlenecking because the reservoirs are performing 
so 
spectacularly and it continues to be so and now that we've resolved the well 
productivity issues, we're seeing the true potential performance and upside 
in this field. And we think there is multiple opportunities for increasing the 
recovery factor in th
e field, given the performance that we've seen to date.

Just another question on Ghana on the TEN dev
elopment, could you just 
outline what the outstanding hurdles are and I think Paul [ph] mentioned 
there's a somewhat of a stumbling block with regard the gas prices, if you 
could explain that?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, Anish, Brian again. Well, look, I think yo
u have to step back and take a 
broader perspective things to start with. You look back at the Jubilee 
development, that took 
--
 
PoD there took essentially 9 months to get 
resolved and been finalized and signed and approved. We're still within that 
timefram
e on TEN. TEN is interesting in 2 things: one, just like Jubilee, it 
was submitted to the government just prior to an election, in this case, we 
didn't get the government changed but we did get a new administration with 
a new president. And I think that's 
one issue that we need to think about in 
terms of the timing of the approvals. The other is it's different in a sense 
that there's a significant amount of associated in and non
-
associated gas in 
this development, which brings into play the strategic resour
ce that's 
important to Ghana, of the gas and making sure that the developments and 
the timing of that development and the pricing of it is right, because 
obviously, the Ghana is setting some precedence in these negotiations. And 
I think as Toa [ph] probabl
y shared, that is one of the challenges at the 
moment, but it's in negotiation. And everybody is aligned and committed to 
getting the right compromise here to move the odd [indiscernible] forward. 
And indeed to bring the gas to shore, to generate power, gi
ven the country's 
current dependence on gas imports and the burning of oil for power 
generation, which obviously, they want to get away from quickly. So 
everybody's motivated to get this done, it just needs to 
--
 
it's a process and 
tell them [ph] on behalf
 
of the partnership and negotiate with the 
government on it. So I just see it as something that's 
--
 
it's working and it's 
playing, we'll get done here sooner or later.

Just o
ne follow up, on the MTA fields, I'm just wondering, if you could outline 
a bit more detail, your current view in terms of the appraisal plan over 
there?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes. And we've recently got an extension on the Teak appraisal period there. 
I think w
e've previously declared that we're trying to integrate the MTA 
discoveries together in an integrated appraisal and development program, 
which is also in the process of negotiation with governments and this 
continues to move forward. And I think as we've p
reviously indicated, that 
we see the most likely development solution and for those discoveries being 
tie
-
in to the Jubilee facility. And we continue to work towards finalizing the 
appraisal program, which we've now largely agreed with the government. 
And 
putting that program together to lead towards a clear develop 
--
 
phased 
development plan here in the next few years. So that's where we are with 
MTA today, and I expect some progress to be made on that probably after 
the TEN PoD has been resolved. We'll se
e a government and partner focus 
on resolving the MTA development plan.

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
You guys were one of the first in to Morocco, and 
while I appreciate another 
race, there' s perception at least over here the likes of Genel and Cairn have 
perhaps overtaken you, in terms of drilling the first wells there, are you 
taking a slightly different approach to risk? Or is it rig contracting that
 
appears to have slow down your progress? Or am I just, as I say, too 
worried of news like that?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
It's Brian again. Look, it's one of our key drivers to our exploration strategy 
is to be first in. And as you correctly pointed out, we pretty 
much were first 
in, which gives you a choice, we're very happy with the choice that we've 
made in terms of the acreage we've got, the first thing. The second thing is 
what is crucial to our Exploration process is which as you know, we refer to 
as rifle sho
t exploration and concentrated portfolio, it's really around making 
sure if you're not drilling as many wells as others might be in a shotgun 
exploration approach, in a rifle shot exploration approach, you better do 
your homework up front and make sure you
 
are drilling the right wells, more 
so than if you're drilling more wells. And really that it's a reflection of that, 
we're doing an enormous amount of petroleum system analysis work, we've 
shot a lot of seismic data, we're integrating that very, very care
fully into our 
analysis. I think the other point to make relative to other players in the 
region is Cairn, for example, did farm
-
in, in the Agadir base in to a project 
that has already been matured over a couple of years. But then further 
south, both them 
and Genel are in, I'm presuming, a different play which is 
in shallow water, and in many respects, is a much simpler play. We have a 
substantial play diversity created by the salt in the area which requires a lot 
more work to do than maybe some of these si
mpler plays on the carbonate 
plays on the shelf, which in particularly Cairn and Genel are pursuing. So I 
would argue that that's the reasoning. We've always said that it's not how 
quickly to drill, it's whether you drill the right wells and being patient 
in 
exploration, historically has been a big key to our success. And that provides 
us with charges with you guys, of course, but we will remain disciplined 
around our exploration workflow and process.

And then if I could just quickly add a follow on question, I mean, you stress 
the Atlantic player tag, are you prepping us for a move into West Shetland, 
Norway, Greenland?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
I think if you're a Deepwater Cretaceous player as we are to a lar
ge extent, 
you have to open up, and particularly in a very competitive environment in 
Sub
-
Saharan in Africa where following our success in the transfer margin, 
the industry followed us very quickly and the opportunity window closed real 
quick and is only n
ow beginning to open in certain areas, we have to look 
further afield. And a lot of the ideas and thoughts that we have that we 
evolved several years ago in the South Atlantic are just as appropriate to 
some of the north Atlantic areas, further north such 
as Ireland. We, again, 
have a very measured approach toward expanding our geography before, 
because we're very cautious about strategy and ensuring that we don't lose 
competitive advantage by diluting ourselves over too big a geography. So if 
we do move fu
rther out from where we are, whether that is south into 
Namibia or in Uruguay or north into the West of Shetland, or offshore 
Canada, we will do it in a very disciplined way. But Ireland was a clear 
opportunity for us where we saw many similar opportunitie
s conceptually to 
some of the things we were exploring further south.

Going 
back to Ireland, where does this rank 
--
 
out of 6 countries, where 
does this rank in your kind of priority list, if you will?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Well, we are 
--
 
we don't think of countries, we think of petroleum systems. 
But you're right, from that, we're now
 
in 6 or so petroleum, well, a few more 
petroleum systems than 6 actually, we're in 7 or 8. And because we've got a 
concentrated portfolio and because our exploration strategy's trying to 
deliver success with a few number of wells to minimize finding [ph] 
costs, 
every project is important to us. The difference is, is that some projects are 
at the drilling stage, such as Sipo, and that's a priority for us. Some are in 
maturing the prospects to the drilling stage such as Morocco, that's 
important to us, and s
ome are at the very early stage, either the geological 
concepts stage or the seismic stage, and they're also important to us. So 
you'll see as moving forward with Ireland, subject to the necessary 
government approvals here, reasonably quickly, and just lik
e we did in 
Morocco, just like we did in Mauritania and just like we did Suriname, we will 
hope to be very quickly acquiring 3D seismic data here because I think as 
you're probably aware, there's just no 3D seismic over any of this well, very 
limited 3D se
ismic over this space and none over the areas that we're 
working. So we need to move forward with that reasonably quickly, and 
Ireland will be a priority for us.

Okay. And then back to G
hana, I think one of the other questions mentioned 
the gas issue as a potential hurdle to getting TEN development approval, are 
you kind of behind schedule of where you would hope to be by this point in 
time or is it on track?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, I mean, 
we're very careful to make any promises when you're 
negotiating, particularly in Africa. We've always said it'd be around the 
middle of this year, that was really based on what we saw and how we saw 
the process involving of Jubilee, and then in the origina
l plan of development 
and then in the Phase 1A process that occurred 18 months or a year ago 
--
 
or so ago. So we're about there, needs to get done here reasonably soon. 
But I think as I said earlier, I think all parties are motivated. But it's 
--
 
given 
it'
s involving gas which is a strategic resource for the government, they are 
taking a great deal of care and making sure they've got terms that makes 
sense for them in the very long
-
term future. And we respect that.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Just a follow on around the capital program, obviously, this year, $525 
million, but as you go forward, you're going to be spending more on TEN 
plus also drilling
 
deep offshore wells, obviously, we don't know the carrier, et 
cetera, just I mean it seems like you have a lot of liquidity, but any 
comments as to how you think that will be funded?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
I'll let Greg take that one.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
I think, as
 
I mentioned in my earlier comments, we are well
-
positioned with 
cash flow from Ghana and liquidity within the company's capital structure to 
meet all of our currently anticipated needs, which includes all development 
in Ghana, all the exploration benches 
we are currently in, plus a number we 
would anticipate entering into over the next several years. That and an $85 
planning deck that we run at. As you will note, oil prices are a bit above $85 
of late and have continued to stay there. I think from a specif
ic number, 
$525 million is still our target for this year, given timing in TEN expenditures 
and the couple [ph] multiyear development cycle, we probably, we expect 
next year to be a little bit higher than this year, but not a whole lot as we 
shift more fro
m Jubilee expenditures to TEN expenditures then doubling up 
on expenditures. So I don't think you'll see material ups or downs in Ghana 
in the next couple of years as we just move from different parts and phases 
of development or different fields of develo
pment there. In terms of the 
exploration program, we have a very good handle on costs. We don't 
assume we're going to get promotes on wells so we're conservative on our 
assumptions. And given all that, I still think we're very well
-
positioned 
financially, 
as I mentioned earlier, to meet all of our anticipated needs and 
forecast needs at an $85 price tag.

Good day everyone, welcome to Kosmos Energy's Fourth Quarter and Year 
Ended 2011 Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. 
At this time let me turn the call over to Brad Whitmarsh, VP of IR at Kosmos 
Energy. Please go 
ahead sir.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
Thanks operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Hopefully you 
have seen the news releases that we issued this morning including our 
fourth quarter and full year results as well as our 2012 capital program. 
Later to
day we expect to be filing our 10
-
K with the SEC, you will be able to 
find these items on our new website at kosmosenergy.com.
 
Joining me on the call today are Brian Maxted CEO, Greg Dunlevy, Executive 
VP and CFO, Darrell McKenna Chief Operating Officer an
d Paul Dailly, Senior 
VP of Exploration.
 
After our prepared remarks, we will have time for a question and answer 
session. I would ask that you keep your questions to one primary and one 
follow up so that we can get to all who are on the call today.
 
Before 
we get started, I would like to mention that this conference call 
include certain forward
-
looking statements which are based on our current 
expectations. The risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have 
been outlined in the earnings release, and i
n our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures such as EBITDAX, 
or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, DD&A and Exploration. The management 
believes these measures are important in looking at the company's historical 
and future pe
rformance, and these are commonly referred to metrics in our 
industry.
 
Historical non
-
GAAP performances reconciled to the directly comparable 
GAAP measure in our earnings release. These measures are provided in 
addition to not as an alternative for and sho
uld be read in conjunction with 
the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance 
with GAAP. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian.

rst 
comment on 2011, a year of significant accomplishment for Kosmos, and 
then secondly folks on our strategic goals and plans for 2012. Greg will 
follow with a discussion about fourth quarter results and then provide an 
overview of our 2012 capital progra
m.
 
2011 was a big year for our company. It was a year of meaningful 
transformations for Kosmos in many ways. Obviously one of our largest 
accomplishments was becoming a public traded company in May of last year. 
We also began a significant transition of th
e organization, largely driven by 
our exploration development success. We made a lot of progress with this 
initiative over the last year.
 

Operating Officer with us on the call today. Dar
rell joined Kosmos earlier this 
year, and he is responsible for leading our operations, production and 
development teams as well as [indiscernible] and procurement. His 
background and significant expertise in development of oil and gas resources 
are a grea
t fit for Kosmos particularly at a time when we are facing 
significant growth and capital investments in ongoing major projects.
 
Paul will wrap up the operating discussion with a review of our substantial 
exploration and appraisal drilling program in 2012,
 
as one of the ongoing 

plans to grow organically through exploration success. Our highest priority is 
to find new [indiscernible] systems of size with a focus on frontier emergin
g 
basins. To that end we had a number of strategic opportunities in the 
portfolio last year providing Kosmos with exposure to multi billion barrel 
hydrocarbon discoveries.
 
It was a year of outstanding results in our exploration appraisal programs in 
2011 a
s we continue to maximize the value of the petroleum system we 
opened in the Tano Basin, offshore Ghana. We announced four new 

history.
 
In addition we apprised a number of our existi
ng fields progressing several 
towards major plans for development. We bought production and cash flows 
on stream from massive Jubilee field lifting nearly 6 million barrels of crude 
net to us in 2011, and generating significant revenues for the company. Th
e 
Jubilee reservoir is performing very well and information to

field wide pressure support suggesting confidence on ultimate recovery.
 
Looking back our phased development approach was the first right step for 
Jubilee bringing cash flows onlin
e quickly and allowing us to get early 
production earnings.
 

gaining reservoir and production information. Second, we will be evaluating 
production enhancement options for Phase 1. Th
ird, will be executing on the 
next phase of development in the field, Phase 1A.
 
We are making good progress towards optimizing well drilling and 
completion design in support of full field development. This is a world class 

 
will prove beneficial to the remaining 
phases of Jubilee and for the developments in Ghana.
 
We are pursuing an active exploration appraisal drilling program in 2012 
with plans to participate in nine wells during the year in our base program. 

ng the Tweneboa, Enyenra, and Ntomme complex with a goal 
to submit the plan on development of these fields in 2012.
 

at Teak, Mahogany and Akasa, focused on further de
-
risking 
the resource 
base of these discoveries and defining an optimal integrated development 
concept. These discoveries have positioned us for significant reserves and 
production growth as we go forward.
 
Three of our Ghana wells in 2012 will be testing new explor
ation prospects 
which offer significant new resource potential. In addition, we anticipate 
initiating our first operated well in Cameroon late in the year as well. Net to 
us we estimate our exploration programs to be testing in excess of 250 
million barrel
s of oil equivalents on the mean basis combined this year, so 

 
Earlier this week we announced that we have exercised the right to increase 
our share in the deepwater tunnel block by acquiring the interest of a
nother 


exploration campaign. It made a lot sense for us particularly in the area we 
know so much about, we were 
fortunate to be able to take advantage of it 
because of a strong financial position.
 
While we continue to enhance the value of our Ghana asset we also 
aggressively but very selectively expanding our exploration portfolio to 
discover more substantial petrol

9 million gross acres in new areas since our IPO. We have now built a 
leading acreage position in two basins offshore Morocco, and we have 
captured substantial exploration opportunity offshore in Suriname, which 
re
presents our first acreage acquisition outside of Africa.
 
This is all in trend from recent proven petroleum system in French Guinea. 
We applying for seismic data in both areas during 2012 as we prepare for 
potential drilling in 2013 and 2014. We will conti
nue to add strategic new 
opportunities to our portfolio throughout the year. We took a number 
execution on exploration strategy and business strategy in 2011, as the firm 
belief that we will keep up momentum moving forward in 2012 and indeed 
the years to f

 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you Brian. I would like to start off by commenting briefly on 2011 
then focus time on our 2012 capital program and certain directional 
guidance for those of you who model Kosmos. Brian mentioned ear
lier that 
2011 was a year of significant accomplishment for us and that was certainly 
true in looking at the financial aspects of our business.
 
Over the last 12 months we have generated substantial cash flows from 
Jubilee, successfully completed our IPO an
d secured a new $2 billion debt 
facility early in 2011. Another highlight came just a few weeks ago as we 
executed a separate agreement with the IFC bringing them in as 25
th
 
lending 
institution in our debt facility. We exited 2011 in a strong position with
 
cash 
of over $670 million and ample financial flexibility to execute our capital 
programs within next few years.
 
Late in 2011 the Jubilee unit partners moved forward with the acquisition of 
the FPSO. We have previously funded a portion of the cost 
under an advance 
payment agreement. So our net remaining amount was approximately $100 
million. This resulted in our long term debt at the year end being up slightly 
from the prior quarter. We reported a net income for the fourth quarter of 
$34 million or 
$0.09 per basic and diluted common share. With our IPO in 
May of 2011 there are no equivalent per share numbers for 2010.
 
Two Jubilee liftings net to Kosmos combined with a strong realized pricing 
led to more than $220 million in revenues for the quarter. 
On costs, our 
production cost per barrel was consistent with the prior period in the $12 to 
$13 range. Exploration expense was comprised primarily of seismic 
expenditures as we continue to have a high rate of drilling success. DD&A 
per barrel was up in the
 
fourth quarter showing the impact of the FPSO 
purchases in December as well as the recording of year end 2011 reserves.
 
G&A costs were relatively consistent with the third quarter of this year with 
non
-
cash long term equity compensation put in places in c
oncert with our 
IPO compromising about 50% of this amount. I want to transition to our 
expectations for 2012 where we are making significant investments focused 
on both near term and long term growth.
 
Our anticipated organic capital program for the year is
 
planned at around 
$600 million, approximately 55% of these investments are allocated to 
exploration and appraisal where we have a very active appraisal campaign 
for our Ghana discoveries and we will be participating in at least four 
exploration well tests
 
in Ghana and Cameroon. The remaining 45% of the 
2012 organic capital program is planned for development. Primarily for 
Jubilee, but there is a little predevelopment capital for the Ten project.
 
At Jubilee, the budget provides for up to three additional si
de tracks of 
existing Phase 1 wells in addition to serving other Phase 1 enhancement 
activities. We were also being excluding the next phase of development at 
Jubilee Phase 1A drilling a number of new producers and objectives. As Brian 
mentioned, we feel f
ortunate to have exercised our right to increase our 

4.05% deepwater tunnel interest. As a result our interest in the deepwater 
tunnel block, which includes the next oil development of
fshore Ghana and 
multiple exploration prospects will increase from 18% to 22.05%.
 
Our Jubilee unit interest grew was 24.1% to 25.8%. The transaction is 
expected to close by mid year and we are excited about the enhanced 
opportunity set for us in Ghana.
 
The
 
impact of the additional interest to our drilling and development capital 
programs will be an incremental $40 million subject to the closing of this 
transaction. You will also hear us talk today about certain contingent wells 
that we will drill this year 
which includes up to three appraisal wells and two 
exploration wells as well as other related activities. These items are 
dependent on the success of our firm well program and the potential 
acceleration of our exploration program. These items would be adds
 
to our 
base capital program.
 

2012. Our current expectations, consistent with the unit operator, assumed 
daily production will average between 70,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil pe
r 
day at Jubilee. For Kosmos that should represent between six and eight 
liftings for the year. Given current plans for Jubilee development and 
production enhancement, we anticipate higher production volumes in the 
second half of the year versus the first 
as we bring Phase 1A wells on and 
start to see impact from our Phase 1 enhancement work. We anticipate only 
one lifting in the first quarter. This has already occurred and priced at a 
$124 per barrel.
 
The acquisition of the FPSO at the end of 2011 will imp
act our production 
cost and DD&A as we have now capitalized the associated costs and will 
therefore not be incurring FPSO lease payments.
 
Our production costs should decrease noticeably on a per barrel basis for the 
year while DD&A will move the other way.
 
Additionally, as we continue to 
incur capital cost throughout the year DD&A should increase from where we 
were in the fourth quarter of 2011. We would then expect 2012 G&A to be 
similar in run rate from the second half of 2011, again with a significant 
co
mponent being non
-
cash equity related compensation. We anticipate debt 
outstanding will be relatively consistent with the fourth quarter.
 
On taxes, there are a number of things that can move the rate around, but 
we currently expect our effective tax rate f
or the year to be somewhat 
higher than 2011. Of our total 2012 taxes, we anticipate a small portion to 
be current cash tax as we utilize the remaining NOLs in Ghana. We 
anticipate 2012 exploration expense to be around $90 million or seismic 
expenditures, G
&G work and studies. Let me now turn the call over to 
Darrell McKenna for a more thorough review of operations.
 
Darrell McKenna
 

company I believe has a legacy of exploration and develo
pment success and 
an impressive defined growth outlook. Most of my comments today will be 
on Jubilee, and I will wrap up on our appraisal programs before handing over 
to Paul. At Jubilee to
-
date the field has produced over 29 million barrels of 
oil safely 
and without a loss time incident over the last 12 months. We are 
continuing to see field wide reservoir pressure support confirming that we 
have good communication and conductivity throughout the field. It is a 
positive sign of reservoir performance. Total
 
gross field production is 
currently about 70,000 barrels per day. As we have mentioned in prior calls, 
the capacity of our producing wells are being impacted by what we believe 
our play times that are plugging the near well bore region.
 
We are continuing 
to make progress towards resolving this issue as part of 
our production enhancement program for Phase 1, and we will ultimately 
apply these lessons to the full field development. The J7 side track, which 
was done as part of the enhancement program, incorpo
rated a new 
completion design with a larger sized screen and Pacsan [ph] configuration. 
The well has been on production for two months now and while it is still 
early days the new design appears to be performing up to our pre
-
drill 
expectations and better 
than the original J7 completion. We are also 
pursuing several other possible options looking at alternative cost effective 
solutions to enhance Phase 1 production.
 
One of these options will be to perform an acid stimulation of one of the 
producers in the n
ext few weeks. In addition we are also considering various 
other workable strategies. We are gaining more information everyday and I 
am confident we are doing the right things to isolate the productivity issue 
and to resolve it.
 
The next phase of developme
nt at Jubilee is Phase 1A was approved by the 
government early in 2012. We have already drilled two top holes and I 
anticipate we will drill and complete the first Phase 1 well within the next few 
months as our well design and completion learnings are fina
lized.
 
By the end of the year we expect to have four new producers online as well 
as an additional water injection well. The remaining Phase 1A wells including 
one producer and two injectors will be completed in early 2013. At the Ten 
project we continue t
o make significant progress towards a plan of 
development. Our redrill of Olo 1 [ph] came in consistent with the original 
well and we have recently flow tested the reservoirs. The well encountered 
multiple channels. Flow testing was completed on the lower 
channel at a rate 
of 10,000 barrels per day. The upper section consisting of two separate 
sands floated a combined rate of 11,400 barrels oil per day. This successful 
test gives us confidence in the ultimate deliverability of the field.
 
Our last well prior
 
to submitting the plan of development is the Enyenra 4 
well, which is a down
-
dip extension 4.2 miles south of Enyenra 2. It is 
another large step out well. The rig recently arrived on location and we 
expect to TD the well by early April. The Ntomme 2 appr
aisal result early in 
the year was a great result for Kosmos. We originally discovered gas 
compensated Ntomme so the fact that this well discovered an oil leg further 
enhances the liquid content and economics of the Ten project.
 
We recently set gauges in t
he Tweneboa 3 well, which initially discovered in 
Ntomme and we expect to perform a flow test on Ntomme 2 in April. The 
ongoing field work for the Ten project is focused on a high volume liquid 
base FPSO development and we anticipate submitting the plan of
 
development to the government in the third quarter this year.
 
This year is a very important year as we look at progressing the potential 
integrated development for our West Cape Three Points Block with 
discoveries including Teak, Mahogany, Akasa, and Band
a. The Atwood 
Hunter rig is anticipated to arrive in Ghana late this month with our first well 
to be Teak 4, a significant step out to the west approximately 2.6 miles from 
the Teak 3 location. This will likely be followed with Teak 5 in the south part 
of 
the field. These two wells are planned to further define and understand 
the extent of the Teak pay intervals and the ultimate resource potential. 
Following these two wells we will be installing gauges and flow testing to 
measure conductivity and communicat
ion within the reservoir.
 
Based on success at Teak 4 and 5 we could drill an additional two wells at 
Teak this year. Planning is underway for at least one appraisal well and a 
flow test at Mahogany oil discovery. At Akasa we anticipate performing a 
flow te
st of the discovery well late in the year. At Banda we are currently 
reprocessing seismic to better understand the presence and distribution of 
pay in that discovery. All the appraisal work at West Cape Three Points this 
year and early next year is focused
 
on determining the optimum 
development plan for our discoveries on this block. A successful campaign 
will have us moving forward with a third development offshore Ghana in the 
near future. Now let me turn it over to Paul.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Thanks Darrell. I'm g
oing to discuss exploration program for 2012 across 
both Ghana and a larger portfolio.
 
As has been mentioned already, we have an exciting program in Ghana for 
2012. We are currently planning to drill three to four exploration prospects 
with the most likely
 
wells being Wawa, a Campanian and Turonian prospects 
up
-
dip of Enyenra, Sapele which is down
-
dip from the Jubilee field and 
Turonian Deep which we also called Tweneboa Deep. These are all the cases 
on the Deepwater Tano Block. Combined these three wells r
epresent drillage 
of more than 100 million barrels equivalent net to Kosmos.
 
Right now, we anticipate drilling Sapele and Wawa in the third quarter and 
then Tweneboa Deep will be in the fourth quarter. This is an exciting drilling 
program for us with poten
tials to add considerable resources.
 

with the government about this drill prospect which we were unable to drill 
last year due to a force majeure event. Kosmos estimates the drill to b
e a 
120 million barrels prospect and hopefully we will resolve this discussion 
shortly and proceed to drill Cedrela likely in the second half of the year 
subject to rig availability.
 
Of these budgets Kosmos is participating in eight explorations of apprais
al 
wells in Ghana this year with contingency for up to an additional four to five 
wells. Those contingent wells will be two additional Teak appraisals, a well in 
Enyenra, a fourth exploration well in deepwater Tano and finally Cedrela.
 

bout drilling our first operated well on our Indian River 
Block onshore Cameroon. This is 150 million barrel prospect targeting Niger 
Delta type deepwater Kesra [ph] reservoirs on favor with offshore 
discoveries. We currently have a 100% of Sapele operatio
ns that are 
expected to commence in late 2012.
 
Earlier this year, we negotiated the production sharing contract for the Fako 
Block which is contiguous with the Indian River license and may continue the 

later in the year. The Fako 
Block is a 320,000 acre position of which we have 100% working interest.
 
Phone discussions with our partners and the Cameroon national oil company 

additiona
l drilling on the Kombe

relinquished this license.
 
In 2011, we significantly increased our position in Morocco, and we now hold 
right to nearly 14 million acres in Deepwater plays there. Between our 6 
million acre positio
n in the Agadir Basin in the north and more than 7 million 
acres in the Cap Boujdour Block to the south, we have a leading position in 
two previously overlooked and under explored areas offshore Morocco. Both 
areas show evidence of working hydrocarbon syst
ems, evidence of reservoirs 
and have significant tracking geometries.
 
As we look around the South Atlantic basin in recent years companies have 
mostly been focused on exploring two different exploration things. Number 
one, Jubilee lookalikes in the late Cr
etaceous play and number two, sub or 
pre
-
salt plays. These position that we have developed in Morocco brings 
together both of those teams with Cretaceous deepwater reservoirs and 
source rocks and both pre and post salt tracking geometries.
 
As Morocco is on
e of the few unexplored salt basins outside the Gulf of 
Mexico, Brazil, Angola and Gabon, we feel we have developed a very 
attractive opportunity here.
 
In the Agadir Basin we have finalized our 3D acquisition on the Essaouira 
Block, and are currently condu
cting a program in the Foum Assaka Block. In 
total we will acquire about 4800 square kilometers. We should wrap up the 
acquisition in the next month or so, and then I anticipate around six months 
of silent processing. I look forward to having identified pr
ospects during the 
end of the year.
 
By carrying our partner seismic coasts our interest in Foum Assaka will 

the national oil company ONHYM. We are currently looking to line up some 
ri
gs to 

 
we have a program of basin opening wells offshore Morocco 
commencing sometime in 2013.
 
Our most recent venture is in South America offshore Suriname where we 
have taken a large position in the deepwater acquiring nearly 3 million gross 
acres in a r
ecently proven plate. We have been working on the acreage for 
most of the year and thankfully had the acreage secured before recent 
industry success in the region. In this basin we are exporting our upper 
cretaceous stratographically from West Africa to ne
w geography. We are 
currently working to secure a seismic vessel and hope to initiate 3D program 
in the second half of 2012.
 
Beyond the existing portfolio, we are continuing to identify new opportunities 
both in existing and new petroleum systems. Our goal
 
is to have a portfolio 
which is balanced both thematically and geographically within our current 
focus areas of Africa and South America. I anticipate we will capture multiple 
new opportunities in 2012 that will allow for drilling potential in 2013 and 
be
yond.
 
Operator, we would like to open the call for questions at this time.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Ladies and gentlemen we will now be conducting a question and answer 
session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Edw
ard 
Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
 
Edward Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Good morning everyone. Just a quick question. I mean where would place 
your 2P or proven plus probable reserves right now?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Good morning Ed. I hope you are well. 
This is Brian Maxted. Ed, we have 
given guidance in various annual presentations over the past 

 
well really 
since the IPO road show, of discovery reserves net 2P to the company 

prove
n and probable resource base.
 
Edward Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
And when you are thinking about Teak, how much of Teak would be in that 
2P reserve bases as you said that today or in terms of some of the more 

 
Brian Maxted
 
The lower end of the range that we carry for that we carry a range of 200 
million to 500 million barrels plus as you are probably aware. And so the 


 
one of the points we 
continue to make is that for u
s Ghana continues to be a high impact 
exploration and appraisal opportunity with significant upside both from 
discovered fields as well as on drilled exploration prospects in 2012 that will 

 
with a nine well program or eight well program in Ghana will be 
a 
significant year for us and potentially increasing the 2P reserve base in the 
company substantially. I know this is the third question but just sticking with 
the same theme on Teak, you know, there are still obviously I guess some 
debate amongst the part
ners. Why I guess after T3 are you still so excited 
by the prospect. Or do we need to look forward to really test the upper 
range?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, I mean the uncertainty around Teak is driven by its nature. As we 
previously communicated again in present
ations, Teak is different in the 

fight to a large extend so this multiple reservoirs spread geologically over 
quite wide geographic areas, multiple pay zones, and multiple hydro
carbon 
types, and that for it requires a more intensive appraisal program to truly 
figure out what the resource base is and what the optimal development plan 
is. And so, with just three wells in Teak we are still at a relatively early stage 
of appraisal. W
e are at that stage of appraisal that when you drill a well, as 
someone said, then you tend to create more which I think is what we are 
seeing in Teak and so we do anticipate we must drill a few more wells before 
we get our arms around it.
 
Operator
 
Thank y
ou. Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please 
go ahead.
 
Ryan Todd 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great, good morning gentlemen. A couple of quick questions on Jubilee. 
Thanks for the update on the J7 well. I mean, how long do you think it will 
be unt

other potential remediation including the acts of stimulation that you are 
looking at, I mean do you view those as long term solutions or is that a type 
of work that you would have to revi
sit over the life of the well periodically.
 
Brian Maxted
 

hand over to Darrell to give you a bit more detail on that. But first of all 
where we are at in the production enhancement program is, is testing a 
number of alternatives which w
ill lead us to an integrated program of 
production enhancement right from the year in terms of renovation Phase 1 
wells and obviously execution of the Phase 1A program. J7 which was a side 
track, essentially a re
-
drill and re
-
completion of the J7 well was 
one of those 

pointed out, we are looking at a couple of other alternatives one of which is 
acidization in the near term. We have one or two other concepts that we are 
as a partners
hip company considering.
 
Over the coming months we will test each of these, understand their impact, 
their cost efficiency, their production efficiency, and decide how best we may 
go forward. It may be a single solution that we go for or it may be a mix of
 
solutions. So within that context let me just hand over to Darrell to give you 
a bit more color.
 
Ryan Todd 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Thanks Brian, and I guess the thing I would add is, the well today is 
performing quite well. We are exceedin
g our pre
-
drill expectations and we 
will continue to monitor the well. We are ramping it up production wise, but 
we are also shutting them periodically to do pressure build ups and analyze 

ll give us 
our answer. Then that will prove again the completion, success for Phase 1A 
application.
 
Ryan Todd 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
The well, I know you have 

 

rigs as you go forward over the course that you are d
oing both side track 
wells and Phase 1A wells, are those going to be staggered back and forth 
between the two or is it going to be predominantly Phase 1A versus 
remediation, one or the other?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, correct. The unit operator has access to two 
rigs that will be 
staggering back and forth with 1A, drilling and completions as well as 
remediation.
 
Ryan Todd 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. If I may one more related on reserves, is it safe to assume 

 
there 

 
year
-
on
-
year, is it 

other remediation effort.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
I would say that fundamentally the reserves a year ago contemplated Phase 
1A and reserve base that is in the develop
ment. Phase 1A is fundamentally 
just additional infield drilling around that as well as accessing a different 
reservoir interval that had previously been accessed. We need history 
obviously to be able to look at enhanced recovery rates and every year we 
do

engineer.

Good morning.

Good morning Bob.

On t
he remediation work, you set up to three more sidetrack wells, how 
much do you have in the $600 million budget for the remediation work this 
year?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Of our development CapEx, about 60% of the development CapEx is actually 
new Phase 1A and about 
25% of that number is remediation related 

to there are other activities we are looking at to see if they can be more cost 
effective than just a full redrill and recompletion.
 
Bob M
orris 

 
Citigroup
 
So that 25%, is that the upper end of max if you have to then drill the three 
side tracks or could it end up being more.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 

recomplete all of those wells.
 
Bob Morris 

 
Citigroup
 
In how many wells that are producing currently side track, seven heavy 
issue with a clay, clogging or any issues that potentially need remediation.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Bob, let me take that one, Darrell here. We see the impact on all the
 
wells to 
varying degrees. Some are at the extreme end of it and some are producing 

just focused right on the three side tracks in the budget, those are the most 
extreme cases that
 

 
Bob Morris 

 
Citigroup
 
Okay. I could probably back into it, but each of those sidetrack wells cost 
approximately what?

In the budget we have them at approximately $85 million to $90 million 
assuming a full side tract and r

Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
 
Hi, I just had a couple of qu
estions. On your cash tax position at the 
moment, could you just clarify what your current NOL position is? Second 
one is just more on the strategy side of things. Your decision to increase 
your stake in Ghana, just want to think of that in a kind of wider
 
concept. Is 

Ghana or is it more specific to thoughts around evaluations in Ghana?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Okay. Anish, this is Brian here, let me just take the second question first and 

pass on to Greg to take your question on the cash tax. I mean 
obviously we were delighted about the opportunity to increase our interest in 


 
we have a lower interest there as you know 18% 
relative to our West Gate Three Points block wh
ere we have 30% interest. 

that block [indiscernible] right there from an appraisal development 
standpoint. Witnessed the Ntomme results recently. We found 70 to a 100 
million barr
els of oil that was to a large extend unexpected, and we think we 
are going to add reserves and resources to existing discoveries.
 
Obviously Ten is 

 
we are hoping to execute on that project this year. That 
will give us more exposure to that. Jubilee, of c

confidence from our standpoint in Jubilee which is a field that we believe 
production history data to
-
date suggests is going to have a long life and high 
recovery. And then we are also excited about the exploration opportunity of 
the t
hree and possibly more wells this year in that block.
 
So, that was very much about 

 
this is a world class asset in Ghana and 
getting more interest in a world class asset makes a lot of sense. Exploration 
business outside of Ghana is quite separate, and as
 

performance in the last few months we have not struggled to put, in our 
minds, high quality strategic opportunities into the exploration portfolio and 
we have a number of them also in the pipeline as we alluded to in the script 
in the
 

exploration side.
 
Greg?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 

income or usable NOLs elsewhere or we can't use elsewhere because of n
o 
income. In Ghana we are making or booking significant income and tax 
income. We do have an NOL position and it has allowed us this past year and 
will for most of this year subject to the price we ultimately receive for our 
crude oil to use that NOLs to o
ffset any tax that would be due. As mentioned 
in the notes earlier we do expect, given reasonable prices and price levels to 
have a small amount of current tax payable near the end of the year, but 
until then the NOLs should be sufficient to offset cash ta
xes due. Outside of 

tax associated with that and/or we are in jurisdictions that are by their 
nature non
-
taxable.

Yes, good morning guys. In terms of the next development, can you give us 
some impression as to whether you think 


Because I was just looking at the latest presentation in terms of Mahogany 

 
Brian
 
Maxted
 



alike, slightly 
different scale, a little bit smaller, but we have had some very 
successful appraisal drilling results in the area in the last few months. We 
mentioned the key milestone for that project was the deliverability of the 
wells which we have just proven on an a
ggregate basis of 22,000 barrels a 
day from the 001 side track. That was a key milestone.
 
We talked about the plan and development going into the third quarter. 

next straight forward 
opportunity to develop.
 
Beyond that the area of West Cape Three Points, the Mahogany, Akasa, Teak 
areas that we questioned on earlier the points I made are, are also valued 
there from a development standpoint. One of the conversations we have 
going on with
 
the government right now is, as you are probably aware we 
have separate discovery areas for these different fines and we are trying to 
integrate these discovery areas into one area that will allow us to do 
essentially an integrated appraisal program [indi
scernible] development 
program for the entire area sometime late next year. So we see the possible 
third FPSO if you like, opportunity being formulated late next year.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC Capital Markets
 
As a slight follow on question and also Paul mentioned 
in terms of rig 
availability, are you starting to get nervous about rig availability for next 
year?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
We are obviously tracking the market very carefully and we are putting 
some fillers out in the market to secure additional rig time. Current
ly the 
unit operator has access to two rigs. We have a third rig that will come in 
the Atwood Hunter and we are contemplating additional rig time for the 
West Cape Three Point block.

Jeffries & Co.
 
Hi guys, thanks. A quick question on what you think your exit rate for 
Jubilee would be just for guidance for 2013? And then I guess just going 
t
hrough on your drilling in Cameron, the volume estimates that you gave, is 
that for oil only case as obviously some of the discoveries to
-
date have been 
mixed gas and oil?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, Laura, this is Brian. We maintain the same guidance as the operat
or 

 
Laura Loppacher 

 
Jeffries & Co.
 
Can you say anything about what you think run rate will be sort of by 4Q?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Obviously we are hoping that we will be ramping up multi
-
watch 

 
at t
hat 


partnership now, most focused on figuring out the optimal completion, work 
drilling and completion designs fo
r these wells for the full field development 
as opposed to worrying about when we get to 120, but naturally we will get 
to 120 as we resolve these production issues. On Cameroon, let me give 
Paul an opportunity to speak and talk to your question on Cameroo
n.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Yeah, the simple prospect is 150 million barrels MMBOE. So, we are trying to 
think 

 

adjacent to the Rio del Ray basin, which as you probably know has oil 
discoveries and s
ome gas discoveries per se. But as you come up to the East 
and things are more shallow, have more shallow bedding hole, one of the 
reason would be like the plays, we think there is a better chance of oil there, 
but it is an MMBOE number.
 
Brian Maxted
 
I wou

play in the well as much as a prospect on the upside on the trend including 
in the faco [ph] acreage adjacent to this, significantly higher than 150 

the prospect we are drilling.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from Bragen Freshcop [ph] with Raincap 
[ph]. Please go ahead.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Yeah, good morning. Just a quick question on the CapEx of $600 million. You 
have several wells that ar
e kind of potential wells depending on the results 
and also [indiscernible] depending on the government. What does the $600 
million include, does it include any of this potential wealth or there could be 
extra on that? Does that $40 million associated with
 
the 4% you just 
acquired, is that included in this $600 million CapEx.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
The $600 million covers the nine wells that are mentioned or we mentioned 
earlier. The amount attributable to Sabre is that amount that we would 
spend subject to a 
closing and acquisition of Sabre interest. So that would 
be an additive $40 million spread across the block and then the additional 
five wells that Paul referenced, or up to five I should say, because it could be 
zero to five, would be separate amount from
 
that.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Can you give us that amount as well?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Ballparkish if all of it were done, and I think that would be a relatively 
extreme assumption, would be in the 100ish million range gross to us or net 
to us.

Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current ex
pectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings. We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Management believes such 
measures are important 
in looking at the company's historical and future 
performance, and these are commonly referred to industry metrics. These 
measures are provided in addition to, and should be read in conjunction 
with, the information contained in our financial statements pr
epared in 
accordance with GAAP and included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Greg.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared comments 
this morning, I will review our financial results 
for the second quarter and 
then provide a brief update on our expectations for the remainder of the 
year.
 
Overall, our financial performance for the second quarter was in line with 
expectations. We recognized a net loss of $71 million or $0.19 per share. 
E
xcluding the $76 million dry hole expense related to Sipo
-
1 and the 
planned exit of Cameroon, we would have recognized a net income of $5 
million or $0.01 per share.
 
Total revenues for the period were $193 million, for an average of just under 
$100 per bar
rel sold. At the end of the second quarter, we were in an under
-
lift position, having lifted for sale approximately 350,000 barrels less than 
our current entitlement.
 
On the cost side, production expense for the quarter was $23 million. 
Excluding certain r
ig maintenance and work
-
over costs, our underlying 
operating expense was less than $7 per barrel, reflecting the benefit of 
continued strong Jubilee production versus a year ago.
 
Exploration expense for the second quarter was $93 million. Excluding the 
dry
 
hole expense in Cameroon, the exploration expense was $17 million, the 
same as the second quarter of last year.
 
G&A, depletion and interest expense amounts were all consistent with our 
previous expectorations and guidance, and our derivatives gain reflect
ed the 
market's lower oil prices at second quarter end. Tax expense for the quarter 
was $46 million. We utilized the balance of our Guinea net operating loss 
position during the first quarter and are now paying cash taxes.
 
Cash flow provided by operations 
was strong this quarter, generating $210 
million. Our cash balance as of June 30 remained robust at just over $500 
million. Our liquidity position improved for the last quarter, and we now have 
over $1.2 billion in liquidity between cash and our debt facil
ities. During the 
second quarter, we paid down $100 million debt outstanding.
 
At this time, I'd like to provide some brief comments on our expectations for 
the remainder of 2013. We are anticipating a slight increase in total forecast 
of CapEx to approxima
tely $560 million for the year. This increase largely 
relates to the capture of our licensed offshore Ireland and the acceleration of 
the Ireland 3D seismic program into the second half of this year.
 
Total capital spending is split approximately 50
-
50 betw
een development 
and exploration and appraisal activities. Based on an anticipated extension 
of a previously planned maintenance shutdown and a recent water pump 
failure, the field operator has revised the Jubilee production forecast to an 
average of 95,000
 
barrels of oil per day gross for 2013.
 
As such, we now anticipate selling 8 cargoes net to Kosmos during the year. 
Our expectations for third quarter production expense, G&A, DD&A and 
interest expense are that these items will generally be similar to seco
nd 
quarter amounts. Exploration expense will continue to vary quarter
-
to
-
quarter, primarily as a result of the timing of seismic and G&G expenditures. 
We currently have 2 large 3D surveys underway in Ireland and Mauritania.
 
Tax expense is often a bit more 
challenging to guide to. We anticipate our 
tax expense per lifting going forward to be consistent with our amount from 
the first half of this year, particularly if Brent remains at or above $100 per 
barrel.
 
With Jubilee generating substantial cash flows, c
ombined with our existing 
liquidity, we remain well
-
positioned to internally fund our growth plans in 
Ghana, as well as a very strategic exploration program.
 
I will now turn the call over to Eric for an operations review.
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Thanks, Greg. Strong 
performance in Jubilee continued during the first half 
of 2013. The field exhibited exceptional well deliverability, high FPSO uptime 
and an excellent safety and environmental record. The Jubilee field is 
currently producing at a rate of around 110,000 bar
rels of oil per day and 
averaged approximately 106,000 barrels of oil per day during the second 
quarter.
 
The field operators recently revised full year average production forecast of 
95,000 barrels of oil per day, which reflects the short
-
term production 
i
mpact of an extended planned maintenance period and a recent water 
injection pump failure on the FPSO, as Greg mentioned.
 
Phase 1A drilling and completion operations in the Jubilee field continued 
during the second quarter, and we anticipate the program wi
ll continue into 
2014. We remain very encouraged with the 2 Phase 1A production wells 
currently online and see no productivity degradation from scaling effects in 
either of the wells to date. The first of these wells has been on production for 
more than 8 
months, which further encourages us that the modified drilling 
and completion practices have mitigated the scaling issues encountered in 
the past.
 
Acid stimulation programs were conducted on 5 production wells during the 
quarter, using a specially equipped
 
marine vessel, rather than the drilling 
rig
-
based interventions performed previously in Jubilee. These vessel
-
based 
stimulation treatments have proven to be more cost effective, as the 
treatments were conducted in significantly less time than the prior ri
g
-
based 
treatments.
 
In anticipation of our substantial excess well deliverability, we continue to 
work with our field partners on the assessment of potential de
-
bottlenecking 
opportunities on the FPSO.
 
Near
-
term plans include the re
-
wheeling of the gas 
compression system and 
the drilling of a third gas injection well, which we anticipate will be 
operational in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, we continue to 
study longer
-
term options for system de
-
bottlenecking on the FPSO, 
analyzing all of t
he major components and systems, including gas injection, 
water injection and fluid processing facilities.
 
Looking forward, it is anticipated the production at year end will be at a 
record level, supported by substantial existing well deliverability and ne
ar
-
term FPSO de
-
bottlenecking, as well as the fact that additional Phase 1A 
producers will be brought online during the remainder of the year. The 
planned shutdown of the Jubilee production facility for routine maintenance 
is scheduled for late in the thir
d quarter and is anticipated to take up to 3 
weeks to complete.
 
Finally, we continue to monitor the gas export project, which is currently 
expected to start up next year.
 
As announced previously, the TEN planned development was approved in 
May. This develo
pment will combine production from the Tweneboa, Enyenra 
and Ntomme fields, with the aim of delivering first oil by mid
-
2016 and 
providing for gas export. The TEN development will require the drilling and 
completion of up to 24 development wells. It will b
e connected through a 
subsea infrastructure to a new FPSO, the second such vessel in Ghana. 
Major contracts for the FPSO and subsea equipment have been tendered and 
award is imminent.
 
Further required rig capacity has been secured for the development drill
ing 
campaign. Accordingly, the field operator has revised the total project capital 
cost upward of $4.9 billion, primarily due to an expanded scope to enhance 
recovery from Ntomme and facilitate gas export.
 
During the second quarter, we successfully drille
d the Ntomme 4A appraisal 
well. Ntomme 4A is the second appraisal well to be drilled in the TEN area 
this year. The well planned is a future water injection well, confirmed the 
down
-
dip limits of the Ntomme accumulation and encountered well
-
developed, wate
r
-
bearing reservoirs, as anticipated. Water injectivity testing 
is currently being performed to confirm the lateral connectivity of the target 
reservoirs. The Ntomme 4A well will be suspended for future years in the 
TEN development program once the water i
njectivity test has been 
completed.
 
On the West Cape Three Points Block, we continue to mature our appraisal 
and delineation plants from Mahogany, Teak and Akasa. An extension of the 
Teak appraisal period was received earlier in the year, which further ali
gns 
the appraisal of these fields and supports the ultimate future development as 
a tie
-
back to the Jubilee FPSO. Our combined Ghanaian assets represent a 
world
-
class petroleum system and a foundation from which we will continue 
to grow Kosmos.
 
Now I'll ha
nd over the call to Brian.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Thanks, Eric. I'd like to transition today's discussion from the ongoing 
production development programs in Ghana to the high
-
impact exploration 
program, which is focused on unlocking new petroleum systems along t
he 
Atlantic margins. We continue to execute our proven business strategy with 
great discipline. Over time, we've executed this strategy with patience, 
which has resulted in a number of significant discoveries around the globe, 
including the Jubilee field i
n Ghana. We fully expect the strategy to deliver 
again going forward.
 
Our systematic approach is based on leverage in our people and process to 
create contrarian perspectives. And then those selectively convert the results 
in first
-
mover advantage into lar
ge strategic positions in petroleum systems 
that offer the rare combination of high
-
volume, high
-
value barrels. We take 
a concentrated portfolio and a rifle shot exploration approach, as well as 
ensuring each opportunity offers play diversity and prospect 
dependency. So 
we might expect to deliver top quartile exploration performance in frontier 
and emerging basis.
 
This approach is designed to achieve optimal exploration efficiency, including 
low
-
finding costs and high potential returns to our shareholders.
 
Since our IPO, execution of this strategy has proven successful in rebuilding 
our second inning portfolio, positioning us on a series of under
-
explored 
petroleum systems that have very significant potential exploration upside.
 
As a hallmark, each of these 
opportunities has the necessary technical 
ingredients for commercial success, has not yet been unlocked by the 
industry. In response to a very competitive business environment in our core 
Cretaceous theme in West Africa transform margin geography during th
e last 
several years, tactically, we've been pursuing 2 initiatives to create 
exploration opportunity and build our new exploration portfolio.
 
Firstly, we successfully exploited our core Cretaceous theme Suriname on 
the Northeast Latin America transform ma
rgin. Here, in our 11,000 square 
kilometer position, we continue to work with our partners Chevron on 
seismic acquisition, processing and interpretation to attain multiple leads at 
the drilling stage based on the fast
-
track seismic volumes.
 
Final prospect 
mapping will tell us the final seismic data points received later 
this year.
 
Using similar tactics during the last quarter, we expanded our geography 
further to capture 3 licenses in the highly suspected Porcupine Basin, 
offshore Ireland. This opportunity 
provides us the chance to leverage our 
technical understanding and explore a forgotten basin with a new 
exploration perspective.
 
Previous drilling in the area has proven a working hydrocarbon system, and 
the recent efforts of others, though commercially su
ccessful, appear to have 
reinforced this.
 
In July, the 3 areas were converted to frontier exploration licenses, and we 
are currently acquiring the 3D seismic program with a future drilling in 2015.
 
And secondly, over the last 2 years, we've established a s
ignificant position 
in Northwest Africa, specifically offshore Morocco, which is today attracting a 
lot of industry interest.
 
Kosmos as a first mover has been able to capture 2 positions of choice, 1 in 
the petroleum system in the North and 1 in the South.
 
Together, these 
totaled a massive 50,000 square kilometers. In the south, we're able to 
explore our core Cretaceous theme, but also have the opportunity in the 
North to explore one of the last untested salt basins along the Atlantic 
margins. Given our ear
ly entry, offshore Morocco represents our less mature 
exploration asset. Plans are moving quickly forward to commence a multi
-
well exploration program beginning in the first quarter of 2014.
 
We have a defined multiple barrel potential resource base in each
 
of these 2 
independent petroleum systems. It includes a range of plays, fairways and 
prospect types. Over the current course of the next 1.5 years, these 
potential company
-
changing opportunities will be tested.
 
The foremost effort of our Moroccan acreage 
position during the second 
quarter has generated substantial interest within the industry. The date 
room has now been closed, and we expect to announce results in the farm
-
out process in the next 3 months.
 
Now that we have the Atwood Achiever rig on the co
ntract and the letter of 
intent signed for slots on the second rig, we've ensured that we have 
capacity to execute next year's drilling program in Morocco, as well as 
pursue our long
-
term exploration programs and plays.
 
Our position in offshore Mauritania 
represents the first of what we hope will 
be a number of second cycle exploration opportunities that are emerging 
along the West Africa transform margin in the wake of the industry's failed 
efforts to replicate the commercial success we and our partners re
alized in 
Ghana with the Jubilee discovery 6 years ago. In May, we completed a 6,300 
line kilometer 2D seismic survey, covering the entirety of our 27,000 square 
kilometer position. Based on very encouraging initial results from the 2D, we 
accelerated our 
planned 3D seismic program and expanded the survey over 
to 10,000 square kilometers. Acquisition of the survey, which will be 
--
 
we 
believe will be one of the largest [indiscernible] regions this year is currently 
ongoing, with a view to drilling late 2014
 
or early 2015.
 
Throughout of Kosmos's first inning portfolio, which was built between 2004 
and 2006, was completed last quarter with the fulfillment of the Sipo
-
1 well 
commitment in the Ndian River Block, our last remaining obligation in 
Cameroon. This we
ll was plugged and abandoned, having demonstrated 
working petroleum system for failing to confirm the presence of commercial 
reservoirs. We are continuing to execute our exploration strategy to identify 
additional new venture opportunities along the Atlant
ic margins, so we can 
fully build out our second inning portfolio.
 
The hard work on our exploration programs since our IPO has created 
significant potential value for Kosmos. We have positioned ourselves to come 
into the multi
-
well, multi
-
country, high
-
imp
act drilling programs during our 
consulting next year. We believe the results will value and transform the 
company.
 
Thank you. Now operator, we'd like to open up the call to questions.

Operator
 
[Operator

Westlake with Crédit Suisse.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Congrats on getting TEN sanctioned. I appreciate you're now the operator, 
but maybe if we could have a little 
bit of extra color on what would generally 
the gas solutions for Ghana given that's going to be an issue going forward.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Let me ask Eric to take that one, if he could.
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Okay. Yes, the gas infrastructure in Ghana is currently bein
g developed 
under the supervision of GNGC, and we are monitoring and supporting those 
efforts to the extent that we possibly can. The current information that we 
have is that the completion of that infrastructure will be made sometime 
next year.
 
Edward Wes
tlake 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
And it's when you see that shore base pipe and some of 
--
 
power plants and 
demand on onshore.
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Yes. But the Western corridor gas infrastructure consists of a pipeline 
running from Jubilee to Atuabo an
d then a pipeline running to Aboadze, 
which is the location of the power generation plant. And at Atuabo, there's 
also a gas processing plant that's under construction.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Which will be sufficient for the 
gas from both Jubilee and from TEN?
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Yes. So we will continue injecting 
--
 
reinjecting some volume at Jubilee, and 
plans are to inject a good volume of gas at TEN as well.
 
Edward Westlake 
-
 
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Okay. And then on 
TEN, I mean, your 
--
 
the $4.9 billion CapEx is fine, and 
you're going to lease the FPSO, I understand. What do you think is going to 
be the OpEx when you think of just from modeling relative to Jubilee, when 
it's up and running at full capacity per barrel?
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Probably a little bit higher than Jubilee.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is coming from the line of Brendan Warn with Jefferies.
 
Brendan Warn 
-
 
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
 
It's Brendan Warn from Jefferies in London. Just first question, I s
hould 
probably have 2 
--
 
2 questions. The first question is just in term of Morocco. 
Now that you're saying you've got the rig capacity, could you give us a little 
bit more detail just about your first prospect? Have you got all your permits 
in place and w
hat will you be drilling, please?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Brendan, and it's Brian. Yes. We've got a portfolio of probably 3 wells to 
begin with to drill in Morocco next year, from really early part of the year 
onwards, so we got the rig capacity when the Atwood co
ming later in the 
year, which is, as you know, 3
-
year contract, and the letter of intent on a 
second rig starting in the first quarter. Final plans around the exploration 
program in terms of the scheduling and the ordering of the wells is kind of 
ongoing. 
My expectation is that the first well will be in the North. And we've 
--
 
as we pointed out in the script, a number of plays and fairways in those 
blocks are both pre
-
salt and post
-
salt. And the initial exploration program 
will probably be designed around 2
 
wells to test the standard prospect in the 
post
-
salt and the standard prospect in the pre
-
salt. For the south, we expect 
to be in the position to drill out later next year, and that's more of a 
straightforward, albeit dominantly structural play in the Cre
taceous.
 
Brendan Warn 
-
 
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
 
Okay. And second question, just circling back to TEN. Can 
--
 
obviously, the 
operated partners looking to mitigate CapEx, to first off, through some sort 
of a farm
-
out process. What's your 
thinking around staying in the 
development in terms of funding CapEx or looking to monetize? And is there 
anything sort of outstanding at the moment in terms of the license or 
contractual arrangement that would prevent you from monetizing or selling 
to ano
ther party?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
It's Brian. Let me take that one, Brendan. I'm 
--
 
obviously, Tullow 
announced plans to dilute their 
--
 
potentially dilute their interests later this 
year. As you know, they have quite a material position in the development, I 
th
ink over 50% or thereabouts. We retained a 17% interest. So the idea of 
diluting doesn't make much sense. And we see 
--
 
at this point, we see, 
mainly the TEN development offering us the second slug of production 
beyond Jubilee. So as part of the asset in G
hana, it's quite an important 
piece for us. And we think it's affordable within the context of our 5
-
year 
plan, and we got the right capital allocated to a combination of development 
team in Ghana and our exploration program. So at the moment, we're 
comfor
table where we are, and there's no plans to dilute at this point.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is coming from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.
 
Ryan Todd 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
A couple 
--
 
I guess a quick one on the 
--
 
on Jubilee. You 
referenced a near
-
term bottlenecking. I think you may have mentioned potential for your gas 
injector later this year. What is the near
-
term bottlenecking? How much 
capacity you think that add? And is this referencing the gas compression 
that you're looking
 
to put on?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Ryan, yes, let me get Eric to answer that one again.
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Ryan, the current constraint on production, which is at around 110,000 
barrels of oil per day is due to gas compression and gas injection, both of 
which are being
 
addressed by the compressor re
-
wheeling project and the 
drilling and completion of the third gas injection well. So we anticipate, given 
in particular that we have well deliverability exceeding FPSO capacity, that 
we will be able to take advantage of that
 
additional capacity at the end of 
the year.
 
Ryan Todd 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
And do you 
--
 
maybe you don't want to say, but do you have an estimate of 
what you think the well deliverability might be? And that additional gas 
injector, is tha
t sufficient if there's a delay in onshore gas solution? Or at 
one point, is there a need at some point to potentially add another gas 
injector to the mix?
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Yes. I guess, answering your first question, we believe the well deliverability 
current
ly is around 130,000 barrels of oil per day. And in terms of the gas 
--
 
the third gas injection well and when the situation becomes more critical, we 
anticipate that will not happen for approximately another year.

Our next question is coming from 
the line of Anish Kapadia with Tudor, 
Pickering and Holt.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., 
Research Division
 
My first question, just looking at some of the new areas that you're going to 
be looking at the next few years, I'm w
ondering, in terms of read
-
through, 
what read
-
through you can talk about from the recent well in the west of 
Ireland? And what we should be looking for maybe in terms of the wells that 
are going to be drilled later this year in Mauritania and Morocco? And 
then 
the second one was, I was just wondering if you could expand on the timing 
and the scope of the appraisal plans for the MTA field in West Cape Three 
Points and what you see as, at least, potential first oil from those fields.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Let me ta
ke your exploration question and I'll pass over to Eric to talk you 
through MTA. Yes, in terms of Ireland, let's start with Ireland, the Exxon 
Dunquin well, I think you're referring to, recently drilled, was within the 
basin's downdip to the west of us. It
 
was on a rather unique feature, which 
in terms of the targets and nature of the play is quite different from what we 
are looking at. We're looking at a far more conventional stratigraphic 
combination play a la the South Atlantic margins. And that well was
 
generally tied, and we don't have a lot of information on it. As we pointed 
out in the script, we feel that they did encounter evidence of a working 
petroleum system but may have had a blown trap, is one of the things that 
we've heard as to why it was dry
. So it's encouraging that they did 
--
 
the 
encounter shows us, as you know, many of the previous wells in the 
Porcupine trough encountered show us. So and then the key for us is it's 
really a trap issue primarily, and that's what 
--
 
it's a 3D problem, and 
that's 
why we're shooting a pretty extensive 3D program right now. In terms of 
Morocco, Mauritania read
-
throughs, the Genel drilling won't be a read
-
through for us, it's a different play. There will be some read
-
through from 
the Cairn drilling. They are dr
illing a post
-
salt play to the Siatopas [ph] in 
the northern part of offshore Agadir. So there will be some from read
-
through from that from a play standpoint. Obviously, it's a different 
prospect. But it will be interesting to see what they will find. In 
Mauritania, 
we've got a different part of the geological systems track, if you like. We are 
further out [indiscernible] than Tullow. We are looking for basin floor fans as 
opposed to channel plays, which is dominantly the target for the Tullow 
guys. But of
 
course, we're exploring at the same stratigraphic level in the 
Cretaceous, so it would be important for us to see what reservoir quality 
looks like and whether the petroleum system is active and working at that 
level and not part of the basin, just updip 
of us. So we'll 
--
 
there will be 
some read
-
through on that, but we are in a different play fairway.
 
Eric J. Haas
 
Anish, in response to your question on MTA timing, a little bit of an update 
on what we have been doing. Our teams are continuing to refine res
ource 
estimates for Mahogany, Teak and Akasa discoveries with the aim of 
determining the optimum development potential for those resources. We did 
also receive an extension for the appraisal period in Teak this year to May of 
2014. And we are looking, alon
g with our partners, to a potential second well 
at Akasa later this year. We still see these discoveries as most likely tiebacks 
to the Jubilee FPSO. And in terms of timing, we see late 2015 or early 2016 
for the first oil.

Our next question is co
ming from the line of Al Stanton with RBC.
 
Al Stanton 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
I'm intrigued by the Atwood Achiever, the 3
-
year contract that you started 
there from June 2014. Do you feel that you have the portfolio to keep the rig 
act
ive for the 3 years and in terms of, I suppose, Ireland, Suriname and 
Mauritania and Morocco? Or do you intend using it as a vehicle for accessing 
new opportunities? And I suppose, the flip side of that is now that you've got 
the rigs you need for Morocco,
 
what sort of thing are you looking for from a 
partner without, obviously, giving too much away?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Al, yes, let me take those 2
-
part 
--
 
those 2 questions. Yes, obviously, and 
what continues to be a rig
-
challenged environment in Atlantic margin, 
securing a rig on an operating basis to give us the flexibility while 
--
 
to firm 
the program, to begin with af
ter next year. And then to give us the 
flexibility, really, in the event of success was important for us. And so 
making a long
-
term commitment, I think, really reflects the fact of our 
confidence in the exploration program. In the event that we do have suc
cess 
in any one of our opportunities, that rig alone won't be enough. And on the 
other side of the coin, we're pretty confident within today's rig environment 
that if we do need to share some time on that rig with others, we will be 
able to, indeed. We've 
been approached by a number of companies looking 
to secure slots on that rig. So we're pretty comfortable that 
--
 
very 
comfortable that the rig will be employed for the 3 years. In terms of the 
partnering, I think we announced that the date room is closed.
 
Bids have 
been received. A very strong response, as we pointed out. And we'll sit 
through it all and work through it in the next few weeks. In a month or 2, 
hopefully, we can have something to tell the market. But a good response, 
and I think we'll be abl
e to make a pretty important statement 
--
 
as we did 
in Suriname with Chevron, make a pretty important statement about the 
size and upside of these opportunities. Hopefully, we'll see some pretty 
significant partners joining us.

Yes, sure. I mean, we shot our 3D last year now. And it's been in 
processing. It will be completed in about September, October time. We've 
b
een working on the fast
-
track volume for the good part of last quarter. 
Initial data was received early part of this year. The interpretation continues 
on that. Obviously, there's a limited demand we can do with the fast
-
track 
data. We don't have all of th
e attribute and another 
--
 
volumes to work with. 
But we are working in unison with Chevron, working up a number of plays 
and fairways and indeed leads and prospects, and that will all continue 
through probably towards 
--
 
until towards the end of the year w
hen we get 
the final volumes, and we'll be able to refine our interpretation and decide 
how we want to go forward and what an explanation program 
--
 
drilling 
program looks like.

And do y
ou anticipate getting to a drill stage sometime next year in 
Suriname?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes. Obviously, that will depend on the 3D interpretation. But in terms of 
schedule, assuming the prospects are ready for drilling, are in place, then 
we would anticipat
e drilling sometime later next year, is where it is currently 
on our schedule.

Our next question is a follow
-
up coming from the line of Ed Westlake with 
Crédit Suisse.

Just, I guess, on the str
ategic notes. Obviously, there's a lot to do in the 
portfolio ahead of you. But there is obviously not just farm
-
down potential 
intent, but maybe farm
-
up potential if you're interested and obviously, farm
-
up potential in the Hess block just on the other si
de, so maybe just some 
comments in terms of how you think about balancing the overall portfolio.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, thanks, Ed. Obviously, Ghana is a very important asset to us, and we 
look at all opportunities as they become available, as we have done i
n the 
past. Obviously, a big focus for the company is diversifying outside the 
company 
--
 
country. And that's our principal emphasis is at the moment, 
and so building portfolio outside of Ghana is probably, in our minds, a better 
use of capital.

It appears we have reached the end of our question

and

answer session. I 
would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Cappon for any concluding 
remarks.

Good day, everyone. Welcome to Kosmos Energy's Third Quarter 2013 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time, let me turn the call over to Jon Cappon, Manager of Investor 
Relations at Kosmos Energy. 
Please go ahead, sir.
 
Jon Cappon
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This 
morning, we issued our third quarter earnings release, which is available on 
the Investors page of the kosmosenergy.com website. And we anticipate 
fil
ing our third quarter 10
-
Q with the SEC later today.
 
Joining me on the call with our prepared comments is Greg Dunlevy, 
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Darrell McKenna, Chief 
Operating Officer; and Brian Maxted, Chief Executive Office
r and Director. 
Following our prepared comments, we will have a question
-
and
-
answer 
session.
 
[Operator Instructions]
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements based on our current expec
tations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures in our discussion. 
Management believes such measures are important in 
looking at the 
company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics. These measures are provided in addition to, 
and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our 
financial statements prepa
red in accordance with GAAP and included in our 
SEC filings.
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Greg.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. In my prepared comments this 
morning, I will review our financial results for th
e third quarter and then 
provide a brief update on our expectations for the remainder of the year.
 
Overall, our financial performance for the third quarter was largely in line 
with expectations, reflecting the sizable plant exploration expense during the 
q
uarter, primarily for 3D seismic investments.
 
We recognized a net loss of $44 million or $0.12 per share on revenues of 
$215 million.
 
The sales volumes from our first lift in the quarter was slightly lower than 
average, which impacted overall quarterly sal
es.
 
At the end of the quarter, we were in an under
-
lifted position, having lifted 
for sale approximately 292,000 barrels less than our current entitlement.
 
On the cost side, production expense for the quarter was $33 million, 
including $20 million related 
to workover operations. Excluding these costs, 
our underlined production expense was less than $7 per barrel sold.
 
Exploration expense for the third quarter was $78 million. The majority of 
these costs was related to seismic acquisition activities in Irela
nd, Mauritania 
and Suriname.
 
Also expensed, although the Akasa
-
2A well 
--
 
appraisal well was fully 
successful on the third quarter's portion of the cost incurred on the well.
 
G&A cost on tax expense was slightly lower than the trend line this quarter, 
wher
eas depletion and interest expense amounts were consistent with our 
previous expectations and guidance.
 
At quarter end, our liquidity position continued strong, with over $1 billion of 
cash and available borrowings under our debt facilities.
 
At this time, 
I'd like to provide some brief comments on our expectations for 
the remainder of the year.
 
We expect CapEx will come at somewhat below prior guidance, the amount 
subject to the timing of our Ghanaian development activities. Consistent 
with previous guidanc
e, we anticipate selling 2 cargoes in the fourth quarter 
for a total of 8 cargoes net to Kosmos during the year.
 
For Jubilee, the average cargo size is 950,000 barrels, with a range of plus 
or minus 5% at the buyer's discretion.
 
We expect production expens
e, G&A, DD&A, interest expense, to be 
generally consistent with the trend line for the first 3 quarters. And 
exploration expense will decrease on lower seismic acquisition costs, as a 3D 
survey underway of Mauritania is expected to wrap up in mid quarter w
hen 
the Ireland seismic program was completed in October. The balance of the 
Akasa
-
2A costs and underlying costs related to ongoing seismic processing 
and G&G activities will also impact the quarter.
 
Tax expense is challenging to guide to, but is closely t
ied to sales from 
liftings. As such, we anticipate our total tax expense per lifting going forward 
to be generally consistent with amounts from the previous 3 quarters, 
assuming Brent remains over $100 per barrel.
 
With Jubilee continuing to generate consid
erable cash flow and our existing 
liquidity base, we remain well positioned to not only internally fund our 
development plans in Ghana, but also our high
-
impact exploration drilling 
campaign set to begin in early 2014.
 
I will now turn the call over to Darr
ell for an operations review.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Thanks, Greg. Performance at Jubilee remained strong throughout the 
quarter, with the field continuing to exhibit exceptional well deliverability, 
high FPSO uptime and an excellent safety and 
environmental record.
 
The Jubilee field is currently producing at a rate of around 110,000 barrels of 
oil per day and averaged approximately 88,000 barrels of oil per day during 
the third quarter.
 
The decrease in production rate this quarter reflects the s
hort
-
term 
production impact associated with the planned FPSO maintenance program, 
which was completed in late September ahead of schedule.
 
The Phase 1a drilling and completion operations in Jubilee continued 
throughout the third quarter with 5 wells drille
d and completion operations 
currently underway on the fifth well.
 
Three Phase 1a producing wells are currently online, including our first 
horizontal producer, which has proven to be the most prolific well drilled in 
the field to date.
 
In addition, we rema
in very encouraged with the first 2 Phase 1a producing 
wells put online, as we have seen no productivity degradation from scale 
effects in either of the wells to date, despite the fact these wells have been 
on production for nearly a year. This reaffirms t
he modified drilling, and 
completion practices utilized in the Phase 1a program have mitigated the 
scale issues encountered in the earlier wells.
 
No acid stimulation programs were conducted in the third quarter, and none 
are anticipated prior to year end.
 
During the quarter, we did perform a workover on one of the water injection 
wells, but no further workovers are planned for the remainder of the year.
 
With our field partners, we are continuing to study options for further 
system de
-
bottlenecking on the Ju
bilee FPSO, as well deliverability far 
exceeds vessel capacity. This includes analyzing all the major components of 
the system, including gas injection, water injection and fluid processing 
facilities.
 
Most recently, we have re
-
wheeled one of the gas compr
ession trains and 
are currently testing that system. In addition, we have completed the third 
gas injection well, which we anticipate will be operational in the fourth 
quarter.
 
As a result of these short
-
term initiatives, we anticipate exiting the year at 
record production levels from Jubilee.
 
Additionally, we are monitoring the progress of the Ghanaian gas export 
project, which is currently expected to start up next year.
 
Since approval of the TEN plan of development in May, focus has been on 
awarding of t
he major contracts for the FPSO and subsea infrastructure. The 
TEN development, which will combine production from Tweneboa, Enyenra 
and Ntomme fields will utilize in FPSO, the second such vessel in Ghana. The 
project will require the drilling and completi
on of up to 24 development wells 
with the aim of delivering first oil by mid
-
2016, staging up to the facility's 
design production rate of 80,000 barrels of oil per day.
 
We are continuing to mature our appraisal and delineation plants for the 
Mahogany, Teak
 
and Akasa areas, which we believe will ultimately be tied 
back to the Jubilee FPSO.
 
Early in the year, we received an extension of both the Teak and Akasa 
appraisal periods. During the third quarter, we successfully drilled the 
Akasa
-
2A appraisal well. Th
e well, planned as a future water injection well, 
confirmed a down
-
dip limits of the Akasa accumulation and encountered 
well
-
developed, water
-
bearing reservoirs as expected. A water injection test 
is being conducted to confirm the lateral connectivity to t
he Akasa
-
1 
discovery well.
 
Moving away from Ghana, we are in the advanced stages in our operational 
readiness for upcoming drilling activities. We are in the process of finalizing 
the contract for a second rig for our initial well in Morocco, which we expe
ct 
to commence the first quarter of next year.
 
In combination with our long
-
term contract with the Atwood Achiever, we 
will have the rig capacity in place to execute our high
-
impact drilling 
campaign over the course of the next several years.
 
Our combined 
Ghanaian assets are truly world
-
class and the foundation from 
which we will continue to grow our business through ongoing development in 
the drill bit.
 
Now I'll hand the call over to Brian.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Thanks, Darrell. Now let me update you on how, as 
a self
-
funded explorer, 
Kosmos is leveraging its strong balance sheet, as well as reinvesting the 
growing cash flow from Jubilee.
 
We're not only internally financing all of our follow
-
on development capital 
needs and production expenses in Ghana, but most 
importantly, we're 
allocating capital to execute an extreme
-
impact exploration program outside 
of Ghana. This, as you know, is focused at replicating our Ghana success by 
opening new super major scale petroleum systems elsewhere along the 
Atlantic margins,
 
so as to transformationally grow the fundamental core 
value our Ghana business provides.
 
To deliver our objective of finding high
-
volume, high
-
value barrels, as we did 
in Ghana, our exploration team is pursuing a proven, organic and a 
venturous strategy, 
which with contrarian ideas and initiatives driving first 
advantage, enable us to establish a concentrated portfolio with multi
-
billion 
barrel resource potential and our choice of the last remaining unexplored 
Circum
-
Atlantic frontier and emerging sediment
ary basins.
 
The execution challenges we would face as a company. But more 
importantly, shareholders, in delivering that strategy, are many, including 
both above and below the ground. I'm pleased to report that over the last 
quarter, we've continued to make
 
excellent progress in overcoming these 
across our business.
 
In particular, with regard to securing access to our new venture opportunity 
targets, addressing aboveground issues, technically de
-
risking these 
petroleum systems and minimizing the exploration 
cycle time required to do 
so, as well as attracting partners and ensuring operational readiness.
 
Building this strategic portfolio with the necessary resource potential and 
risk profile to significantly change the value of our company through 
exploration s
uccess for the drill bit, we were required to ship from our 
former home at the West Africa's transform margin, due to limited new 
venture opportunities, which followed our Ghana success.
 
Practically, we therefore expanded our geography and exploited our 
Cr
etaceous core themes. North to Northwest Africa, offshore Western 
Sahara; West General South America, offshore Suriname; more recently, 
into the North Atlantic offshore Ireland.
 
Salt basins are the other recently successful exploration plan on the 
Atlantic 
margins, which led us to offshore Morocco in Northwest Africa.
 
In this regard, we recently added the Tarhazoute license, which follows on 
from our entrance to Porcupine trough offshore Ireland during the second 
quarter.
 
While due to the [indiscern
ible] to Essaouira and Foum Assaka licenses in 
the Agadir basin offshore Morocco, it increases the play on fairway diversity, 
as well as the number and type of leads and prospects in one of the less 
undrilled salt basins along the Atlantic margins.
 
This ac
reage brings our total gross position in this underexplored frontier 
basin to over 25,000 square kilometers.
 
Moreover, with 82,000 square kilometers licensed to Kosmos, including 
56,000 square kilometers offshore Morocco and 26,000 square kilometers 
offsho
re Mauritania, we're now one of the largest acreage holders in 
Northwest Africa, significantly exposed to the 3 independent under or 
unexplored petroleum systems, each possessing multibillion barrel potential.
 
In our existing blocks, we continue to materia
l leads to prospects to the 
drilling stage in a timely manner. This quarter, we have completed the 
largest 3D seismic program ever acquired offshore Ireland, over 5,000 
square kilometers in the Porcupine trough and about operational as soon as 
the licenses
 
were signed.
 
We're also acquiring what we believe is the largest 3D seismic survey shot in 
West Africa this year, over 10,000 square kilometers, and this is nearing 
completion offshore Mauritania.
 
Earlier this year, we also completed 6,300 line kilometer 
2D seismic survey, 
covering the entirety of our Mauritania acreage position.
 
Based on very encouraging initial results from the 2D, we both accelerated 
and expanded our planned 3D seismic program.
 
Also a significant interpretation of both the Ireland and M
auritania surveys 
next year will position us to grow further explosion wells in these areas as 
early as 2015.
 
Offshore Suriname, final data processing volumes from the 3D seismic 
survey acquired early in the year of a portion of our 11,000 square kilometer
 
position is expected during this quarter. With new 2D seismic also in 
processing, interpretation should be completed during the first half of 2014.
 
New large 3D seismic surveys are currently being planned for both our Cap 
Boujdour license offshore Western
 
Sahara, as well as our Tarhazoute license 
in Morocco, during the early part of 2014 to provide exploration drilling 
opportunities for 2015 and beyond. This will most likely include a wide 
estimate 3D seismic survey, which we understand may be the first ac
quired 
offshore West Africa.
 
We've also made excellent progress in attracting strategic partners to join us 
in our exploration portfolio ahead of drilling. All our processes represent 
excellent industry peer review opportunities for us, as well as our inve
stors, 
and our recent initiatives have proven very successful.
 
Following on from our format with Chevron in Suriname during 2012, last 
month, we announced the formats of our 3 licenses in the Agadir Basins with 
BP, who will join us as a non
-
operated partne
r. BP brings a wealth of 
knowledge and technical expertise to the project, specifically their proven 
leadership in the exploration and exploitation of salt basins, including Nova 
Scotia, the conjugate twin basin in northern Morocco.
 
Their entrance into the
 
project, including the deal terms, is a testament to 
the resource potential of the Agadir Basin.
 
In the [indiscernible] basin offshore Western Sahara, we are pursuing our 
core largest theme in one of the largest undrilled Cretaceous deltas in the 
world, D
elta's giant seismic [indiscernible] to export exploration upside.
 
We recently announced that Cairn Energy has joined us as an non
-
operating 
partner in this venture. We're delighted to be an independent company with 
excellent standing, and our proven explo
ration track record has joined us 
here.
 
The deal terms, as well as the retention of a high working interest, reflects 
the size of the potential price here and our belief in it. We'll now move 
forward to position ourselves to drill the first well and Cap Bo
ujdour license 
in the second half of 2014.
 
All [indiscernible] of our Mauritania and Irish licenses are expected to 
commence later next year.
 
Final part of the process to enable exploration discovery is ensuring 
operational readiness, in particular, securi
ng rig capacity, unordering long 
lead time items to meet our rifle
-
shot drilling objective of about 3 or 4 well 
exploration campaign each year going forward.
 
We have already announced the contracting with the Atwood Achiever rig for 
3 years starting later 
next year. In addition, we're in final negotiations for a 
single slot on the second rig to Drill Eagle 1, the first well in our Foum 
Assaka license is expected to start in the first quarter of 2014.
 
Although faced with a highly competitive upstream environ
ment, we are 
nevertheless continuing to selectively and successfully evaluate new venture 
opportunities in frontier and emerging basins along the Atlantic margin to 
high
-
grade our second inning exploration portfolio.
 
Kosmos, as you know, was the original a
rchitect of the Jubilee play in the 
transform margin in West Africa. To much industry interest, existing plays in 
this region have begun to withdraw after [indiscernible[ Limited success.
 
This provides us with a second cycle exploration opportunity, involv
ing 
acreage 
--
 
new acreage positions or farming initiatives.
 
Our greenfield new ventures efforts are currently focused on reentering this 
play for the short term, as well as identifying new themes and geographies, 
along or adjacent to the Atlantic margins 
for the longer term.
 
Since our IPO in 2011, we have identified and acquired over 63,000 square 
kilometers of new acreage and shot nearly 26,000 square kilometers of 3D 
seismic, as well as extensive 2D, all focused at rebuilding our exploration 
portfolio an
d maturing prospects to the drilling stage. We've also secured 
partners in our advanced projects and are ensuring that we are operationally 
ready for our upcoming wells. We are now poised to commence our 
transformational exploration drilling program starti
ng in the new year.
 
I look forward to great anticipation to the results. Thank you. Now, operator, 
we'd like to open the call for questions.

I just want to understand the progression of operating costs. It sounded to 
me, if I heard correctly, that you expect operating cost to be at the same 
run rate th
at they were in Q3. But you also said the workovers would 
probably go down. So with workovers going down, do you expect OpEx to 
get closer to that 6 82 number that you reported net of workovers last 
quarter?
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
I think it's probably 
--
 
this is
 
Greg. There's probably more downside binders 
--
 
bias in that number in the fourth quarter, as you correctly alluded to, both 
for production expense, as well as our exploration expense categories I 
mentioned.

Yes, and just on exploration expense, you expensed the Akasa appraisal 
well. Was that

if it was successful, why was it included in expense? And 
was that the bulk of the exploration costs? Or was that most of the big 3D 
surveys?
 
W. Greg D
unlevy
 
It was mostly the big 3D surveys, as well as what we call our normal sort of 
run rate. G&G work, reprocessing studies and all that, which typically runs 
about $10 million a quarter. Now the Akasa
-
2A well under U.S. successful 
efforts accounting rule
s, we are actually required to expense that even 
though it's a completely and fully successful appraisal well, was designed to 
find the oil/water contract and be in the water leg so that we could use it, 
not only to appraise the deal, but as a future water
 
injector. Unfortunately, 
until we have an approved plan of development, these kind of expenditures 
actually are considered expense unless they only find oil. It's just a unique 
feature of U.S. GAAP for successful efforts accounting.

Okay, that makes sense. And then one broader question. I know you can't 
speak for BP's exploration team, but did they give you any indication as to 
what they were seeing offshore Nova Scotia that led them to Morocco
? I 
mean, have they expanded on prospects or kind of what they're looking for 
in both plays?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, John, it's Brian. Obviously, that offshore Nova Scotia and Morocco were 
once part of the same margin that joined up before the opening of the 
Atlantic. And they see a great analogy and similarity of the plays offshore in 
Nova Scotia to the plays offshore Morocco, but in terms of salt rocks and 
reservoir targets as well. And I think what most excites them about Morocco 
recognizing that it was bot
h 
--
 
there is both charge and reservoir risk. It's 
just the nature of some of the trap geometries, which are significant in size 
and very akin to many of the successful trap types that you see in other salt 
basins, in particular, the Gulf of Mexico.

So it's safe to say that the salt substance is more attractive than sort of the 
Cretaceous fan plays like Jubilee, because you do have both there, correct?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
We do have both, exactly, y
es. But it's the structural geometries created by 
the salt, which really attracted them, which is, of course, attractive to us, so 
it's nice to have both play types.

Just quickly, with regards to Ghana and the de
-
bottlenecking of the FPSO, 
you're in the process of discussing plans for the long term, how much do you 
think that would actually cost? And al
so in terms of timeline, how long would 
it take? And what could you ultimately sort of move production there? 
Secondly, with regards to Morocco, you're in the process here of finalizing 
your plans for the second rig, what's the chance that, that gets pushe
d out? 
And when do you think we will hear well results on your first well?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Okay, John, thanks for the questions. It's Brian here. Let me take the 
second one first. Yes, we're in the final stages of negotiation on a second rig 
of opportunity
. And in the event that, that comes through, there's still some 
uncertainty in the actual timing, given its current operations, but we see it 
spud some time around the first quarter, which would enable us to have 
results around mid
-
year on that first well.
 
Our second well in South Morocco, 
Western Sahara doesn't spud until later in the second half of the year. In 
terms of your first question on the de
-
bottlenecking, let me hand that over 
to Darrell to address.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Yes, thanks, Brian. John, wh
at we're doing right now is reviewing really the 
4 systems that affect the total FPSO capacity: gas, water, fluid and well 
capacity. And it's a balancing act of looking at short term versus long term. 
[Indiscernible] our focus is, obviously, trying to exit
 
the year at 120,000 
barrels per day. We do have a significant technical work going on to look 
longer term. It would be too early to really lay out any capital projections on 
that. It has to be, obviously, economic to do so in the longer term, so 
volumes a
nd capital is really under study right now.

And when you think about long term, when you talk about longer term, 
when you come up with a plan here, I mean, are we talking like 1 year? 2 
years? I mean, 
how long will the process take in order to increase capacity 
there? I mean, there's a number of different options out there, but how long 
would it take, potentially?
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Yes, I think you're looking at 1 year to 1.5 years for the bigger 
CapEx
-
type 
items, and there's lots of short
-
term small CapEx things that can be done in 
the interim to continue to bulk production on.

when you talk about bigger CapEx items, I mean, h

are we actually talking here in terms of a dollar amount?

I had just a question, looking at some of the recent presentations f
rom some 
of your peers, one that's highlighted, difficult to replicate the success we've 
seen at Jubilee, elsewhere in the West African and Equatorial margins. And 
you have seen a large number of noncommercial wells. Seems like the 
challenges that they enc
ounter in the reservoir, protecting the [indiscernible] 
charge focus. I wanted to see whether you have seen the riskiness of the 
Cretaceous play as increasing or decreasing after what you've learned from 
discovery of Jubilee, and then if you could relate t
his to your further 
exploration of the play.
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
John, this is Brian. That's a fantastic question. And in fact, that's something 
that our exploration team has been fully focused on in the last 6 months. So 
we were 
--
 
the time after we talked du
ring our strategical [indiscernible] 
pre
-
IPO, one of the benefits of it, there's a lot of downsides, one of the 
benefits of it was to allow us to sit on the sidelines and watch the industry 
drill multiple wells around the margin over the last several years
. And 
unfortunately, there hasn't been the success that we had back in 2007 with 
Jubilee. And so there's a wonderful laboratory out there now of different 
outcomes on different types of prospects and plays and leads in different 
parts of the basin, where w
e think we've been able to put an understanding 
together, which allows us to define criteria that lead to success and 
alternatively lead to failure on the play. And the key for us now is how can 
we leverage that into existing opportunities to where we thin
k may have 
been overlooked by the industry, and we have a very focused new ventures 
effort that try to do exactly that. Mauritania was really the first attempt on 
the back of that work to replicate the Jubilee discovery. We are very, very 
happy with what w
e're seeing there geophysically and hope we'll have 
success there in the future, but we believe that there are other parts of that 
margin that have been overlooked. They are few and far between, but we 
believe that 
--
 
we look, we think about it very simply
 
as we don't think we 
were smart enough several years ago to find the only big discovery on this 
trend back in 2007 and probably as others. It probably looked different from 
Jubilee, though.

Okay. And just in terms of a follow
-
up, you mostly got another well drilling 
in Morocco now transferring the theme core Cretaceous Delta prospect. I'm 
just wondering what you're watching for from that well that would have read 
across into t
he prospect in the [indiscernible] block?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes, I mean, it's a flank well on the basin and the Agadir basin for us. So it's 
not 
--
 
there's not a full readthrough from that well. It will provide us some 
information on reservoir and potentiall
y charge systems in the basin. But a 
very independent play time relative to our prospectivity that Cairn is testing 
that. And they are, we believe, more focused on the deeper part of the 
Cretaceous into the Jurassic, whereas we are focused from the tertiar
y all 
the way down to the Jurassic. So summary through, and we wish them luck, 
and hopefully they will unlock the basin and prove and work our petroleum 
system and make our job a little bit easier.

And just a follow
-
up and just back to the first question. It seems like one of 
the biggest issues up and down the transform margin has been reservoir. 
How would you connect knowing about de
-
risking of the reservoir aspect to 
-
-
 
for y
our Morocco drilling?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Yes. Well, I mean, in Morocco, it's sort of a bit of a different system up there 
in terms of the age and the nature of the reservoir systems. In the 
transform margin, it was part of our solution to the technical issues
 
around 
failure and success. We believe that we've established a structural and 
stratigraphic stroke reservoir providence model that helps us 
--
 
guides us 
into some of the areas where we may hope to see some better 
permeabilities, which is the fundamental 
issue. It's all about clay breakdown 
in [indiscernible]. So we pull a model together and obviously, it's not 
something that we're out there sharing with the rest of the industry. We're 
trying to leverage it and play competitive advantage to gain opportunit
ies at 
this time.

The first one on Jubilee. So now that you're on the cu
sp of getting to the 
plateau of 120,000 BPD, how long do you think that plateau is ultimately 
sustainable?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Thanks, Pavel. I'll let Darrell answer that one.
 
Darrell L. McKenna
 
Yes, John. That's a function, again, of well capacity and, of cou
rse, our 
success in being able to de
-
bottleneck along the way. But we see it to be 5 
to 7 years right now, conservatively, and NPA potentially could be a backfill 
to some of that plateau in the future.
 
Pavel Molchanov

Okay. And then secondly, and I apologize if this is maybe asking for a sneak 
pre
view of the meeting next week, but other than Ghana and Morocco, do 
you anticipate to be drilling in any other countries next year?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
It very much depends on how quickly the processing interpretation goes on 
the 3D. We are trying to position 
Mauritania acreage to drill, and our Irish 
acreage to drill in 2015, stroke '16, starting probably first in Mauritania at 
the beginning of '15. Depending on the schedule, we may be able to bring 
that later into next year. But our strategy is to

exploration. You won't see Kosmos drilling a lot of wells. I mean, we try and 
do a lot of homework and make sure we can de
-
risk them to the point that 
we can deliver success in a relatively few number wells to maximize our 
exploration efficie
ncies. So we're all about drilling 
--
 
try and drill the right 
wells and number of wells, whilst you want to get exposure because you do 
have to play the game to have success. It's not about drilling as many wells 
as you can't expect to [indiscernible] righ
t on. So we're very happy with the 
2

well program we've got next year. If it becomes 3, then that will be great.

My fantastic questions have already been asked. So kind of slightly minor 
questions. Just on that last point. So in terms of the farming on new 
ventures you're looking at, should we assume that you're not about to farm 
in immediately prior to any addi
tional wells? You're looking for slightly longer 
term ventures on that?
 
Brian F. Maxted
 
Al, yes. I mean, again, we're focused on the quality of the opportunity. 
Obviously, we have the financial flexibility to farm into wells that may be 
going down relative
ly soon, as we've seen in the frontier and emerging 
basins. One of the big challenges we have in today's competitive world is 
just the cycle time for exploration. And the best way to get around that is to 
shortcut it with a farm
-
in. And so we have been loo
king at a number of 
those. But our bread
-
and
-
butter, if you like, is greenfield exploration. We're 
also focused on new ventures that are greenfield and truly organic. So it's a 
bit of a mixture of both, that are proactive and reactive kind of new 
ventures.

Okay. And then my follow

on question was for Greg. I missed the under

lift 
figure, and if you can give out to me and then say whether you would 
strongly advise or modestly advise or advise to do you
r own thing in terms 
of whether you could get a third cargo in Q4, because it must be pretty close 
to being a third cargo next quarter.
 
W. Greg Dunlevy
 
We 
--
 
as we mentioned on the call, we're just under 300,000 under
-
lifted. 
Our guidance has been 8 cargoe
s for the year, which would be 2 cargoes in 
the fourth quarter of this year.
 
Al Stanton

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
But if you get production up to 115,000 barrels a day as an average, you 
should just about make a third cargo?
 
W. Greg Dun

You have to look, also, at the order in which cargoes are lifted. We can end 
up with under
-
liftings or over
-
liftings that are pretty significant. And I think 
under just about every scenario, you could probably project it would fall in 
January, not in 
December.

quarter 2011 

 
Before we get started, one housekeeping matter. This conference call 
includes forward
-
looking 
statements, the risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and in 
Kosmos SEC filings and they are incorporated by reference for this call. 
Management may also refer to certain non
-
GAAP measures such as EBITD
A 
or earnings before interest, taxes, DD&A and exploration. Management 

and future performance and these are commonly referred to metrics in the 
industry. Historical non
-
GAAP perfor
mance is reconciled to the appropriate 
GAAP measure in the earnings release.
 
At this time I would like to turn the call over to the President and CEO of 
Kosmos Mr. Brian Maxted for introduction and opening remarks. Please go 
ahead sir.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Good mo
rning everyone and good afternoon to our overseas callers. Thank 

Joining me on the call today are Greg Dunlevy, our CFO; Paul Dailly, our 
Senior Vice President of Exploration; and 
Brad Whitmarsh who has just 

know Brad.
 
I plan to start our comments with a review of our exploration production 
portfolio as well as our main events. Greg will then discuss our fin
ancial 
results followed by Paul will provide an operations review. We hope that 
everyone has seen the release that issued this morning. In addition we will 
find our second quarter 10
-
Q today.
 
We created Kosmos energy to execute the strategy of technical an
d 
commercial excellence focus on the exploration development of the world
-
class upstream portfolio. This approach has led to an unparalleled record of 
success and significant value creation for our shareholders. Our overall 
strategy is focused on doing thr
ee things: creating value through 
exploration, maximizing and delivering value through developments in 
production and managing the risks inherent in our business.
 
We believe in building a balanced portfolio of long
-
term core assets. For us 
that means conti
nuing our strong government programs focused on high 
margin production growth and then combining that significant low cost high 
value exploration. The Jubilee Field offshore Ghana is the core of our 
portfolio and the foundation of this company. Jubilee is 
one of the largest 
discoveries worldwide in 2007. As technical operations of the development, 
we and our partners brought the field on stream in a record 42 months with 
first oil achieved last November.
 
This is a world
-
class project with strong production 
capabilities and we 
expect net EBITDAX to Kosmos around a billion dollars per year at least at 
current strip prices. The stable long
-
term production cash flow from this core 
asset coupled with our strong balance sheet provides us the capital base to

In addition to ramping up to and maintaining plateau production at Jubilee, 
our operational strategy is focused on for additional elements: firstly, we are 
working to bring our other discoveries offshore Ghana into production, th
e 
progress is being made on this front with delineation and appraisal of the 
Enyenra and Tweneboa discoveries on the Deepwater Tano Block underway. 

discussions are ongoing with the Minist
ry of Energy and GMPC. And finally 
appraisal of the Teak discovery is planned in the near term as well.
 
Secondly, there remains plenty upside in our Ghana position. Recent 
exploration drilling on our West Cape Three Points Block has primarily 
targeted new 
deeper, previously on tested place and together with other 
recent drilling success elsewhere in the Tano Basin there is new play type of 
highway (ph) opportunities. We are off to pursue on our acreage through 
2012. Results on our Akasa prospect which is cu
rrently drilling are expected 
in the next couple of weeks.

Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you, Brian. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let me start 
by commenting on our strong financial position. The cornerstone of which is 
our sizable Jubilee cash flow as Brian mentioned earlier. Cash an
d cash 
equivalents at the end of the quarter was 818 million and total liquidity was 
near $1 billion including cash and available borrowing under our debt facility.
 
Since the end of the quarter, we have repaid 300 million on our debt facility 
from cash on 
hand. We feel confident in our financial position with sufficient 
liquidity to fund our development appraisal and exploration programs over 
the next several years.
 
Turning to second quarter financials, we reported a net loss of 9.1 million or 
$0.03 per bas
ic and diluted common share. As we went public in the second 
quarter this year, there are no equivalent per share numbers for 2010 and 
the second quarter of 2011 per share numbers are pro forma for the IPO.
 
Oil revenues in the quarter were $124.1 million f
rom Jubilee lifting of 
986,000 barrel with cash received in third quarter. The average daily 
production for the quarter was approximately 15,000 barrels per day, net to 
Kosmos or 66,000 barrels per day growth from the Jubilee Field. We were in 
under looked
 
position for the quarter to the tune of approximately 340,000 
barrels or approximately 35 million in revenues.
 
Oil and gas production costs were below $15 per barrel sold in the quarter, 
with depletion and depreciation about 22 per barrel. General and 
adm
inistrative costs were approximately 20 for the quarter. Of this, 
approximately 40% was non cash and related to long
-
term equity base 
compensation. Our interest expense was 18 million for the quarter, which is 
up slightly from last year on higher average d
ebt outstanding balance.
 
For the quarter, exploration expense was 85 million, which included costs 
related to Odum, (inaudible), Banda and Makore. In coordination with our 
partners, we have decided there was insufficient basis to declare Odum 
commercial du
ring the second quarter. The West Cape Three Points 
exploration period as you know ended in July of this year and we are 
pursuing a plan to relicense the relinquished acreage including the Odum 
area.
 
Looking forward to the second half of the year. We 
anticipate two liftings in 
the third quarter and two liftings in the fourth quarter. There is a small 
possibility, we might have a third lifting in the fourth quarter though this will 
depend on exact timing of partner liftings and the field production ramp
 
up 
rate during the balance of the year.
 
I want to provide a bit of cost guidance to go along with the outlook for 
liftings at Jubilee. As you would expect, these estimates have a band of 
uncertainty around them. For the full year 2011, we expect oil and g
as 
production costs of around $100 million, which correlates to our six liftings in 
the year four of which will be in the second half. Interest expense should be 
approximately 75 million and our G&A expense, we anticipate in the range of 
$95 million. Again
, 40% of that being non
-
cash expense permanently so to 

-
term equity incentive compensation program.
 
Our 2011 budget remains at 500 million, which is unchanged from the 
guidance previously given to you of which 85 to 90% is planned fo
r Ghana. 
To conclude, we are in a very solid position to executive our corporate 
strategy and fund our capital programs through the end of 2013.
 
Now, let me turn the call over to Paul Dailly.
 
Paul Dailly
 

our current portfolio 

great breadth and depth. In Ghana, we made a number of world class 
discoveries, highlighted by our first producing asset, the Jubilee. We have a 
number of addi

to be drilled.
 
In Cameroon, we have a substantial position in two petroleum system. The

ramp up in production ad Jubilee 
continues. We continue to work with partners and the Ghana government on 
the optimal approach for the development of Mahogany East. Our appraisal

are planning to drill two additional appraisal wells beginning later this year. 
And at Teak, we plan the first of two appraisal wells late in 2011.
 
On the exploration side, we spud th
e Akasa
-
1 exploration well in July on the 
West Cape Three Points Block. Now, we expect results of this well in the few 
weeks. Many of you have seen that we delivered of course, as you notice the 
Government of Ghana and Ghana National Petroleum Corporation 
related to 
the Cedrela prospect, when the drilling rate that we scheduled to arrive on 
location was delayed due to rig. The rig was working for another operator on 
a different block at that time.
 
Looking forward, we see an active drilling program in 2012 o
n both the 
Deepwater Tano on West Cape Three Points Block. We are also excited about 


Cameroon when we encounter
ed reservoirs and hydrocarbons and we will be 
evaluating the data to identify play elements in areas of the block through a 
liquid content and track effectiveness may improve. This will help us to 

k.
 
In Morocco, our program is moving forward. We are excited about the large 
potential we have access to between the Cap Boujdour and Foum Assaka 
areas. The new Foum Assaka license is located in the Aaiun Basin, which is 
underexplored area with some simila
r opportunities to Kosmos core plays in 
the late Cretaceous as well as a new potential pre
-
salt play. The acreage has 
proven source
-
rock and abundant structuring.
 
The first phase of exploration includes acquisition of 3D seismic project 
drilling decision. 
We are eager to get to work and could drill a cross well in 
the Foum Assaka license as early as 2013.
 
Our new ventures group continues to identify and evaluate numerous 
opportunities across the globe. Our approach is always been to tick our 
experience that
 
large volumes of oil and apply to new opportunities and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question this morning is
 
from 
the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please state your question. 
Mr. Doug Leggate, your line is open for question sir.
 
Brian Maxted
 
You can go to the next question operator.
 
Operator
 
Thank you, sir. Our next question is from Bob Morris, Cit
igroup.
 
Robert Morris 

 
Citigroup
 
Good morning.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Good morning.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Good morning, Bob.
 
Robert Morris 

 
Citigroup
 
Can you give us a little bit more color on the timing of Cedrela. First is the 
Marianas rig repaired in, you 
mentioned that you ready to proceed with 
drilling Cedrela and then also could there be any delay even once the rig is 
fixed in getting the government approval to extend the term of that lease to 
be able to drill Cedrela.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Paul, do you want answ
er to that question.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Yes, sure. Good morning everyone. Right now, the rig is been in (inaudible) 
in Ghana being repaired and repairing proceeding quite well. So, we expect 

 

resolved, we expect to drill the well.
 
Robert Morris 

 
Citigroup
 
Can you see the rig be ready fourth quarter?
 
Paul Dailly
 
Yes.
 
Robert Morris 

 
Citigroup
 
Okay. And then, this is second 
quick question on the budget, you mentioned 
that there is no change in 500 million a year. What displace I know the 
recent budget did not include Cedrela and did not include potential sidetrack 
at Jubilee. So, is there 

 
was it that those expenses displaci
ng now Odum 
that was previously planned to be drilled or how does that shape out to be 
unchanged?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Greg, if you want to go.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Bob, this is Greg. Two things, we actually have revised our budget during 
the year upward to cover some of 
these additional costs and we have a 
small amount of unallocated in the budget. So, given that we have adequate 
amount in the number, we provided as we estimate about seven, eight 
weeks ago. That included the Cedrela in that number as well. So, it was 
ther
e. The total cost of the additional sidetrack we mentioned are released, 

think 80 million will change 

 
gross will change the 500 million for the year.
 
Robert Morris 

 
Citigroup
 
Okay, great. Thank you.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks Bob.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Doug Leggate of Bank of 
America. Mr. Leggate, please state your question.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Hi, guys. Can you hear me now?
 
Brian Maxted
 
We c
an hear you Doug, yeah fine.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Probably guys 

 
you could hear me before. A couple of quick ones if I may. 
Greg, can you give us an update on the current stock as so 

 
I guess the 
negotiations are on the license 
extension on West Cape Three Points and I 
just want to be clear on what you said about Odum. Did you see Odum was 
not the declared commercial and does that mean Odum that is also you had 
to relinquish there because you run does well. Any update there that 
would 
be appreciated and I have a quick follow
-
up.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 

discussing the technical merits and where we stand with the Odum 
discovery. During the quarter, we concluded we were not 
prepared to go 
forward with commercial exploration and therefore a development or plan a 
development with government.
 
On July 21st, the seven year exploration period for the license expired and 
with that the area related to Odum. As you may recall, we have
 
under our 
existing license rewrite on similar terms to relicense the relinquished area as 
well as a right of first refusal should GNPC given off of the third party to 
match that offer and thereby we acquire the relinquished area. The total cost 
related to
 
the Odum charged exploration expense was approximately 32.5 
million pretax or 21 million after the tax effected for 35% gaining of tax 
rate.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Thanks Greg. I guess the reason for the question is my understanding 
originally was
 
that Odum was perhaps probably looked out as a potential 
development along with some of the other smaller discoveries. Does that 
changed the game plan and in terms of how you might move forward with 
some of the other developments on the block.
 
Greg Dunlev
y
 

 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah Doug, this is Brian here. I think you are exactly right, we think 

 
we 
have seen, still see Odum as a path for integrated development and the 
central and western part of t
he West Cape Three Points Block and tied back 
into the Teak in Mahogany East area is the most sensible and most likely 
way forward for Odum, which is challenged for couple of technical reasons 
principally the lower gravity oil that exists in that reservoir
.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Great. Thanks Brian. My own 

 
my very quick follow
-
up then is this one is 
for Paul. Paul, the relationship between Cedrela as a prospect on the 
Paradise well that has start, could you maybe just give any kind of prognosis 
o
f how the Paradise result make the potential prospectively of Cedrela and I 
leave it at that. Thank you.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Okay. The Paradise well and also the Banda well are being drilled into deeper 
horizons than we previously drilled anything in the block and
 
so we opened 
up a new play theory and that play theory extends over we think over our 

of the additional prospects and Cedrela is one of the prospects which 
emerged in that process. S

able to drill it soon.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Is your understanding is Cedrela is a separate prospect or a part of the same 
formation possibly in the context of Paradise.
 
Paul Dailly
 

ve that information to know the answer to that to be 

 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Got it. Thanks for taking my question guys.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Okay.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from t
he line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. 
Please state your question.
 
Edward Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Yes, good morning everyone and congratulation on the strong realizations 

t
ricky to make a comparison against the quarter average price of Brent. Can 
you give us a feeling of what you achieve relative to Brent for that cargo?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Hey Greg, do you want to take that?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Yeah, that cargo was priced at approximately $1 above Brent. Our most 
recent cargo was priced at approximately $0.40 above Brent and it really 
depends on the market for African and specifically West African crudes. 
These are the Brent exactly where that di

process. We and our partners Anadarko, Tullow, GNPC and others, building 

buyers so far. That group is expanding and we as expand that further, we 
w
ould expect that band of pricing to now or to Brent to a bit. But, 
fundamentally the difference is that the West African market, these will be 
the North Sea market and the relative differentials for transportation that 
are incurred.
 
Edward Westlake 

 
Credi
t Suisse
 
Thanks. And the second question relate around timing on FID of next 
project. Obviously, just you flagged appraisal work at Enyenra, Kombe 


ke a decision potentially around taking 
the next FID on the next perhaps project in either block.
 
Brian Maxted
 

in the last quarter through this part of the year that we have a 
major focus 

And Enyenra appears to be the simplest, most conventional oil development 
along lines of Jubilee itself. And so, because of that for instance more reason 
to being move fo
rward quickly. And I think the partnership as a whole sees 
that as a like in next development. Tullow, the operator is looking towards 
completion appraisal declaring commerciality on submitting a development 
plan probably in the early part of next year.
 
Ed
ward Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
And if I was to just talk about Teak and Mahogany East because you could 
tie this back to Jubilee or potentially to Odum. So, what are thoughts there?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, I mean Teak and Mahogany East at various stages of appra
isal 
obviously. Teak quite early and we believe there is a very substantial 
resource in that west central part of West Cape Three Points. But, over the 

volumes that justify a stan
dalone development. So, we are eager to move 
continued 

 
continuing to move Mahogany East along same time in parallel 
with delineation in later part of this year and into next year of Teak which is 
multiple reservoirs, multiple pay zones, multiple fluid ty
pes and could be 
quite a significant development for us.
 
Edward Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Right. And then, my final question, just picking on a comment. You said, you 
are discussing Force Majeure with the government. Presume that would 
happen on any Force M
ajeure, but, this is around the rig for Cedrela. But, 
are there any risks of that acreage would have to be relinquished or you feel 
these discussions basically will work out in your favor and that that acreage 
will continue to be part of existing seven
-
yea
r license period?
 
Brian Maxted
 
We think we are in a pretty strong force majeure position given the situation 
and what happened in the rig with handling the tankers (ph) before coming 
to the block and so we believe we will ultimately move forward on 
south, 

 
Edward Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Please 
state your question.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Socie
te Generale
 
Hi, some quick ones. With the Tweneboa DST that you did finish, could you 
discuss the results more.
 
Brian Maxted
 

 
Paul Dailly
 
Yeah, sure. Iweneboa
-
2 an oil DST which he completed probably a mo
nth or 
so doing that. That was successful test of the one of the oil zone Tweneboa 
fluid at 6.5 million barrels a day with about 5 million cubic feet of gas. So 
that was successful DST and right now we are in the middle of a second DST 
Tweneboa
-
4 which is 



-
date.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 
Okay. How long will the Enyenra wells tak
e to TD?
 
Paul Dailly
 
Once we finish Tweneboa
-
4 we are going to go back and start drilling 
Enyenra again. The next activity there is in Enyenra
-
3 we should be fairly 



 
t
hree to four weeks once we re
-
spud it. And then following that 
we will do DST in Enyenra on the original well, discovery well is drilled and 
then towards the end of the year, late fourth
-
quarter will probably drill 
Enyenra
-
4. So by the end of the year we s
hould a lot more information on 
Enyenra.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 
Okay. With Cameroon what kind of shares did you have, can you be more 

 
Paul Dailly
 
Well, in terms of gas and water in a 
variety of different sands, we actually 
had quite thick sand section, thicker than we had anticipated. Right now we 
are going back and remapping to understand what the implications are for 
the track and geometrics and for the migration. So there is probabl
y a few 
months of work to be done there to understand what our next move is in the 
block.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 

 
Paul Dailly
 
It was a mixture, there was some dry gas and we also had some wetter gas 
there as 
well.
 
John Herrlin 

 
Societe Generale
 
Last one from me is on Morocco, will you try to bring in partners given your 
high working interests on some of your blogs there or religious way to do the 
P&G and then consider promotes?
 
Paul Dailly
 
Right now in Morocc
o, we have some work to do with seismic with 

first, so you understand exactly what our strategy is before bringing partners 
in.

Hi, guys. This is Brandon Warren from London here.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Hi, Bra

Brandon Warren 

 
Jefferies
 
Just a couple of questions, most have been answered, but just one I guess 
following Banda in the Campanian, now that you have time to evaluate it 
and build it back into your models, I mean just how has that changed your 
vie
w on the Campanian on the West Cape Three Points Block. And then 
there is secondly also read through from obviously the Eni discovery, does 
that mean sort of any further prospectively on your acreages will.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Paul, they are probably your questio
ns. Thanks, Brandon.
 
Paul Dailly
 

shallower objective and then the kind of the pay zone was done in 
Cenomanian. We were pretty done there on the Campanian. It was wet and 
that was a di
sappointment. It fit into the whole discussion around Odum, but 
of course there is an update potential in there, Odum scale of that potential 


 

better to be honest with you and oper


 
released that much 
clear results. But in general, with the ENI discovery, the Banda deeper pay, 
which was the first well to open up this new Cenomanian play and then a

area.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anish Kapadia with UBS. 
Please state your 
question.
 
Anish Kapadia 

 
UBS
 
Good morning. There are a few questions. Firstly on the gas side of things, 
there has been quite a lot of gas discovered now in Ghana. I was just 
wondering what your thoughts are around gas monetization if you had any 
conversa
tions with your partners. And secondly on production from Jubilee, I 
was just wondering if you could run through some of the issues you had with 
production and some of the reasons for the delay in the ramp up of that. 
And then just a final one on the West 
Cape Three Points Block, just 
wondering when should we expect to hear something about the extension 
over here, and what do you hope to drill.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Okay, Anish, thanks for those questions. Let me, probably, let me take them 
in the following order, l
et me talk about the West Cape Three Points license 


 
touched on that, the process is 
ongoing with GMPC, as you know we have first right refusal and they do 
have the opportunity to market the area. We are in the midd
le of preparing 
for that process. And our estimate is a roundabout six months to get through 

 
In terms of Jubilee production, the first thing to know is this is a world
-
class 
field. Ev
erything that we have seen from the reservoir in terms of 
performance since the start of production is nothing but confirmed the 
originally predicted volumetric range that we saw for the first oil. So this 
remains a giant field with spectacular production 
capability. The challenges 

the start
-
up phase of any major field and obviously particularly the one 

 

 
The delays 

 
the de
lays are really related to two principal thing and probably 
an additional factor. The principal issue has been a significant amount of rig 
maintenance particularly with respect BOP, refurbishment was necessarily on 
the already crowded rig which delayed com
pletion, cyclical completion of 

 

both the water injection system the gas injection system, those are now on 
their way to being resolved,
 
which is good news. And then there have been 
one or two wells that suffered largely from completion related problems in 
productivity. And as we discussed part of plan to get to plateau production 
involves sidetracking of one of those wells into a better p
osition. So, we are 

achieve its potential plateau production target around the end of the year, 
and then we folks will be on maintaining that production, we plateau for as 
long as o
bviously possible.
 
The third question on the gas and this is a great point. There is obviously a 
substantial amount of gas discovered already in the base of the well there 
(ph) and others now both associated and free gas. And as we look to start 
exploring 
some of these deeper horizons, the phase risk for gas gets higher. 
So, we could very 

 
we could end up with a very significant amount of gas in 
this province. And finding solutions both for the Jubilee but also for the other 
fields is going to be crucial t
o commercialize the liquids in particular on these 
discoveries.
 
So we were very pleased to see the establishment of the GNGC by the 

business from the government standpoint. And we look for
ward to working 
with GNGC both as Kosmos and as part of a broader consortium with any 
industry to assist the government and support the government in putting 
that structure to commercial the gas.

Our next question is from Al Stanton with RBC. Please state your question
.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC
 
Yes. Good morning, guys. Just a follow onto that question on whether that 
was an oil or an oil equivalent figure. But my main question is really in terms 
of the renegotiation of the West Cape Three Point. I was wondering what 
elements of the PFC (ph) can be flexed. Is it the thins like the equity stake, 
is it the fiscal terms, is it work commitments? Thank you.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes, this is Brian here. As we mentioned earlier in the questions, this process 
is ongoing. Our GMP has t
he market to 

 
the right to market the acreage. 
The language in the petroleum agreement talks about substantially the 

 
essentially the same terms. Obviously this will be a discussion in negotiation 
and will be subject to whatever third parties may put on 
the table. And we 
will have to wait and see what that is.
 
On Cedrela, Paul, do you want to take the Cedrela part of question?
 
Paul Dailly
 


 
some of the horizons are deeper, then 

some fees risk attached to that.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC
 
And then 

 
sorry, just a follow on question. In terms of as we stand today, 
what do you reckon is going to be the 2012 exploration campaign?
 
Brian Maxted
 

 
that one too.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Well, all the 

 

we end up. But actually, we explained how a fairly robust drilling campaign 
in the Deepwater Tano Block in 2012. And this year, Deepwater Tano is 
mostly r
efocused on appraisal of Enyenra and Tweneboa. That process will 
come to an end sometime early 2012. And the operator who I think, is going 
to give some sort of presentation in the next couple of weeks will 

 
is 
planning affiliate robust drilling program n
ext year in Deepwater Tano.
 
In West Cape Three Points, this year, we have Akasa which is currently 

-
3 potentially 
Teak
-

(Operator Instructions) Gentlemen, w
e have a question from Brendan Warn 
from Jefferies. Please state your question.
 
Brendan Warn 

 
Jefferies
 
Sorry, gentlemen. Just a quick follow
-
up question regarding that statement, 
just in 2012 what sort of risk we got (inaudible) us in not being drilled a
nd if 
they fall outside of the West Cape Three Points current license area.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Paul.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Well, I mean, as Brian already total debate, we got a process with GNPC 

the petroleum agreement and we have the right to match whatever offer 
they get. So, we feel fairly good that we have the opportunity to drill those 

 
Brendan Warn 

 
Jefferies
 
And within that timeframe w
hen you flag next six months, at what point 
would be call booking a rig slot so those wells and the risk of sliding into 
2013.
 
Paul Dailly
 
We have quite a lot of rig capacity with the Atwood Hunter next year, which 
will be split between a variety of 
activities, either appraisal or exploration 


 
Brendan Warn 

 
Jefferies
 
Okay. Thanks guys. Just a 
follow
-
up question on the Jubilee Field. It may be 
too early, but, are there any deep bottlenecking opportunities being 
highlighted in terms of the actually facility itself?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Sorry, Brendan. This is Brian. Yes, there are as we talked earlier. S
ome 
bottleneck opportunities. Fundamentally, we believe these facilities have the 

this point. We are focused ongoing production capacity in place and ensuring 
particularly the wate
r injection and the gas injection systems are working on 
a good enough time basis which possibly get them FSO (ph) as a whole is 
working about 95% up time at the moment which is spectacular really and 

d as we go into 
next year, we got up to our plateau and the operator will be focusing few 
bottleneck 

 
on optimizing the top side facilities to get to make full use of 
the facilities that are available.
 
Brendan Warn 

 
Jefferies
 
Okay. Thanks guys.

And Brendan, I made one of the comments on the prospectively that the 
West Cape Three Points. Obviously, we try to manage a portfolio, we bring 

discuss Foum Assaka in Morocco. B
ut, as we start to pickup new petroleum 
systems with very, very significant potential which have all the hallmarks of 
Ghana four or five years ago. We have to look at all the prospects in Ghana 
within the context of allocating capital on whatever our best 
prospects are 
and they may not 

 
they just may not be in Ghana, they maybe in 
Cameroon or Morocco or indeed in another new venture that will come into 

 
that we expect to come into the portfolio in the coming months.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. I would now like to
 
the turn the call back over to Mr. Whitmarsh 
for closing comments.

Good day everyone, welcome to Kosmos Energy's Third Quarter 2011 
Conference Call. Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. It is now my 
pleasure to turn the floor over to Brad Whitmarsh, VP of IR at Kosmos 
Energy. Thank you sir, you 
may begin.
 
Brad Whitmarsh
 
Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Hopefully 
you have seen the earnings release that we issued this morning. In addition, 
we will be filling our 10
-
Q with the SEC shortly. Joining me on the call to
day 
are Brian Maxted, President and CEO, Greg Dunlevy, Executive Vice 
President and CFO, Marvin Garrett, Senior Vice President, Production and 
Operations, and Paul Dailly, Senior Vice President of Exploration.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention tha
t this conference call includes 
certain forward
-
looking statements which are based on our most reasonably 
expectations. The risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have 
been outline in the earnings release, and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refe
r to certain non
-
GAAP financial measures such as EBITDAX, 
or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, DD&A and Exploration. The management 
believes such measures are important in looking at the company's historical 
and future performance, and these are commonly re
ferred to metrics in the 
industry.
 
Historical non
-
GAAP performances reconciled to the appropriate GAAP 
measure in our earnings release. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to 
Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Brad and good morning everyone. I'd like to 
start off today with 
some open comments focused on our strategic goals and accomplishments 
in the third quarter. Greg will then discuss that strong financial results for 
the period, and Marvin will follow with some context on the progress of 
Jubilee, to be
 
followed by Paul who will updates on our exploration and 
appraisal programs.
 
In the context of the bigger picture, everything we do at Kosmos as an 
organization is focused on two corporate goals. One, the foundation of this 
company is exploration. So our 
priority, is to find and unlock new petroleum 
systems. We firmly believe and our history has proven that the best way to 
create value in this business is organic exploration success, the results of 
executing on a world class portfolio.
 
Strategically, we fo
cus on frontier on emerging basins, these are the areas 
that we believe are offer the greatest upside in finding substantial quantities 
of high value barrels. During the quarter, we made significant progress in 
continuing to build out our portfolio of new 
venture opportunities with 
discipline and diligence, focusing on areas where we can create a 
competitive advantage and maximize value.
 
I'm extremely excited about the expansion of our position offshore Morocco, 
where we entered into a new petroleum agreeme
nt for Essaouira block in 
the Agadir Basin which followed the signing of Foum Assaka last quarter.
 
We've now captured approximately 12 million gross acres offshore Morocco, 
about 30 times the size of Ghana position. So this is a very substantial area 
with 
multiple prospect tights and huge running rate. We are planning to start 
a sizeable 3D seismic acquisition survey over these new blocks shortly.
 
Our new ventures team continue to identify opportunities to grow and 
diversify our exploration portfolio includ
ing a number of place in our existing 
geography at West Africa, as well as in other adjacent geographic areas and 
similar geological themes. We are very pleased with the team's progress to 
date.
 
Our goal is to increase our exposure to new hydrocarbon syste
ms, and we're 
pulling together a very attractive lineup of basin in play wells for 2013 and 
2014. Our second goal is to grow and mature the value of Hydrocarbon 
systems we've already opened. Obviously, for us, that is in Ghana, where we 
continue to have fo
llow
-
on exploration success.
 
We're also progressing the appraisal development and production of our 
existing discoveries. At third quarter we've a number of big accomplishments 
on that front including a new discovery Akasa on our operated West Cape 
Three P
oints Block which had multiple good quality reservoirs.
 
We also had success at the Enyenra
-
3 appraisal well, highlighting the 
significance of that major oil field. An additional appraisal like Enyenra and 
Teak is currently underway. Exposing our company to
 
meaningful resource 
upside and helping us to best define the extents of these discoveries.
 
Paul will talk through these programs in just a bit. Our Jubilee, guidance 
from the unit operators suggest that we are delayed in ramping up 
production to full faci
lity capacity. As previously mentioned, we're in the 
process of sidetracking the J
-
7 well, and we expect that well to be online 
early next year.
 
The FPSO in the reservoir pits would be performing at very high levels, 
however downhole completion issues have
 
recently impacted production 
sample of the wells. We believe that this is a well completion design matter 
with no impact on the ultimate recovery resources at Jubilee.
 
It's a timing issue on the ramp up of Jubilee and the operators are taking the 
necessar
y steps to identify and implement appropriate remediation 
measures. With two 

 
liftings and strong Brent pricing we generated over 
$190 million of EDITDAX in the quarter. Combined with great progress in our 
exploration programs, it was a great quarter for 
Kosmos.
 
Now I'd like to hand over the call to Greg for financial review.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you, Brian. I'll begin by commenting on the further improvement of 
our balance sheet in the third quarter. At the end of September, we had over 
$650 million in cash
 
after paying down $300 million on our credit facility 
during this quarter. Our long
-
term debt balance at the end of the quarter 
was $1 billion.
 
Available liquidity grew to almost $1.1 billion consisting of cash on
-
hand and 
available borrowings under our f
acility. This is an improvement of $115 
million from the end of last quarter.
 
Strong earnings and cash flow certainly benefited our overall financial 
position, and we feel very good about our ability to fund our development 
appraisal and exploration progra
ms through 2014 with currently available 
resources.
 
We reported net income of $52 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted 
common share for the quarter. With our IPO in May of this year, there are 
no equivalent per share numbers for 2010, last year.
 
Total re
venues in the quarter were $233 million led by our two Jubilee field 
liftings which totaled nearly 2 million barrels of oil sold. The crude at Jubilee 
continues to trade well on the market were the last several cargos trading at 
about $2 above Brent. Both 
operating expense and DDA on a per barrel 
basis were lower than the second quarter, this year as we had two liftings in 
the third quarter versus one in the second quarter.
 
Oil and gas production cost was approximately $12 per barrel sold, down 
15% from the
 
second quarter, depletion and depreciation was about $21 per 
barrel. General administrative cost were $39 million in the quarter with over 
50% if this G&A number being non
-
cash and associated with our long
-
term 
equity incentive compensation program.
 
Our interest expense was $17 million down from the second quarter as a 
result of the lower debt balance. With our exploration and appraisal drilling 
success in the quarter, exploration expense was only $11 million this 
included certain seismic costs, but w
e also had some carryover cost from the 
second quarter drilling of the Makore and the Ghana wells.
 
Our pre
-
tax net income was over $102 million which should line up well 
versus most of the analyst models. Our effective tax rate for the third 
quarter was 49
% with virtually all of the taxes deferred. In Ghana, we 
accrue taxes at 35% statutory rate. In our non
-
Ghana locations, we did not 
accrue any taxes either because we have a full valuation allowance in that 
jurisdiction, or we are operating in a jurisdicti
on that does not have an 
income tax. So we expect going forward, at least for the near terms, to be 
above the 35% range.
 
I'll wrap up with comments on our expectations for the remainder of the 
year. We anticipate two Jubilee oil liftings in the fourth quar
ter, on the cost 
side of things, based on our performance to date, an outlook for the fourth 
quarter, operating expense should come in slightly under $100 million on a 
full
-
year outlook. G&A looks to be a little bit above our earlier expectations 
which was
 
95 million for the full year.
 
On interest expense, we are still expecting about $75 million for the year. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter is anticipated to be up a bit for the 
fourth quarter versus the third quarter rate primarily as a result of th
e 3D 
seismic program in Morocco, for which we do not accrue tax benefit.
 
We are on track with our 2011 capital program of $500 million, unchanged 
from earlier in the year. We are now in the process of working through our 
2012 budgets, and we expect to fina
lize that over the next couple of 
months.
 
We plan to give an update on the 2012 plan in the early part of next year. 
During the quarter, the first Jubilee unit tract redetermination was 
completed resulting in increased of our interest from 23.5% to 24.1%. 
The 
original tract participations in the Jubilee unit were 50% for both West Cape 
Three Points and the Deep Water Tano Blocks. After expert analysis the unit 
interest have been changed to 54.3% for the West Cape Three Points Block 
and 45.63% for the Deep W
ater Tano Block.
 
Let me now turn the call over to Marvin.
 
Marvin Garrett
 
Thanks Greg. Focusing in on Jubilee, we have produced over 22 million 
barrels of oil safely exported 21 cargos. The FPSO is performing at a very 
high efficiency level, with over 98% u
ptime during the quarter. The reservoir 
is performing as expected, we've seen good pressure support across the 
producing reservoirs. As a reminder, we are only in the first year of 
production from the field, and we've only partially developed two of the fi
ve 
reservoirs.
 
Since the field has been on production, we've been acquiring valuable, 
dynamic reservoir information which will allow us to optimize future phases 
and maximize recovery. All of the Phase 1 wells, have been drilling 
completed and we are curre
ntly in the process of sidetracking the J
-
7 well.
 
Fuel production is currently about 80,000 barrels a day from eight 
producers, and we anticipate the J
-
7 sidetrack to come online around the 
end of the year or very early next year. In a number of the produc
ing wells, 
we've seen a recent reduction in productivity.
 
The operator in Jubilee partners, have undertaken a range of studies and 
technical valuations to help identify the issue. In the information we have 
today, we believe the lower productivity is attri
buted to less than optimal 
well completion design, and we are confident that this issue will not have an 
impact on ultimate recoverable resources.
 
As we are sidetracking the J
-
7 well, we will be implementing new completion 
design and anticipate seeing the 
results of this remediation after a couple of 
months of collection history. This will help us in assessing any other 
remediation needs and the timing of such activities.
 
Planning for the next phase of development of Jubilee has been completed 
and the Phase
 
1A plan has been submitted to the government for approval. 
The plan includes the drilling and completion of five additional producers and 
three additional water injectors. We anticipate commencing Phase 1 
operations in the first half of 2012. Jubilee is a
 
world
-
class field, it's in its 
early life.
 
We are continuing to learn about the field while working to ramp up to 
production capacity. We have plans to 

 
once we achieve plateau, to 
maintain that plateau for multiple years into the future.
 
Now let me turn
 
over to Paul who will comment on the exploration of the 
pricing programs.
 
Paul Dailly
 
Thanks, Marvin. I'm going to wrap up our prepared comments by 
highlighting our ongoing appraisal and exploration programs. In Ghana, for 
our operated block at West Cape 
Three Points, we recently announced the 
Akasa exploration well find over 100 feet of net oil base in multiple good 
quarter reservoirs. This is a great result for Kosmos, and adds to our 
growing discovered resource base.
 
Operations that Teak 3 are currently
 
ongoing and we anticipate results by 
the end of the month. With Teak 3, we're testing with strategic extension of 
the field beyond the discovered structure in Teak 1. There's a large range of 
potential resources on the Teak and the results will help us be
tter define and 
reduce uncertainty on that range.
 
We're also planning additional appraisal work in 2012 on Teak, the extent on 
that work will depend on the success of the Teak 3 well and the Teak 4 well 
which is scheduled to be drilled beginning late first
 
quarter next year. Our 
strategy for the West Gate Three Points Block, is to fully appraise the 
resources in our discoveries to determine the optimal development plan.
 
We anticipate being in position, nine to 12 months from now to determine 
the best develo
pment plan going forward for the discoveries on this block. 
On deep water tunnel the other Ghana block, Brian mentioned the successful 
Enyenra
-
3 appraisal well which confirmed a continuous oil core for almost 
1200 feet in the field. We also confirmed stati
c communication over a 
distance of about 8 miles between Enyenra
-
3 the updip well and Enyenra
-
2, 
the downdip well.
 
We are currently redrilling the original discovery well. We will be performing 
a fluid test, and that will allow us to test further 

 
the com
munication 
between the other wells where we set pressure gauges.
 
We will then drill Enyenra
-
4 which is 4 miles further down depth from 
Enyenra
-
2. The deep water tunnel block partners anticipates submitting the 
field plan of development in the first half of
 
2012 as a high volume FPSO 
project. The Enyenra development will likely include a pilot project for the 
gas condensate discoveries at Tweneboa and in Ntomme to provide early 
information that will assist in facilitating optimal design for the fuel field 
de
velopment.
 
Overall, things are moving forward very importantly on both kind of blocks I 
mean on the midst of very impactful appraisal programs. Between now and 
the end of 2012, we will drill something between eight to 16 explorations 
and appraisal wells, b
ut as part of that program, we anticipate our own 
senior exploration prospects being tested on the deep water tunnel block 
next year.
 
So it's a very active and significant program over the next 15 months at 
Ghana. And we also anticipate beginning drilling 
of our first operated 
prospect in Cameroon around year
-
end 2012. In Morocco, we're very excited 
about the wells potential we now have access to.
 
We have expanded our Agadir basin position with a new Essaouira license 
which awaiting signoff from the Morocca
n government, consistent with our 
positions Foum Assaka we will operate Essaouira 37.5% working interest. 
Both Foum Assaka and Essaouira have multiple play types including the 
company's core late Cretaceous play and addition to that, also a significant 
pre
-
sold Atlantic margin plate.
 
Our near
-
term plan is to shoot something close to 5,000 square kilometers 
of 3D seismic staffing in the next few weeks. This is the first step towards a 
well decision with the potential for fast drilling in 2013. The exploratio
n 
team, including our new ventures program, we are focusing on identifying, 
capturing and ultimately opening multiple new hydrocarbon basins.
 
We're in a great position to do exactly that with strong financial bandwidth 
and excellent technical capabilities.
 
When we open a new basin, we are 
focused on growing, maturing that basin to follow on success in development 
and production. Operator, we like to open the call for questions at this time.

seen estimates of you know, $200 million, I've seen estimates of $500 
million to basically remediate the completion and perhaps do some 
additional sidetracks, I mean where within that range and why or what do 
we have to look for
 
to understand where that CapEx might come in? Thanks.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Hi Edward, it's Brian, let me take that question, make some generic 
comments and then if there's any follow
-
ups, specifically, I'll hand over to 
Marvin. You know, I think the big picture o
n Jubilee is, it is a phase 
development. We phased it for two reasons. First is to create value through 
that acceleration of that development and we clearly have done that. By the 
end of this year, we will have lifted and 

 
up to six cargos net to the 
comp
any which is obviously significant for us.
 
And the second reason is because we're facing the field to learn in the early 
part of its development. And what we are seeing right now is very much a 
learning process as we fully anticipated.
 
And you need to reme
mber that only two of the five reservoirs of Jubilee and 
with the first 300 million barrels of resource there is being 

 
is actually being 
developed as part of that first phase. But it is a learning exercise where we 
are focused on learning how the reservo
ir and the wells perform with respect 
to designing the optimal full field development plan.
 
So this is exactly the reason why we phased that development. The second 
point to note is that from the learning today in terms of reservoir 
surveillance from the w
ells, suggest that there is good communication 
between the water injectors and the producers. And so we are very 
confident that ultimately the recovery reserves of this field, may indeed be 
even greater than we currently carry.
 
There's really no reason to 
understand why we shouldn't see higher recovery 
rate in the longer term than we currently got in our base case. The challenge 
is on Jubilee at this point are very much related, the delay has previously 
been related to rig maintenance delays with the route 
and beyond that was 
commissioning of the FPSO, and the water injection and the injections size, 
and then most recently, as you 

 
I think I've heard with the wells, the 
completions issues around some of the wells.
 
At this point in time, we are not certain t
o the extent of the issue, it is a 
near wellbore plugging issue of pore spaces related to possibly define 
migration. And as you know, we talked about the J
-
7 well which we are 
sidetracking, and we'll incorporate what we believe will be a resolution of the 
issue which we hope to be a resolution of the issue.
 
Beyond that to actually answer your question in terms of will be 200 or 500 
million, it's just too early to tell at this point how much remediation work will 
be required on this first phase wells.
 
Marvin
 
do you want to add anything to it?
 
Marvin Garrett
 
I think that's exactly right. Brian. J
-
7 is important to get that completion 
design change done and the partnership is continuing to work together to 
understand what the various options are and what the im
pact might be in 

 
to continue to solve this wellbore issue.
 
Edward Westlake 

 
Credit Suisse
 
And maybe just one follow
-
on for just kind of 

 
is there any risk of this sort 
of 18,000 sort of depth 

 
in terms of production before 

 
and stops to be 
resolved a
nd pushed back up to design capacity?
 
Marvin Garrett
 
Well what we've been doing right now is we've 

 
one of the things that we 
have been doing is the wells that have been affected more severely, we've 
been doing some bull
-
heading, we've been regaining some
 
of the 
productivity and we will continue to cycle and do that, and I think we've 
been maintaining where we are right now for a few months.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Legga
te from Bank of

Doug Leggate

Thanks, good morning fellows, thanks for taking my questions. A couple of 
quick ones if I may, I wonder if I could ask you just to go a little deeper into 
the actual
 
nature of the completion problem. I mean are we talking about 
sanding or mash issues or what exactly is the nature of 

 
from a mechanical 
standpoint, what you see is actually the issue. And how will the 

 
I guess the 
sidetrack and the subsequent wells of 
Phase 1A change in terms of 
completion design?
 
I got a quick follow up.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Hi Doug, Brian, hopefully we'll see you next week.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Looking forward to it, thanks Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yes, let me ask Marvin to answer 
that for you.
 
Marvin Garrett
 
Okay, just very simply, with the work that we have done, the bull
-
heading, 
we've confirmed that it is near wellbore region, we believe that we need to 
change the size of the pore spaces, very near wellbore which means that the 
design chains that we're doing in implementing on J
-
7 sidetrack.
 
It's going to be to increase the gravel size and also change the screen design 
that will increase the flow area and the pore spaces very near wellbore and 
within the completion.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Is there any reason why you can't pull the existing completions? Or is it just 
not cost effective to do that?
 
Marvin Garrett
 
Well we want to get away from the very near wellbore region, that's why 
we're sidetracking it. It's a conservativ
e approach, we want to have good 
clean reservoir and then put in what we believe is the optimal completion.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Bank of America
 
Got it, thanks a lot. My follow
-
up is really to post question about exploration 
plans on the West Cape Three Points B
lock specifically, I wonder if you could 
give us an update in any change to the lease extension or the status of the 
lease [ph] generally?
 
A little more specific where are we with (inaudible) in terms of getting back 
to that one at some point? And I'll lea
ve it at that, thank you.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Brian here, Doug, yes thanks. Yes, as you know, there's a provision within 
the existing petroleum agreement for the government of Ghana to market 
the relinquished part of the block in west cape three point. You may be
 
aware that we actually retained almost half of the original block containing 
all of the discoveries that we've made and that's a significant part of the 
prospect there.
 
That process that the government has the right to conduct is underway. 
They have given
 
us guidance that it would be the end of the year beginning 
of the next year when they would come back to us at which point as you 
know, we have a first right refusal on whatever proposal they may have 
engaged.
 
So that process is ongoing and we continue to
 
have discussions with the 
government vis
-
à
-
vis the force majeure on Cedrela. You may be aware that 
we're drilling the Teak 3 well with the Marianas and the partnership made a 
decision that that was 

 
at this point in time are far more impactful well for 
u
s to drill, given the timing of the Teak Appraisal Program. And so rather 
than drill Cedrela with the Marianas, we took the opportunity to drill Teak
-
3, 
and in the meantime we continue to have discussions with the government 
on that well.
 
Doug Leggate 

 
Ba
nk of America
 
Thanks, Brian. Would you mind if I just threw in a quick final one here. 
Given Cedrela seemingly it looks, I think, my recollection is it kind of 

understanding is Ha
shi is looking to farm some of that down now. Are you 
guys 

 
have any interest in taking off that? And I will leave it at that. Thank 
you.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, I (inaudible) not comment on that, Doug.

afraid. In terms of the 

eight wells on Jubilee, but would you now consider that to be a minimum? 
And should we add remedial costs and perhaps additional wells on top of 
that?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
This is Greg. For 2012 and beyond, I do ex
pect there will be cost related to 
remediation activities over and above what normally would be presumed for 

details yet. We are working closely with operator and partners and their 
t


 

and beyond. This is not just a one
-
year spend, it will be spread over more 
likely in not on
e or two years. And, in fact, if you really think about it, they 
J
-
7 Sidetrack is the first element of cost under that spending.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC Capital Markets
 
And sticking with costs for next year, should we assume the acquisition of 
the FPSO, well, whe
re do we stand with that now?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 

negotiations led by a total of the unit operator with MODEC. We have 

 


 
to get negotiating if you will on the phone in 
a public context. We need to work through the partnership. But I believe it 
will be resolved before year end 2011.
 
Al Stanton 

 
RBC Capital Markets
 
Okay. And then, finally, fr
om me, at the back of my envelope, I think you 
need 90,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter to get to cargos. Are you 
considering changing away from doing cargos and negotiating some other 
deal with your partners so that you can get a more regular cash 
flow?
 
Brian Maxted
 
We expect two cargos in the fourth quarter and I think regularity from week
-
to
-
week to month
-
to

We tend to think of years, not whether a given month has a revenue or not.

Hi. First question is just on related to J
ubilee again. The reduced cash flow 
and incremental CapEx that will be potential require to rectify the Jubilee 
problems. I was just wondering how that affects your funds and thinking 
about investments in new ventures?
 
Marvin Garrett
 

 
modeled a number of scenarios not knowing what 


several years. Do keep in mind that as 

 
and this may be something 
that 

development, those reserves become available to us under borrowing base 
facility. And as you may recall, we have $2 billion of commitments while the 
facility currently only 
has $1 billion of utilization.

Okay. And just a second question, just kind of put context...
 
Brian Maxted
 
Okay, let me just follow up on that. This is Brian here. Just to make it very, 
very clear. The company co
ntinues 

 
we expect the company to continue to 
be funded through 2013 on current projections. And most importantly, new 
ventures program will not be constrained in any way we believe though any 
reduced cash flows from Jubilee.
 
Anish Kapadia 

 
Tudor, Picker
ing, Holt

Okay. And just my second question was in looking at the issues with Jubilee, 
I was just wondering how much of an analogy you can draw from the K.K. 
Fields with Murphy in Malaysia since they have kind of similar problems over 
those. Is that 
something that you can 

 
kind of looking at as an analogy?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, I mean 

 



ng at all aspects of both the specific aspects of 

other operators around the world including offshore Malaysia which are some 
of us around here are very familiar with.

How
 
are you doing? Just two things. What would 
be your over
-
under if we 
would have tried to pin down when you think you could get the Jubilee field 
back up to the 20,000 barrel rates, one. And two, could you give us an 

continued benefit 

 
Brian Maxted
 
Let me ask Marvin to answer the first part of that question and Greg can 
take the NOL.
 
Marvin Garrett
 
Okay, just where we are, again, J
-
7 and the design change of the completion 
is very imp
ortant. We get an early solution with that well. We will continue 
to ramp up to the year and we could achieve a plateau production towards 

it remains to be seen exactly when tha
t will happen.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
On the NOL front, we do have a significant NOL in Ghana. We currently 
anticipate within a broad range depending on oil prices, production and other 
factors that that NOL would most likely be utilized over 2012 and into 2013.
 
Nat
han Churchill 

 
Societe Generale
 
Do you expect any additional benefit from that this year and how much is 
left on that NOL?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 

are booking taxes as deferred taxes in regards 


As such, we will not be making cash income tax payments and that NOL 
should extend into next year, again, subject to those qualifications about oil 
pr

point in time obviously.
 
Nathan Churchill 

 
Societe Generale
 

Jubilee, are you going to be able to run that throu
gh the PSEs? Can you 
expense that?
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
All spending in regard to the oil field, whether its capital, expense, operating 
expense, would be expense that is applicable to petroleum operations under 
petroleum agreement. It will be subject to the terms
 
of petroleum 
agreement and subject to the normal income tax regime in Ghana. So the 
second part of your question, it is tax deductible as well.

Good morning. I just had a quick question just wondering if you guys could 
identify the wells that you plan to drill in the 18 to 16 program next year and 

from earlier guidance.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, sure. Let me ask Paul to explain that to you.
 
Paul Dailly
 
The program for next year is divided between West Cape Three Points, 
Deepwater Tano for the most part in West Cape Three Points we expect to 
be drilling fur
ther appraisal wells on Teak. The exact number of them 
depends on the results of the Teak
-
3 well and then the subsequent Teak
-
4 
well with two or three additional wells after that depending on the earlier 
results.
 
Similarly in Deepwater Tano a large chunk o
f the drilling activity is 

successful year with Enyenra with the two wells that we have drilled thus 
far. And we probably have another two to three wells to drill there to 
evaluate the si
ze of the entire field. Beyond that in Deepwater Tano, Tullow 
is planning to drill a number of exploration wells, the exact number is yet to 
be agreed by the partnership but that will probably be two to three wells.
 
And then the other activity is going to 
be in Cameroon where we hope to 
spread our first operated well late in 2012.

Hey, everyone. Just thanks for the follow on. Just on our reserve sides, 

an assertive step
 



from say mainly in Enyenra and Teak, where would yo

potentially getting to?
 
Brian Maxted
 

-
deal road 


 
upside uncertainty around 
the size of these fields. Hence the extensive
 
appraisal program from now 
with Teak
-
3 through the end of next year. Teak is particularly significant in 
terms of its uncertainty. We drilled the original, structure originally and the 
step out is a major walk away to the north to test the potential strat
igraphic 

was originally considered to be in the 100 million to 200 million barrel range 

upsi
de in the event the Teak is successful.
 
Enyenra is still in appraisal as you know. We carry a significant range on that 
from 200 to 500 or even possibly more and with Teak
-
3 now drilled and 
Enyenra
-
4 planned and possibly Enyenra
-
5 into next year, ahead of 
the plan 
of development being submitted late in the first half of next year, we expect 
more clarity on how big that flied is, and is it 200 or is it 500.
 
And Akasa has gone upside as well and we would hope to delineate that as 
well in the coming 15 and 18 

of upside around these discoveries and that the challenge here is to 
minimize the uncertainly range and figure out what the optimal development 
plan is, particularly for the discoveries in West Cape Three Poi

up question
. This will help ensure we 

to within our 45 minutes timeframe, please contact me later today.
 
Before we get started, I'd like to mention that this conference call includes 
cer
tain forward

looking statements based on our current expectations. The 
risks associated with forward
-
looking statements have been outlined in the 
earnings release and in our SEC filings.
 
We may also refer to certain non

GAAP financial measures in our discu
ssion. 
Management believes such measures are important in looking at the 
company's historical and future performance, and these are commonly 
referred to industry metrics.
 
These measures are provided in addition to, and should be read in 
conjunction with, t
he information contained in our financial statements 
prepared in accordance with GAAP and included in our SEC filings.
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Darrell.
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Performance at Jubi
lee remained 
strong throughout the fourth quarter and the field continued to exhibit 
exceptional reservoir characteristics, high FPSO uptime and an excellent 
safety and environmental record.
 
The Jubilee field has been producing at an average sales volume r
ate of 
around 104,000 barrels oil per day since the New Year and averaged nearly 
100,000 barrel oil per day during 2013. To
-
date, the Jubilee field partners 
have recovered around 90 million barrels of oil gross from the field.
 
We have drilled and completed
 
five Phase 1A wells in Jubilee, three 
producers and two water injection wells and in aggregate 
--
 
and all five wells 
are currently online. Our first horizontal producer remains the most prolific 
well drilled in the field to
-
date and we are very encouraged
 
with all the 
Phase 1A producing wells and have not seen any production degradation 
from scale effects on any of these wells.
 
This year we are planning to drill up to three development wells associated 
with the Phase 1A program in Jubilee. These wells were
 
deferred into 2014 
as a result of superior well performance and excess well deliverability, and 
will be timed based on FPSO capacity improvements.
 
Phase 1 wells also continued to perform well and no assets stimulation 
programs were conducted in the fourth
 
quarter and none are currently 
scheduled in 2014. The water injection well workover is planned for later in 
the year.
 
With our field partners we are continuing to focus considerable resources on 
de
-
bottlenecking the Jubilee FPSO, as well deliverability ex
ceeds current 
production constraints.
 
Late last year considerable effort went into analyzing all the major 
components of the system, including gas injection, water injection and fluid 
processing facilities. One of the gas compression trains was re
-
wheeled 
late 
last year as part of our gas handling initiative and our third gas injection well 
was completed in an effort to further mitigate gas handling constraints on 
the FPSO.
 
This third gas injection well had minimal impact on gas handling due to what 
appears
 
to be limited connectivity with the main body of the field and a 
subsequent mechanical problem with the well.
 
The Jubilee partners are actively pursuing various gas solutions in concert 
with the Government of Ghana to address gas handling until the 
govern

we are advised by the government is currently scheduled for late in this 
year.
 
This approval of the TEN plan of development last year, the focus has been 
on awarding of major contracts fo
r the FPSO and the subsea infrastructure. 
All major contract awards have been completed. A version of the FPSO is 
currently underway in Singapore and development drilling in TEN began late 
in the fourth quarter.
 
The TEN development will combine production 
from Tweneboa, Enyenra and 
Ntomme fields. The development is projected to require the drilling and 
completion of up to 24 wells, of which a number have been drilled during the 
exploration and appraisal phase with Enyenra delivering first oil in 2016, 
stagi
ng up to the facility's design production rate of 80,000 barrel oil per 
day.
 
In the Greater Jubilee area, we are continuing to mature our appraisal and 
delineation plants for the Mahogany, Teak and Akasa areas, which we 
believe will ultimately be tied back
 
to the Jubilee FPSO.
 
In January of this year, we signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
Ministry of Energy and the Ghanian National Petroleum Corporation, which 
aligned and approved the appraisal programs for these three discovery 
areas.
 
Additional
ly, in upcoming Phase 1A Jubilee well we are planning to further 
appraise the underlying reservoirs associated with the Mahogany discovery. 
Our objective is to conclude our West Cape Three Points appraisal by year 
end.
 
In Morocco, we are in the advanced st
ages in our operational readiness for 
the upcoming exploration drilling activities. We recently finalized the rig 
contract for a single well slot on the Maersk Discoverer, which BP has on 
long
-
term contract. The Discoverer is a highly capable six
-
generatio
n semi
-
submersible drilling rig which has been actively working in the Mediterranean 
region.
 
The rig is currently on contract to Kosmos and is in transit to commence 
operations on our initial exploration well offshore Morocco. Based on the 
current schedule
, we expect to spud the FA
-
1 well in the Foum Assaka 
License in March. Drilling operations are expected to take around three 
months to complete.
 
In combination with our long
-
term rig contract with Atwood Oceanics for the 
Achiever drillship, which we 
anticipate to arrive late in the year, we expect 
to have the rig capacity in place to execute our high
-
impact exploration 
drilling campaign over the course of the next several years.
 
Our supply and demand assets are truly world
-
class, and form the 
foundati
on from which we expect to grow our business to ongoing 
development and appraisal programs. Jubilee produced a record volume of 
oil in 2013. Today more than ever, I remain confident of the upside potential 
our Ghanaian assets hold and that the potential wi
ll be fully realized.
 
Now, I will hand the call over to Greg.
 
Greg Dunlevy
 
Thank you, Darrell. I would like to highlight the financial position we ended 
the year with, largely a result of improved performance and production 
increases at Jubilee. Total corp
orate liquidity was $1.2 billion at year end, 

strongest financial position since becoming a public company.
 
Overall, financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 were 
l

quarter was $250 million and we recognized the net income of $4 million or 
a penny per share. We finished the year with eight crude oil liftings, two of 
which occurred in the four
th quarter as expected. At the end of the year, we 
were in an under
-
lifted position, having lifted the sale of approximately 
312,000 barrels less than our entitlement.
 
On the cost side, production expense was $17 million or just under $9 per 
barrel sold, w
ith no work over operations conducted during the quarter. 
Exploration expense of $36 million for the quarter was largely related to 
completion of our large 3
-
D seismic programs offshore Ireland and 
Mauritania.
 

red on the Akasa well which 
expensed as required. G&A, tax and interest expense amounts were 
consistent with our previous expectations and guidance. Fourth quarter 
DD&A per barrel was favorably impacted by the addition of proved reserves 
at year
-
end, resul
ting from positive Phase 1A development and field 
performance at Jubilee.
 
At this time, I would like to transition to our expectations for 2014. As 
announced earlier this month, our expected investment programs totaled 
$575 million with around 70% of this 
targeted for development activity in 
Ghana and the remaining percentage allocated to our exploration programs.
 
Consistent with previous production guidance, we anticipate selling a total of 
eight cargoes of crude oil from Jubilee, net to Kosmos during 2014
. With 
Jubilee, the average cargo size is 950,000 barrels, with a range of plus or 

970,000 barrels.
 
In the first quarter of this year, we anticipate two liftings of which the first
 
has already been completed at 943,000 barrels. On the cost side, we 
anticipate total production expense in the range of $11 to $12 per barrels. 
G&A cost for the year are expected to be relatively in line with full year 2013 
and DD&A should average around 
$25 per barrel.
 
Exploration investments, based on our current CapEx guidance are expected 
to be approximately $175 million for the year and maybe used as a proxy for 
exploration expense. Majority of the costs associated with drilling operations 
and seismic
 
acquisition, also included a spending
-
related seismic processing 
and interpretation activities across our portfolio as well as potential new 
exploration opportunities.
 
Our 10
-
K filed later today will detail our current hedging positions, which 
totaled 11.
2 million barrels with approximately 6 million barrels in 2014, and 
the balance associated with 2015 hedging. We expect to add further to our 
2015 positions and to commence initial 2016 hedging in the near future.
 
Bearing in mind, the challenge of giving g
uidance on taxes, we project total 
tax expense to be approximately $20 million to $22 million crude lifting, 
consisting with the 2013 average, assuming Brent remains above $100 per 
barrel. Maintaining adequate financial liquidity is critical to our busines
s 
strategy, as it provides the capacity to internally fund our development and 
growth programs in Ghana, as well as our high
-
impact exploration programs 
to the point of success.
 
At the same time an improved balance sheet provides flexibility to capture 
att
ractive new exploration opportunities as they arise. With Jubilee 
continuing to generate considerable cash flow at our existing liquidity base, 
we remain well
-
positioned to execute on our strategy as a self
-
funded 
exploration company.
 
I will now turn the c
all over to Brian.
 
Brian Maxted
 
Thanks, Greg. Looking back, 2013 was a significant year for our company in 
many ways. In Ghana, we achieved record annual production from Jubilee. 
We received governmental approval for the TEN Plan of Developments. We 
contin
ued to advance the appraisal of the MTA discoveries. Throughout the 
year, we significantly matured and derisk these assets, grew both production 
and reserves and realized record cash flows.
 
Over the next several years, our expected operating cash flows fro
m Ghana 
based on a conservative [H5 daily provider rental] [ph] price, combined with 
our existing liquidity should enable us not only to internally finance all of 
that development capital needs and production expenses in Ghana, but also 
fund the world
-
clas
s exploration drilling program, which will target 
multibillion barrel transformational opportunities beginning next month.
 
The self
-
funded explorer status differentiates us from many peers within our 
industry. Today, Kosmos remains very much an attractive 
asymmetric risk
-
reward opportunity. The recognized value of our Ghana asset essentially 

 
Conversely, our exploration portfolio which includes large fully
-
operated 
acreage positions
 
and a range of under explored frontier emerging 
basements is effectively free and offers investors a substantial near
-
term 
value growth opportunity. This too differentiates us from many of our 
industry peers.
 

mature our exploration 
portfolio to further define and derisk substantial hydrocarbon potential. 
Moreover, we are now on a coast of commencing a multi
-
well, multi
-
year 
drilling program to test this portfolio.
 
In the Agadir Basin, offshore Morocco following
 
the successful farm
-
out to BP 
late last year about three consecutive licenses which totaled nearly 25,000 
square kilometers and where we now have an average working interest of 
about 30%, we expect to spud the FA
-
1 well on the Eagle prospect in Foum 
Assak
a license next month with the Maersk Discoverer rig which is now 
contracted to Kosmos.
 
This will test the [salt diet] for play, one of 300 common concepts 
recognized in the salt basin, which is a multibillion dollar potential. New 3D 
seismic will be acquir
ed late this year to better define the subsalt target and 
plays in the Essaouira and Tarhazoute respectively. Drilling these two 
licenses is expected to start as early as next year.
 
Catching within our 27,000 square kilometer Cap Boujdour license offshore 
Western Sahara where following the successful farm
-
out to Cairn Energy in 
2013, we now have a 55% participating interest with Aaiun Basin. This is an 
undrilled cretaceous delta similar in size than present day Niger Fan. It 
represents potentially giant hyd
rocarbons problems with very significant 
aspiration prospectivity supported by performing indicators of a working 
performance system of direct and indirect. A new 3D seismic survey will be 
acquired later this year to define the hanging wall anticline and f
ootwall fault 
block concept. We are currently planning to spud a well to test the giant 
Ghana prospect on the hanging wall anticline play fairway in the fourth 
quarter of this year. Elsewhere in our portfolio the launch 2D and 3D seismic 
surveys we acquire
d in 2012 and 2013 are now at various stages of 
processing and interpretation.
 
Offshore Mauritania where we have a 90% working interest in three blocks, 
C8, 12 and 13 totaling 30,000 square kilometers, we are currently 
interpreting our new fast
-
track 2D an
d 3D seismic ahead of receiving the 
final versions during the second quarter of this year. Early results are very 
encouraging with both structural and combined structural stratigraphic 
cretaceous plays identified. Following completion of our evaluation, we
 
expect to seek a partner later this year ahead of drilling in 2015.
 
Tullow recently announced the results of the Fregate in northeastern of 
acreage and we are excited by the technical lead through. Importantly, there 
appears a lot of concern with the pres
ence of the working petroleum system 
within the cretaceous, including the potential for both oil and gas 
condensate.
 
Importantly, also, we believe our acreage position catches the down
-
dip and 
both fairway of the system. We also believe this distal slope b
ased on our 
position is optimal for both an oil charge and thick reservoirs, which is the 
factors determine their [neutrality].
 
In Suriname where we have a 50% working interest in two blocks 42 and 45 
totaling about 11,000 square kilometers one with our 

now receive the final processed 3D seismic products and are identifying and 
defining leaks in prospects ahead of formulation and forward exploration 
strategy in mid 2014.
 
Similarly, in the Porcupine offshore Ireland where we have thr
ee blocks 
totaling approximately 2,600 square kilometers, participating interest 75%, 
25%, we are currently interpreting the fast
-
track for 3D seismic acquired in 
2013, while we wait the final process working which were expected to begin.
 
Again early techn
ical works are encouraging and recently prospects are 
presently being identifying and defined. Following completion of our 
evaluation we expect to commence the farm
-
out effort to secure additional 
partners towards the end of the year ahead of possible dril
ling reserve lease 
in 2015.
 
While as an industry some are beginning to question the value of the 
deepwater exploration, given the strong progress we are making in 
developing that exploration portfolio, I am more confident than ever that 

-
funded
 
explore business model is valid and intact for two 
reasons. Firstly, our strategic acreage positions which have been enabled by 
organically grown contrarian ideas and which benefited from first move 
advantage, I totally fully manage the technical risks in
herent in frontier and 
emerging basin exploration, while at the same time offering substantial 
hydrocarbon potential included in attractive commercial terms.
 
So to make sure there is substantial value growth opportunities present for 
us in the event of suc
cess. And secondly our successful farm
-
out efforts 
enable us to minimize net size of drilling cost and therefore leverage returns. 
Giving this we believe Kosmos is positioned to differentiate itself and 
hopefully our performance base to deliver top quartil
e exploration results 
going forward.
 

exploration efforts going forward as Chief Exploration Officer following the 
recent appointment of Andy Inglis is Chairman and CEO. I am personally 
delig
hted Andy has chosen to join us or lead the company in future. We have 

testament to the company and institution that we have.
 
Andy both strengthens management team today as well a
s provides for 
longer
-
term succession. Now Andy is very much looking forward to its new 
position and I can assure he would like to get started at the beginning of 
next month. Andy knows he has my full and complete support and I look 
forward to us having mu
ch success together going forward. I am proud to 
what I was able to accomplish as CEO since our IPO. Andy appointment 
enables me to singularly focus on my true passion and do what I do best, 
exploration. As I told the Board last year at start of the search
 
given we 

that I can provide the most value to the company and to shareholders going 
forward.
 
So today from an operating and financial and organizational standpoint, I 
believe Ko
smos is perfectly and unique positioned to deliver substantial 
value and growth to its shareholders starting as early as the next few 
months given our high impact exploration drilling program is about to get 
underway in Morocco. Thank you.
 
Now, operator, w
e would like to open up the call for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Ed Westlake 
from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Yes, good mo
rning, Brian, everyone and congratulations again on getting 
Andrew on board for the future. A quick question around gas handling and 
debottlenecking of the FPSO, obviously [104] [ph] maybe is good, we know 
what the issues are, but maybe just provide any up
date in terms of when 
you think you will be able to get increased gas handling and therefore higher 
capacity on the FPSO?
 
Brian Maxted
 

onto Darrell. Darrell, do you want to take that
?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yeah. Thanks Brian. Yeah, I just want to, just clarify that all the gas 
handling number of options are being looked at and that pass through 

the preferred option 
front to back; several other short term and long
-
term 
options are being looked at, re
-
wheeling the compression, bypass and 
possible flare options as well, are all being looked at.
 

p
rogress being made on all these options and that the agencies, government 
of Ghana agencies are working together with Tullow as unit operator and all 
the partners on Jubilee 
-
 
all these options along and secure a final solution 
for the gas handling for Jub
ilee.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
And maybe just remind us, when you reckon that the onshore or that the 
sort of gas processing option will be complete?
 
Darrell McKenna
 

agencies, GN
GC, and right now they are saying latter half of 2014.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Okay. And then my second question just around the 
--
 
obviously behind that 
as you mentioned sort of confirmation in Mauritania, but maybe talk more 
broadly about whether the
re can be any acceleration of the drilling plan in 
terms of drill
-
ready prospects that you outlined obviously at the, sort of, 
Exploration Day late last year?
 
Brian Maxted
 

making su



[inaudible] in particular and given 
the cost of exploration in deep water 

success and therefore exploration efficiency, we get it right more often than 

ex

technical corners on the other.
 


hope
fully, some follow
-
on wells in both of those areas, plus Mauritania and 
one on both Suriname and Ireland as well, possibly depending on timing of 
the technical schedule in Ireland, the weather window as well has also been 
a challenge for us.
 



sure we actually create value when we put the drill bit in the ground. So we 

ears developing this portfolio, we got a 
great place and may just need the tender love and care now to get it across 
the line to the drilling stage.
 
Ed Westlake 
-
 
Credit Suisse
 
Makes a lot of sense. Thanks very much Brian.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next ques
tion is coming from Anish Kapadia from TPH. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH
 
Hi. I got a question, kind of, going back to of course overall strategy. You 
mentioned operating costs are going up currently the first well in Morocco is 
go

industry come down over the last couple of years in deepwater? And also 
NAVs or NPVs per barrel could be coming down, getting some delays in 
contract terms. Just wondering when you pull
 
all that together, how do you 
see the overall market, the opportunity throughout relative to maybe a 
couple of years ago?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah, Anish. This is Brian. Let me take that one. Obviously, we are conscious 
of the piece, the [inaudible] piece that y
ou guys did a couple of weeks ago 
and obviously we have continued ongoing internal [compositions] [ph] 
around the self
-
funded explorer model, which as I mentioned in the call, the 
call script is very much that we feel is completely valid right now.
 
And the
re are a number of drivers to value through exploration. And we 
think our strategy is, pinpointed correctly to address constructively each of 
those drivers. I mean, I think in frontier and emerging basins, which is our 
playing field and where much of the f
ailure that you refer to in the industry 

to be in the basin from a play and source 
--
 
from a play 
--
 
source rock and 
reservoir standpoint, the only way you can manage that is to buy l
arge 
tracts of acreage, not by acquiring small individual licenses and [licenses 
rental] [ph], et cetera.
 
So our strategy to create [contrarian ideas] [ph] and get in first in the basin 
get large acreage tract is crucial to success our exploration of front
ier 

Transform margin we had 
--
 
we looked at everything between Mauritania 
and Togo and we chose Ghana. So we basically had a frontier exploration 

nt that play. And we feel in Morocco 
and Sahara and to a lesser extent in Suriname but also in Ireland as well 

 

able to manag
e 
-
 
one of the key drivers of exploration success which 
obviously cross that risk. We managed returns in a number of ways. One is 
to get great commercial terms but again you only if you get in there first 
before success and most of our acreage has got very
 
competitive contractual 

 
And then I think the other key in terms of minimizing, reducing cost is being 
able to successfully farm out as we showed in Mauritania and minimize the 
expense that you actually 
put in the ground on the drilling stage.
 
And again, we did that in Morocco, hopefully we can, hopefully, we can 
continue to do it in other places like Mauritania and 

already done it in 
Suriname but also in Ireland. And so I think the combination of those 
factors 
will ensure that we give ourselves the very best chance of not just having 
exploration success but creating substantial value through it.
 

quality exploration opportunities a
t frontier and emerging basins are few and 

the statutory around doing our homework for a significant amount of time to 
make sure we are in the right places. Oil is not easy to find an

everywhere and the industry is kind of finding that out.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH
 
And just a kind of follow
-
up on that more specifically and kind of look at your 
acreage just like Suriname [inaudible] areas with most expensive wells, just 
the [fiscal
] [ph] terms when it come up for (inaudible) looks like the worst 
out your portfolio? Does that kind of change its ranking again how you saw it 
versus when your originally got in (inaudible)?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah. Look, I mean, exploration is a portfolio game
, right, and you explore, 
you deliver successful portfolio exploration and Suriname is one piece. And 
you are absolutely right, I mean, in terms of the contractual terms, its one 

ha
ve world
-
class commercial terms.
 


we are trying to find high
-
value valves lot often and certainly, Surin
am is 
currently stand at the interpretation stages, they are very strategic to us.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH
 
Okay. Thank you. And just one final one, on 
--
 
just with the recent capital 
well, any real change to the contingent reserves numbers I think coming in 
th
e range [10] million barrels, the NTA field, any of those changes to those 
or kind of any effect from that?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah. Darrell, do you want take that on the reserve numbers on the NTA 
Discoverer?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yeah. I guess, the short answer to t
hat is, no, there are no changes right 
now in terms of the reserve. The appraisal program is still ongoing. We have 
talked about deepening of Jubilee well to evaluate Mahogany, underlying 
piece of Jubilee, the cost of well thus 
--
 
the cost of two well was 
and 
achieved its objectives in terms of finding the water leg or water oil contact, 
we have kept that well as a water injection well and we have got some 
ongoing work with respect to the Teak seismic and that appraisal program 
we believe completed by year 
end as we mentioned in the script.
 
Anish Kapadia 
-
 
TPH
 
Thank you.
 
Brian Maxted
 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Pavel Molchanov from 
Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Pavel Molchanov 
-
 
Raymond James
 
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. At the technical update last year, you 
mentioned for SA1 the pre
-
drill estimate of 360 million barrels? Has anything 
changed in your mind since then?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Hi, Pavel. This is Brian. Not at all, I m


test on the [salt diet] play number of track times. On that [salt diet] per play 
is testing the flat to the [salt diet], it is also based 
on the on pay us four way 
closures as well but there after testing that four well.
 
So the good first test of the overall controlling system, so just to prospect 
that just a first well and really the first modern example in that basin based 
on post Gulf of 
Mexico ideas and its going to be an important well for us in 
terms of, specifically in terms of trying to demonstrate reservoir and charge 
looking in the system but no change in the prospect.
 
Pavel Molchanov 
-
 
Raymond James
 
Okay. You may have touched on th
is in your comment? But given that 
Jubilee has been running at 104,000 a day year
-
to
-
day, whereas the 
operator had said 100 for the year as a whole? Is it 
--
 
are you getting the 
sense that guidance was perhaps overly cautious?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Yeah. And Darrel
l, do you want to take that one?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yeah. I actually think that the difference is sales versus gross volumes, there 
is a 3.5% shrinkage value that needs to be implied with the gross number 
and our 104 is the sales numbers, all our numbers are 
all the sales.
 
I think some of that maybe played in there. I will say on both the sales and 
the gross basis, we have been on track with in excess of 110 gross in recent 
days and weeks. So I think that may explain kind of the difference in the 
numbers.
 
Pave
l Molchanov

Raymond James
 

closer towards 2016? Is there any more precise timetable for startup, 
second half, first half, that sort of thing?
 
Brian Maxted
 
Go ahead, Darrell.
 
Darr
ell McKenna
 
Yeah. No. No updates on that. We are still looking of 2016 startup, still a lot 
of things to do. I mean the good news is all the contracts have been 
awarded and the project team is just getting its pace right now. So we will 
updates on that as 
we go along.
 
Pavel Molchanov 
-
 
Raymond James
 
All right. Appreciate it guys.
 
Brian Maxted
 
You welcome.
 
Operator
 
Thanks. Our next question is from Al Stanton from RBC Capital Markets. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Al Stanton 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets
 
Yes. Good morning. Couple of question, just sticking with the Jubilee and 
Mahogany area. Is Mahogany more gassy or less gassy than Jubilee, is there 

 
Brian Maxted
 

 
to answer that.
 
Darrell McKenna
 

composition and crude. One thing that we do is in Kosmos that is really 
stable on money and extended testing is the use of downhaul gauges for we 
actually confirm communication across reservoir on a dynamic basis after 
the rig is left.
 

that technology to all the fields along with our partners in both licensees. So 
right now
 

go and as to be very useful in terms of our thinking on a development 
farming basis.
 
Al Stanton 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets
 
To some extent, I was thinking of the context of given the gas constr
aint 
from the Jubilee excellency whether there was any method of fast tracking 
the appraisal of Mahogany or having slow it down on a given the gas 
handling issue?
 
Darrell McKenna
 
Yeah. And that adds 
--
 
again, we need to finish our appraisal program on 
that
 
before we could really look at any options on accelerating. And then it 
will be a function of subsea infrastructure timing and contracts and all that. 

Three Points from a gas standpoin
t.
 
Brian Maxted

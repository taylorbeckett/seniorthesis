7/30/20,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by saying 
how pleased I am with our performance this year as we delivered record 
earnings per share and record MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, our 
outlook reflect strong revenue and 
earnings growth in fiscal 2011. In the 
coming year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA
-
based device 
shipments including smartphones and other data
-
centric devices driven by 
the global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand for wireless 
dat
a.
 
There's been a number of highlights this year. First, QCT continued to 
execute. Our Snapdragon platforms set the competitive benchmark for 
smartphone silicon, and we've taken a leadership position in offering our 
chipsets for key operating systems such 
as Android and Windows Phone 7. 
We offer the industry's broadest 3G product roadmap, and we continued to 
grow share in WCDMA chipsets.
 
Our Licensing business continues to be well positioned in 3G and multimode 
3G LTE and now has over 185 licensees. Of note
, we added another 14 new 
Chinese licensees in fiscal 2010, bringing the total number of Chinese 
licensees to 65. Our licensing program continues to foster innovation and 
supports the 3G ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
 
In terms of our
 
Display business, we believe mirasol is a disruptive 
technology for the mobile display industry. The combined benefits of 
extremely low power consumption with sunlight viewability and support for 
color, video and touch sets us apart from the competition. 
We've made 
strong progress in the development of this display technology as we brought 
our first batch online and are targeting limited volume commercial 5.7
-
inch 
display devices in the first half of 2011. We're very excited about that 
prospects for this t
echnology, and we'll be providing more details at our 
upcoming Analyst Day.
 
In FLO TV, we have decided to change directions, stepping back from the 
direct to consumer business and commencing a restructuring plan, under 
which we expect to exit the current F
LO TV Service business. We're in 
discussions with a variety of interested parties and are continuing to 
evaluate other options for this business. Possibilities range from a new 
wholesale model, sale or joint venture with the third
-
party and/or sale of the 
spectrum licenses and discontinuance of the operation of the network.
 
Overall, we had strong earnings and cash flow performance in fiscal 2010. 
We returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in the form of a $3 billion 
buyback and over $1 billion in cash
 
dividend. We ended the year well 
positioned with a strong balance sheet, including $18.4 billion in cash and 
marketable securities.
 
Turning to calendar 2011. We expect CDMA and multimode 3G 4G
-
based 
device shipments to grow to approximately 765 million un
its, up 20% year
-
over
-
year based on the midpoint of our projections. This growth will be 
driven by the global adoption of 3G, the continued demand for wireless data, 
strength in consumer demand for smartphones, growth in new connected 
device categories as 
well as 3G momentum in emerging regions.
 
Operators around the world continue to benefit from the growth in wireless 
data. Japan is approaching a tipping point where data ARPU will exceed that 
of voice. In the United States, AT&T recently reported a 30% yea
r
-
over
-
year 
growth in data revenues, and Verizon Wireless stated that data comprised 
over 35% of its revenues this quarter.
 
We expect this trend of data growth to continue as operators increasingly 
experiment with variable pricing plans that provide more c
hoice and lower 
total cost of ownership alternatives to consumers. To meet the network 
needs, resulting from this rapid growth in wireless data use, operators 
continue to make investments in the latest air interface technologies. TDDI 
recently announced it
s fourth quarter device lineup, and seven of the new 
devices included support for multi
-
carrier EV
-
DO also known as EV
-
DO Rev. 
B.
 
According to the GSA, to date, there are a total of 81 operators who have 
launched HSPA+ Networks, of which nine support dual 
carrier HSPA+ with 
data rates of 42 megabits per second. The rate of HSPA+ Network launches 
is faster today than when HSUPA was first introduced. We're also seeing 
strong momentum behind LTE led by Verizon's expected launch this quarter. 
Our multimode capa
bilities are essential for device on these networks, and 
we're very well positioned to capitalize on these dynamics by leveraging our 
time
-
to
-
market advantages and industry
-
leading modem solutions.
 
Smartphones remain the strongest area of growth within the
 
Wireless 
segment, driven by continued innovation and competition. According to 
analysts, the global smartphone shipments exceeded 80 million units this 
quarter, representing a 30% increase quarter
-
over
-
quarter and a 95% 
increase from the year prior.
 
Looki
ng forward, according to Gartner, smartphones as a percentage of the 
total handset market is expected to grow from approximately 16% in 2009 
to greater than 45% in 2014. These numbers would be even greater if they 
had included blue mobile platform based ph
ones in their numbers.
 
And our emergence of new connected device category is also a favorable 
trend for our business. As volumes in new categories like 3G connected e
-
readers and tablets continue to grow, they represent incremental growth 
opportunities for
 
our businesses, driving adoption of multiple 3G devices for 
consumer.
 
The growth of 3G and emerging regions is another catalyst for our business. 
China represents a significant opportunity with a low CDMA penetration rate 
of 13%. With 3G networks now matu
ring, operators have turned to 
increasing the number of devices available on their networks. For example, 
China Telecom reported more than 100 EV
-
DO handset models in supply by 
the first half of 2010. In China, Unicom had over 90 3G models available as 
of 
June.
 
In India, 3G licenses had been issued, and the majority of newly licensed 
operators plan to launch 3G services before the end of calendar year 2010. 
Tata DOCOMO became the first private Indian operator to launch 3G. 3G 
services will be available acro
ss all nine of their circles this week.
 
On the legal front, as we noted in our 10
-
K, in September, the company was 
notified by the SEC of a formal investigation that arose from a 
whistleblower's allegations made in December 2009 to the audit committee 
of t
he Board of Directors and to the SEC. The audit committee has 
conducted a review into the allegations and related accounting practice with 
the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic 
accountants. This recently concluded review did not id
entify any errors in the 
company's financial statements. The company continued to cooperate with 
the SEC's ongoing investigation and look forward to resolving this matter.
 
And separately, I'm pleased to report that the arbitrator in the Panasonic 
arbitrati
on issued an interim order in the first day of the process denying 
Panasonic's claims that we've breached our license agreement with them. 
We're pleased with this initial finding as it supports our belief that 
Panasonic's claims are without merit.
 
So to wr
ap up, we've completed another record year at Qualcomm, and I'd 
like to thank all of our employees and partners for their tremendous efforts. 
With our broad licensing program and industry
-
leading chipset roadmap, 
we're extremely well positioned to take adv
antage of key 3G growth 
opportunities in both developed and emerging regions around the world.
 
In looking forward, I am pleased with our outlook for improved revenue and 
earnings growth in fiscal 2011 and strong growth in CDMA
-
based device 
shipments, drive
n by the global migration in the 3G and the increasing 
consumer appetite for data
-
centric devices, particularly smartphones.
 
That concludes my comments, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve 
Mollenkopf.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Paul, and good 
afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered 
strong results this year in a dynamic environment, reflecting growing 
demand across our product portfolio. We had another record quarter, 
shipping 111 billion MSMs, which was a great follow
-
on to our record r
esults 
in the June quarter.
 
We also had a record year shipping just under 400 million MSMs. We are 
extremely pleased to deliver stronger
-
than
-
expected revenues and operating 
profit for the quarter and for the fiscal year with operating margins 
exceeding th
e top end of our guidance. As we anticipated in July, demand 
for smartphones continued to grow in the September quarter. This is clearly 
a favorable trend for our business. Shipments of integrated 7,000 and 
8,000
-
series chipsets increased more than 30% qua
rter
-
over
-
quarter and 
nearly 100% year
-
over
-
year. We also saw continued strong demand for our 
QSC and data
-
centric products. Our broad, industry
-
leading chipset roadmap 
help us grow share in both WCDMA handsets and in mobile application 
processors this yea
r.
 
As forecasted a year ago, we experienced a greater
-
than
-
normal decline in 
our average revenue per MSM during fiscal year 2010. In the first half, this 
was driven by competitive pricing pressure and an increase in sales of chips 
for entry level and lower
-
tier feature phones. In the second half, we saw 
even stronger
-
than
-
anticipated demand for our higher
-
tier integrated 
chipsets, evidenced by the fact that we shipped 4x the number of 
Snapdragon chipsets in the second half of fiscal 2010 than we did in the 
first 
half.
 
This favorable mix trend is likely to continue into fiscal Q1, resulting in a 
sequential increase in average revenue per MSM. Growth in demand for 
smartphone chipsets continues to be an important driver for our business, 
and we expect to see an
 
increase in the variety and tiering of smartphones 
in the future. We continue to see upside in the high
-
end of the market as 
well as the new wave of opportunity coming in the form of lower cost, high 
volume 3G phones in both developed and developing geogr
aphies. The cost 
advantages of our integrated approach and platform compatibility among 
our products positions us to grow as these trends play out in the market 
place.
 
We have a significant and growing number of design wins based on our 
integrated solution
s, encompassing multiple
-
priced tiers and form factors. 
On the high end, devices based on the newest members of our Snapdragon 
family, the 8X55 and 7X30 chipsets are expected to be available this holiday 
season and devices based on our dual core products a
re expected to be 
available in the first half of calendar 2011.
 
New, lower
-
cost smartphones based on our integrated 7X27 and 7X25 
chipsets are also growing, including offerings from LG, Motorola, Sony 
Ericsson and Huawei. In China alone, we have seen a nea
rly 30% growth in 
our customer base, with over 40 new designs in this tier. The majority of 
these are based on the Android operating system.
 
Our investments to support multiple operating systems positions as well to 
gain share from smartphone growth. We no
w have seven different 
integrated chipsets that support the Android operating system. We are also 
Microsoft's lead chipset partner for the Windows Phone 7 launch. Our 
Snapdragon chipset powers all nine of the new Windows Phone 7 handsets, 
which are expecte
d to be in stores in Europe, the U.S. and Southeast Asia 
this holiday season.
 
On the modem side, our innovation, products quality and ability to execute 
continue to set us apart. In emerging markets like India and China, our 
single chip QSC product 
family positions us to benefit from the 2G to 3G 
transition. A number of customers including Lenovo, Yu Long and Long Xer 
[ph] have already launched devices based on our 6240 and 6270 chipsets, 
and we have more than 25 designs in progress at multiple custo
mers in 
China.
 
In mature markets, the 3G to 4G transition has started, driven by the 
increasing demand of smartphones and tablet. Our MDM9600 chipset is the 
first and only multimode LTE solution designed to help our customers 
seamlessly bridge this complex
 
technology transition. We have sampled this 
product and expect to see the first commercial products based off of it this 
quarter.
 
We are very pleased that we finished the 2010 fiscal year at such a strong 
note and above targets, driven by an increase in d
emand for smartphone 
chipsets. We expect this trend to continue into the first quarter along with 
initial demand for LTE chipsets. In the second half, we expect the change in 
mix as the demand shifts to more mass
-
market smartphone products and 
emerging mar
ket chipsets driven by the transition from 2G to 3G. We will 
continue to price in order to gain share in this environment as we did in 
fiscal 2010. You will also see a major product transition in our portfolio as we 
sample our first 28
-
nanometer parts and 
increase the focus on cost
-
optimized smartphone solutions.
 
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed well in fiscal 2010 and 
continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in the 
industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive
 
position to continue to 
grow share and to lead the transition to smartphones and the growth of 
mobility in the market. That concludes my remarks. And I now turn the call 
over to Bill Keitel.
 
William Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. W
e have good results to 
report to you today. Our fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $2.95 billion, up 
10% year
-
over
-
year, and non
-
GAAP earnings per share was $0.68, up 42% 
year
-
over
-
year, both exceeding our prior guidance.
 
QCT had record MSM shipments and 
favorable product mix including HSUPA 
and EV
-
DO integrated chipsets. QCT's operating margin increased to 28%, 
reflecting strong volume and increased mix of higher
-
tiered chipsets.
 
QTL revenues were $921 million, and total report device sales by our 
license
es were approximately $28 billion for activity in the June quarter, 
towards the high end of our prior guidance and up 12% sequentially, 
reflecting strength in Europe and North America.
 
We estimate that approximately 153 to 157 million subscriber units were
 
shipped by our licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price of 
approximately $179 to $185.
 
As Paul mentioned, we are excited to see the introduction and growing sales 
of the increasing number of new 3G
-
enabled products including tablets. It 
w
ill drive incremental growth for QTL and QCT. As we have explained in the 
past, our Licensee business for sometime has had a voluntary royalty 
capping program for certain kinds of the devices, including 3G
-
enabled 
laptop computers.
 
In order to help drive t
he broadest possible adoption of 3G connectivity in 
these new incremental product categories, we have decided for now to 
extend our voluntary royalty capping program to cover some additional 
types of connected devices such as tablets that meet certain requ
irements. 
Depending on selling prices of these devices, the royalty caps may results in 
a royalty payable on something less than the full ceiling price of the device.
 
QTL's implied royalty rate decreased slightly quarter
-
over
-
quarter, and it's 
one of the k
ey drivers in the growth of these new connected device sales, 
notably tablets.
 
Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion, and our cash and marketable securities 
balance was $18.4 billion at the end of the quarter, with $6.3 billion onshore 
and $12.1 billion off
shore. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate was approximately 19% in 
the fiscal fourth quarter.
 
Non
-
GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were up $0.11 over the 
third quarter. QCT contributed $0.07 on higher MSM shipments and a 
favorable product mix, while QTL w
as better by $0.04, driven by higher 
shipments of CDMA
-
based devices. The improvements in investment income 
and our tax rate offset the sequential growth in operating expenses, 
including two non
-
recurring operating expense items.
 
Turning to our results for
 
fiscal 2010, revenues were approximately $11 
billion, up 6% year
-
over
-
year and in line with the midpoint of our original 
guidance at the outset of the fiscal year. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2010 were 
$1.96 per share. Non
-
GAAP operating income was $4.3 bill
ion, up 37% year
-
over
-
year, and non
-
GAAP earnings were $2.46 per share, up 88% year
-
over
-
year. Our business continued to generate strong cash flow. Operating 
cash flow for fiscal 2010 was more than $4 billion and approximately 37% of 
revenue.
 
QCT's fiscal 
2010 operating margin was 25% above our original guidance at 
the outset of the fiscal year, driven by strong volumes and favorable product 
mix in the second half of the year, including healthy demand for our 
integrated smartphone chipsets.
 
QTL's operating 
margins was 83% for fiscal 2010, and we estimate that the 
fiscal 2010 device ASP, as reported by our licensees, was approximately 
$183 to $189. Our non
-
GAAP and GAAP tax rates were approximately 20% 
of fiscal 2010. We are updating our estimate for calendar
 
2010 CDMA device 
shipments. We now expect approximately 625 million to 650 million devices 
to be shipped. Based on the 638 million midpoint of our estimates, we 
expect worldwide CDMA device shipments to grow approximately 26% year
-
over
-
year. Our prior est
imate had been 23% midpoint growth.
 
Turning to next year. We estimate calendar 2011 CDMA device shipments 
will increase approximately 16% to 24% over our 2010 midpoint estimate, 
with unit shipments of approximately 740 million to 790 million units. Based 
o
n the current business outlook, we anticipate fiscal 2011 non
-
GAAP 
revenues to be in the range of approximately $12.4 billion to $13 billion, a 
double
-
digit increase of 13% to 18% year
-
over
-
year. We expect non
-
GAAP 
operating income to be in the range of $4
.8 billion to $5.3 billion in fiscal 
2011, an increase of 11% to 23% year
-
over
-
year. We expect fiscal 2011 
non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.63 to $2.77, an 
increase of 7% to 13% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We are encouraged by the progress we are m
aking in resolving the two 
licensing disputes. While the outcomes remain uncertain and the disputes 
may not be resolved in 2011, we have included some benefit in the high
-
end 
of our 2011 guidance relating to resolution of the disputes. Our total amount 
exp
ected by the licensees is significantly greater than what's in our guidance 
when prior years and total fiscal 2011 disputed royalties are included. We 
are trying to be prudent pending resolution of the matters. Once the 
disputes are resolved, we will adjus
t our guidance and provide you with an 
appropriate explanation so that you can understand the impact.
 
In the QCT segment, we expect a modest decline in revenue per MSM in 
fiscal 2011, more consistent with historical norms prior to fiscal 2010. We 
anticipat
e that non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow 
approximately 7% year
-
over
-
year and driven primarily by growth in R&D 
expense.
 
We have begun a restructuring plan to exit the current FLO TV Service 
business and expect to incur restructuring charges
 
in fiscal 2011 to reduce 
ongoing expenses. This in turn better positions us for the strategic 
alternatives we are considering.
 
We expect our non
-
GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2011 to be approximately 21% 
and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19%.
 
Turning to
 
the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate non
-
GAAP revenues 
to be approximately $3 billion to $3.4 billion, an increase of 14% to 26% 
year
-
over
-
year. We anticipate the non
-
GAAP earnings per share will be 
approximately $0.70 to $0.74, an increase of 13
% to 19% year
-
over
-
year. 
This estimate includes shipments of approximately 115 to 119 million 
chipsets during the December quarter due to continued strong demand for 
smartphones in developed markets.
 
We expect total reported device sales of approximately $
31.5 billion to $33.5 
billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, and we 
expect a favorable foreign exchange benefit of several dollars, mostly due to 
the euro.
 
We believe that the channel inventory level is going through a seasonal bu
ild 
for the holiday season, although early indications are that the build may be a 
bit larger than what we've seen in recent years. We expect non
-
GAAP R&D 
and SG&A combined expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. The 
Qualcomm Investor Relations web
site includes an extensive slide 
presentation on the many data points included on this conference call, and 
we look forward to seeing you in New York for our Analyst Day meeting on 
November 17, where we will share additional data points regarding our fisca
l 
2011 guidance, including regional device shipment estimates, average 
selling prices and channel inventory. The Analyst Day event will be webcast 
for those of you unable to attend.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Warren.
 
Warren Kneeshaw
 
Thanks, Bill. I'd like to remind our participants that our goal on this call is to 
address as many questions as possible before we run out of time. I would 
encourage you therefore to limit your questions to one per caller. Operator,

If you could first just talk about in terms of the tablets and the other devices 
within your guidance, how much it 
were? If you can emphasize that market 
in terms of how much is embedded into your guidance currently? And then 
secondly if I just look at your fiscal year guidance, the math seems to imply 
that your operating margins in either your QCT or QTL or both will 
actually 
decline pretty significantly going into the last three quarters of the year, by 
my math, maybe below 25% on chipsets if I'm holding 80% margins on my 
QTL business. Can you just walk through kind of the puts and takes of the 
margin linearity throug
h the rest of the year?
 
William Keitel
 
Maynard, this is Bill. On the tablet question, we are considering whether we 
share more data on the market estimate and connected devices, specifically 
for a couple of weeks in New York. It's not currently in the pres
entation, but 
it is under consideration for inclusion. On the fiscal year operating margin, 
you are correct. We are expecting some decline after the first quarter. As 
Steve mentioned, we are looking at a channel inventory build here in the 
December quarter
. Typically, that begins to run off into the March and June 
quarters, number one. And number two, Steve talked about some product 
transitions that we foresee here in the second half of the year. So we are 
expecting operating margins to decline a bit in the
 
QCT business.

Bill, I was wondering if you could update us on mirasol. You said last year it 
was about $180 million to $190 million if my memory's right in terms of your 
guida
nce for fiscal '10. Can you update us on what might be included in the 
guidance for fiscal '11? And then just building an Maynard's question in 
terms of the margins, I know usually in the March quarter, you have an ASP 
lead price of lower prices ending the
 
year of your QCT divisions. Is that how 
we should think about that division also?
 
William Keitel
 
Mike, on mirasol, I think we've got some good information to share with 
everybody in a couple of weeks on how we see that business developing and 
unfolding. W
e had said at the outset of this year that we expected about 
$190 million operating loss in that business, and we did do a little bit better 
than that, kind of $15 million or so better this year. The operating loss 
within this guidance, we're projecting a 
higher loss for fiscal 2011, and we'll 
give some specifics on that in a couple of weeks. On the average ASP within 
QCT, as the year unfolds right now, we think we're in an 
--
 
developed 
market for us is developing one kind of add and the other one flows a b
it as 
you progress. Right now, we think we are very much in an add
-
on in the 
developed market. The latter part of this year, we are expecting emerging 
market to do a bit better. So that would suggest a bit of a decline in average 
revenue per MSM.

Bill, first, you talked about the cap in non

handset devices that you'll charge. 
Is that cap lower than what you might collect on a higher
-
end smartphone 
ASP? And then a question for Steve as
 
well. You talked about kind of the mix 
changing a little in the back half of the year. What are you assuming for 
products like a Snapdragon dual core? Should we be seeing that soon? And 
then the overall smartphone mix, do you expect that to continue to in
crease 
as a percent of your overall chip mix in terms of shipments in the back half 
of the year?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Brian, this Derek. Let me address your first question. We have had 
generally, across our licensing program, a capping program for some time. 
Now, 
what we're rolling out I think in a little more breadth is some specific 
caps to specific devices. And I think as for those, the expectation is that they 
will be below the caps that would apply generally to the broader set of the 
handset devices.

Derek Aberle
 
Yes.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Brian, this is Steve. On your smartphone mix question, I think what you're 
saying is in the f
irst quarter, certainly in the quarter that we gave guidance 
on, we continued to see very strong shipments of smartphones and 
probably, as I mentioned in my script, a little bit more than we even thought 
a couple of quarters ago. In the second half of the 
year, what we anticipate 
happening is that this shift will be probably a little bit more to the developing 
market, which would kind of pull that down a little bit in terms of the type of 
device that we ship. It's more of a statement I think about how I thi
nk 
strong it is at the moment versus kind of what's happening in the second 
half. Although in the second half, as Bill said, it kind of goes back and fourth 
between developed markets versus emerging markets. We saw that happen 
this year as well. In terms o
f dual core, dual core, we have today over 10 
different companies designing tablets on our dual core solutions. So we feel 
very good about where they're going. And then also in the handset space, 
you'll see that as well. That mix will start to happen throu
gh the year. The 
tablets space at this point, it's difficult to say how big that space is going to 
be. I've seen a lot of different estimates on that, and it will be interesting to 
see what happens. As we've probably talked before, we see that developed 
wo
rld being one type of market. In the developing world, I think you'll tend 
to see a number of different types of devices go in there, mainly because 
there is no laptop market for them to have to displace, and we've already 
seen that with some of our produc
t today. You've seen products going into 
India based off of smartphone chips. So there'll be a little bit of a mix there. 
In all cases, I think we're still trying to figure out how big that market is and 
how it will develop throughout the year.

Just a question maybe for Derek and Steve on LTE and timing of impact. I 
think, Steve, you talked about getting some chips in the market for the data 
cards this quarter. Could you talk a 
little bit about the timeline for phones? I 
think it's going to be single

chip for a while and when do we get the 
integrated chip? And then Derek, if you could just talk a little bit about when 
you think LTE devices will really start hitting the numbers an
d what impact 
we could expect from them for next year?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve, I'll handle the first part of that. I think you'll see, consistent 
with what we've said before, you'll see first products launch on our chipset 
here in this quarter tha
t we're in today. I think you'll see a big push on more 
handset and other connected products, probably around the timing of CES, 
and those will start to come in at the high
-
end of the portfolio next year and 
certainly built. We are addressing that really i
n three different ways. The 
first product is the MDM9600, which is the one I mentioned on the script and 
that's going into production in customer's devices here this quarter. And we 
will augment that with both our single core and dual core chipsets through
 
next year and then follow that up with our integrated 28
-
nanometer device 
that we've talked about. So it's a portfolio of products that will develop 
through next year according to that transition progression.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Let me take the second half of th
at. As you know, the royalties that are 
generated are paid in arrears, so we do expect some volume of LTE 3G 
multi
-
mode devices in the fiscal year, although given the QTL fiscal year to 
be less than what you would expect in a full calendar year. The licens
ing 
structure we have in place, as you know, already applies to multimode 3G 
LTE devices so that the royalties will continue to get paid on those devices 
without the need for us to go out and sign new agreements. I think we do 
expect, to some extent, upwar
d movement on the ASP front of these 
devices, given that the introduction of products with new technologies tend 
to start out at a little higher price point and work its way down, so it could 
be a positive contribution to ASP.

Both on your numbers in your guidance with respect to the question, I was 
wondering, Steve, in providing your guidance for somewhat lower ASP 
assumption in the back half of next year for the Chip business, could 
that 
partially be reflective of some customers requiring based on functionality 
rather than an integrated
-
based band and application offering. And also if 
you could clarify from Bill's comment, he said that he might expect slightly 
higher inventory levels 
to be sustained through this calendar quarter and 
you've state about strength of smartphones into the first quarter. How do we 
think about those two elements and what might be underpinning them?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
I think what you're seeing is more of a 
--
 
or at least at we've modeled is 
more of a shift within the integrated portfolio as opposed to a change in 
architecture. As I mentioned in the script, we're seeing very strong traction 
with our integrated solution, I think more of what is likely to happen. 
And 
again, this is a difficult thing to model. You're predicting mix and inventory 
levels out two or three quarters, which I think history is sometimes difficult 
to do. But our current plan assumes that shift tends to be more toward the 
mass market smartph
one, which is a different type of product than I think 
we're selling right now in a lot of the developed market. It's I think a good 
trend for the business because that also tends to pull 2G subscribers over to 
3G. And I mentioned how in the China market, 
for example, we're getting a 
lot of design traction on what I would consider to be mass
-
market 
smartphones. I think more of the growth of that market segment is 
occurring versus any change in architecture.
 
William Keitel
 
Tim, this is Bill. On the channel i
nventory question, as you know, we are 
aware typically see a little more channel inventory building in this December 
quarter for the holiday season. And then you look back in past years, the 
work
-
off of that extra inventory is typically in the March quarte
r, but 
sometimes, it extends into the June quarter. We're trying to monitor this 
very closely this year. We are, as we said, a little suspect that there's a bit 
more inventory build than what we've seen in prior years, and it's just 
around new devices, new
 
OEMs and a lot of excitement around the whole 
smartphone market. So we're going to continue to monitor this here over 
the next couple of weeks, and when we're in New York, we'll share with you 
our best view of it, as of that point in time as to just how m
uch of an 
increase is it, and do we think it's a March unwind or a March and June 
quarter unwind.

Just a couple of questions on the QTL. Bill, I think you said that t
he implied 
royalty rate decreased quarter
-
on
-
quarter partly because of the capping 
program in tablets. And I would imagine that the capping program impacts 
ASPs but not the royalty rate, if you can just clarify that. And then the 
second question on QTL was
 
it looks like ASP has actually declined a little bit 
sequentially and I understand that they're one quarter in arrears, but Q2 is 
really strong quarter for smartphone. So I'm just curious why ASPs were 
down. And then just lastly, in QTL, the 82% level for
 
operating margins, is 
that now a normalized level for that business? Or are there still any excess 
legal costs or any thing that's unusual there that's depressing that margin?
 
Derek Aberle
 
This is Derek. Let me take the first one. So basically, yes, there
 
is a 
sequential decline in the implied rate. As Bill mentioned, the devices that are 
coming through a total reported device sales are coming throughout at a full 
ASP. And to the extent that as a royalty cap in place, that means the royalty 
will actually g
et paid on something less than that complete selling price, so 
that does have a downward effect on the implied rate that you would 
calculate based on the information that we provide. And as typical, some of 
the revenue outside of the subscriber base tend t
o be a bit lumpy. Audit 
recovers were a bit down this quarter as well. That was contributed to the 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter change.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
On the ASP question, ASPs for the September quarter we just reported were 
pretty much in line with what we expected.
 
It was a modest decline from the 
prior quarter, and as we had mentioned last time, that was primarily the 
euro. There was a few dollars of euro FX impact that reduced the average 
selling price. But on that same point, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing 
the opposite impact here in this coming December quarter. We're looking for 
several dollars of positive impact, again primarily due to the euro. On the 
operating margin side for our Licensing business. Last quarter, we reported 
approximately 80%. This quar
ter, we reported 83%. So we did indicate that 
last quarter was an abnormal quarter. And then in terms of the full year, 
obviously, we're looking for good earnings growth and part of that is we are 
looking to grow revenues and operating income at a faster r
ate than our 
operating expenses. So we are looking to leverage that pace of operating 
expense that we already have in place. So on balance, operating margins, I 
think, are on a positive trend here.

I want to ask about the non
-
recognized licensees. In the past, you said it 
was about $200 million or so. Has that run rate increased? And then would 
they'd be included in your guidance, a kind of a catch
-
up? Because it's be
en 
a couple of years since they've paid. And then I also have a question on the 
chip side, in terms of overall content, I think the big driver on the increase 
generally is going to be apps processor and maybe move to 4G, so maybe if 
Steve can give us an up
date on 
--
 
I want to clarify that. And then second is 
any update on your connectivity solutions in terms of growing your footprint 
into WiFi into GPS?
 
William Keitel
 
Mark, it's Bill. On your first point on the licensees, yes, last year we 
indicated that we
 
thought there was approximately $200 million of revenues 
that we would not be recognizing, and that $200 million was 
--
 
the estimate 
as of the end of fiscal '10. We updated that during the year and indicated 
we're still in that range of approximately $200
 
million. The number, 
obviously, we haven't given you a specific for where it stands. Our estimate 
as of the end of fiscal '11, it is substantially larger. And we thought it best 
not to do so. The number is quite large, and we thought it was better just to
 
put in a prudent estimate into our guidance, the high
-
end of our guidance 
for what we expect to be able to recognize and get paid for and get reported 
on by licensees here in this fiscal year. And as we reach resolution, we will 
update everybody on the sp
ecifics and give best clarity we can as to what 
will prior year impacts and what's the current year impact.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Just to be clear, the number that's in the high
-
end of our guidance does not 
include the amount from prior periods.
 
Steven 
Mollenkopf
 
In terms of the AP tax rate that is growing we talked about in June that we 
had a 50% or nearly 50% sequential growth in our 7K and 8K units. We just 
reported 32% sequential from June to September. And then looking forward, 
we expect to see soli
d double
-
digit percentage gain on a sequential basis 
into Q1. So we think that, that business is going quite well or that business 
segment is going quite well in terms of growing share. 4G, we think, is a 
positive catalyst for us as well on the ASP side as
 
well as on the content 
side. As we've talked about before, a number of 
--
 
I think there are two 
things that differentiate us on the 4G side. One is our multimode capability, 
that ability to seamlessly handle or provide simultaneous services across the 
3G 
and the 4G networks. And then also I think just our ability to execute 
what we saw through the quarter was a build in terms of demand for LTE 
chipsets, and I think that's probably a good data point for how we're able to 
deliver. In terms of connectivity, G
PS is a big component of our solution 
today. It has been for a long time. It's something that has a very high attach 
rate with our solution across the feature phones as well as smartphones. 
We're now shipping Bluetooth in the tens of millions a year
-
type o
f quantity, 
and that has started to move into being an integrated solution in our 
smartphone roadmap. That will be followed by our Wireless LAN solution, 
and then we will integrate that as well. So if you look at our product 
portfolio, we started sampling 
stand
-
alone Bluetooth devices several years 
ago, and now we've migrated that into the MSM. We're a little bit delayed 
relative to the Bluetooth schedule, but same strategy is playing out on 
wireless LAN. So it's a standalone product today will be integrate
d here in 
the future and you'll hear more announcements about that in the future.

Steve, you spoke about your WCDMA chips share going up. Can you give us 
a sense as to where you think
 
that is? Because it sounds that you do track it 
in a sense, and you gave great information on the integrated 7,000 and 
8,000, how they've grown in the last couple of quarters. But can you give us 
again a sense as to roughly what percent you are of your to
tal MSMs are 
now of the 7,000 or 8,000 just to give us any ballpark that we have 50% 
again and we still are in the 20%, 30%, so something that's sort last couple 
really strong quarters. And then another clarification. Bill, you said that I 
just want to mak
e sure I heard that right, that all out or was it the majority 
of the royalty rate decline this quarter I calculate around 3.25% versus we 
were expecting an income of 3.4%. Was that all due to the caps or were 
there other things in there so we kind of back
-
end?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
It's Steve. I'll talk about the share issue. We think we are building share. At 
least 
--
 
I think we're building share, both in the handset market or actually 
in the handset market and overall. I think in the past, the WCDMA market 
h
as been strong growth in data cards and then really what happened was 
there's been, I think, a pretty strong move into smartphones. That transition 
into smartphones I think has been a good transition for us in terms of share. 
We expect that to continue thr
ough fiscal year '11. And as I said in my 
remarks, we will be continue to be aggressive in both protecting slots as well 
as trying to grow our share throughout the year. And as things move, I think 
a little bit more to being integrated solutions in the sma
rtphones space, we 
think that the market will move into a direction that plays to our strengths. I 
think there was a question there on 4G as well in terms of share or no?

First of all if you could quantify all of that 
--
 
the s
hare you talk about NWB 
and then second of all, the integrated percent of your total MSMs under 
integrated, you've told us they've grown 50% and then 33% last two 
quarters. But if you could give us a sense quantitatively where 
--
 
what the 
penetration rate 
of your total MSMs are right now of the integrated or the 
7,000 or 8,000?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure. On both of those, I don't think we've provided that type of guidance in 
the past. I would say that in terms of the percentage gain, it's a significant 
amount 
that I think the growth in percentage is actually meaningful as 
opposed to a law of small numbers type of issue. But of course, I don't think 
that's something that we've broken out in the past.
 
Donald Rosenberg
 
This is Don. On the royalty rate question, in
 
this quarter we just reported 
what we call the implied royalty rate as compared to the third quarter 
decreased 10 basis points. The primary driver of that was just this 
connected device point that we've made. But then, as Derek mentioned, a 
contributor as
 
well, was the fact that audit recoveries, which tend to be 
lumpy where not as much in the fourth fiscal quarter as they were in the 
third fiscal quarter.

I wanted to follow up on the tablets and I think in response to Maynard's 
question at the outset of the Q&A se
ssion, is that you indicated you were 
debating whether to give more view into what you think the tablet market 
may look like. I just want to clarify that you do have some tablet build into 
your guidance for fiscal year 2011 first. Second, as part of that, 
several 
years ago you gave a statistic of tens of millions of units shipped related to 
connectivity, and I think most of those were laptop cards. How are you 
thinking about cannibalization of tablets into what you've been getting from 
things like USB, dong
les, et cetera? And then finally, just a contribution from 
TD
-
SCDMA, in the past, there has been some comments that you may start 
to try to address that market but can you just give us a rough outline of how 
we should be thinking about TD
-
SCDMA's contribut
ion to your fiscal year 
2011 outlook and when you might be participating in the Chipset business 
there.
 
William Keitel
 
James, I'll take the first two. This is Bill. On the tablet market, yes, we do 
have an estimate in our forward guidance. Yes, we do have 
that in. And then 
how we think of tablets in terms of our cannibalization, I think the key point 
there is that we see tablets being sold with a higher rate of Wide Area 
Network connectivity, 3G connectivity than what we were seeing laptops go 
with that sam
e capability. So we think as time goes on, tablets will 
substitute, to some degree, for a laptop. But on balance, the connectivity 
stays at an increment. It's clearly a positive for Qualcomm.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. On the chipset side, it really 
looks like an incremental market 
to us. And the interesting thing about it is I think it's unlike the netbook 
space and the laptop space, the embedded attach rate of wireless LAN is 
quite high, which I think helps us in two ways. One is that it just sets u
p the 
market better for us. The other one is that I think it encourages a number of 
the handset players to pull up into that space. So it looks very much like a 
different market to us form the chipset side, one that we could leverage our 
traditional streng
ths on.
 
Derek Aberle
 
At this point, we don't really see that cannibalizing the dongle space either. 
Let me just comment on TD

SCDMA. I think its a similar story, I think, as 
we've said in the past, we've got a large number of companies that are 
licensed for TD
-
SCDMA where we'r
e collecting royalties from those licensees 
on nice segment of the devices being sold in China. However, we still got 
some work to do and we're continuing to engage in discussions and try to 
enter into agreements with the remaining companies that are suppl
ying in 
China that are not yet licensed. And I think we'll be in a position to put a 
little more color on that in a couple of weeks in New York.

I'd like to look into your guida
nce. You mentioned that you have some 
contribution from tablets, I'm wondering if you can quantify? And then you 
also mentioned there is some contribution from the licensing dispute, and 
I'm wondering if you can quantify also this one. And the third point,
 
mirasol 
this year, as far I remember, it was $0.09 of losses from my calculations. 
What's embedded in your guidance for next year? Are you assuming 
substantial increase or not? And then can you also discuss 
--
 
you said that 
you maybe able to update us soo
n on mirasol, but can you discuss what's 
going to be the impact of any investment you have there? What could be the 
impact on your guidance?
 
William Keitel
 
This is Bill. On the constitution from tablets, what we said was that on our 
presentation as it stan
ds right now, in New York, but we are considering and 
we're having a good discussion on whether we would include a breakout 
estimate of connected devices. So it's under consideration, but we haven't 
decided that yet. It's a new developing market, a little 
harder to forecast 
because of that reason, but we are considering that. On the licensing 
dispute, I'll just recount I think what I think are the key points we made 
here. If you recall, we had said it was approximately $200 million as of the 
end of fiscal '
10. That was due to loss and of course some licensee is paying. 
But we haven't recognized it. So revenues and earnings that we haven't 
recognized. And that number for fiscal '11 is substantially greater. And so 
the decision was rather than put forth it was
 
a pretty large number. We 
thought it was better to just put in a very prudent estimate into our 
guidance of what we think will be ultimately recognizable in fiscal '11, and 
we did not include in that any prior year. So it would only be a prudent 
estimate 
of what is earned and what we think we will report to recognize in 
fiscal '11. From a timing standpoint, we'll put that in the second half of the 
year, but that's what we've got right now. On the mirasol side, the 2010 
operating loss was approximately $180
 
million. We do have on a percentage 
basis I would say it's a fairly substantial increase year
-
over
-
year. Operating 
loss I think, as you know, we're pretty optimistic about the potential here 
we've got, and we'll get into some more specifics on that on wha
t's in the 
guidance and where we stand on that business in a couple of weeks when 
we see in New York.

you repay trade with what international cash might look like and just 
generally comment on what you think the probabilities are there? I'd also be 
interested in whether you think paying 
a dividends earlier or getting to some 
sort of a dividend like Cisco had done would help your chances with the 
government? So that's one question. And then another one, it's just I know 
it's been asked several times, but I want to clarify again, on the roy
alty 
caps, can you just confirm that you're using an absolute U.S. dollar amount 
for the cap? And then can you also talk about how you're basing that cap? In 
other words, should we assume that the absolute U.S. dollar royalty 
payment on these devices is go
ing to be based off of what you're already 
receiving as an average on existing smartphone royalties? Or is it something 
completely different?
 
Paul Jacobs
 
This is Paul, let me take the repatriation question since I've been in the 
middle of having those disc
ussions with the members of the administration 
and Congress people. The discussions have really focused around what the 
use of that money would be, whether it be used for things like building 
factories in the United States or other forms of CapEx, creating
 
more R&D 
jobs so funding innovation or dividends. I've been a pretty strong proponent 
that dividends would be a good use of that money, because of it create a 
velocity of money in the economy. I would not say that I've gotten great 
traction with that at t
his point, but we're continuing to do that. we're doing 
an economic study about repatriation and when that is completed, we'll be 
going around Washington. Hopefully, demonstrating to people the value of 
repatriation. So far, dividends hasn't been something
 
that's been a leverage 
point, but as I said, we'll continue to try and drive that thought.
 
William Keitel
 
Then on the tablet question, again what we're looking to do is on a specific 
set of device categories, what we really want to help drive a higher 
pen
etration of 3G put in place on specifically tailored caps. And as I said, 
they are lower than sort of the traditional caps that apply generally or 
broadly across the licensing program, but at this point, we're not really 
going to get any more detail as to 
exactly how they're calculated or what 
they are.

I'm just having a little bit of trouble reconciling it. So if I take the midpoint 
in fiscal '11, you got revenues up 16%. You'v
e got operating profit of about 
the same amount 17%, with OpEx up only 7% or 8%, so I can see where 
the margin compression is coming from here. But you got EPS up only about 
10%. So it sounds like there's quite a bit of cost or some other kind of 
compressi
on below the line thus affecting the difference between the 
operating profit increase and the EPS increase. Can you give me some 
feeling for what that actually is?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
It's pretty straightforward. We don't include it in our guidance a forecas
t of

before closing the call?
 
Paul Jacobs
 
I think at the beginning of the fiscal year, there were a lot of concerns about 
our compet
itive Chipset division and growth opportunities in the Licensing 
business, and I'm really happy with our performance in the year and also 
with our projections going forward. The Snapdragon sales really highlight 
our strength in smartphones. Smartphones and
 
also these new device types 
are driving a lot of opportunities for the Licensing business. And so I was 
very excited by what we see as a potential going forward. The reason is 
because the wireless industry really continues to innovate in an extremely 
rapi
d pace, and it's doing that because it's responding to consumer traction 
and excitement, and the amount of focus on this space I think is almost 
higher than it's ever been. And so I feel like Qualcomm is extremely well 
positioned there. We are going to con
tinue to drive that dynamic as hard as 
we can with new products and new technologies in 2011 and beyond. So we 
thank you very much for your support and thanks for being on the call 
today, and we look forward to seeing you in New York.

of smartphones and other device types at multiple price tiers positions QTL 
for strong growth in fiscal 2012.
 
We continue to make advancements with our mirasol Display technology and 
announced the launch of eReader products with 4 different partne
rs in the 
last 90 days. Now these products are being supported from our development 
fab. We're on track to bring our commercial fab online later this year.
 
On the mobile health front, we announced the launch of Qualcomm Life in 
our 2net platform. We expect
 
that this platform will help accelerate adoption 
of a variety of new mobile health
-
related devices and services. Further, the 
Qualcomm Foundation, partnering with the X PRIZE Foundation, also 
announced the launch of the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Pr
ize, which 
is a global competition with the goal of helping drive development of 
diagnostic devices that will give consumers access to their state of health in 
the palm of their hand.
 
And just after the close of our first fiscal quarter, we completed the s
ale of 
our 700 MHz Spectrum in the United States to AT&T for $1.9 billion, and 
we're now working with them to provide supplemental downlink technology 
that they intend to deploy in that spectrum to deliver faster downloads in 
greater capacity on their LTE 
network.
 
Looking forward, we continue to see favorable trends across the key growth 
drivers for our business. First, with respect to handsets, there continues to 
be strong consumer demand for smartphones across all key regions. 
According to Gartner, worldw
ide smartphone sales reached 477 million units 
in calendar year 2011, up approximately 60% year
-
over
-
year. Second, the 
2G to 3G migration remains strong in emerging regions. According to 
Wireless Intelligence, in the December quarter, 3G connections in eme
rging 
regions grew greater than 45% year
-
over
-
year.
 
They also forecast that China will surpass 1 billion mobile connections before 
the end of the March quarter, and that 3G will soon account for 25% of the 
country's connections, driven by increased operato
r subsidies, as well as 
increased availability and consumer demand for smartphones. According to 
Gartner, China is currently the world's #2 region in terms of quarterly 
smartphone sales and is poised to become the leading consumer of 
smartphones in the wor
ld. Now recently I attended China Telecom's annual 
supply chain conference where they announced that they expect demand for 
80 million 3G handsets on their CDMA network in calendar year 2012, of 
which 45 million are expected to be EV
-
DO smartphones.
 
A thir
d growth driver is the opportunity beyond handsets, including the 
adoption of 3G, 4G connectivity and devices such as tablets, eReaders, 
machine
-
to
-
machine and gaming devices. According to certain industry 
analysts, non
-
handset mobile broadband device ship
ments are estimated to 
grow at a 40% compound annual growth rate from 2010 through 2015.
 
We also see an exciting opportunity for the adoption of our Snapdragon 
processors in the mobile computing and the consumer electronics space. 
Lenovo's recent K91 smart
 
TV announcement, powered by a Snapdragon 
processor, demonstrates the breadth of capability that our products have, 
and we continue to make significant investments in these areas.
 
The fourth key driver is to continue deployment of advanced network 
technolo
gies to handle the accelerating consumer demand for wireless data. 
I have regular discussions with leading operators as they consider 
alternative ways to address the expected growth in data traffic on their 
networks. Across the world, we see operators cont
inuing to invest in 
enhancements to their 3G networks, seek new spectrum, as well as deploy 
LTE. According to the GSA, LTE is now commercial in 49 networks across 29 
countries.
 
And finally, we see the expansion of connectivity as an important 
incremental g
rowth driver for our business, consistent with our vision of a 
world where almost everything around us is connected. At CES, we 
demonstrated examples of our vision of a connected home. We announced 
expansions of our Qualcomm Atheros product portfolio to ad
dress these 
future opportunities.
 
On the legal front, as we noted in our 10
-
Q, which was filed today, on 
January 27, 2012, we learned that the U.S. Attorney's office in San Diego 
and the DOJ have begun a preliminary investigation regarding the 
company's co
mpliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We believe we 
are in compliance with the requirements of the FCPA, and we will continue to 
cooperate with this investigation and look forward to resolving this matter.
 
To conclude, we have completed another 
outstanding quarter at Qualcomm, 
driven by a continued 2G to 3G migration, smartphone adoption and 
continued strong execution across our businesses. And looking forward, I'm 
pleased with our outlook for continued strong revenue and earnings growth 
in fisca
l 2012.
 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to Steve 
Mollenkopf.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered 
another strong quarter with record MSM shipments, revenue and 
operating 
profit. Growth in global demand for 3G and 4G smartphones, along with 
share growth across our chipset portfolio, helped to drive these strong 
results.
 
We shipped a record 156 million MSMs, up 32% year
-
over
-
year, and we are 
pleased to be shipping 
our chipset solutions to all major handset 
manufacturers. Our volumes continue to grow at a rate in excess of 4G, 3G 
device growth, and our strategy to drive smartphones further into all tiers 
through the expansion of our Snapdragon chipset road map contin
ues to 
gain traction with our customer base.
 
Snapdragon shipments grew by more than 120% year
-
over
-
year in the 
December quarter, and there are now more than 340 announced 
Snapdragon
-
based devices with over 400 more in design, and we continue 
to grow our de
sign pipeline with increasing momentum at key Tier 1 
multinational and developing OEM accounts. Our S1 Snapdragon products 
targeted for lower
-
priced smartphones showed strong growth during the 
quarter, particularly in China.
 
Our shipments to developing Chi
nese accounts grew more than 10x year
-
over
-
year and in total, compare favorably to shipments to China
-
based 
multinational accounts, reflecting the overall growth and diversification of 
our customer base in the region. Our MSM 8960, the flagship of our 
Snap
dragon S4 family, is now shipping commercially to customers as 
scheduled. Volume production is ramping, and we are seeing strong OEM 
demand for that chipset even above our prior expectations. We are starting 
to see the first 8960 device announcements by ou
r partners, including the 
Lenovo IdeaTab and the ASUS Padfone, both announced at the Consumer 
Electronics Show last month, and there are now over 120 S4
-
based devices 
in design, and many more partner announcements are expected in the 
coming months.
 
The maj
ority of these OEMs are designing in our integrated connectivity, 
including Wi
-
Fi, GPS, Bluetooth and FM into these devices. At CES last 
month, we demonstrated a prerelease version of Microsoft Windows 8 
running on the S4 MSM 8960, showcasing the integrate
d multimode 3G LTE 
modem connected via AT&T's live network. Our technology breadth 
combined with our ability to integrate these technologies into a broad and 
deep road map is a clear competitive differentiator for us. We continue to 
make investments upstre
am of new opportunities, positioning us for 
leadership at the front end as they develop. We see that taking place now 
with our strength in LTE and believe we are investing to be positioned well 
for the Windows 8 opportunity.
 
We are on track to sample the n
ext two 28
-
nanometer chipsets in our 
Snapdragon S4 family of products. The dual
-
core MSM 8930, which will 
enable 3G LTE smartphones at high
-
volume price points, and the quad
-
core 
APQ 8064, which will support high
-
end smartphones, tablets and Windows 8 
devi
ces. These chipsets exemplify our strategy of rapidly extending new 
technologies and chipset features across multiple price tiers.
 
Fiscal year 2012 is off to a strong start, and we are pleased with the demand 
profile and design pipeline that we have in pla
ce, as well as the opportunity 
that lies ahead in mobile computing.
 
That concludes my remarks, and I would now like to turn the call over to Bill 
Keitel.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. We had another quarter of 
record results
, and we are pleased to be raising our estimates for fiscal 2012 
revenue and earnings per share. Our first quarter revenues of $4.7 billion 
were a record high, up 40% year
-
over
-
year and at the high end of our prior 
guidance. Non
-
GAAP operating income was a
 
record $1.87 billion, up 32% 
year
-
over
-
year, and non
-
GAAP earnings per share was a record $0.97, up 
18% year
-
over
-
year, both exceeding the high end of our prior guidance.
 
We shipped a record 156 million MSM chipsets during the quarter, also 
exceeding the 
high end of our prior guidance, and QCT's operating margin 
was 24%, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of smartphone chipsets. 
Total reported device sales from our licensees for the September quarter 
were a record $41.4 billion, at the high end of o
ur prior guidance. We 
estimate that our licensees' total reported device sales was comprised of 
$191 million to $195 million 3G, 4G device shipments at an average selling 
price of $212 to $218 per unit. Based on the midpoint, the average selling 
price of s
uch devices increased 4% sequentially, driven by higher average 
selling prices of handsets in emerging regions and data dongles comprising a 
lower percentage of total units, partially offset by approximately $4 per unit 
of unfavorable foreign exchange.
 
QTL
's operating margin was 88%, driven by record total reported device 
sales. Non
-
GAAP investment income was $191 million, including $45 million 
in gains from put options in our stock sold in fiscal 2011 as part of our stock 
repurchase program. Operating cash
 
flow was approximately $1.8 billion 
during the first quarter, and cash and marketable securities totaled $22 
billion.
 
During the first quarter, we returned $461 million to stockholders, including 
cash dividends of $362 million and $99 million to 
repurchase 2 million 
shares. On January 10, we announced another cash dividend of $0.215 per 
share payable on March 23 to stockholders of record as of March 2.
 
First quarter non
-
GAAP earnings per share was $0.08, above the midpoint of 
our prior guidance. Q
CT contributed $0.05. QTL contributed $0.02, and the 
remaining $0.01 was primarily from better
-
than
-
expected investment 
income. We estimate that 770 million to 795 million 3G, 4G devices were 
shipped in calendar 2011. Based on the 783 million midpoint of t
hat range, 
we estimate that calendar 2011 3G, 4G device shipments grew 
approximately 20% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Now turning to our guidance. We are raising our estimate for 3G, 4G device 
shipments to between 875 million and 945 million in calendar 2012, an 
increa
se of approximately 10 million units over our prior guidance and up 
16% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We are raising our fiscal 2012 revenue 
guidance by approximately $700 million on the strength of our QTL and QCT 
business segments. We now expect fiscal
 
2012 revenues to be $18.7 billion 
to $19.7 billion, up approximately 27 
--
 
28% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We are raising our non
-
GAAP earnings per share guidance by $0.13. We now 
anticipate non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.75, up approximat
ely 
14% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We are also raising our guidance for 
GAAP earnings per share by $0.56, reflecting strength in our core 
operations, as well as the $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our spectrum to 
AT&T at the outset of the second fisc
al quarter.
 
We now expect GAAP earnings per share of $3.36 to $3.56, up 
approximately 37% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate the 
average selling price of 3G, 4G devices would be approximately $204 to 
$216 in fiscal 2012, above our prior estimate o
f $197 to $209, reflecting 
higher
-
than
-
expected average selling prices in multiple regions, partially 
offset by approximately $1 per unit of unfavorable foreign exchange.
 
We expect the combination of non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to increase 
approximately 
18% year
-
over
-
year, driven primarily by increased R&D 
investments in our QCT business. For fiscal 2012, our guidance for QTL and 
QCT operating margins is unchanged. We expect QTL's operating margin for 
the fiscal year to be 86% to 88%, and we expect QCT's 
operating margin for 
this fiscal year to be 20% to 22%. We estimate our non
-
GAAP annual tax 
rate to be approximately 18% and 19% for fiscal 2012.
 
Now turning to the second fiscal quarter. We estimate revenues of $4.6 
billion to $5 billion, up approximately
 
24% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint, 
and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.91 to $0.97, up approximately 9% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect GAAP earnings per share of 
$1.20 to $1.26, up approximately $0.42 sequentially at the midpoint, 
including 
approximately $0.44 from the gain of our spectrum sale to AT&T.
 
We expect total reported device sales by our licensees to be $47.5 billion to 
$51.5 billion, up 24% year
-
over
-
year and up 20% sequentially at the 
midpoint. We anticipate QCT shipments of 146 m
illion to 154 million MSM 
chips during the March quarter, down a bit sequentially at the midpoint 
coming off the busy holiday quarter, but up 27% year
-
over
-
year. Our 
estimate for CDMA channel inventory is consistent with our prior 
expectations remaining at
 
the lower end of the 13 to 18
-
week range through 
fiscal 2012.
 
We anticipate second quarter non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses combined 
will increase approximately 9% sequentially, reflecting increased seasonal 
expenses, notably employer payroll taxes. As we s
aid last quarter, while we 
estimate that the implied royalty rate you calculate based on the information 
we provide will be in the range of 3.4% to 3.5% for fiscal year 2012, you will 
continue to see quarterly variations in the rate based on a variety of f
actors 
that we have discussed in the past. At this time, we do expect that the 
implied rate will decline sequentially in Q2 based primarily on the fact that 
fixed Licensing fees and infrastructure royalties are growing at a much 
slower pace than the strong
 
growth in total reported device sales by our 
licensees.
 
We also estimate that QCT's operating margin for Q2 will be at the low end 
of the 20% to 22% range we have provided for fiscal 2012. The midpoint of 
our fiscal second quarter non
-
GAAP earnings per sh
are guidance is $0.03 
lower sequentially. Based on this midpoint, we estimate that QTL will be 
$0.08 better, reflecting strong device smartphone shipments for the holiday 
quarter, and we estimate that QCT will be lower by $0.05, reflecting typical 
seasonal
ity. The remaining $0.06 decrease is driven by operating expense 
growth and lower forecasted investment income.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren 
Kneeshaw.

On the Chipset business, if I could. First on the gross margins, Bill, it looks 
like, back of the envelope here, it looks 
like they declined again sequentially. 
Are we going to see continued gross margin pressure on the Chipset 
business? And then on the ASPs, if you could just touch on what drove them 
down in the December quarter, and should we expect the typical March 
--
 
I 
t
hink you do some repricing where there's a price down in the March 
quarter?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure, Tim. On the gross margins, we're seeing both first quarter and second 
quarter unfold largely as we expected at the outset of the year and 
consistent with th
e strategy we've had in place now for a good year plus. 
There is some more pressure on the gross margin, but volume side is 
offsetting pretty well on the operating margin level. ASPs on average per 
chip, I don't expect a lot of change going into Q2 relativ
e to what we 
reported here in Q1. There will be, I think, a modest change. But overall, I 
don't expect a lot of change, in fact, based on our outlook here for the rest 
of the year. We do expect QCT to report a sequential decrease in operating 
margin percen
t going into Q2 as we've seen in prior quarters. And as typical, 
I think everybody understands that this is a time of year when we typically 
have our pricing resets.

Just a couple of follow
-
ups. First, Steve, I think you said that demand for the 
MSM 8960 is exceeding expectations, and I just wanted to clarify if that's 
because the customers that you've won are ordering higher volumes than 
you expecte
d or if it's because you're getting more customer wins than you 
expected? And then, Bill, I just wanted to clarify in terms of your full year 
3G, 4G unit, raised by about 10 million, if you can just expand a bit on the 
sources of that upside.
 
Steven M. Mol
lenkopf
 
It's really a combination of both. What we're seeing is, I think, consistent 
with my comments about increased demand for LTE across the portfolio. So 
we're seeing that being pulled through on the 8960, as well as the 
--
 
I think 
there's also demand 
for the new CPU core that we have in there as well. So 
it's become a very successful chip for us in terms of design pipeline.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Simona, on the full year 3G, 4G units. Yes, our range has increased 
approximately 10 million at the low and the 
high end. And that 10 million 
changes, the primary driver is China. As you noted in Paul's remarks, that 
market is particularly strong for smartphones here of late. But we're seeing 
strength elsewhere beyond that. Latin America 
--
 
I would say, first of all
, 
more on the emerging regions. But Latin America, and parts of Middle East, 
Asia and Africa, we're seeing strength.

Steve, just building on that 
last question. With strong share gains for QCT 
during the December quarter, can you just update us on some areas for 
content share gains as you go through the year? For example, our checks 
are showing like Qualcomm's integrated solutions doing very well in
 
kind of 
the mid
-
tier mass
-
market smartphones. How do you see kind of your apps 
profits pull through with the 8960? And then also if you could talk on your 
connectivity business for 8960, that would be great.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Sure, Mike. It's really be
en across the board. We've been really telling a 
story in our strategy that we thought that the combination of the high
-
end 
modem feature set, which would be LTE and the high
-
end AP was something 
that we really felt would move together in the market, and w
e've seen 
evidence of that happening. We had the Fusion chipsets really strong at the 
high end of the product line. You've seen some of the big OEMs take that 
and really transition their product line toward us in that respect. We've also 
seen, particularly
 
into emerging markets and some of the new accounts that 
we've been able to acquire, particularly in China, a demand for really mass
-
market smartphones, particularly in China across several different operators. 
And then in addition, we've been shipping rea
lly into some new larger 
accounts that have been important for the business as well. So it's really a 
case where things have been happening across the board. We think this 
broad technology play, as well as integration, will be something that will help 
us i
n the future as well. A good example of that was the comments that I 
made about the connectivity business in reference to your question. If you 
look at the number of 8960 design wins that we have, really the majority of 
them are going to be using our integ
rated connectivity as well. So we think 
that, that strategy continues to play in addition to what we've seen in the 
past. We think it's a good strategy moving forward as well.

A question for Steve. So the China business, can you talk a little bit about 
what you're seeing from a design win standpoint. Our checks are indicating 
you're capturing over half the designs in China with regard to 
--
 
as those 
vendors shift
 
over to 3G, can you kind of talk around that number? And Bill, 
how do you see, as you've seen more of these kind of mid and low
-
end 
smartphones hitting the market, how that might affect your gross and 
operating margins in that business overall. And then i
f I can get an update 
on the timing of your TD
-
SCDMA product for China as well, I'd appreciate 
that.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Sure, Brian. In answer to your first question about the emerging accounts 
for us in China, we were first mover to integrated smartphon
e chipsets in 
the emerging markets, and I think that's been an area that's been able to 
--
 
what we've been able to sustain that in terms of design wins, which I 
mentioned in my remarks how those accounts have really been growing in 
terms of shipments. And 
now the size of them they really are pretty close to 
where we are with some of the larger multinationals in China. So we're quite 
pleased with how that's working. We think that continues to be a technology 
battle there. We have a pretty deep road map. Our 
strategy there will be to, 
as you know, to just continue to push our integration strategy. Integrated 
connectivity is also important in that market as well. So we're going to 
continue moving that forward and are pleased with the initial results though.
 
Don
ald J. Rosenberg
 
Brian, it's Don. On the mid to low
-
end smartphone space, obviously, that's 
been very much a target of ours for more than the last year now. Last year, 
we priced the chipset products pretty aggressively to help build up that 
space and seeme
d to work pretty well. And the year from a margin 
standpoint QCT pretty much unfolded as we had expected. So now we're 
starting to ramp more into that business, continue to be aggressive on the 
price, bringing the 28
-
nanometer mark to market, which hopeful
ly, in future 
years, that's going to lead to a little bit better margin potential for us. On 
the Licensing side, this mid to low
-
end market in smartphones is thus far 
proving pretty positive for QTL, and it's not a small part of our optimism 
really with th
e strength of ASPs going forward for the rest of this year. So 
we're pretty pleased with this mid to low
-
end smartphone market.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
And, Brian, in answer to your question about TD
-
SCDMA, this is Steve again. 
It's really the same timing tha
t we mentioned in New York in November. Our 
TD
-
SCDMA products, we think will be delivered at the end of this year in 
terms of products in the market. There's a couple different chipsets that 
have that including our S4 family of chipsets, as well as our 28

nanometer 
modem designs called 9x15. So those are on track and continue to move 
forward.

This is Eric Ghernati for Tal. A few questions here. First for Paul, 
we haven't 
talked to you since then, and since the Analyst Meeting that TS, Intel 
obviously, talked about some LTE [ph] and a couple of design wins and there 
were a few benchmarks. If you can just walk us through your thought 
process now that you've seen a
 
few benchmarks from Intel. And then a 
couple of questions for Bill, if you don't mind. First if you can disclose what 
the ASPs did for QCT, sorry, for MSMs. And secondarily, off of the Q2 trough 
in QCT operating margins, how much do you think is coming fr
om 
--
 
how 
much should we expect as far as gross margin improvements over next 2 or 
3 quarters shall we say? Midpoint of your EBIT margin of 20%, 22%.
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
So yes, we saw the announcements that were made by Intel at CES. And 
some of the guys got a
round to see some 
--
 
how the products were 
operating and talking to some of the 
--
 
some of the partners. So I think we 
still feel extremely strongly that we're in a good position relative to power 
and performance, relative to them. If you look at the diffe
rence in the 
number of design wins, I think that really does tell the story pretty directly. 
And the other thing that I think you may have seen at CES was us 
demonstrating 8960
-
based Windows 8 tablets. And when I said to the 
audience that it didn't have a 
fan, I think we got a lot of knowing chuckles. 
So we feel good about that opportunity. It's going to certainly be a lot of 
competition coming, but we're excited about what's ahead of us.

Steve, if I can try and dissect the 
--
 
your chips a little bit. X 
--
 
you have 
your largest customer, the fruit one, and we look at your baseband business. 
So x Snapdragon and x this new customer. Is that baseband business kind 
of gro
wing 
--
 
still growing with the market? Or is that beginning to decline? 
And then when I do the math, it looks like your Snapdragon chips were still 
very strong but may have fallen sequentially, I calculate falling around 15% 
to 20% sequentially, yet your o
perating margin went up 2 points from 22 to 
24. So does that mean that the profitability of your basebands, which seems 
to be a mix towards basebands this quarter, may have actually been 
stronger than people think and that with just basebands, you can keep
 
your 
margins up higher? And then finally, the S4 platform, as that comes out, 
how should we be looking at this? Is this just the next version of your chips? 
Or is it really kind of a game changer in the sense that it puts you up ahead 
of 
--
 
from everyone 
and it will allow you to gain share? And how should we 
be thinking about the impact of all the S4 devices on the P&L?
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
We're 
--
 
so forgive me if I don't touch all of it. The 
--
 
let me answer the first 
--
 
last part first, which is I think on t
he S4, you should really look at it as 2 
things. One is, it's the next chip in our family. But as we've been saying over 
the years, each chipset becomes more integrated, more complex, probably 
more difficult to do, actually, unless you have a very broad se
t of 
technologies. In this case, we've combined really a full
-
scale modem 
upgrade, connectivity upgrade and computing upgrade, and we're really very 
pleased with how the market has received that. So we really look at it as a 
pretty big step up in terms of 
integration and functionality. And then on its 
heels, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're rapidly tiering that product 
family so that, well, now 
--
 
in addition to delivering at the high end, we're 
also delivering across multiple tiers, really above and bel
ow. That's the 
strategy we've had for many years across the modem, and now we're 
bringing that into mobile computing as well. I apologize. I actually can't 
recall the first half of your question.

It was 
on, are your basebands, x, so I'll just say Apple, and x your 
Snapdragon chips. So just basebands. Is that growing with the market? Or is 
that declining? And your Snapdragon chips seem to have fallen sequentially, 
yet your total operating margin went up 2 
points. Normally, we think of 
Snapdragon up sequentially, operating margin up and vice versa, yet now it 
seems as though your basebands were up versus Snapdragon's, and yet 
your operating margins still went up. So how should we be thinking about 
that relat
ionship?
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
Well, I think the baseband continues to grow 
--
 
or the Snapdragon platform 
really continues to grow quarter
-
to
-
quarter, and we still 
--
 
we saw the same 
thing in the units that we delivered this quarter. In addition, you should 
think
 
of our results really as a combination of bringing on some new 
customers on, some of them being, or one of them being quite large, as well 
as continuing to grow outside, really. So your 
--
 
the traditional accounts, 
we've continued to either maintain share
 
or grow share, as well as we're 
bringing on new customers as people transition to smartphones in emerging 
markets. So it's really a case for us as we've been able to grow the business 
while the landscape of the OEM market has really changed quite a bit. S
o 
we're pleased with how that's happened. And this quarter's a really good 
example of that.

Bill, I wanted to dig into the QCT margins. Clearly, your volumes, 
chipset 
volumes, are delivering higher than planned. Your device ASPs are higher 
than planned, which means a much better mix of devices as well. So 
--
 
and I 
understand that sequential decline in QCT margins into the second quarter 
doesn't make sense. But I
 
guess the question is why still you can't raise your 
QCT margin target for the year. It seems like you're running ahead of plan, 
as was the case this past quarter and, it sounds like, the next quarter versus 
your original plan. So why can't we see the QCT
 
margins rising?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure, Ittai. And by the way, after I answer your point, I didn't like my 
microphone, and I'm going to come back and finish Eric's questions from 
--
 
Eric from Merrill Lynch BofA. But on the QCT margins, Ittai, the 
--
 
if yo
u 
back up a little bit, do recall, of course, the pricing strategy we've had in 
place. And then, of course, the acquisition of Atheros put some pressure, 
downward pressure, on our margins. But for 
--
 
relative to the guidance we 
gave at the outset of this y
ear and where we are right now, we did 
--
 
in 
addition to the revenue increase, we did increase our operating expenses, 
and that's primarily R&D and primarily QCT. So there's 
--
 
the demand for 
more program from our customers is giving us reason to up that R
&D spend. 
Back to the question that I didn't answer. ASPs for QCT, we did see a bit of a 
--
 
a slight dip here in the quarter we just reported relative to the fourth 
fiscal quarter of 2011. We do expect a modest uptick in Q2 and then kind of 
flattish from t
here given 
--
 
and this really reflects the wide array of chipset 
products that we've got. Having said that, one of the more challenging 
things for us to forecast in our business is the right mix of what we will 
actually ship. So just be prepared for likely
 
some volatility in that average 
revenue per MSM. Okay?

I've got a couple questions for Bill and a quick one for Steve. So Bill, on the 
royalty base, I want to ge
t a sense for how much of it is based on tablets. Is 
that becoming a meaningful percentage based on attach rates of 3G? Along 
with that, what kind of impact would you see, for instance, if a $400 
smartphone went to $300? Would that 
--
 
is there a cap or som
ething that 
would keep that overall ASP from coming in? Also, Bill, onshore cash, if you 
can give me that number. And then finally, for Steve, on the 8960 ramp, 
congrats, it sounds like you're seeing some good design work there. Any 
guess or guidance on wh
at kind of mix you'd expect in fiscal '12? And also, 
what kind of battery life's relative to the bolt
-
on LTE? I mean, is LTE going to 
be ready for the mass market tier in the back half of the year?
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
Mark, this is Derek. Let me go ahead and a
ddress the first couple of 
questions. I think as the market continues to grow, we're seeing growth in 
the number of tablets quarter
-
over
-
quarter. But I think as a percentage of 
total units, it's been relatively stable. So we're not seeing them, at this 
poi
nt, increase as a percentage of total units, just more grow in line with the 
market. On your question on ASP, we do have caps that we've talked about 
generally. They tend to be 
--
 
on the higher side wouldn't necessarily impact 
the price points that you des
cribed on the smartphone side. But our feeling 
is that as the prices of these phones come down into the mid and lower 
tiers, as Bill said, it's going to be very 
--
 
continue to be very positive trends 
for the business, and we don't see those phones cannibal
izing the devices at 
the high end where the pricing continues to remain fairly stable.
 
William E. Keitel
 
On the onshore cash, we finished the quarter with $6.1 billion in onshore 
cash.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Mark, this is Steve. With respect to 8960, in term
s of mix, what we think is 
happening is you're seeing a strong pull of multimode LTE in the portfolio. 
And if you look really 
--
 
we'll probably exit the year somewhere close to 1/3 
of our shipments on a run rate basis. We'll be including those 
--
 
including
 
that technology. Obviously, not all of that would be on 8960. It takes a while 
for the OEMs to transition off of what they're using today. And in many 
cases, it's a 2
-
chip solution on to those products. But that's what you're 
seeing in the mix.

Just one clarification. On that last question, Steve, do you say 1/3 of your 
QCT volume exiting this year could be LTE? Is that what you were saying? I 
just want to 
be clear on that. And then my other question is for Bill. It's 
actually on the Licensing business and the ASP. You had 
--
 
so you've seen 
stronger volume growth in emerging markets, but you're also taking up 
ASPs as well. So I would have thought there's som
e geographic negative mix 
shift in there that's also being offset. So were you seeing people upgrade to 
higher price points? Is that what you're seeing in the industry right now? 
How sustainable is that? And then I guess a broader question on ASPs is it 
lo
oks like you're going to see 2 years now, if your guidance comes through, 
in terms of ASPs in your Licensing business rising. I'm just wondering how 
should we think about that in the context of a $100 smartphone coming 
down in the market and this very aggr
essive move down market we're 
having amidst a very competitive smartphone market that still exists out 
there. So are we close to ASPs, would you say, an absolute level, whether 
it's $205, $210, peaking, goes up, how see it?
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
This is Derek. L
et me go ahead and take this. I think if you look at the first 
quarter that we just reported, we actually saw higher ASPs pretty much 
across all the emerging regions. And so as we've kind of predicted and 
talked about previously, we do continue to see thes
e positive trends that will 
drive ASPs up in emerging regions. We're also seeing relative stability in the 
developed markets as well, and that helped drive the ASP this quarter. As 
we look at Q2, I think we're expecting to see the ASP relatively flat quart
er
-
over
-
quarter. And that's despite some trends that would normally push it 
down, including more volume coming from emerging markets and a higher 
percentage of the units expected to come from dongles and maybe even 
some FX unfavorability. And despite that,
 
we think there's 
--
 
we expect that 
there are some positive trends that are going to push the 
--
 
against that and 
create stability. In the back half of the year, I think we're expecting that 
we're going to see even more volume from emerging regions, and so
 
there 
will be some downward pressure on the overall ASP. But the long
-
term 
trend, as we've said, we believe are very positive, and our 
--
 
or really, as 
these prices come down into the $100 mark, are really going to help 
accelerate even further 2G to 3G mi
gration in the emerging regions.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
And Kulbinder, this is Steve. Just 
--
 
that was a correct interpretation. We will 
--
 
it's really the exit 
--
 
how we exit the year. Again, not all of that will be 
8960. It will be across a family of chips
ets.

So you gave us a little bit of data on the 
--
 
what was driving the EPS 
increase for the Q2 guidance. But regarding the raise in the 
annual 
guidance, in the past you've given us some color on how much of the change 
in the outlook to revenues in particular is coming from QCT versus QTL. I 
was wondering if you can give us any sort of feelings for the relative 
contributors of both of those
 
businesses to the $700 million increase in your 
guidance range that you've given us. And then just very briefly, what are 
you guys going to be doing with the $22 billion in cash and $6.1 billion 
onshore, which I think is at least $1 billion above your tar
get of $5 billion?
 
William E. Keitel
 
So Stacy, on the raise for the year, we raised revenue approximately $700 
million. The majority of that was QCT in a range of about $0.5 billion and 
then you've got a couple hundred million that is driven by QTL. On the
 
cash, 
the $22 billion of cash, I mean, first of all, on the domestic side, $6 billion of 
domestic, I think you've heard us say in the past much less than $5 billion of 
liquidity, and we'll probably get a little nervous here. So we think it's an 
appropriat
e level of liquidity for our business. But we 
--
 
having said that 
--
 
we're a bit maybe in a little excess position now. So we'll see. We have a 
10b5
-
1 on file, and we'll just see if that executes at all. On the offshore, the 
state of our tax, corporate tax
es today, obviously there's a strong incentive 
not to bring that back into the U.S. Hopefully, we'll get a little more sensible 
on that in the next year or so to help the overall U.S. economy. But I think 
our mission, as long as the tax code stays as it is
, is to keep that cash 
offshore and be patient looking for opportunities to get back into the 
business.

Bill, I just wanted to come back around to your economic assumpt
ions in the 
new guidance. I know last time you gave it to us or since last time you gave 
it to us, the economic forecasts have been coming down a little bit. So I 
wonder if you can just give us some color around what your own 
assumptions have done with res
pect to the global economy. And then, 
Steve, I just wonder on the 8930 that you guys mentioned, you might be 
--
 
you're going to be sampling. Can you some idea of what sort of device ASP 
that kind of a chip would correspond to? And then I hope it's understa
ndable 
what kind of capabilities it has as well. I mean, how close is it to the 8960? 
And then finally, in CES, Huawei came out and announced that they're going 
to make their own chips. I know you guys are a supplier there. Can you give 
us any color on you
r discussions with them? I mean, how does the fact that 
they're planning to make their own APs impact your relationship with them? 
Does it really materially change? How many chips are you shipping in there?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Rod, it's Bill. On the macroeco
nomic front, in November when we introduced 
our guidance for fiscal '12, we thought the macro, the world GDP growth 
would be in a range of about 3.5%, 3.6%. Today, as I'm sure everybody has 
kind of a similar view, Europe has deteriorated a bit. The U.S., I
 
think, in our 
view, has partially offset that. And 
--
 
but our view today, this plan that we 
have is based on approximately 3.3% GDP growth in 2012. The 
--
 
obviously, 
the unit projection we gave you is maybe call it bucking that trend. As I said, 
the main 
driver to the increase in total units was China, which we really 
think is 
--
 
seems to be have entered into quite an inflection point on 3G, 4G 
smartphones. We did bring down the Europe component of that. But overall, 
the China strength, and a bit in Latin 
America as well, was such that we felt 
it was appropriate to raise that estimate a bit for the year.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
And Rod, this is Steve. The 8930 is really a replacement of the 8x55 and the 
7x27A tier of device, which is really kind of 
mid
-
tier to lower mid
-
tier 
smartphone product. If you look at how it's configured in the marketplace, it 
has a fairly wide band in terms of ASPs in terms of device. But it really is the 
LTE
-
enabled feature phone replacement kind of at the mid
-
tier and belo
w. 
With respect to customers announcing plans to do their own chips, we've 
dealt with that, I think, over the last probably 12, 15 years. Typically, what 
our experience has been is that it's difficult, really, to keep up in terms of 
investing across as man
y technologies as are required to be successful kind 
of long term or to be a real big concern for us as a business, but it's 
obviously an area that we watch. But we really think that it's very much a 
systems game across a number of technologies, and it's q
uite difficult, I 
think, to get that scale if you're only supplying yourself. But that's been our 
view for a long time, and it seems to have been the case and we don't think 
it's going to change.

Steve, maybe perhaps along those lines, are there any indications that it's 
getting a little bit more difficult, expensive for the 2 largest smartphone 
makers to kind of continue their own developments to only sell to
 
themselves? How might that change this year? Any inclination that might be 
helpful? And then separately, as we look at the tablet market and how that 
evolves, perhaps your thoughts on how you might have recalibrated the unit 
assumptions for this year and 
how we might see the split between mobile 
and Wi
-
Fi
-
only devices.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Sure. So I don't know if 
--
 
I think our comments or my previous comments 
apply to just about any account really. Today, if you look at the speed at 
which technology is c
hanging, it's actually accelerating, both in the modem 
as well as the AP side. So I think it's becoming quite difficult to invest as 
much as you would need to and at the rate you would need to in order to do 
that. I think our 8960 and S4 traction is probab
ly a good proof point for 
what we believe there. In terms of the tablet market, I think in general, the 
tablet market obviously has been really dominated by one player by and 
large. We continue to be bullish long term on that market. In fact, we look at 
it
 
as a good means for us to transition into what has traditionally been the 
computing space. As we do that, we think the importance of having multiple 
technology connectivity as well as wide area connectivity in 3G and 4G 
modems becomes more important becau
se by and large, those ecosystems 
that are going to be enabled over the next several years are going to 
demand more cloud connectivity and more 
--
 
the OS itself and the services 
that are being supplied by these tablets tend to assume that you're 
connected 
all the time. We think that's a good environment for us to be 
delivering chipsets into.

One on the Licensing side and then one, Steve, for you in QCT. On t
he 
Licensing side, 16% growth is your midpoint this year. I mean, could you 
give us some of the assumptions behind that? I know we're coming off a 
year where smartphone growth was about 60%, so it seems like there's a 
pretty big gap there. I know it's not 
apples
-
to
-
apples but still it's a large 
delta. And then, Steve, if you could help us a little bit on the attach rate for 
Snapdragon and what you think we will see over the course of 2012, that 
would be very helpful.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Yes, this is Bill. On 
your 
--
 
that 16% growth on units, 3G, 4G units, for 
calendar '12, I think your point is, if I understand correctly, it's a bit of a 
decrease from the growth that we think we saw in calendar 2011. The 
--
 
obviously, in our view, the macro economy is 
--
 
a dep
ressant on that 
growth, concentrated in a few regions, notably Europe. So that's one of the 
reasons, I think, that, that growth is a bit lower. And then, two, just in a 
number of markets, the smartphone penetration has picked up markedly, 
whereas in anothe
r 
--
 
a number of other regions, it's really just beginning, 
China being one example. So I think we're a bit 
--
 
in a bit of a transition now 
where a number of markets smartphone penetration has gone quite high 
and now it's into a healthy replacement and upg
rade cycle, whereas more of 
the emerging world is just beginning to get into a smartphone transition.
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
And in terms of Snapdragon projections moving forward 
--
 
I'll try to stay 
away from a particular number, but the trend of smartphone growth
 
as well 
as the ability for us to add new accounts with these integrated chipsets, we 
think, continues. It's had a little bit of an advantage because in the past, 
because our 6K products, future phone products, have been transitioning to 
smartphones rapidl
y, that will continue. However, those 
--
 
the raw number 
of those 6K units now are getting smaller in terms of the overall mix. But 
still, we expect it to grow faster than the overall device market, just 
consistent with Bill's comments about smartphones con
tinuing to grow.

Paul, a question for you on the market dynamics for LTE in the next version 
of HSPA at 42
-
2 here. Specifically, can you talk 
about operator road maps 
you're seeing for both technologies, especially in Europe and Asia where LTE 
is not fully licensed? Do you think we should expect HSPA will hold 
--
 
hang 
on longer in those geographies? And then drilling down on some of the LTE 
chip
 
commentary you just gave. Do you anticipate the consumer demand 
side for LTE phones will match those 1/3 of chip shipment commentary 
you're giving? Or is it the case of OEMs trying to stay ahead of the curve, 
shipping phones with LTE in the markets where 
there's no LTE there?
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
If you look at the rollouts of LTE around the world, I mean, it's definitely 
mixed, obviously U.S. driving and the competition between the operators 
driving here. But also, Japan is 
--
 
we're seeing some aggression there
 
as 
well. India and China, obviously we're still waiting, in our case, that we used 
to get the spectrum for LTE in India. I mean, that will happen. There's just 
not enough 3G spectrum around. Operators there, I think, will continue to 
upgrade their 3G netw
orks pretty aggressively anyways. But 
--
 
then we'll 
see the 
--
 
then we'll finally see LTE roll out. China, it's a little bit of 
anybody's guess how it's going to roll out. Obviously, we'll see trials, 
probably large
-
scale trials. But then the question is, 
is it really a commercial 
--
 
is it going to be commercial? And in terms of demand for LTE going into 
the phones, I do think that we'll see increasingly that leading
-
edge 
smartphones will have LTE in it, and we've made it easy for people to have 
LTE in it w
ith the way that we've integrated the technology into our chipsets. 
So yes, I do think, in some cases, they'll get sold into places where there 
isn't an LTE network necessarily, although probably those phones will come 
through other channels besides the op
erator channel. I don't really see the 
operators necessarily driving LTE phones unless they have a LTE network 
deployment coming up soon.

This concludes the question

answer portion of today's conference. Dr. 
Jacobs, do you have any closing rem
arks before adjourning the call?
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
Yes, thanks. I'm really pleased with the quarter, and I have to say the year 
looks pretty good going forward. And that's really because all of our growth 
drivers are really continuing to generate great result
s for us. Feeling good 
about the investments we're making for these opportunities that we see 
ahead of us, and I think 8960 is just a great example of our ability to 
execute because we're able to aggressively push the pace of technology in a 
lot of areas, 
microprocessor, graphics, connectivity, modem, location and, 
obviously, going to the 28
-
nanometer process node. And then we take that 
lead and we tier it, as we've done 
--
 
as our strategy in the past. So really, to 
kind of cement that lead. The other thing
 
I'm very happy, although it wasn't 
reflected in this quarter's results, really happy to conclude the sale of the 
FLO spectrum to AT&T. And obviously, we wish FLO had been successful, but 
what we've been able to do with it is really pivot that spectrum to 
supplemental downlink technology and also drive broadcast video over LTE 
with it. So that's a pretty cool thing. And then in addition to supplemental 
downlink, we're working on a bunch of other really great technologies in the 
labs to help the operators de
al with the continued growth in demand for 
data. So excited about our execution, excited about what's in front of us. 
And thanks, everybody, for being on the call, and I hope that we'll get the 
chance to see many of you in person at Mobile World Congress i
n Barcelona. 
Thanks a lot.

2/6/20,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report 
another successful quarter driven by strong year
-
over
-
year growth in both 
our chipset and licensing businesses. Revenue was up 28%, and non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share was up 16% 
compared to a year ago. Adoption of 3G and 
3G/4G technologies continues around the world, and our licensees report 
stronger
-
than
-
expected total reported device sales driven by strength in 
high
-
end smartphones.
 
Looking forward, we're now forecasting approxi
mately 14% growth of 3G/4G 
device shipments in calendar 2012, reflecting a slightly more cautious 
outlook on the macroeconomic environment. We now also expect the profile 
of the calendar year to be more back
-
end loaded as new devices are 
launched for the h
oliday season.
 
Now although our outlook for semiconductor volumes in the fiscal fourth 
quarter has been reduced from our prior expectations, we are ramping our 
supply of 28 nanometer chipsets. We expect this ramp, along with new 
devices launched for the ho
liday season, to result in a strong December 
quarter for our semiconductor business.
 
During the third fiscal quarter and up through today, we returned 
approximately $1.4 billion in capital to stockholders. This includes 
approximately $1 billion in stock re
purchases. We believe that the 
combination of dividends and stock repurchases are effective means to 
increase our stockholders' returns and build additional stockholder value.
 
In QCT, we're continuing to see strong demand for our new Snapdragon S4, 
and oth
er 28 nanometer chipsets, and that demand continues to exceed our 
available supply. We will continue to ramp capacity in the upcoming quarters 
consistent with our prior expectation. However, the constraints on 28 
nanometer supply are continuing to limit ou
r potential revenue upside this 
fiscal year.
 
QCT continues to drive technology and product leadership, including the 
sampling of 802.11ac solutions for mobile computing and networking 
products and several new chipsets in the Snapdragon S4 family.
 
QTL conti
nues to grow and expand its base of licensees, and we now have 
over 215 CDMA licensees, including our first major Brazilian licensee, 
Digibras Group. We now also have more than 25 royalty
-
bearing, single
-
mode OFDMA licensing 
--
 
licensees. And as with 3G, w
e believe that our 4G 
portfolio is the most widely licensed in the industry.
 
On the spectrum front, Bharti Airtel, a leading wireless 
--
 
Indian wireless 
operator, acquired a 49% interest in our Indian BWA entities. One of our key 
objectives from the outset
 
of our investment has been to include a strong 
Indian operator as our partner in the Indian venture with the scale, 
experiences and resources to deploy and operate an LTE TDD network. 
We're very pleased to have Bharti's participation and support in this e
ffort.
 
Also related to spectrum, the European CEPT reached an initial conclusion, 
which is subject to final approval, to harmonize the L
-
Band for supplemental 
downlink. This is the same spectrum that we own in the U.K. This is an 
important milestone, and i
t opens up the potential to have our carrier 
aggregation technology deployed widely across Europe.
 
With respect to QMT, we're now focusing on licensing our next
-
generation 
mirasol display technology and will directly commercialize only certain 
mirasol prod
ucts. We believe that this strategy will better align our updated 
roadmap with the addressable opportunities.
 
Looking forward, we believe that our long
-
term growth drivers remain intact. 
Smartphone demand continues to grow. Gartner estimates that 
approxima
tely 145 million smartphones were shipped in the first calendar 
quarter of this year, representing 45% growth year

year. In China 
alone, they estimate that approximately 33 million smartphones were 
shipped, representing greater than 160% year

yea
r growth. This year, 
Gartner estimates that China will become the largest consumer of 
smartphone. And just to give you some idea of the interest, I recently 
attended China Telecom's 3G handset fair where it was reported that more 
than 20,000 industry playe
rs and 200,000 consumers attended. And at that 
event, China Telecom encouraged their manufacturers to launch a full range 
of smartphones from flagship devices through all of the tiers.
 
The overall growth of 3G remains strong especially in emerging regions.
 
According to Wireless Intelligence, at the end of June, of the 1.8 billion 3G 
connections globally, there were greater than 900 million 3G connections in 
emerging regions, representing a 42% growth year
-
over
-
year. We believe 
the burgeoning opportunity bey
ond handsets is front of us 
--
 
is in front of us 
and, moving forward, will be driven by the growth in 3G/4G connectivity 
from tablets, mobile PCs, machine
-
to
-
machine and other devices. We're 
encouraged by developments in the computing space with Microsoft'
s 
support behind the ecosystem for Windows RT with general availability 
expected in October.
 
On the legal front, I wanted to give you an update on our ongoing SEC and 
DOJ investigations. As we noted in our 10
-
Q, which was filed today, we have 
discovered an
d, as part of our ongoing cooperation with these investigations, 
have informed the SEC and DOJ of instances in which special hiring 
consideration, gifts or other benefits were provided to several individuals 
associated with certain Chinese state
-
owned comp
anies or agencies. Based 
on the facts currently known, we believe that the monetary value of these 
benefits in aggregate to be less than $250,000, excluding employment 
compensation. We're continuing to investigate the circumstances related to 
providing the
se benefits and are attempting to identify when 
--
 
whether any 
other benefits were provided. We're continuing to cooperate with these 
investigations, but we are unable to predict their outcome. Given the 
ongoing nature of the investigations, we'll have no 
further comments beyond 
the foregoing and what's contained in our Form 10
-
Q.
 
So to conclude, we've completed another solid quarter at Qualcomm. And 
despite some challenging near
-
term market dynamics and supply 
constraints, we're very pleased to see the con
tinued growth of 3G and 
3G/4G multimode smartphones, as well as new mobile computing devices. 
We're looking forward to an exciting portfolio of device launches for the 
holiday season and are anticipating a strong December quarter on the 
semiconductor front
 
and believe that we are well positioned for the 
opportunities ahead. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Steve 
Mollenkopf.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to first congratulate 
Cristiano Amon and 
Dr. Murthy Renduchintala on their new roles as co
-
presidents of Qualcomm mobile and computing products. Their leadership 
has been instrumental in our success to date, and I look forward to working 
with them in their expanded roles. Dr. Craig Barratt will c
ontinue as 
President of QCA, focusing on connectivity and networking products, and Jim 
Lederer will continue in his current General Manager role, leading the sport 
organizations across the semiconductor business.
 
QCT shipped 141 million MSMs this quarter, 
up 18% year
-
over
-
year but 
below our prior expectations. Our fiscal third quarter MSM shipments and 
our outlook for the fourth quarter have been impacted by a number of 
factors, including a near
-
term reduction in the 3G/4G inventory channel, 
which we believ
e reflects a pause and a re
-
profiling of demand prior to the 
launch of some key flagship devices for the holiday season. Additionally, we 
have seen some impact from customer mix shifts and competitive pressures 
in the low tiers, as well as a slowdown in th
e industry demand for USB 
dongles, particularly in Europe.
 
We continue to be supplies constrained on our 28 nanometer products but 
are ramping supply with multiple foundries in the September quarter and 
again into the December quarter consistent with our p
rior expectations. We 
currently project that we'll be able to closely match supply with demand as 
we exit the calendar year.
 
The reduced demand profile and ongoing 28 nanometer supply constraints, 
as well as our increased efforts to bring additional 28 nan
ometer capacity 
online and continue investments in our QRD and mobile computing programs 
in advance of the opportunities ahead are driving lower operating margins in 
the fiscal third and fourth quarters versus historical norms.
 
Looking ahead, we anticipate
 
a strong lineup of device launches leading into 
the holiday season and believe QCT is well positioned for the December 
quarter, particularly with the increasing supply of industry
-
leading chipsets 
for high
-
tier devices.
 
Over 15 devices based on our S4 MSM
8960 28 nanometer chipsets have 
launched to date, including the Samsung GALAXY S III, the HTC One S and 
One X, LG Optimus LTE2, Pantech Vega Racer 2 and Sony Xperia SX. There 
are now more than 420 announced Snapdragon
-
based devices with over 400 
more in de
sign, including 175 S4 designs. Third
-
party reviews and 
benchmarks again reinforced our product leadership this quarter, confirming 
that the Snapdragon MSM8960 outperforms quad
-
core CPUs
-
based handsets 
by using a complete multi
-
core system with our custom 
GPU, DSP and dual
-
Krait CPU cores. We also sampled 3 new S4 chips this quarter, including the 
APQ8064 and the MSM8x30. The APQ8064 includes 4 Krait CPUs. It is the 
first to use our new Adreno 320 GPU and will extend the performance 
expectations we recently
 
established with the MSM8960. The MSM8x30 
integrates a multi
-
mode LG or 3G LTE and is designed to enable 3G/4G 
smartphones at high
-
volume price points globally.
 
Our modem leadership also continues to be a differentiator for design wins in 
modem plus AP sm
artphones, in tablets, modules and WiFi personal 
hotspots, including over 90 designs in process based on our 28 nanometer 
3G/4G LTE MDM9x15 modem. While many companies are still 
commercializing their first LTE products, we have already announced our 
third
-
generation LTE chipsets and will continue investing in our modem road 
map to maintain our leadership.
 
Our connectivity solutions, which include WiFi, GPS, GLONASS, Bluetooth 
and FM, continue to be used in a vast majority of our customers' designs on 
the S4
. Our new
-
generation 802.11ac solutions are being designed into 
smartphones, tablets, computers and networking products and align with the 
WiFi industry's certifications timeline to enable 802.11ac interoperable 
products in market by early 2013.
 
In emergin
g regions, our QRD program, which provides turnkey designs for 
affordable smartphones, continues to expand rapidly. We continue to grow 
our QRD road map with differentiated technology, including our new 
Snapdragon 8x25 1.2 gigahertz dual
-
core chipset, whic
h began shipping 
commercially in July, only 2 months after first sampling. We are engaged 
with over 40 OEMs, many of which are now transitioning their platforms 
from 2G to 3G, and these OEMs have announced approximately 50 devices 
based on our chipsets for
 
China and other emerging countries. In addition to 
the announced devices, we currently have 100 new QRD
-
based smartphone 
designs in the pipeline.
 
We also continue to invest in mobile computing and are pleased to see the 
momentum building around the new AR
M
-
based Windows platform. As the 
only chipset provider supporting Windows on both PCs and phones sold 
commercially, we look forward to the availability of both Windows 8 and 
Windows Phone 8 this fall.
 
Looking ahead, while we are forecasting sequentially lo
wer MSM shipments 
based on midpoints in the September quarter consistent with the pause and 
re
-
profiling of demand, we expect a strong December quarter as new high
-
tier smartphone devices launch for the holidays and we have an improved 
supply of 28 nanomet
er products.
 
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have another good 
quarter. Compared to last year, our fiscal third quarter revenues were up 
28% to $4.6 billion, non
-
GAAP operating income was up 23% to $1.7 billion 
and non
-
GAAP earnings per share was up 16% to $0.85 per share.
 
As both Paul and Steve mentioned, our results this quarter and updated 
fiscal 2012 guidance reflect estimated reduction
s in the 3G/4G inventory 
channel in the June and September quarters, as well as our expectation that 
a greater percentage of calendar year volume will be sold in the December 
quarter as new, high
-
tier devices launch for the holidays.
 
We continue to expect 
this to drive a strong December quarter for our 
chipset business.
 
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were up 31% year
-
over
-
year to $47.8 billion and above the high end of our prior guidance range, 
driven by strong smartphone demand. We es
timate that approximately 206 
million to 211 million 3G/4G
-
based devices were shipped by our licensees in 
the March quarter at an average selling price of approximately $226 to 
$232, up approximately $15 sequentially, reflecting higher average selling 
pric
es in multiple regions, particularly Europe and developed regions in Asia, 
and combined with lower mix of data modems.
 
QCT shipped 141 million MSMs, up 18% year
-
over
-
year but below our 
expectations at the outset of the quarter for the reasons Steve just 
ex
plained.
 
During the third fiscal quarter and the first few weeks of this current quarter, 
we returned approximately $1.4 billion of capital to our stockholders, 
including dividends paid of $429 million and approximately $990 million for 
stock repurchases.
 
Now turning to our guidance. We are modifying our estimate of global 
3G/4G
-
based device shipments for calendar year 2012, reflecting 
economists' more cautious view on the 2012 world economy. We now 
estimate that between 875 million and 935 million 3G/4G
-
ba
sed devices will 
ship in calendar year 2012, up approximately 14% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint.
 
We expect the second half profile to be similar to calendar year 2011, which 
had muted growth of 3G/4G devices in the September quarter and very 
strong growth
 
in the December quarter.
 
We estimate that the average selling price of 3G/4G
-
based devices for fiscal 
2012 will be approximately $216 to $222. The $219 midpoint is $7 above 
our prior $212 midpoint estimate primarily driven by higher average selling 
prices
 
in multiple regions, including an increased mix of smartphone 
shipments, particularly at the high tier.
 
We expect fiscal 2012 revenues to be in the range of approximately $18.7 
billion to $19.1 billion, up approximately 26% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint.
 
We anticipate fiscal 2012 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in 
the range of $3.61 to $3.67, up approximately 14% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint.
 
In QCT, we estimate operating margins to be approximately 18% to 19% for 
the fiscal year, lower by approximate
ly 100 basis points than our prior 
estimate, and reflecting reduced expectations for MSM volumes driven 
primarily by lower expected 3G/4G channel inventory and a re
-
profiling of 
demand prior to new devices being launched for the holiday season. We 
expect t
he combination of non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow 
approximately 24% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We estimate our fiscal 2012 tax rate to be approximately 20% for both GAAP 
and non
-
GAAP and a bit higher than our prior estimates driven by the mix of 
our foreign and
 
domestic earnings.
 
Specific to the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range 
of approximately $4.45 billion to $4.85 billion, up approximately 13% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be 
approxima
tely $0.78 to $0.84, up approximately 1% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint.
 
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device 
sales of approximately $43.5 billion to $47.5 billion in the September quarter 
for shipments they made in t
he June quarter and up approximately 16% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We anticipate shipments of approximately 134 million to 142 million MSM 
units during the September quarter with revenue per MSM higher 
sequentially, reflecting favorable product mix, 
including lower sequential 
shipments of shipments [ph] for data modems and increased volume of 28 
nanometer products.
 
We estimate that the 3G/4G inventory channel declined in the June quarter, 
and our guidance includes an additional bleed of channel invent
ory in the 
September quarter, ahead of new device launches for the holidays. We 
estimate the channel inventory will exit the fiscal year at or slightly below 
the low end of the 13
-
 
to 18
-
week normal range.
 
We expect QCT's operating margin to be approximate
ly 14% in the fourth 
fiscal quarter, approximately 500 basis points below the midpoint of our 
prior outlook and driven primarily by the expected contraction of 3G/4G 
channel inventory and re
-
profiling of demand prior to new devices launching 
for the holida
y season.
 
We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses 
combined will increase sequentially approximately 11%, reflecting continued 
QCT investments in 28 nanometer, QRD products and mobile computing.
 
That concludes my comments. I will 
now turn the call back to Warren 
Kneeshaw.

Bill, just 2 questions for me. One, just on the mirasol going to a licensing 
model, could you remind us what kind of impact was 
--
 
mirasol might have 
had to earnings this year and how that business model might change? And 
then just on a higher lev
el on the royalty side, much better
-
than
-
expected 
QTL ASPs, but there's certain smartphones that are dominating the high end 
of the market. So with that coming more in the holiday season, would you 
expect us to see ASPs drop maybe for the next 2 quarters a
nd recover again 
into the March quarter given QTL's reported quarter arrears [ph]? I'm just 
trying to get a feel for the new cadence of ASPs as they might be tied to 
certain high
-
end smartphone launches.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure, Mike. On mirasol, we did ann
ounce today a shift in our focus, a bit 
more of a licensing focus number one. And number two, commercialization. 
We're going to be focused on certain mirasol products. The impact for the 
year, this fiscal year, will be relatively muted since we're largely 
through the 
year. But we do expect some changes to be taking effect for fiscal '13. On 
the royalty side, yes, we 
--
 
Mike, we do expect quite a strong December 
quarter for the QCT business, and we expect a very large increase in the 
overall shipments of 3G/
4G devices. And that will then 
--
 
should extend then 
to a strong second fiscal quarter for the QTL business. On the ASP front, I 
think it's always prudent to be cautious on ASPs rising. We do 
--
 
but I think 
a reasonable expectation is low single
-
digit decr
ease on an annual basis.
 
Operator
 
Sam Weil [ph] with the Bank of Montreal.
 
Unknown Analyst
 
Just getting back to the chip business. I think you said ASPs went up and 
they're expected to go up again next quarter. Just looking at the 
profitability 
there, obviously the volumes hurt, but it looks to me, by my calculations, we 
had another tick down in gross margin. So I'm just curious, what would be 
causing the gross margin pressure still than just competition? And then you 
did mention 28
 
nanometer helping the ASP. I'm curious both on ASP and 
gross margin as we get into Q3 and really calendar Q4 when the volumes 
are fully there. How should that impact both ASP and gross margin? And 
how much of that will be passed through the model? And how
 
much will be 
used to maybe accelerate the QRD program? So if you could help us talk 
about the balance between the profitability and growth as we transition to 
28 nanometer.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure. I'll take stab at it here, but others might want to chime 
in. On the chip 
ASPs, yes, we do expect a sequential increase from Q3 to Q4. There is, of 
course, pressure on the gross margins. We've been seeing that now for 
some time. It's consistent 
--
 
largely consistent with our expectations. No 
real surprises there.
 
But we've added into the business mix what has 
traditionally been lower gross margin products, number one. Number two, as 
we're going more in 
--
 
more and more into emerging markets, it does have 
a lower cost profile and price profile. So that puts pressur
e on it. But, I 
mean, aside from the supply shortages and channel inventory corrections, 
we've been able to sustain still a pretty rich operating margin in this 
environment of pressure on the gross margins. The 28 nanometer, I think, 
fits much into that fo
ld. I won't comment directly on the gross margin of 28 
nanometer, but I think you're aware we have stated in the past that we have 
been pricing pretty aggressively. But nonetheless, these are very rich 
products, and we think we're quite a distance ahead of
 
the competition as 
well. So I do think it will be a nice positive to our business as we ramp 28 
nanometer here.

Steve, on the 28 nanometer, can you talk a litt
le bit about how you see 
demand in the current quarter? You've talked about hitting 1/3 of volume by 
September. Is that still feasible? In terms of the guide down sequentially, is 
this 
--
 
a lot of this 
--
 
have you seen cuts in the 45
-
nanometer demand 
trend
s as well? And then are you bringing a second source on for 
--
 
in terms 
of meeting the demand as you get into the fourth quarter? And are you 
happy with the yields that you're seeing on that second source at this point?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Brian, yes, it'
s Steve. The 28 nanometer right now, as I said, we're supply 
limited. So it's 
--
 
and it's going quite well in terms of bringing up additional 
sources. We actually have 4 sources that we're now bringing up. If you track 
through the calendar year, we're enga
ged with all of them now. And it's 
going the way that we had thought. You had 
--
 
you talked a little bit about 
the 45
-
nanometer products and such, and I think what you're seeing a bit of 
is a little less of the backfill that we would have expected. And I t
hink that's 
consistent with what we were talking about, the re
-
profiling of demand. 
That's really a little bit less of the backfill and a little bit more waiting for the 
new products to come out. So we're just working very hard to try to get 
those products
 
out the door.
 
Brian T. Modoff

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
So in terms of talking through the 
--
 
just talking about a more positive 
December quarter, some of this is you're getting demand. People want the 
28 nanometer. So the push in demand is to
 
that quarter is what you're 
saying?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
That's right. You 
--
 
at the same time, you're 
--
 
we have a significant demand 
for the 28
-
nanometer products. And as you get into the December quarter, 
you now have a tier of products on 28 nanometer
, which, I think, is a big 
advantage for our portfolio. And they're moving forward. And you're 
essentially in a situation where demand is increasing and supply is 
increasing, and we're trying to match those 2 ramps. And it's 
--
 
we're just in 
execution mode
 
getting through that right now and engaged with 4 fabs in 
order to do that.
 
Operator
 
Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
 
Ehud Gelblum

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
A couple of questions. First, Steve, in the past, you've given us a sense of 
the growth
 
in Snapdragon. I was wondering if you'd do it again in terms of 
however you look at it, quarter
-
over
-
quarter, year
-
over
-
year, half
-
over
-
half, 
whatever you can give us in terms of what the Snapdragon growth is. And 
Bill, on the ASP jump from the $214 to $2
29 in the March quarter, it seems 
relatively 
--
 
I mean, that's a large jump. Can at least some of that 
--
 
and 
obviously, you said that 
--
 
I heard the narrative that you said, and it makes 
sense that smartphones are growing. But could some of that be explai
ned by 
higher tablets that are going in there because they go in at the full ASP as 
opposed to at the truncated ASP? I'm just wondering just if 
--
 
any 
granularity you have, an explanation of that large jump and what we should 
do with that going forward? An
d then when you were talking about this year 
unfolding similar to last year with a more muted September on the QCT unit 
side and a stronger December, last year, we went from 127 million in 
September to 156 million in December. So on absolute value terms, 3
0 
units. This year, we're going be somewhere in the, by your guidance, mid
-
 
to high 130s, probably high 130s, maybe around 140. Should we be looking 
again at the same 30 million uptick as we look into December? Or should we 
be looking at higher because it'
s just a bigger market and a bigger year?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Ehud, it's 
--
 
this is Steve. Your first question was about growth in 
Snapdragon. Snapdragon's a big portion of our shipments now. And if you 
look at the year
-
over
-
year, it's probably in the hig
h 20s in terms of percent 
growth. And that includes 
--
 
that's if I looked at the quarter we just were 
reporting on now. That includes the fact that a number of the Snapdragon 
products are, of course, 28
-
nanometer products and they're a bit supply
-
constrain
ed today. So we would have even seen higher growth than that 
year
-
over
-
year. So we're quite pleased with how the Snapdragon product 
line is ramping throughout the year, so. And I'll 
--
 
I think the second part is 
really more Bill could perhaps take.
 
Derek K
. Aberle
 
Ehud, let me 
--
 
this is Derek. Let me jump in on the ASP. I think actually, 
the increase quarter
-
over
-
quarter on the ASP was pretty broad based. Just 
generally stronger ASPs across both emerging and developed regions. The 
tablet numbers, although 
they tend to go up and down with the market, 
have remained relatively constant in terms of a percentage of total units. 
And so although again, we saw strength across pretty much all products and 
geographies, it wasn't driven by an increase in the percentag
e of tablets as 
compared to total units.
 
William E. Keitel
 
And Ehud, Bill. On your last question, the profile for the year, for 2011, 
calendar 2011, our estimate is about 24% of the total devices that year 
were shipped in the September quarter. And then th
ere was a large jump to 
approximately 30% of the total devices shipped in the December quarter. 
And that's for 2011. Our estimates for 2012 are 
--
 
based on the midpoint of 
that 
--
 
the 905 million total units is very similar to that profile that I just 
quot
ed for last year. And by the way, that's 
--
 
that information is now on our 
website if anybody wants to take a look at that.
 
Ehud Gelblum 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
If I can follow up? So should your QCT units match that? Or is it going to be 
diffe
rent because you have maybe unusually low share now with 28 
nanometers restricted and maybe proportionally higher share in December 
once your restriction is over. So maybe even more drastic than that 21 to 
30?
 
William E. Keitel
 
I think it's best I 
refrain getting too specific on the first fiscal quarter of 
2013. I'll just say that we're looking for a pretty substantial increase in 
QCT's quantity of MSMs.

Just a couple of questions. First, to clarify. With your comments on the 28 
nanometer, suffice to say it's alleviating in the December quarter, was that 
referring to the entirety of the December quarter? Or is it just for the exit 
run rate? In
 
other words, would you still see inability to meet some of the 
demand in the entirety of that quarter? And then as it pertains to your 
chipset margin, is there any reason to think that in December, chipset 
margins should not be above your typical average 
margin given the volumes 
you're expecting?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Simona, it's 
--
 
this is Steve. The supply really exits the quarter on a 
matched situation. It doesn't end 
--
 
enter the quarter that way. So at the 
beginning of the quarter, we still have a gap
 
that we need to deal with, but it 
improves throughout the quarter. We think it matches up toward the end.
 
William E. Keitel
 
And Simona, it's Bill. On the margin side, it's 
--
 
well, it's preliminary here. 
We do expect a nice, increasing QCT op margin. But 
understand, it's still 
going to be a very active quarter in terms of ramping the supply. So there's 
going to be a high level of costs supporting that. So I think it's too early to 
comment or maybe even to expect that the December quarter would be 
above our
 
averages in the past.

So then maybe just a question for Paul. In terms of looking strategically 
longer at some of your big customers who are becoming more vertically 
integrated, and obviously,
 
we had the announcement yesterday from 
Samsung are buying some of the technology and connectivity from CSR, 
now how should we think about customers like that longer term for fall 
coming in terms of your potential share of their silicon business?
 
Paul E. J

Yes. So we've had these same issues throughout the history of the company 
where internal efforts 
--
 
people try to build the silicon for their own chipsets. 
And I think the key way to combat that, as we've done all along, is to 
continue to drive the t
echnology hard. Obviously, we're driving it very 
rapidly in a number of areas now, not just the radio. It used to be just the 
radio. But now it's also processor and graphics technology. And we've seen

about how, I think the latest one I saw was on graphics, how we were really 
winning on the graphics side but, obviously also, on the computing side, 
we've had great comparisons. So the key, as I said, is drive the technology 
hard. Do people 
for their internal uses have enough scale to invest at the 
same rate that we do? And the answer is generally no. And plus, we have 
just a level of experience that we can bring to bear, and I think that, that 
strategy will continue to work as it has in the 
past.

Just a couple of questions and clarifications. I guess first on the channel 
inventory. I don't think I heard, Bill, you comment on how many weeks of 
inventory 
--
 
t
he inventory is reducing down to that below
-
13 level. So I 
don't know if you could just comment on what the change in channel 
inventory is from your point of view or the change in your expectation, I 
should say. And then also, I'm just wondering on your GD
P assumption. You 
talked to us about what you 
--
 
what GDP assumption you make underlying 
your guidance. I wonder if you could just update us on that. Then on the 
--
 
just the overall demand picture, if you could talk to us about the rate of 
deterioration. A
re you guys expecting demand, based on what you're seeing 
out there, to remain roughly where it is now? Or do you think demand is 
going to continue to deteriorate? And at what sort of rate do you think that 
might occur? And then on 28 nanometer, just one m
ore thing. Can you 
quantify at all what kind of 28
-
nanometer shortfall you're assuming in the 
fiscal Q4 guidance?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Okay, Rod. First, on channel inventory. We think we're exiting here the June 
quarter at just 
--
 
or coming in 
--
 
we exited th
e March quarter just a little bit 
above 15 weeks. We think we're exiting the June quarter at a little bit below 
15 weeks, and we think we're going to exit the September quarter at just 
below 13 weeks. So obviously, that September quarter, if that happens, 
which we obviously expect it will, would be almost a new low for at least our 
history.
 
Rod B. Hall 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
What did you think before, Bill? Did you think it was going to be around 15 
and now it's 13? Or I just wonder what 
you were expecting. Okay.
 
William E. Keitel
 
We thought it was going to be more flattish between just a little bit under 15 
to just above 15 weeks. So that's on the channel inventory. On GDP, we're 
aligned with consensus economists for 2012. And you're prob
ably aware, 
they recently downticked from about 3.2% world GDP growth to about 
3.1%. Obviously, a little bit more in the second half of the year relative to 
the first half. For 2013, I'm 
--
 
I would say we're a bit below consensus right 
now. We're a little 
more cautious than where the consensus economists are. 
But to translate that back into our estimate, our midpoint estimate of 3G/4G 
devices, so 3 months ago, our midpoint was 915 million units, and our 
updated guidance here is 905 million. That 10 million 
reduction is 
approximately a 1 percentage drop in the turnover rate, replacement rate of 
devices. We've previously been around 34%. We're just 
--
 
we're a little bit 
above 33% now. So as the economy weakens, we typically expect 
consumers to hold on to their
 
devices a little bit longer. And we think this is 
concentrated for 
--
 
our decrease here is concentrated in Europe and North 
America. On overall demand, I think we have a good sizing on it now. The 
--
 
I think historically, we've seen, on a quarterly basis,
 
we're pretty good at 
predicting MSM volume. And obviously, there's a lot of interest and focus on 
what we're going to be able to ship here all this quarter and particularly into 
December. So I feel like we have a good handle on it right now, Rod.

Just how much is

William E. Keitel
 
Oh, in the shortfall. Well, let me say this. First of all, 28 nanometer, our 
shipment estimates both for the fourth fiscal quarter and what we expect for 
the first fiscal quarter, we're essentially in line with where we were 3 months 
ago. So the QCT team i
s executing well on that aggressive ramp that we had 
talked about last time. But going out of this quarter, if we could ship all the 
demand that's in front of us for this quarter, I would just say that our 
revenue and operating margin would be materially h
igher.

I have 2 questions. First, the NREs. I think you said before they're going to 
be $200 million. Can you give an update on where it is and when would this 
be re
versed? Second, the 
--
 
on the same topic, is 
--
 
should we expect the 
OpEx intensity ratio or OpEx ratio to be relatively the same as you transition 
to smaller geometries? Or are we going to see improvement sometimes once 
you're done with the 28 nano? Those
 
are my 2 questions.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure. Tal, it's Bill. On the NRE, I think your 
--
 
I think the 200 million is 
referring to our 
--
 
the increase in R&D that we're looking at approximately 
this time of year versus where we were at the outset of the year
. I want to 
answer your question correctly because that's approximately what we're up 
in R&D outlook, current outlook for fiscal 2012 versus the outlook at the 
outset of fiscal 2012. Am I vectored correctly with it?
 
Tal Liani 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research
 
Division
 
Yes. Yes, I...
 
William E. Keitel
 
Yes, all right. Yes, the key components of that, foremost, is spending around 
28
-
nanometer products, both the 
--
 
accelerating the supply as much as we 
could, but then also, there's been expansion in the products a
nd the future 
road map for those products. That's number one. Secondly would be the 
mobile computing. We've stepped up our investments there relative to what 
we expected at the outset of the year. Thirdly would be you heard Steve talk 
a lot about how well 
we're doing on the modem. And so we have stepped 
that investment up, both 
--
 
carrier aggregation being one example. There's 
a lot of demand for that right now. And then lastly would be in QCA, the 
Atheros business. Those would be the 4 primary areas that m
ake up the 
great majority of the R&D increase this year. Steve, anything to add to that?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Well, I might say that this year is a little bit unusual in the sense that we 
pulled in some real [ph] SLA [ph] investments essentially to accelerate the 
speed at which we're going through future nodes. So this year is a little bit 
faster than you would ty
pically see because we're trying to go through the 
nodes even faster than we have done in the past. And you're seeing that in 
the OpEx this year in particular. The other aspect, just to add to the QCA 
comment, was we're seeing significant fan out in terms 
of design wins on 
our connectivity products, and we're essentially scaling up our ability to 
deliver on those design wins. Those are probably the 2 of the bigger topics 
we're having right now.
 
William E. Keitel
 
And then the last one, Tal, this was on OpEx,
 
operating expense, intensity 
and 
--
 
particularly in light of new 
--
 
as we go through new geometries from 
here. I think the key there is scale. And we're doing very well on scale. So 
we've got a good opportunity to manage our operating expense intensity, I
 
think, pretty well. But the key, I think, there is scale.
 
Tal Liani 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
So if you look at 
--
 
just to combine your 2 answers, if you look at the growth 
in OpEx this year, given that next year you have other plans and 
--
 
to drive 
different technologies, is the hike this year kind of one
-
off? Or is it going to 
be reversed? Or is this just a new level that from this point onward, it 
depend 
--
 
revenue growth will determine the margin level of the company 
unless the decline in
 
OpEx?
 
William E. Keitel
 
I think, Tal, this year, it's unusual in respect that we've ramped the 
operating expenses even though we aren't able to ship all of our customer 
demand. That's a rare case in our history where we can't ship demand. But 
going forwar
d then, the operating expense intensity, I think we've said in 
the past we expect that 
--
 
I mean, our goal is to improve it. It isn't 
--
 
I 
--
 
that isn't a guidance point for fiscal '13, but I would take it as a guidance 
point looking 3 years out. And maybe
 
Paul, I don't [indiscernible].
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
Yes, I just wanted to say also we're obviously investing a lot in QMT. We're 
looking at the opportunities to 
--
 
on that business model to reduce some of 
the expenses that we have there. And so that could have 
a pretty significant 
impact as well.

I was wondering first if you could talk a little bit about emerging markets. 
We've seen some signs of w
eakness in emerging markets in the handsets 
and in others and even some of your big customers reporting to more 
weakness there. But your own outlook seems to be pointing more weakness 
in developed markets or even where you took guidance down with more in 
d
eveloped markets than in emerging. So if you could talk about some of the 
dynamics that you're seeing between those, so that'd be helpful, and 
particularly potential impacts going forward on ASPs. I think for 
--
 
and just a 
second question, if you could jus
t maybe comment a little bit about the 
recent IP restructuring that you guys did. If you could give us a little more 
commentary on the rationale for that. And then any sort of impacts or not 
that, that may have going forward, that would be helpful.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Stacy, I'll take your first point. On the emerging market side, now we 
--
 
our 
estimates within that 915 million midpoint estimate that we shared 3 months 
ago are largely intact. So I have seen some reports here where some people 
are seein
g some surprises here and there. But overall, we feel it's holding 
fairly steady. So the 2 changes we really made in our estimates for this year 
are North America and Europe and really just a bit of an extension on the 
replacement rate that we had previous
ly been forecasting. So I think 
emerging is holding strong. And then on the 
--
 
expect on ASPs, as we said in 
the past, as we're seeing smartphones penetrating emerging markets. And 
so the ASP trends that we've been seeing on the emerging front is 
--
 
has 
be
en really quite positive to us.
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
This is Derek. Let me just take a second answer to your question on the 
corporate restructuring. So we just went through the corporate restructuring 
for a variety of reasons. I think it's something that if yo
u look kind of across 
various industries, that companies will adopt as a corporate structure 
separating certain businesses and liabilities for other regions. But also, 
obviously, a big part of this was to kind of reflect the way that we've been 
doing busin
ess for a number of years and to further protect the intellectual 
property portfolio for some of the activities of the operating businesses such 
as the chip business. And in particular, we've been working quite a bit with 
open source historically and feel 
very good about the way we've been doing 
that. But we expect that, that need will continue to increase, and this just 
kind of further protects the important intellectual property that underpins 
the licensing business from some claims or inadvertent activit
ies by others in 
the business.

I have a couple, gentlemen. I think the first is to follow up on the internal 
production. I think we've seen the pendulum shift back an
d forth between 
internal and outsourced a bit over the years. Where are we in the current 
swing? Should we expect production to go a little bit more internal perhaps 
over the course of the next few quarters or years? Then my second question 
is on the Intel
-
ASML relationship. I wonder if you had some observations on 
that of how you feel about your access to capacity looking out over a 5
-
 
to 
10
-
year period.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. I'm assuming the first question is really more about the 
vertical c
ustomers. I would say that it's really consistent with what Paul said. 
I think it's getting harder and harder to create chipsets moving forward. It's 
primarily because in order to create particularly high
-
end products, you need 
to innovate across so many d
ifferent technology vectors. And unless you're 
fairly large and you have a fairly broad technology portfolio and you're at the 
leading nodes, I think you're going to have a difficult time producing the 
type of products that you need. So in our view, it's a
ctually getting harder to 
do chipsets and so, therefore, probably more favoring of our model. With 
regards to the ASML and really the 450 move, our view essentially that the 
industry moving that direction and supporting larger wafers and really 
bringing th
e economies of scale even to further out nodes is something that 
we actually want to see happen. But it's also the expense is so large. It's 
unlikely to us that one company is going to be able to put something in place 
that will advance them and given the 
fact that it's just going to require a 
number of different companies to put the investment in. So we're happy to 
see that the industry is moving in a way that keeps Moore's Law working. 
We think that's good for our business as it is for others.

Well, I ho
pe [ph] 
--
 
I think you'll start to see some of our fab partners 
perhaps working on that, but I don't have any special information on that. 
We're still committed to the fabless model. It served us well. And with our 
size, I think we're probably a bigger pla
yer in terms of being able to 
influence it. But I don't know to the degree that our

that we will have a

I 
just want to dig into QCT margins a little bit. I understand that you said 
they're going to go down to somewhere around 14% in the near term, and I 
understand the drivers. I'm wondering how quick the snapback is. And the 
reason why I'm asking is that as QC
T margin's at a new low, I'm just trying 
to think, has there been any structural change? Once upon a time, ex 
Atheros [ph] they were at 30%. Then we talked about the mid
-
20s. Now 
we're at 14%. I'm just thinking, as we look out beyond a couple of quarters 
a
nd as you get through these ramp issues, are you really confident enough 
in this change to the competitive dynamics? That's my first question for 
Steve. On the ASP front, I understand the strength you've seen. I 
understand, Bill, also the conservatism you 
want to think about with ASPs 
going forward. But specifically, as you're going through the back half, many 
of these product launches that are discussed or speculate seem very high 
end. So doesn't the mix shift of the industry actually go 
--
 
even to calenda
r 
Q4 look very high end as well? And that would help licensing for the whole of 
next year or for a significant part of next year. What's wrong with that way 
of thinking of things?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure. Kulbinder, this is Bill. I'll take on the 14% up mar
gin question and will 
there really be a quick snapback. Yes, I feel like we just had a quick snap 
down. I was expecting 
--
 
we were expecting 19% operating margin. We lost 
a little bit of volume and we're at 14%. So I do expect a quick snapback, use 
your te
rminology. But maybe more important, we've said for sometime now 
here our goal as a company is to look over the next 5 years or so to be 
improving the QCT operating margin a bit. And the June quarter, September 
quarter, really, that's 
--
 
it's not having an
y impact. It isn't making us re
-
question our goal there. It's just a temporary phenomena that 
--
 
and we 
think we understand it pretty well.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
We also have a very significant investment in pre
-
revenue opportunity, 
which is the whole mobil
e computing space. So we certainly expect to get a 
good return on that investment going forward. But right now, currently 
weighing down the margins.
 
William E. Keitel
 
On ASPs, I think you're characterizing a positive outlook, at least for the 
next couple o
f quarters, and we don't disagree with that. But obviously, 
there's a lot of pressure within the industry to be reducing prices, both 
consumers and carriers, and OEMs putting the pressure on their suppliers. 
We're trying 
--
 
we're working hard to enable tha
t best we can. And hence, I 
always think it's just a little bit better to be not looking for ASP increases but 
just flat to modestly down, I think, is the better outlook. But I agree, we're 
looking

I think the next couple of quarters look pretty positiv

Just a few follow
-
up questions. First, back to Steve or Paul related to your 
partnerships with your foundries. I think, Steve, you s
aid that you're now 
sourcing 28 nanometer from 4 different partners. Going forward as we look 
at future geometry and process improvements, should we expect you to 
continue to be diversified at the outset across multiple partners? Or should 
we expect you to
 
return to concentrating on 1 or 2 key partners for future 
transitions, firstly? Secondly, Bill, just could you update us quickly on where 
we're at in terms of authorized buyback? I mean, you've been fairly active 
since the end of June or starting at the e
nd of June, and I just want to make 
sure that I kind of know where you're at in terms of what you still have 
authorized.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
James, this is Steve. Our product portfolio at the high tier, we tend to be on 
the leading node; on the lower tiers or the mass
-
market tiers, we may be 
one node behind. So we tend to have a broad sourcing strategy to take 
account of the fact that we're on 
leading node. And also, following nodes, we 
tend to engage with a lot of fab partners by necessity. On the leading nodes, 
I think you're not going to see a big change in our strategy moving forward 
with the exception that we do, obviously, a much better jo
b of matching our 
ramps, capacity ramps and demand ramps, as we drive leading nodes. For 
us, you're going to continue to see us really taking advantage of the fact 
that you can play the integration game at the leading nodes. And there's a 
number of differe
nt good road maps that we're seeing from the industry 
through the fab 
--
 
through fab partners, and we're going to continue to drive 
the best ones that we can find.

On the

James, on the buyback authorization, as of a day or 2 ago, it wa

just a little under $3 billion. But I think just think in terms of

it's about $3

shoot as you're ramping for foundry partners.

11/7/19,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report 
another quarter of record revenues and earnings per share driven by strong 
demand for 3G and 3G/4G multimode
-
enabled devices across both 
developed and emerging regions.
 
Consistent with this performance in March, we announced the 16% increase 
in our dividend and a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization.
 
QCT delivered another strong quarter and announced several new products, 
including our third generation of LTE chi
psets, our family of 802.11ac 
solutions and our new Snapdragon S4 Pro processor featuring our latest 
graphics technology.
 
We're seeing very strong demand for our industry
-
leading MSM8960 and 
other 28
-
nanometer products. Although the manufacturing yields ar
e 
progressing per expectation, there's a shortage of 28
-
nanometer capacity. 
And at this stage, we cannot secure enough supply to meet the increasing 
demand we're experiencing. We're working closely with our partners to bring 
additional capacity online. How
ever, the constraints on 28
-
nanometer supply 
are limiting our potential revenue upside this fiscal year.
 
Looking forward, we believe we will see significant improvement in supply in 
the December quarter, and we will continue to work this issue aggressively
.
 
Turning to QTL. Our Licensing business had another strong quarter with total 
reported device sales by our subscriber licensees driven by continued global 
adoption of smartphones and other 3G
-
connected devices. QTL continues to 
grow and expand its base of
 
licensees, and we now have over 210 CDMA 
licensees and more than 20 OFDMA licensees. As with 3G, we believe that 
our 4G portfolio is the most widely licensed in the industry.
 
On the spectrum front, we completed the sale of our 700 megahertz 
spectrum in th
e U.S. to AT&T for $1.9 billion. And separately, our Indian 
subsidiary has received its ISP license from India's Department of 
Telecommunications. I was in India last week, and I'm hopeful that the 
related spectrum will be assigned to us soon.
 
Looking forw
ard, we continue to see favorable trends across the key growth 
drivers for our business. First, smartphone demand continues to be strong 
across all key regions. According to Gartner, annual worldwide smartphone 
sales will now exceed 1 billion units in 2014
.
 
LTE is increasingly becoming a catalyst for multimode 3G/4G smartphone 
adoption. In Europe, the first LTE smartphones were sold this quarter. And 
here in U.S., Verizon plans to add 4G LTE capability to each of their 
smartphone launches during the rest of
 
2012.
 
Second, subscriber migration from 2G to 3G remains strong, particularly in 
emerging regions. According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G connections in 
emerging regions grew to approximately 850 million this quarter, 
representing close to a 45% year
-
over
-
year increase. And further, they 
reported that China recently surpassed 1 billion mobile connections, yet only 
24% of those connections were 3G if we include CDMA2000 1X, leaving a 
long runway for 3G growth in this important region.
 
2G to 3G migration in 
emerging regions continues to be driven by 
smartphones. According to Gartner, smartphone sales in emerging regions 
nearly doubled from calendar 2010 to 2011 with demand at the high end, as 
well as more affordable tiers.
 
A third growth driver for us is the 
opportunity beyond handsets, including 
3G/4G connectivity in nonhandset devices, as well as the opportunity for 
Snapdragon in the evolving computing space.
 
The computing landscape is in a transition period with the growth of tablets 
and Microsoft's plan to
 
support Windows ARM
-
based solutions. According to 
industry analysts, annual shipments of tablets and notebooks are expected 
to exceed 650 million units in 2016. We are increasing our investment in 
mobile computing ahead of revenues and are looking forward
 
to supporting 
this new opportunity.
 
Fourth key driver is the continued deployment of advanced network 
technologies. Operators are talking about significant potential increases in 
data demand on their networks, even as high as up to 1,000x, this decade 
and
 
they'll need to deploy a variety of solutions to effectively meet this 
challenge.
 
At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated several throughput
-
enhancing 
techniques operators can use, including femtocells, heterogeneous network 
optimizations for both HSPA+
 
and LTE, as well as LTE Broadcast services. 
We're continuing to invest in developing a broad set of technologies to 
increase 
--
 
to deliver increased bandwidth going forward that will provide 
cost
-
effective solutions to support increasing data demand.
 
And 
finally, we're moving toward a world where more and more devices 
around us will be connected and communicating with each other. With our 
broad Qualcomm Atheros product portfolio and our strong footprint in 
mobile, we have the opportunity to deliver a uniqu
e set of technologies for 
the expanding Internet of Everything.
 
Looking ahead, we'll be hosting our annual Uplinq conference on June 27 
and 28. As you know, Uplinq is unique in that it brings together developers, 
device manufacturers, mobile operators and 
technology providers to help 
identify opportunities across a variety of mobile operating systems. It should 
be another great event, and I look forward to seeing some of you there.
 
To conclude, we've completed another record quarter at Qualcomm. We're 
excit
ed to see the continued growth of 3G and 3G/4G multimode 
smartphones, as well as new mobile computing devices. We are increasing 
our operating expenses to facilitate additional 28
-
nanometer supply and to 
continue to position our industry
-
leading chipset so
lutions for the 
opportunities ahead.
 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone.
 
Our QCT business delivered another strong quarter. We shipped 152 million 
MSMs, up 
29% year
-
over
-
year driven by increased demand for our 
integrated smartphone solutions and advanced modems.
 
Smart 
--
 
Snapdragon shipments increased by more than 70% year
-
over
-
year, driven by growth across all price tiers from Snapdragon S1 products to 
our l
atest generation of Snapdragon S4 processors. There are now more 
than 370 announced Snapdragon
-
based devices with over 400 more in 
design, of which over 150 are S4 designs.
 
As you know, we have made significant investments in recent years to 
establish a le
adership position in LTE chipsets, and we believe we are 
succeeding. In parallel, industry adoption of LTE technology is growing 
rapidly. And with our strong portfolio of products, we are at the forefront of 
this technology transition.
 
As a result of these
 
trends and as Paul mentioned, demand for our 28
-
nanometer chipsets continues to exceed available supply. To address 28
-
nanometer demand, we are increasing our related operating expenses and 
are working closely with our fab partners to bring up additional 
capacity.
 
Within this environment, it is worth noting that our current estimates for 
total 28
-
nanometer shipments this fiscal year are largely in line with our 
prior guidance, though our forecast for the June quarter is a bit lower. Our 
increased investmen
t to bring up additional 28
-
nanometer capacity is 
expected to show results in fiscal 2013.
 
Across the rest of the business, demand trends are very strong, and we 
continue to drive our technology leadership. At Mobile World Congress in 
Barcelona, several le
ading OEMs announced their first Snapdragon S4 dual
-
core devices, including ASUS, HTC, Huawei, Lenovo and Panasonic. We also 
demonstrated our new S4 quad
-
core processor, the APQ8064 running 4 
separate HD video streams; and we announced our S4 Snapdragon 
MS
M8960 Pro, which integrates our new high performance programmable 
Adreno 320 GPU for higher
-
end mobile computing devices.
 
We announced and demonstrated our new 802.11ac Wi
-
Fi solution and 
announced a broad family of 11 AC chipsets for mobile, computing, 
co
nsumer electronics, as well as home and enterprise networking. Also, our 
new integrated connectivity solution, which includes digital Wi
-
Fi, GPS, 
Bluetooth and FM, continues to be designed in by our customers in the vast 
majority of our growing S4 pipeline
.
 
We continue to invest in our Qualcomm reference design program to support 
growth of lower
-
tier smartphones in emerging regions. Shipments into 
Chinese emerging accounts are expected to grow at a strong double
-
digit 
rate 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter while we transition customers to 7x27A. There 
have been 10 OEM designs launched on our reference programs over the 
last quarter with more to follow. We are on track to expand the reference 
design programs to include a new dual
-
core Sna
pdragon processor the 
MSM8x25. We will do this before the end of the June quarter.
 
We are increasing our investments to address incremental opportunities 
beyond traditional cellular, including mobile computing and Windows on 
Snapdragon. And looking ahead, 
our leadership position across multiple 
technologies, delivered to our customers with a tiered and expanding chipset 
road map, positions us well for smartphone and computing trends in both 
emerging and developed regions.
 
That concludes my remarks. I would 
now like to turn this call over to Bill 
Keitel.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report 
strong financial results today. Fiscal second quarter revenues were a record 
$4.9 billion. Non
-
GAAP operating income 
was a record $1.9 billion, and non
-
GAAP earnings per share was a record $1.01.
 
3G/4G device shipments, particularly smartphones, grew significantly in the 
December quarter, driving record total reported device sales of $51.7 billion, 
up 25% sequentially an
d 29% year
-
over
-
year. And comprised of 
approximately 239 million to 243 million units at an average estimated 
selling price of approximately $211 to $217.
 
QCT shipped 152 million MSM chips. And revenue per MSM was slightly 
higher sequentially, both consist
ent with our prior guidance.
 
Our GAAP results reflected a $1.2 billion gain in discontinued operations 
from the sale of our 700 megahertz spectrum to AT&T. During the quarter, 
cash and marketable securities grew by approximately $4.6 billion, on the 
streng
th of approximately $1.6 billion of free cash flow and approximately 
$1.9 billion in cash proceeds from the AT&T spectrum sale.
 
Since our second fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 is 
higher than the $0.94 midpoint of our prior guidance, I 
thought it might be 
helpful to provide an earnings walk of the $0.07 improvement.
 
First, QTL and QCT combined were better by $0.06, including $0.04 from 
QTL and $0.02 from QCT. QTL's upside reflected record 3G/4G device 
shipments and total reported device 
sales in both developed and emerging 
regions. QCT's upside reflected slightly higher MSM shipments and favorable 
product mix, partially offset by higher R&D spending.
 
Beyond the $0.06 improvement from QCT and QTL, the remaining $0.01 
resulted primarily fro
m higher investment income, largely offset by a charge 
for legal matters unique to the second fiscal quarter.
 
Turning to our updated financial guidance. We now estimate that 
approximately 787 million to 803 million 3G/4G devices were shipped during 
calenda
r 2011, an increase of approximately 21% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint. We estimate that between 885 million and 945 million 3G/4G 
devices will be shipped in calendar 2012, driven by strong smartphone 
shipments in both developed and emerging regions.
 
Usin
g the midpoint of our guidance, we estimate that in 2012, the number of 
3G/4G devices will increase approximately 15% year
-
over
-
year. We now 
estimate the average selling price of 3G/4G devices for fiscal 2012 will be 
approximately $207 to $217. The $212 mi
dpoint is above our prior $210 
midpoint estimate, driven primarily by higher average selling prices in 
developed regions.
 
We are reiterating our fiscal 2012 revenue guidance of approximately $18.7 
billion to $19.7 billion, up 28% year
-
over
-
year at the midp
oint. We are 
raising our fiscal 2012 non
-
GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of 
$3.61 to $3.76, up 15% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We estimate that QCT's operating margin will be towards the lower end of 
our prior 20% to 22% estimated range for
 
fiscal 2012, reflecting the 
increased investments that Steve mentioned. We expect the combination of 
non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expense for fiscal 2012 to grow approximately 
23% year
-
over
-
year, driven primarily by increased QCT R&D.
 
For the third quarter of fi
scal 2012, we estimate revenues to be in the range 
of approximately $4.45 billion to $4.85 billion, up approximately 28% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share for the 
third fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.83 to $0.89
, up approximately 
18% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device 
sales of approximately $43 billion to $47 billion in the June quarter for 
shipments they made in the March quarter, up 24% ye
ar
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint and down sequentially, reflecting postholiday seasonality, typical 
for this time of the year.
 
We anticipate shipments of approximately 144 million to 152 million MSM 
chips during the June quarter and expect a greater mix of chi
psets targeted 
for smartphones for both lower
-
cost emerging regions and multimode 3G 
LTE in developed regions. We estimate that the 3G/4G inventory channel will 
exit the fiscal year at the low end of the 13
-
 
to 18
-
week range, consistent 
with our prior esti
mates. We estimate that fiscal third quarter combined the 
non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will decrease sequentially, 
approximately 3%, primarily due to expense items that were unique to the 
fiscal second quarter.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn
 
the call back to Warren 
Kneeshaw.

Steve, I wonder if you could just elaborate a little more on the 8960 ramp. 
Obviously, some of your customers are worried about your ability to supply, 
given the demand's greater than the ability to supply. So how do you 
manage maybe losing some shar
e in the short term? And then also how do 
you manage maybe some double ordering that might come from customers 
trying to get that supply?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Mike, it's Steve here. A couple of things, one is we have taken approach to 
spread the supply acr
oss all of the customers as best we can, and so I think 
everybody is dealing with this issue. And obviously, it's a pretty difficult 
issue to deal with. But in the near term, some of the OEMs have been 
looking at alternative chipsets, in particular our Fus
ion 2 lineup, which can 
be substituted in some cases. But other than that, it's really a question 
where we are accelerating as best we can the supply, consistent with what I 
was saying and what Paul was saying. We're really focused very much on 
getting add
itional supply throughout the year.

Just a 2

parter on the royalty line, if I could. It looked like the calculated 
rate,I know you had said it would be down, but it looked 
like it was down 
probably 10 basis points or a little bit more. Is there anything other than mix 
in that, tablets or LTE impacts that are bringing that down? And where is 
that expected to go? And then, Bill, on the ASP raise, I think last quarter, 
you had 
said kind of flat sequential, and it looked like to get to the full year 
of 2010, you were going to tail off the back half of the year. So now I guess 
there's less of a tail off. So why do we think that now? Is that just the mix of 
the chips that you're se
eing? Because obviously, it's going to be the March, 
June quarter that's driving it, not necessarily what we just saw for 
December.
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
This is Derek. On the externally implied rate, I think last time, as you 
mentioned, we indicated that you sh
ould expect to see a sequential decline 
and basically, we gave the reason. And really the primary driver there was 
we had very strong growth in total reported device sales, which obviously is 
a positive for the business. And we have fixed or more slowly gr
owing 
elements in the revenue base, such as the license fees and infrastructure 
royalties. And so effectively, in a rapidly growing quarter like we just had 
from a TRDS perspective, you'll see a decline in the implied rate. I think 
we're still expecting fo
r the full year to be in the range of 3 4 to 3 5, 
although I think our current expectation is we're probably going to be 
towards at the lower end of that range given that the sort of the TRDS size 
for the year is larger than we initially expected. Let me m
ake a couple of 
comments on ASP, and then I'll see if Bill has anything to add. I think 
largely, we're kind of in line with what we expected in Q2. There were some 
puts and takes, but we basically came in about $1 lower, and we had about 
$1 of FX unfavorab
ility in that. And I think the drivers for the back half of 
the year are largely consistent with what we expected. Although we're 
expecting a little stronger picture in the back half of the year than we did a 
few months ago. But we do expect it to trend do
wn based on higher units 
out of the emerging markets, just sort of normal ASP declines from moving 
down tier, and then also likely a larger percentage of dongles coming in the 
back half of the year.

A couple of quick ones. First of all, can you explain a little bit, I guess, it's 
either Steve or Bill, what your 
--
 
I mean, you don't actually own fabs, you 
use obviously partners to work with. So what does your OpEx 
--
 
why does 
your OpEx have to go up to increase supply? And what is your OpEx going 
to? And is that temporary? If you can explain, first of all, what it goes to and 
is it temporary after a couple of quarters? And as you get to the December 
quarter and supply 
comes online, does that go down? Just the more we 
understand about what that OpEx is, we can kind of figure out how that 
works. And then since it's kind of relevant as to trying to figure out what 
percent of your chips are sort of caught up in this? Can yo
u give us a range 
at least as to what percent of chips 
--
 
of shipments in the second quarter 
were 28
-
nanometer? And in your guidance for next quarter for Q3, what 
percent you think are going to be 28
-
nanometer?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Sure. Ehud, this is Stev
e. With respect to OpEx related to 28
-
nanometer, 
one of the things that you do when you look in to bring on additional sources 
that you tend to have more unplanned tapeouts. And essentially, you're 
taping out at a faster rate in order to move the ramp fast
er than you might 
have had to do it earlier. That's what we're doing today. And you're seeing 
part of that in the OpEx increase. We're also increasing OpEx to drive the 
reference design program that I mentioned in my comments. So a portion of 
it is 
--
 
I wo
uld consider to be more of a onetime item type of issue. But then 
a portion of it is things that were related in investing and things for next 
year as well. And your second question, I think it was about the percentage 
of products. If you look at our S4 pr
oduct lineup and all of our 28
-
nanometer 
devices, they are, of course, all impacted by this shortage. I made a 
comment last year 
--
 
or last quarter about the exit rate in terms of LTE 
devices leaving this year, and we're still in the same place. We think t
hat the 
high end of the road map and the LTE exit rate will be the same as what we 
mentioned before.
 
Ehud Gelblum 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Can you give us a sense, too, in fiscal Q2 or Q3 what that percentage was?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Yes, we di
dn't. I think I said it was 
--
 
we expected the fiscal year to exit at 
1/3 of shipments.
 
Ehud Gelblum 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Okay. I was just hoping to get a kind of a current spot point as to what that 
looked like in Q2 and what you're expecti
ng for Q3. I think you said 1/3 by 
the end of the fiscal year, but I was hoping to get some sort of a where we 
stand, where's the limitation is on a quarterly basis.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Yes, it's actually pretty small right now as we've been discussing. I
t's 
building throughout the year, and the multimode LTE products are starting 
to become 
--
 
I would consider it to be a table stakes type of feature at the 
high end of the portfolio. And that's what you're seeing reflected in the 
forward

looking mix that we
're talking about.

Steve, I just wanted to clarify that comment. If you still expect 1/3 of your 
shipments to be on LTE despite the fact that some 
of the 
--
 
what would have 
been a June quarter shipments are now pushed into the September quarter. 
Wouldn't we have actually expected not have a higher percentage be on LTE 
by the end of the September quarter? And then also the clarification. Given 
the sho
rtages and the declining volumes in the June quarter, if you can just 
comment on why the inventory went up.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Just to be clear, the data point that I gave was an exit rate leaving the fiscal 
year. And so I think there's really not a big 
change in that from that 
perspective. I don't know if we're providing 
--
 
I wouldn't expect us to 
provide much color either way in terms of whether that's moving up or 
down. But we are chasing supply quite a bit here. And as that starts to 
unfold, we hope t
o be able to increase those shipments.
 
Simona Jankowski 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Okay. So just to make sure I understand the clarification there. So it will still 
be fair to assume though that even if the exit rate is the same, then th
e full 
quarter for the September quarter of LTE shipments should be higher now 
than what you would have expected given that some of the June quarter 
volume is pushed into September?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
No. I think what I was trying to 
--
 
I was 
trying to give you a very sort of 
qualitative number. I'm not even sure to what accuracy it's changed. But we 
expect about that same proportion to leave the year. I don't know if there's 
a big change there, is the point I'm trying to make.
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
A
nd we expect to be supply constrained through the fiscal year. It's really

I just wanted to sort of go back to the basics on this 28
-
nanometer situation 
because it so
unds like from Steve's comment that the fact that you're exiting 
at 1/3 of chips is more or less on track with what you had originally planned. 
So I'm trying to make sure that I understand whether it's supply or demand 
that's causing the shortage. It sound
s like demand's just outpacing what you 
guys had originally expected it to, and therefore, you're having to chase 
supply. But I want to make sure that's the correct interpretation of what's 
going on. And then I wanted to circle back around to the OpEx ques
tion, and 
see if Bill could give us any more quantification on how much OpEx you guys 
are having to spend over the next couple of quarters. I understood from 
Steve what it's being spent on, but I didn't get any idea what the amount 
looks like over the next
 
couple of quarters. So if you could clarify that, that 
would be helpful.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Rod, this is Steve. I think your assumption is correct. Your interpretation is 
correct.
 
Rod B. Hall 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
So, Steve, just to 
follow up on that. Then that means that in the December 
quarter, if you guys get supply on board, you're going to 
--
 
you should see a 
pretty rapid ramp of 28
-
nanometer delivery, I guess, because there's pent
-
up demand there?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
That's wha
t we're driving towards...
 
Rod B. Hall 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Right. And how fast do you think? Do you have any view on 
--
 
do you think 
it's a pretty immediate rapid ramp in the calendar Q4? Or do you think it's 
going to take a few quart
ers for things to build up?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Well, we've been trying to match available supply with demand here. And as 
Paul said, we're going to see a significant increase in supply actually in the 
calendar year. So that's probably the most informatio
n that we can give at 
this point.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Rod, this is Bill. On the operating expenses, 3 months ago, we thought 
operating expenses would grow year
-
over
-
year approximately 18%, and 
now our estimate is 23%. And the bulk of 
--
 
great majority of tha
t 
differential 
--
 
in fact, all the differential is really QCT. And as Paul and Steve 
mentioned, a lot of that is going towards trying to accelerate the availability 
and the ramp of 28
-
nanometer. But then secondarily, we are putting a bit 
more investment in
to the Windows on ARM. And then back to the 28
-
nanometer one, as Steve mentioned much of that expense can get 
--
 
it 
comes on quickly but could get turned off quickly. It's less of a people
-
related, our own employee
-
related expense, more of an NRE.

Steve, can you please explain the alternative your customer have, given that 
the supply is constrained? And then what has been the reaction so far? I 
mean what 
--
 
I mean are th
ese customers willing to go to older Snapdragon 
designs? Are they looking at alternatives? Are they trying to use their own 
set [ph] of solutions?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Well, I think you see a combination of people. In any constrained 
environment, people look for any alternative they can in order to solve the 
problem. Now what you have, particularly in this case, is these are devices 
that primarily are using LTE type of chipsets, and so the alternatives are a 
little bit smaller than the
y would be, let's say, in a general allocation 
scenario, maybe in another industry. And we've been helping customers to 
see how they can swap in our Fusion 2 chipset, which is the chipset that we 
have been ramping over the last 8 months in production. Now 
in some cases 
also, our OEM partners are, of course, working with us very closely to try to 
help us accelerate our own supply, and that is primarily what we're seeing. 
And we do expect to see some alternative non
-
Qualcomm chipsets being 
used to solve that 
issue as well. But I will remind you that in addition to the 
8960, right on its heels is the 8x30, as well as the APQ8064. So we're 
continuing to drive our tiered road map throughout the year on the same 
schedule, again, gated by the supply here in the nea
r term. But I think that's 
a pretty attractive road map that people are interested in doing. So we need 
to solve the supply issues, and then we'll move the business on.

I wanted to just turn quickly and tie in the Windows on ARM launch of 
products coming later this year. And if you can just talk about how your 
outlook for those products and how we should expect them to start to ramp 
may have cha
nged because of supply issues, as well as any other issues. 
Just trying to gauge how important the supply issue may be in that and how 
your outlook for 
--
 
starting to penetrate the general computing market may 
or may not have changed.
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
This i
s Paul. So we've said before that revenues from Windows on ARM is 
really not this fiscal year, and so that also probably dovetails well with our 
ability to increase the supply of the chipsets. So we'll see how this all plays 
out. But those things, they are
n't necessarily an 
--
 
this fiscal year kind of an 
issue. In terms of designs that are coming out and our enthusiasm for it, I'd 
say that, that is probably reflected by our continued investments. We see a 
lot of interesting form factors that are coming out.
 
Microsoft continues to 
release more and more information about the operating system and its 
plans. And we continue to be excited. We see very good traction, interesting 
form factors, happy to see their confirmation about Office availability and so 
forth. 
So I think these are going to be great products. They're going to be 
thin, light, always on, always connected, the kinds of things that people 
expect from mobile computing these days. And we're definitely planning on 
delivering it and also to drive the chi
pset road map to continually improve 
the experience.

I was wondering if we could again just move back to the guidance on chipset 
shipments a
nd the supply shortages. So can you help me understand how 
chipset shipments in general are going down in the supply constrained 
situation even though overall 28

nanometer capacity, even though it's 
constrained is still going up, what's going on? Is there 
--
 
are there inventory 
issues? Is it just splitting between other customers? What's going on in the 
non
-
28
-
nanometer portion of your volume? Is it some trade
-
off between 28 
and 40? Can you just give us some 
--
 
maybe a little more color on what's 
driving th
e decline in shipments even though you'd still expect the overall 
28

nanometer capacity to still go up?
 
William E. Keitel
 
I'll take a stab

this is Bill Keitel

at your question, but maybe Steve will 
want to join in here. Looking at the June quarter, o
ur revenue outlook at this 
point is pretty much spot on with what we were expecting 3 months ago. 
We're not seeing a lot of surprise here from our end. The operating expenses 
have been higher, as you mentioned, but revenues seemed to be pretty 
much in line
. The somewhat flattish outlook for MSM chipset shipments is 
really not a surprise for us. We think that's going to build into the September 
quarter and then again into the December quarter.

But again, they usually up in this quarter anyways. How can they 
--
 
how are 
they still, I guess, flat to down because of supply constraints, even though 
capacity on that, on the supply should still be going up? I guess I'm still a 
little bit unclear o
n the math part in that. What else is going on in the non

28

nanometer portions that's causing that reduction?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Stacy, this is Steve. On the

high end of the portfolio in the LTE type mar
ket or the high modem feature 
set are enabled by the 8960. There are a number of designs who 
--
 
if we 
had more supply, we could ship into that. You're probably looking at a little 
bit of the high end not being there as much as we could supply. And as I 
sai
d in my remarks, we've seen a little 
--
 
we see the same amount of 
chipsets broadly, or 28
-
nanometer chipsets broadly, throughout the year but 
they shifted a little bit out of the June quarter, which left a little bit of a 
whole there, I think, in terms of 
units on the 28

nanometer side.

The question is 2 things. First, on the finance side QTL EBIT margin for 
2012, the guide is 86 to 88. This quarter, it's 89.4. Do 
you think EBIT 
margin on QTL will go down, and why that's the inferred kind of guidance? 
Second, the question about fab capacity. It may be a lingering issue in 
smaller nodes in the future. Intel is aggressively 
--
 
they have a road map 
and manufacturing fo
r it, and the question is whether you're considering 
having your own fab for particularly this kind of smaller nodes? Is this 
something that strategically you think it's wise or not? Let's start with these 
2 questions.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Tal, this is Bill. 
On the QTL margins, the bit stronger market, particularly on 
the TRDS and the higher ASP, that's driven upside that is showing through in 
revenue, but the operating expenses for the QTL segment have not gone up 
in the same proportion. So we're trying it a 
bit higher on that QTL operating 
margin than what we had expected at the outset of the year.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. With respect to the question about fabs, if you look at the 
fabless model, it's really served us well as a business. And we hav
e the 
majority of our R&D dollars spent on people creating products or technology 
that we use or patents, and it's really worked out quite well for us. Now as 
we move and become more of a leader in technology on the VLSI side and 
start to compete with peop
le who compete in that form, I think we'll 
probably evolve our 
--
 
the way in which we work, and probably even become 
closer with our fab partners versus rethink our entire business. But I think 
it's just an evolution of how the industry is moving and being
 
at the size that 
we are, we're happy to be able to shape it in the way that I think is best for 
us.

I just want to clarify again on this 
28
-
nanometer issue. Paul, Steve or Bill, 
with the 
--
 
normally your QCT volumes in the June quarter go up, you're 
guiding them slightly down. And I'm just thinking that the smartphone 
market is strong. You talked a lot about China being strong for a long ti
me. 
And all of this sequential slight decline, just in volumes that you're maybe 
guiding to the low point, is all of that just the constraint you're having on 
28
-
nanometer? That's my first question, just want to be clear on that point. 
And the second quest
ion is in terms of this higher level of spending, you're 
doing and it seems you're leaving everything for the December quarter to, 
let's say, go up a bit more back to normal. What confidence and visibility do 
you have on that? Is this 
--
 
and then just emph
atically you can say that 
Qualcomm is saying it's not a yield issue. It's much more about bringing in 
more suppliers, than we spend this money and we get to calendar fourth 
quarter and everything goes back to, let's say, a more normal QCT volume 
level and 
margin level. Is that the right way of thinking about things?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Okay, on the first part of that question, the only supply shortage we're 
dealing with is the 28
-
nanometer. And then again, to the point that, is the 
June quarter abnormal? I wo
uld caution people on looking back 1, 2 years 
and assuming that every year afterward is going to be a similar pattern. 
Again, this June quarter is largely in line with what we expected even 3 
months ago. We're not seeing much change here in our perspective
 
here. 
There's going to be, I think, a lot a focus on product launches going into the 
September quarter and particularly into the December quarter. But I don't 
see June really as abnormal or a concern from my standpoint for our year 
and looking forward. On
 
2012, the first quarter of fiscal 2012, I'd say we feel 
pretty good about that 
--
 
or excuse me, excuse me, 2013. I'd say we feel 
pretty good about that, Kulbinder. Obviously, we've got a little ways to get 
there, but the customer demand is strong, and we'
re working our way to see 
if we can fill it and get caught up by that time.

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Bill, just to be clear on that point. If everything goes to plan by that quarter, 
some of this elevated level of, let's say, 
OpEx you're seeing largely in QCT 
goes away hopefully. Is that the right way of thinking about how the model 
works?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Well, I would say it would look much more normal in proportion to revenues 
at that time, but that would only been one quar
ter. So let's not jump too far 
ahead. We'll share our guidance for fiscal '13 as we normally do in 
November.

So I'll try to ask it a little differently. So what
 
would the quarter look like if 
you weren't constrained on 28
-
nanometer? And then what are you doing 
with regard to getting that incremental capacity? Is this all TSMC? Or are 
you working with other vendors to bring more supply on from other sources?
 
Willi
am E. Keitel
 
I'll take the first part. On the June quarter, I mean it will be better, but I 
don't think it would be an increment that would be all that great. There will 
be a nice increment, but I think the September quarter would be much more 
meaningful i
n that respect. And then the December quarter, obviously, the 
demand backing up into that, our goals are pretty high there in terms of 
filling this customer demand.
 
Brian T. Modoff 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
So bringing that capacity on, how are
 
you going to do it? Is it with TSMC? Or 
is this an other source? In other words, is there any risk to getting that new 
capacity online in the time frame you laid out?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
I think we are, in addition to working very, very closely with TSMC
, we're 
also bring on several alternative sources. And it's the tapeout into those 
alternative sources and moving up the ramp that's actually contributing to 
this pulse of OpEx that we've been talking about. With respect to risk, I 
mean, anytime that you'r
e on the front end of driving a node, there is risk 
with respect to the timing of how that comes on. But so far, so good on that. 
We've been pleased with the way things have been looking with respect to 
yield, and we've been just adding supply. But like an
y other time you're 
driving a node, these things take a little while to get running, but we're full 
steam ahead, multiple sources now.

I think one of the implicit ass
umptions that many of us are making is that 
the pre
-
LTE shipments are going to be easing down a little bit over the 
course of the June quarter. My question is if that is in fact the case, would 
that mean that we should be thinking about a chipset number th
at is lower, 
an MSM number that is lower, in the September quarter than what we had in 
June before we then see a recovery in the December quarter? That might 
help us quantify how much the uptick might be in December.
 
William E. Keitel
 
We're looking for a r
easonable, a healthy uptick into the September quarter 
on total MSMs.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
The important part to remember is we're supply limited right now, and we're 
ramping supply.
 
Jeffrey T. Kvaal

Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay. And so shoul
d then we think that, that supply ramps in through the 
September quarter, and then you're at full steam entering December? Is 
that how we should we think about it?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Yes. I mean anytime that you're ramping, you're ramping through the 
quarter. In fact, in the quarter that we're in, and we're adding a substantial 
amount of capacity throughout the year. So it's a ramp. It's not a shelf or 
some sort of a pulse.

I guess one thing is if we look at QCT operating margins, what do we think 
of is a more normal operating margin range in a more typical environment? 
And then can you also just give us a sense of what you are seeing 
competitivel
y in the chip space against other guys in 3G like MediaTek or 
Broadcom? Is that starting to weigh on ASPs? I guess I'm just wondering 
what's portion of baseband content in your ASPs versus other and how that's 
changed over time.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Operating
 
margin, what's a normal environment. So last year, we operated 
in a 22% to 24%, 23% kind of band. This year, we're expecting 20% to 22% 
band. We do have internal goals to be improving on that over the next 5 
years. But the environment today is pretty comp
etitively intense, and we're 
doing well in that environment. I think we're doing, operating margin
-
wise, 
we're doing better than many other players. So I don't 
--
 
Steve, any other 
thoughts on that?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Yes, I would say the mass
-
market smar
tphone tier is a pretty competitive 
and crowded tier today. And, however, we look at our integration strategy 
that we've had in place for some number of years, and we've been driving 
across multiple technology vectors. We think that, that's paying off in t
erms 
of demand. In fact, I think one of the reasons why we're spending so much 
of this call talking about 28
-
nanometer is because we made those 
investments over the last several years. This resulted in, I think, very strong 
demand. We believe that those tr
ends continue into the future, and we're 
continuing to make those investments, not only for the home space, which is 
the phone space, but we also think those same trends will yield an 
interesting business in the computing space, as Paul talked about, on th
e 
Windows, on ARM transition that we think is going to happen in PCs. So 
we're investing in computing upstream of that. We think that, that's a great 
place to be, and we think it's also something that is a unique capability 
--
 
or 
a more unique capability t
hat we have compared to some of the competition, 
and you'll continue to see us do that.

A couple of items on the chip side of the house. So for your MSM pricing, can 
you 
share with us your outlook, in light of some of your changing mix 
assumptions perhaps for the next couple of quarters, on how you expect 
your MSM pricing to evolve? And I was wondering if you could give us an 
update on trends within your Atheros Wi
-
Fi busi
ness. Was it flat, down, up 
sequentially in the March quarter and expectations for June?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Shawn, Bill Keitel here. On the average revenue per MSM, so the quarter we 
just reported, there was slight uptick in average revenue per MSM, pretty 
much in line with what we had expected at the outset of the quarter. We're 
looking for modest upticks between now and the end of this fiscal year on an 
average revenue per MSM.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Then on the Atheros side, we're pleased with how that busi
ness has been 
integrated into Qualcomm. One of the things that I think would even help us 
more is as we work through the ramp of our S4 chipsets, those chipsets tend 
to use, the design
-
ins tend to have a very strong presence of the Atheros 
chipsets next to
 
them. And so as we start to work through these supply 
issues with the 8960 and the S4 chipsets, we think that's a good opportunity 
for us to pull some of the synergies that we've been talking about on the 
handset side through. So similar trends in that bu
siness, and we're pleased 
to have it as part of the organization.

Don't want to kick a dead horse here. But, Bill, if we go back all the way to 
'03, your June quart
er unit volumes on MSM have been up almost every 
single year except for, say, maybe one. I just want to be clear because 
obviously with all the 28
-
nanometer supply issues, I think most people are 
concerned that it might be masking a slowdown in any of the 
other 
businesses. So I know you said that it wasn't surprising the way it turned 
out for you 3 months ago, but most of the consensus estimates and most of 
the analysts were looking for more of a traditional increase. If we remove all 
the 28
-
nanometer from 
the equation, are you looking at any dislocation or 
slowdowns or share loss or any negative impact to either QRD or your 
traditional chip business? Or is everything tracking pretty much as you 
expected and most of this has to do with the product that 
--
 
th
e new 
products that you're trying to get out? And then I have a question about 
--
 
in terms of supply. You mentioned that there are some sockets that are 
going to non
-
Qualcomm solutions during this period of constrained supply. Is 
that more of the legacy pr
oducts? Are you talking about 
--
 
there's not really 
any really compelling LTE solutions out there that I wouldn't think of. But if 
you can give more color on how large a group that is and what technology 
that is, I'd appreciate it.
 
William E. Keitel
 
I'll j
ust say again, I'd be cautious of drawing these correlations year
-
over
-
year. I'll remind people, back to when we guided the September quarter last 
year people were a little surprised that our MSM guidance wasn't higher, and 
our messaging was pretty clear t
hat it's going to 
--
 
we thought it was going 
to come through strong in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. And people were 
looking at historical trends and trying to infer that there may have been 
something wrong there. And I think you'll recall our guidance
 
was spot on. 
So again, there's going to be other factors driving this market. We're not 
going to get into chipset family by chipset family. But other than customer 
demand for the 28
-
nanometer exceeding what we can supply, the business 
is humming along, I 
think, very, very well. And this is an opportunity that 
we're working hard to close up on by the end of this calendar year.

other levers can you pull to get operating margins up over the next several 
quarters on the chipset side?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Yes. Steve, I'll let you jump here. I don't think the levers are that short a 
term. The pricing typically gets set well in advance. We'll react through the 
year as competitors make moves. And then on the

so that kind of speaks 
to the revenues and the gr
oss margin. On the operating expense side, it's 
primarily R&D, and the R&D investment we can't manage for a quarterly, 
given quarterly outcome we might want to see on the P&L. That has to be 
managed with that

a little longer cycle in mind, and I think Q

W
e could. I think you probably saw at the Mobile World Congress, we did an 
over the year demo. In fact, I think it's the world's first over the year demo. 
That actually use the commercial silicon that is in our 8960. And our 11ac 
chipset is actually just a 
swap of the RF chips pin
-
for
-
pin compatible chipset. 
So as the industry starts to develop and the certification starts to mature, 
it's a fairly easy upgrade for our customers in order to enable that. And that 
same comment that I made about 8960 applies to 
the 8064 and the 8x30. 
So I think it's a fairly well
-
designed approach to enable that market, and I 
think you would expect that from us. We tend to try to drive the front end of 
technology transition, and we'll do the same thing and have done the same

OpEx just tape

out costs?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
It is. We do tailor the chips for really the different camps. And of course 
there are 2 camps there, depending on kind of the source of the VLSI

and I 
would call 
them tapeout

A question for Steve and then for Bill. First for Steve, 28

nanometers. Just 
to be crystal clear on the 8960, is that produ
ct good to go? There's really no 
technical testing issues or what have you, I mean it's all capacity that you're 
waiting for? And I'm kind of guessing that the 28

nanometers, you'll 
probably bring out, what, your 9615s and 9215s first, and then put the ram
p 
over to the 8960. And then also wanted to know if 
--
 
I wonder if you expect 
802.11ac to show up on the 8960? And then for Bill, just housekeepings. 
How much of this cash is onshore? And then also on your June guidance, if 
you can break out how much is on
 
--
 
from investment income, how much 
you see there?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Mark, it's Steve. Yes, it really is related to wafer starts and not yield or any

development worked there, and 
your transition in terms of our road map, in 
terms of timing sounds accurate.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Mark, it's Bill. On the

we've got $26.6 billion total cash at quarter end, 
and the onshore component was $10.8 billion. And then on the investment 
income for
 
Q3 and Q4, for Q3, I think at this point, with the visibility we 
have, I would expect investment income including realized gains to be in line 
with what we've seen maybe the last couple of quarters. But for Q4, fiscal

especially. I

--
 
there's just no problem with demand at all?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Matt, I'll take the first one. On the investment income. Yes, in fiscal Q2, it 
was a little higher than normal. If you recall last year, we sold some puts in 
our stock. There was a 
$75 million premium on those puts, and then as the 
stock rises, that premium is brought onto the P&L. So with the 
--
 
where the 
stock ended fiscal Q2, the majority of that $75 million has come to the P&L, 
and a little over $30 million of it was in fiscal Q2
 
alone. So there was a bit of

Paul E. Jacobs
 
Yes. I wanted to just say thanks, everybody, for being on the call today. And 
really we're gratified by the strong traction we're seeing on Snapdragon, the 
8960. The team
 
that designed that product really executed on a bunch of 
vectors. Its new radio technology, new microprocessor technology, new 
graphics, new connectivity and a new process node, and that's what put that 
chip so far out in front of the competition and drov
e really tremendously 
strong demand that we've seen. And we're going to drive those advantages 
going forward as well. We've got some really good products in the road map.
 
Obviously we're making the investments we talked about to improve our 
supply and go a
fter this Windows opportunity and also to go after the 
emerging markets with the reference designs.
 
The growth drivers of the company continue to be very strong, and I think 
the big issue is that we're disappointed, I think our customers are a little 
disap
pointed with the fact that we have these supply constraints. They've all 
designed really exciting new devices around those things, and we're going to 
work as hard as we can to get more supply for the end of the year to really 
bring up those great devices. 
So there's a lot to look forward to, and we're 
working hard to bring all that to reality. So thanks very much, everyone.

8/1/19,Qualcomm,"Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. I think it's fair to say I'm 
extremely pleased with Qualcomm's performance this past fiscal year. We 
delivered record revenues of $19 billion, up 28% versus last year. Earnings, 
total reported device 
sales and MSM chipset shipments were also records, 
was driven by the increasing global consumption of wireless data across a 
diverse range of devices and particularly smartphones.
 
We also increased our dividend for the 10th consecutive year and returned 
$2
.9 billion to stockholders in the form of buybacks and cash dividends.
 
As to the fourth quarter, we are above the high end of our previous revenue 
and earnings guidance as demand in 28
-
nanometer supply improved as the 
quarter progressed. This gives us a st
rong base to build off of. And looking 
forward to next year, we expect double
-
digit revenue and non
-
GAAP 
earnings growth again in fiscal 2013.
 
For the year, we had a number of highlights. We delivered double
-
digit 
growth in our Licensing business, with rec
ord revenues and earnings. We 
now have over 220 royalty
-
bearing 3G licensees. And this year, we added 
more than 20 new Chinese licensees and our first license agreements with 
major Brazilian consumer electronic suppliers. We've also continued to grow 
our s
ingle
-
mode OFDM licensees. We now have over 30 single
-
mode OFDM 
licensees around the world and believe our 4G portfolio is the most widely 
licensed in the industry. Through our licensing program, we continue to 
foster innovation and enable a large and grow
ing ecosystem that benefits 
wireless consumers worldwide.
 
Our semiconductor business had double
-
digit growth as well, delivering 
record revenues and earnings. During the year, we continued to lead in LTE 
with our integrated modem solutions. We delivered si
gnificant product 
enhancements across all key technology vectors including the modem, 
processor, graphics and connectivity with world
-
class integration. And we 
executed the fastest ramp of a new process node in our history. Now this 
was not without its cha
llenges, but the teams consistently executed to an 
accelerated schedule over the last 9 months.
 
We believe the breadth and depth of our product road map is unparalleled, 
and our Snapdragon and Gobi family of chipsets has established the industry 
standard i
n integrated mobile semiconductors, allowing us to continue to 
extend our partnerships with key OEMs.
 
On the display front, we continue to believe MEMS
-
based displays will 
provide key differentiating features such as low
-
power consumption and 
outdoor view
-
ability. As we previously indicated, we are increasing our focus 
on licensing our display technologies, including our next
-
generation mirasol 
display technology, while at the same time directly commercializing certain 
current
-
generation mirasol displays. A
nd we're also evaluating various 
options for our display manufacturing facility in Taiwan.
 
Shifting to our spectrum
-
related initiatives, we achieved many significant 
milestones this year. In United States, we completed the sale of our 700 
megahertz spectru
m to AT&T, and we're working closely with them to enable 
their deployment of supplemental downlink using our carrier aggregation 
technology on this unpaired spectrum to improve download speeds and 
capacity.
 
In Europe, the regulatory group CEPT decided to h
armonize the L
-
Band at 
1.4 gigahertz for supplemental downlink. This, by the way, is the same band 
that we own in the U.K., and this opens up the potential to have 
supplemental downlink deployed widely across Europe.
 
And finally, in India, we received our 
license in the assignment of the 2.3 
gigahertz spectrum we won in India's BWA auction. And Bharti Airtel, a 
leading Indian wireless operator, acquired a 49% interest in our Indian BWA 
entities, and we expect they will take full ownership of those entities 
in 
calendar 2014. Bharti's acquisition added an operator
-
partner with the scale, 
experience and resources to roll out and operate an LTE TDD network on this 
spectrum.
 
Turning to calendar 2013. Despite a somewhat cautious macroeconomic 
outlook, we expect 3G
/4G device shipments to grow approximately 14% 
year
-
over
-
year based on the midpoint of our forecast. We believe our long
-
term growth drivers remain intact. Smartphone adoption continues at a 
rapid pace, with many increasingly capable devices at a variety o
f price 
points being launched on a global basis.
 
According to industry analysts, more than 300 million smartphones were 
shipped in the first half of calendar 2012, representing approximately 45% 
year
-
over
-
year growth. To put this in perspective, according 
to Gartner, this 
was over 2/3 higher than the volume of PCs that shipped during the same 
period.
 
Further, the demand for data on mobile networks continues to grow, which 
is driving the need for continued technological innovation, and we're seeing 
a fundame
ntal shift towards mobile computing. Watch for these and other 
opportunities in more detail during our upcoming Analyst Day, and I look 
forward to seeing many of you there.
 
As you heard, due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy, we were unfortunately 
forced to
 
move the Analyst Day to San Diego, but our thoughts are with all 
of those that were affected by this tragedy.
 
So to wrap up, we've once 
--
 
we have completed another outstanding year 
at Qualcomm. I would once again like to thank all of our employees and 
pa
rtners for their innovation, effort and leadership. Looking forward, I'm 
pleased with our outlook for continued double
-
digit revenue and non
-
GAAP 
earnings growth in fiscal 2013.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Qualcomm's 
Presid
ent and Chief Operating Officer, Steve Mollenkopf.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. QCT had another strong 
year, with record revenues up 37% year
-
over
-
year, driven by record 
shipments of 590 million MSM chipsets, 
which were up 22% year
-
over
-
year. 
In the fiscal fourth quarter, we shipped approximately 141 million MSM 
chipsets, above the midpoint of our prior guidance.
 
Revenue per MSM was up approximately 9% sequentially, driven by a 
greater mix of multimode 3G LTE d
evices, which more than doubled quarter
-
over
-
quarter and made up approximately 1/3 of our shipments exiting the 
quarter as expected. Similarly, shipments of our new dual
-
core MSM8960 
tripled quarter
-
over
-
quarter as demand for our integrated application 
pro
cessors continues to grow.
 
Demand for our 28
-
nanometer products remained strong, including 
significant design activity on our follow
-
on chipsets. As expected, we ramped 
our 28
-
nanometer supply significantly in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we 
remain on tr
ack to match our current 28
-
nanometer demand profile exiting 
the December quarter.
 
Our industry
-
leading modem technology continues to be a tremendous 
differentiator for us. As modem complexity continues to increase with 
multimode and multiband requirements
, we are well
-
positioned with a single 
solution that offers a true global modem, supporting all cellular modes 
including CDMA, WCDMA, TD
-
SCDMA and both LTE TDD and LTE FDD, as 
well as the approximately 40 related RF bands.
 
In addition, we recently sampled 
our third
-
generation multimode 3G/LTE 
chipset, the MDM 9x25, which is also a global modem that adds support for 
LTE category 4 and carrier aggregation.
 
We believe our first 28
-
nanometer Snapdragon product, the dual
-
core 
MSM8960 with integrated 3G/LTE has b
ecome the global standard for 
combined performance and battery life, powering recent flagship devices 
such as the Samsung Galaxy S III, the HTC 8X, the Motorola RAZR M and 
the new Nokia Lumia phones.
 
As carriers deploy LTE networks, they are looking to Qua
lcomm as the leader 
in multimode LTE for smartphones. For example, KDDI, NTT DOCOMO and 
SoftBank announced 27 new smartphones in Japan in October, and 24 of 
those were powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors.
 
Since releasing the MSM8960, 15 OEMs have lau
nched devices with this 
chipset across 19 carriers around the globe. The 8960 was our fastest 
integrated product to ship 100 million units.
 
Our OEM customers have also moved quickly to adopt the Snapdragon S4 
Pro, which includes our latest Adreno 320 GPU, 
4 Krait CPU cores and is 
paired with an MDM9x15 multimode LTE modem. Early reviews show that 
this product has set a new bar for multitasking and graphics performance. 
The first OEM devices based on this platform include the Google Nexus 4, LG 
Optimus G and
 
Xiaomi MI2, and we expect more leading devices on this 
platform to be announced soon.
 
Smartphone demand in emerging regions is growing rapidly, and we 
continue to invest in our Qualcomm Reference Design program to help 
service a new group of emerging cust
omer accounts. The program now has 
over 40 OEM customers and 100 commercially launched devices. And this 
quarter we expanded our road map to include the new Snapdragon quad
-
core MSM8x25Q and our new 28
-
nanometer based MSM8930 with an 
integrated global mode
m.
 
We are pleased to see the initial launch of Windows RT devices, including the 
Snapdragon
-
based Samsung ATIV Tab and the Dell XPS 10. While this early, 
we are positioned to benefit from this new category as our Qualcomm 
Snapdragon chipsets are the only c
hipsets to power both Windows 
smartphones and these new mobile computing devices.
 
Our mobile connectivity solutions, which include integrated Wi
-
Fi, GPS, 
Bluetooth and FM continue to be used by the vast majority of our customers' 
designs for their 
28
-
nanometer S4 devices.
 
As we mentioned on the last call, we expect a strong December quarter for 
QCT as our supply of 28
-
nanometer chipsets continues to ramp and our 
partners launch a broad lineup of handsets for the holiday quarter. We are 
expecting rec
ord MSM shipments of between 168 million and 178 million 
units in the first fiscal quarter, up approximately 19% to 26% sequentially, 
with revenue per MSM also up sequentially.
 
In fiscal 2013, we expect multimode 3G/LTE shipments for smartphones to 
constit
ute a much greater percentage of our mix, which we estimate will 
significantly increase our average revenue per MSM versus fiscal 2012. We 
also expect our 3G/LTE leadership and broad
-
tiered road map to help 
increase our design traction within key customer 
accounts.
 
Leadership across multiple technologies require to succeed in mobile remains 
our strategic priority for our business, and we are increasing our R&D 
investments in fiscal 2013, including investments in our modem, the 
application processor and driv
ing new process technologies, as well as our 
reference design effort.
 
That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many of you in San 
Diego at our upcoming analyst event. I will now turn the call over to Bill 
Keitel.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Thank you, Ste
ve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial 
results and guidance to report to you today.
 
Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were $4.87 billion, up 18% year
-
over
-
year; 
and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, up 11% year
-
over
-
year, both 
above 
the high end of our prior guidance range. QTL revenues grew 16% 
year
-
over
-
year, and total reported device sales by our licensees were 
approximately $46.5 billion, up 19% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We estimate that approximately 210 million to 214 million subscriber u
nits 
were shipped by our licensees in the June quarter, up 12% year
-
over
-
year 
at the midpoint at an average selling price of approximately $216 to $222.
 
QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a new record, growing 21% year
-
over
-
year, and QCT's operating m
argin was 16%, above our prior guidance, 
reflecting strong shipments of our multimode 3G/LTE solutions.
 
We returned $1.27 billion to stockholders in the fiscal fourth quarter, 
including $426 million in cash dividends and $841 million through stock 
repurcha
ses. In addition, since the end of fiscal 2012 and through 
yesterday's market close, we repurchased another 4.1 million shares of our 
stock for $240 million.
 
Non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $0.89 for the quarter, $0.08 better than 
our prior
-
guidance midpo
int. QTL was $0.02 better, driven by strong 3G/4G 
device shipments. And QCT added $0.07, driven by higher MSM shipments 
and favorable multimode 3G/LTE product mix. The net of higher operating 
expenses and impairment charge and higher investment income acco
unted 
for $0.01 reduction.
 
Turning to our results for fiscal year 2012. Revenues were a record $19.1 
billion, up 28% from last year. GAAP earnings were a record $3.51 per 
share, up 39% year
-
over
-
year; non
-
GAAP operating income was a record 
$7.1 billion, up
 
17% year
-
over
-
year; and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were 
a record $3.71, up approximately 16% year
-
over
-
year.
 
QTL's fiscal 2012 revenues were a record $6.3 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year, and QTL's operating margin was 88%. We estimate that the fiscal 
201
2 3G/4G device average selling price, as reported by our licensees, was 
approximately $216 to $222, up 6% compared to fiscal 2011 and reflecting 
strong adoption of smartphones in multiple tiers in both developed and 
emerging regions.
 
QCT's fiscal 2012 reve
nues were a record $12.1 billion, up 37% year
-
over
-
year with operating margin of 19%. Our fiscal 2012 operating cash flow was 
$6 billion and 31% of revenues. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to 
stockholders during fiscal 2012, including $1.6 billion 
of cash dividends and 
$1.3 billion through stock repurchases.
 
We are reaffirming our 905 million unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2012 
3G/4G device shipments by our licensees, up approximately 14% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Now turning to next year. We estimate ca
lendar 2013 3G/4G device 
shipments by our licensees will be approximately 1 billion to 1.07 billion 
units, up approximately 14% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. Our economic 
outlook is largely aligned with consensus worldwide GDP forecast except that 
we hav
e less optimism in developed economies.
 
The midpoint of our guidance is based on 3.0% world GDP growth in 2013 
compared to consensus of 3.4%. We expect fiscal 2013 revenues to be in 
the range of approximately $23 billion to $24 billion, up approximately 23
% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect our non
-
GAAP operating income 
to be in the range of approximately $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion, an increase of 
approximately 18% at the midpoint.
 
While we anticipate strong growth in both our chip and Licensing b
usinesses, 
we expect the higher mix of multimode 3G/LTE and 28
-
nanometer chipsets 
to drive growth in QCT's revenue and operating income at a comparatively 
faster pace than QTL. We expect fiscal 2013 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to 
be in the range of $4.12 t
o $4.32, an increase of approximately 14% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We estimate that the 3G/4G device ASP will be approximately $214 to $226 
in fiscal 2013, a slight increase year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We 
anticipate that combined non
-
GAAP R&D an
d SG&A expenses will grow 
approximately 19% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by increased R&D 
investments and those R&D investments focused on furthering QCT's 
leadership position.
 
Absent U.S. corporate tax reform, we expect both our GAAP and non
-
GAAP 
tax 
rates in fiscal 2013 to be approximately 18% to 19%. As a reminder, we 
do not include estimates for realized investment gains or losses on our cash 
and marketable securities portfolio in our financial guidance unless they are 
reasonably certain.
 
Now lookin
g out to the first quarter of fiscal 2013. We estimate revenues to 
be approximately $5.6 billion to $6.1 billion, an increase of 25% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We anticipate that non
-
GAAP earnings per share will be 
approximately $1.08 to $1.16 a share
, an increase of 15% year
-
over
-
year at 
the midpoint. This estimate includes expected total reported device sales of 
approximately $46 billion to $51 billion by our licensees for shipments in the 
September quarter, up 17% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We 
estimate that QCT will ship approximately 168 million to 178 million MSM 
chipsets during the December quarter, with revenue per MSM higher 
sequentially, reflecting strong demand for our multimode 3G/LTE solutions 
and improved 28
-
nanometer supply. We expect
 
a modest build in the 3G/4G 
inventory channel in the December quarter, as is typical for the holiday 
season. And we estimate that 3G/4G inventory channel will remain towards 
the low end of the 13
-
 
to 18
-
week band throughout the remainder of fiscal 
2013. W
e expect combined non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to decrease 
approximately 2% sequentially.
 
We hope to see many of you at our November 15 Analyst Day, where we will 
share additional data points regarding our fiscal 2013 guidance, including 
segment operatin
g margins, ASP trends and 3G/4G regional breakouts. The 
event will be webcast live on our Qualcomm Investor Relations website, 
which also includes a slide presentation on the data points included on 
today's call.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn
 
the call back over to Warren.

Just a 
2
-
parter on the chipset ASPs, if I could. It sounds like a lot of LTE and 
good smartphone shipments in the quarter and expecting the same next 
quarter. Two things. One, could you talk a little bit about what's going on 
with ASP at the lower end? Obviously,
 
MediaTek is starting to do a little bit 
better. Are you seeing more price pressure there? And secondly, I'm 
calculating a little bit better gross margin profile for the chipset business in 
the quarter. Is that accurate? Have you seen 
--
 
starting to see gr
oss margin 
benefits from the move to 28
-
nanometer or from the higher ASPs?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Tim, I'll take the first 
--
 
second part of your question on the gross margins. 
Let me just say, for our first fiscal quarter of 2013, we do expect a nice 
increase 
in QCT's operating margins. I won't comment on the gross margin, 
and I won't give specifics on the Q1 operating margin for QCT. But I think 
we'll share a little more color next week at the analyst meeting. But again, 
we do expect a nice pick up in QCT's op
erating margin in fiscal Q1.
 
Timothy Long 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
Okay. Then maybe the impact at the low end?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Tim, this is Steve. On the low end, it's pretty much playing out the way that 
we've discussed and/or described over the la
st year or so, which is pretty 
competitive market at the low end. It's very crowded a bit competitively, 
and people are really pricing aggressively in order to get share or to 
maintain share. So we expect that to continue to some degree as we talked 
about 
for some time. One thing I should mention too, earlier I misspoke a 
bit. I said that the MSM8960 was our fastest product to 100 million units. It 
actually should have been 10 million units. Apologize for that. It's 10 million 
units.

Bill, on QTL or the CDMA device market, ASPs are flat to even improving 
next year, especially with your GDP comments about lower mix maybe from 
mature markets. Can you just walk us th
rough some of the factors that are 
keeping ASPs flat to up next year? And what you might think longer term 
with more growth from emerging markets that might put a downward 
pressure on QTL ASPs longer term?
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
This is Derek. Let me go ahead and
 
take that one. I think as we've said in 
the past, over the longer term, we should see some amount of erosion in the 
ASP. I think as you look ahead to next year, and we'll provide some more 
color on this next week, I think there's going to be somewhat offs
etting 
trends. I think we are expecting to see more volume coming from the 
emerging regions. But then sort of offsetting that to some extent, we're 
seeing more higher percentage of devices at the highest tier in some of the 
developed regions, and also we e
xpect, as we've said in the past, ASPs in 
some of the emerging regions that have been quite low to continue to 
increase with more smartphone penetration cannibalizing the feature phone. 
So I think all that kind of nets out together to relatively flat pictu
re going 
forward next year.
 
T. Michael Walkley 
-
 
Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
 
And Derek a follow
-
on question is are connected tablets becoming a bigger 
impact in terms of the ASP trends that you report?
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
I'm sorry. Could you repeat t
hat?
 
T. Michael Walkley 
-
 
Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
 
Sure. Just wondering if connected tablets works more with LTE shipping and 
3G? Are the connected tablets becoming more meaningful to your ASP 
calculations?
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
I think we've been 
--
 
as the volume goes up and down quarterly, the 
volumes themselves have changed, but I think the percentage of total units 
that are coming from tablets have been relatively constant. I think we'll kind 
of have to wait and see how things play out going forwa
rd with Windows RT 
and some of the other Android tablets coming into the market over the next 
year.

Just wanted to clarify, when you talk about exp
ecting a significant increase 
in the MSM ASPs, it's interesting that you're not also expecting an increase 
in the QTL ASPs to match that. So that will seem to imply that directionally 
your market share is increasing more at the high end of the total device
 
opportunity. Is that a reasonable conclusion?
 
William E. Keitel
 
I think it's a combination of things, Simona. One, you're going to get a 
timing difference between the MSM shipment and the impact into our 
Licensing business. So that would be number 
one. But number two, we are 
-
-
 
as Derek said, the high end of the market seems to be playing out pretty 
strongly here in the near term. So you're going to see more of effect of that 
initially. Through 
--
 
later through the year though, as Derek did say, we 
do 
expect the emerging markets to be growing at a faster pace than developed 
markets. So I think some of it's 
--
 
a lot of what you're seeing there is just 
timing, Simona.
 
Simona Jankowski

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
And also wanted to fol
low up on the guidance for fiscal '13 within QTL. Can 
you just be a little more specific on what you're assuming there on the 
success for Windows RT with 3G/4G connectivity attached. Is that a 
meaningful assumption as part of your guidance? Or if that plat
form were to 
be successful, would that imply upside?
 
William E. Keitel
 
I would say on Windows RT, in our guidance here we've been cautious. But 
looking out in time, we're cautiously optimistic.

A couple of questions. Steve, on the LTE side, you talked about 
your MSM 
ASPs going up because of the shift towards more of the LTE product and 
more of the advanced MDM product. Can you talk a little bit about LTE 
competition? Our own checks indicate the competitors who are getting 
continuous delays in getting their pr
oducts out. Can you talk about when you 
expect to see merchant silicon out from some of the competitors? And then, 
Bill, a question around 
--
 
you guide revenues next year, 23% and EPS, 14%. 
Why such a gap between the 2.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Brian, this is 
Steve. On your first question about LTE, yes, LTEs become 
really a table stakes feature at the high end. And it's something that we 
have not only in our modem product line but also in the application 
processor line as you know. And it's become tiered now w
hen you look at 
our 28
-
nanometer shipments, meaning that we have multiple tiers of AP 
shipping LTE now integrated. Moving into next year, we expect that feature 
set to turnover, meaning that the LTE solutions that we're shipping today 
will add additional b
ands, they'll also add different data rates, as well as 
carrier aggregation. I talked about how we had been sampling our new 
design as well, which is our third generation. So we think that's moving quite 
fast, and we think it's going to be a very difficult
 
situation to come into that 
market. But as you know, everyone is trying to do that. So we expect a 
number of competitors to go after portions of that market. But I think 
getting the worldwide SKU, we're going to try to make it very difficult.

And Brian, to your second question, the reason that revenue growth is 
greater than earnings per share growth is simply the difference in margins 
between QCT and QTL. Now we're expecting QCT next year to grow at a 
substantially higher rate than QTL. T
hat is the primary difference. There's a 
small amount of difference as well, because we don't forecast realized gains 
on our cash and marketable securities portfolio beyond what we have clear 
visibility on. And that tends to be a very near
-
term picture. So
 
those are the 
2 factors. The great majority, though, being the fact that QCT we expect to 
be growing at a much faster pace than QTL, albeit both businesses we 
expect to grow double digit.

A couple of quick questions. One is, if you look at your guidance for QTL 
market size, these are the market size in June that you got relative revenues 
on and, in September, was $46.5 billion. And you said that's going to go to 
$46 billion to $51 billion. The midpoint of that is up 4%. Most of what we've 
seen, I think you've probably seen the same things from all of your 
licensees, which show that smartphone growth from calendar Q2 to calendar 
Q3 was a lot more than 4.5% or 4%. I
 
think most of the numbers are 
showing well into the double digits. How did you get to your $46 billion to 
$51 billion range? I would have thought it would have been higher than that. 
And then, just want to see what you did or didn't bake into that, and th
en I 
have a follow
-
up on royalty rate.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Yes, Ehud, this is Bill. Yes, we monitor the OEMs as you do. Obviously, we're 
able to engage probably at a more detailed level. There's 
--
 
as we 
mentioned, we're seeing 
--
 
Steve Mollenkopf and Paul d
escribing this way 
that the OEM market is kind of getting to be a barbell, where you have one 
end of the barbell with names that we all recognize. But the other end of the 
barbell has a lot of names that very few people recognize concentrated in 
Asia. And 
it's the 
--
 
it's that visible name in one end of the barbell that 
people tend to focus on and where data is more readily available. The other 
end of the barbell, the data can be hard to come by. So I think that's 
probably a key difference between what you'
re rolling up, and what we're 
rolling up.

So I'm guessing it's more that you can't see it either, and so you're going 
conservative there versus you actually know more than we do there. Or do 
you know more
 
than we do? And then my extra question is on the royalty 
rate. It came back to 3.4%. Obviously, it has to do with a couple of your 
providers or a couple of your licensees that have some fixed components to 
their rate structure. And when they're up or down
, it does fluctuate a little 
bit. But as you look into 2013, do you expect the same 3.4% to hold? And at 
what point do you expect your single
-
mode LTE licensees, who presumably 
have a lower royalty rate than 3.4%, to start dragging on that?

On the TRDS question, total reported device sales, I hope is that we have 
more visibility than you or others do. We've tended to do reasonably well 
with our forecast. I'm hopeful that we're going to hold that pattern here 
going forward.
 
Derek K. 
Aberle
 
This is Derek. Let me try to answer your question on the rate. As we've 
pointed out kind of repeatedly, we do tend to see quarterly fluctuations in 
the rate. And it's for a variety of factors that can move it around. And last 
quarter, obviously, the
 
TRDS was a bit higher than came in this quarter. So 
that's an impact, and we actually saw with some of this growth at the high 
end of the market a larger percentage of devices hitting the caps that we 
have in place. So that's going to have an impact on th
e rate. I think we're 
not prepared today to talk about what we see going forward. But hopefully, 
we can give you some color on that next week. What we did say a couple of 
quarters ago is we expected to finish up the year towards the low end of the 
3.4% to 
3.5% indicator we gave at the outset of the year. And I think we're 
pretty close to that. It's where we ended up.

Just a question on R&D, maybe for you, Bill. If yo
u could talk a little bit 
about 
--
 
R&D's a little bit higher than we thought it would be in fiscal Q4. 
How much of that was related to 28

nanometer? And then I also wanted to 
ask about next year, the fiscal 2013 guidance. I mean your R&D is 
--
 
or the 
overa
ll OpEx is kind of pacing in terms of growth a little bit below expected 
revenue growth. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about 
--
 
but put 
that in context with Paul's commentary about R&D investments increasing 
next year. Should we expect OpEx t
o shift more toward R&D next year? Or 
how is that going to play out as we move through the year?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure, Rod. Yes, next year, we expect R&D to grow at a rate substantially 
higher than SG&A. We're pretty excited about the R&D investment 
oppo
rtunity ahead. And at the same time, I think we're pretty pleased that 
we think we'll be able to get a lot of leverage 
--
 
operating leverage out of 
the SG&A we got in place. So we expect R&D to grow at a rate substantially 
higher than SG&A. What you're see
ing in fiscal Q4 is just we're on that 
ramp. The expenses came in a little bit higher. Now we did point out that we 
did have an impairment charge in the quarter. It was a $54 million 
impairment charge related to our display business, which as I think 
every
body's aware, we're 
--
 
we've shifted our focus there a bit. And that 
impairment follows on that shift in focus. But other than that, we're on a 
ramp here that there's a fast growth in R&D because of the exciting 
opportunities ahead.

Yes, I have one question for Steve. I guess, with the rising ASPs you're 
talking about in the QCT business, is it fa
ir to say that 
--
 
how do you think 
about QCT margins over the next year, maybe over the long term? Can we 
get back to historic levels? Is that level of investment you're needing to 
make or pricing pressure or competitive environment you're breaking into 
th
e next fiscal year so margins don't expand? Any color there would be, 
specifically of QCT, will be helpful. And I guess, Bill, I'm just going back to 
the whole issue off OpEx. And I think all the questions are really getting 
guys [ph] this. You have like f
airly decent R&D growth last year, fairly 
decent OpEx growth. This year, it's going to grow slightly a touch slower 
than sales. But you're not necessarily giving, especially in the R&D line, as 
much leverage I guess as we once spoke about. I thought there 
has been a 
number of investments and heavy level of investments in recent years. And 
so, at what point do you think you could get actual significant operating 
leverage over R&D? Is that still a 3
-
 
to 5
-
year discussion? Or could we 
actually start seeing tha
t towards the end of the next fiscal year, for 
example?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Kulbinder, this is Steve. On the first question, what you're seeing in the QCT 
business is we have the strategy, and it's particularly true on the high end of 
trying to set the 
design 
--
 
essentially the design point for the industry really 
create an integrated product that leads in multiple dimensions. Those 
dimensions, graphics, modem, connectivity, what have you, we continue to 
invest pretty heavily in. And we think that, that 
strategy is working, 
particularly as you look at the outlook in '13. We feel that we'll be able to 
really see a significant year
-
over
-
year growth because of that, as Bill 
mentioned. The other thing that you're seeing as well is we are transitioning 
through
 
nodes at a faster pace than we have done historically. So we have, 
probably on a historical basis, a bit more VLSI investment consistent with 
transitioning through nodes quickly. We think that, over time, it'll be very 
difficult for people to continue to 
keep up with that level of technology 
innovation. That's essentially our strategy on the high end, and it seems to 
be paying off right now. We're going to continue it through the next year. 
And as Bill said, we're pretty excited about where we think that's
 
going to 
lead. Particularly at a time when the smartphone and the tablet are 
converging, we think long term.
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
In terms of getting leverage on the R&D investments outside of things Steve 
has been talking about, obviously, we have a pretty sig
nificant investment in 
supporting multiple operating systems and being, let's say, cautiously 
optimistic about kind of the revenue growth derived from that in the near 
term. But I would think that those are great growth opportunities looking 
out. And then 
we're also doing reasonable amount of R&D in new areas to 
deal with the data growth and really satisfying customer demand there. And 
then finally, new R&D in other growth markets that are adjacent. And we'll 
get into some of those discussions in the Analys
t Meeting on where we see 
the opportunities.

Firstly, with QCT growing significantly more than QTL, it sounds like a lot of 
this is going to
 
be pricing. But do you see share gains as well? And to the 
extent you see that, is it more customer exposure versus new [indiscernible] 
driving it? For the second question, a question on mirasol, you're moving 
that to a licensing business. So this last ye
ar, I think it lost more than $300 
million. There's probably $0.15 or $0.20 of EPS. Do you have upside in your 
annual guidance for next year from that mirasol transition to licensing? Or is 
there potential further upside once you figure out what to do with
 
it? Or is it 
already in there and you're spending the savings on the OpEx?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Stacy, this is Bill. I'll take the mirasol one first. There are savings built into 
our guidance. We had indicated earlier this year that we would be 
--
 
we're 
executing on a plan that would deliver savings, and those are built into our 
guidance. On the question on share gains, we are targeting to do better in 
QCT. There is a

we've got both a richer mix, and we're targeting to 
capture more design wins as we go
 
forward here. So it's a combination of

You're upping estimates for emerging market devices in 2012 by $15 million. 
Could you talk about that? And d
o you have thoughts on how much of the 
China market can actually migrate to 3G and 4G? There is a bit of a negative 
case out there that EDGE plus WiFi is a sufficient smartphone experience for 
some, given the density of WiFi hotspots in China, and even lik
e iPhones 
already on the China Mobile network.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Ian, this is Bill. On the first question for 2012, yes, we did increase our 
estimates. It's disclosed on our website, I assume that's where you saw it. 
For 2012, China and India by 15 million
 
units. And then that was offset with 
some reductions that we think are occurring elsewhere. The 
--
 
between the 
-
-
 
that emerging market estimate, it's primarily China. And that's really 
extrapolating off the trends we're seeing. I think many are seeing it'
s a very, 
very active smartphone market, both the consumers are high consumer take 
rate and we think a good operator experience as well.
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
If we look at the EDGE smartphone market, I mean, we believe that's a 
transitional step. Obviously, peop
le aren't going to be satisfied with the 
EDGE experience when it comes to the kind of content that many people are 
consuming on their smartphones, high
-
bandwidth content like video. The 
other thing is WiFi is going to tap out because it's going to be inter
ference 
limited. And the nice thing about the licensed band technologies that you 
can cause the base stations to manage interference among themselves. And 
that's the kind of technologies that we're going to be bringing to the market 
over the next few years
. And those, I think, will drive the kind of capacities 
of the network at very, very much decreased cost points. So the wireless 
operators are going to be in a position to really supply a lot better data 
experience, lot better quality of service over the 3
G and 4G networks. And 
so while we love WiFi and we sell an awful lot of WiFi through Atheros, we 
believe in it for offload, it's not going to be the solution for the mass of 
smartphones and tablets going forward.

I would like to ask across the service first, if I could. I think many of the 
benchmarking studies have indicated that your own architectures are 
superior on many metrics to the internal ones from Samsung and Apple. 
Could you talk about why
 
it is that those phones have done so well? And 
what the implications there are on the apps processor market? Just 
--
 
do 
believe that your market share will go back up again? Is that what you're 
referencing in your prior statement? And then, Steve, perhaps
 
for you on the 
seasonality. You had said earlier that you would expect supply to only match 
demand later in the second half of the December quarter. Does that mean 
that you will still be working off demand in the March quarter? Is that the 
implication of 
that statement?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Sure. So on your first question, what we've continued to believe, and it's 
been our strategy for some time, is that we believe that for mobile, you 
have to have expertise across multiple areas. You have to be able to 
in
novate across multiple dimensions, the modem, the application processor, 
graphics, connectivity. And probably even more importantly, you need to be 
able to put those together in some sort of integrated product, where you 
control the architecture. Because t
here are a number of different trade
-
offs 
that are required. And we've been able to do that over the years and 
significantly here over the last several years, 8960 being a great example of 
an area where we've had 
--
 
we were the first people to come out wit
h the 
new micro
-
architecture for the ARM, CPU, as well as integrated LTE and 
brand
-
new graphics core. It's really important for mobile, we think, to put 
those all together in one package and really optimize the architecture for 
what's required for mobile. 
And we've benefited from that. And you're seeing 
that in the benchmark. So that's our strategy. We're going to continue that 
moving forward. We're pretty happy with where the roadmap goes to be 
able to do that moving forward. Incidentally, I think that's a
lso one of the 
reasons why you're seeing some people who have expertise in one area, 
let's say CPU or GPU, try to add the other expertise areas. Because it's very 
difficult to compete unless you have them all. With respect to seasonality, let 
me clarify my
 
comments. For the fourth quarter, we have been talking about 
how we thought that exiting the fourth quarter we thought supply and 
demand of 28
-
nanometer would be matched. By implication, the starting 
point or the beginning part of the quarter, meaning the
 
October and 
September time frame, we are still burning off excess or not enough supply. 
And by the way, these are calendar quarters. So I'm talking about the 
December quarter. Now going into March, we feel that we have supply and 
demand imbalance. And we 
think that, that will be the case, really, exiting 
the December month. So hopefully that clarifies it.

we're seeing, particularly at the high

these launches are global. And the global launches 
essentially have caused the high end of anybody's smartphone portfolio to 
absorb technology very quickly. But it's technology that's really the unio

world. And what we've seen is that we've been able to leverage, to some 
degree, a design win in one geography and be able to move that to another

ust consistent with the way the high end of

up, Steve, if

connectivity, but could you comment at all on your attach rate of the WiFi 
piece, the Bluetooth piece, the connectivity with your 
8960 solution?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Sure. The ASP uptick is really a combination of better modem features, as 
well as better application processor features, in really selling more and more 
of the integrated products. On connectivity, what we've really adde
d 
throughout fiscal year '12 was the ability to attach wireless LAN to our 
solutions. As you know, we've had very strong attach on GPS and GLONASS 
here recently, Bluetooth and FM. With the integration strategy that we have, 
we've added wireless LAN. And as
 
I've mentioned really throughout the year 
and have reiterated here today, the vast majority of our 28

nanometer S4 
designs use our integrated wireless LAN. So we're very pleased at how that's 
going right now. And we're really trying deliver on the fan

Just a coup
le of questions. First, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question 
related to device ASPs. I think Mike Walkley has asked about when we might 
expect to see the growth in emerging market start to have downward 
pressure on ASPs. At least, how we should thi
nk about that qualitatively? 
And the second question that I had was related to cash. You highlighted very 
well the use of cash and return of cash to shareholders over the last little 
while. How should we think about your outlook for buybacks and dividend 
p
olicy going forward?
 
William E. Keitel
 
James, this is Bill. On the device ASP, emerging markets having a larger 
effect on the total average. The 
--
 
although emerging market units are 
growing faster than the developed markets are, the total dollar value of 
the 
developed TRDS is far greater than the emerging market TRDS. And so 
we're ways away from that crossing over where emerging market dollar 
value is equal to or greater than the developed market. But I think we're 
planning a little more color on this next
 
week. So I'll leave that point there. 
And Paul, do you want to talk about...
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
Yes. So I think you've seen that we're focused on returning capital to 
shareholders. And we're going to continue to be focused on doing that, as 
well as investing 
into research and development and 
--
 
because we see the 
opportunity ahead of us as being so great. But the board, obviously, looks at 
cash flows when they determine the dividend policy. And we'll continue to 
look to be opportunistic on the buybacks as well
. So I think the one thing 
that could make a step function difference in these things is hopefully, we'll 
see some corporate tax reform and go to territorial system going forward. 
And that would have a significant impact on that as well.

And just to follow up on ASPs, my understa
nding is that the strong 
smartphone adoption that's happening in the emerging markets has been 
driven in part because the smartphone ASPs have come down. I think, Paul, 
you were talking recently about the price points getting to $100 and, at 
some point, ma
ybe going down as low as $50. And I'm just trying to 
reconcile that with the comments around ASPs at the low end running up, 
and hence, supporting the outlook of flat to up ASPs in 2013.
 
Derek K. Aberle
 
This is Derek. Let me just try to take part of that, 
and then if Paul wants to 
add on. I think there's still 
--
 
even though the pricing from smartphone is 
coming down tier, which obviously is a positive for driving growth, there still 
is a meaningful gap between sort of the lower
-
end smartphone and the low
-
e
nd 2G or 3G feature phones that have been sold before those became 
available. So as we look out and we see the trends, I think we do continue 
to expect, even as the prices come down, a combination of more people 
buying at a higher price than they were hist
orically on a feature phone as 
well as people migrating to even the higher

tier devices will provide some 
stability there.

margins and operating margins are much higher than they are for QCT. But 
both businesses were looking to grow by double digit next year. It's just QCT

This concludes today's allotted time for questions and answers. Dr. Jacobs, 
do you have anything further
 
to add before adjourning the call?
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
Yes, I just wanted to say I'm really happy that the year turned out so well. 
And it was a little harder year than I had anticipated. Obviously, the very 
beginning of the year, we had our engineering teams 
working feverishly to 
get chipsets done. They did that so well. And then we ran into supply 
constraints and had talked to customers about not being able to give them 
everything that they wanted, and you add that to a somewhat uncertain 
macroeconomic enviro
nment. But in the end of the day, global demand for 
data and for mobile data and smartphones and tablets and all these device 
just pulled it really through. And I think that's a testament to the employee 
base, the focus that they had and just the worldwide
 
excitement around 
mobile technology. And now looking forward, continue to execute with great 
team of people. We've got some great products coming out that we're 
already getting good traction on. A lot of new technologies, a lot of very 
interesting markets
 
that are expanding. I'm very, very excited by the 
opportunities that lie in front of us. So I hope to see you all next week, and 
we'll get chance to go into a little bit more detail on that. I just wanted to 
say thanks, everybody, for the support.

5/2/19,Qualcomm,"Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Today's call will include prepared 
remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon, 
Alex Rogers and Don Rosenberg will join the question

answer session. 
You can access our 
earnings release and a slide presentation that 
accompany this call on our Investor Relations website. In addition, this call is 
being webcast on qualcomm.com and a replay will be available on our 
website later today.
 
During the call today, we will use non

GAAP financial measures as defined in 
Regulation G and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our 
website. We will also make forward
-
looking statements, including projections 
and estimates of future events, business or industry trends or busin
ess or 
financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those 
projected in our forward
-
looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings 
including our most recent 10
-
Q, which contain important factors that could 
cause actual resul
ts to differ materially from the forward
-
looking statements.
 
And now, to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve 
Mollenkopf.

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second 
quarter 
results were strong with non
-
GAAP earnings per share 14% above the 
midpoint of our guidance range, driven by continued strong performance in 
QCT and cost management throughout the company, which was balanced by 
some headwinds from weaker industry c
onditions and litigation costs in QTL.
 
We returned approximately $1 billion to stockholders in the quarter, 
including $845 million of dividends paid and $200 million in stock 
repurchases. We also announced a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend 
rate in th
e quarter, effective for dividends starting in the June quarter.
 
Looking ahead, we see some near
-
term headwinds, but our longer
-
term 
outlook is consistent with our fiscal 2019 targets that we shared with you in 
January. Our fiscal third quarter guidance re
flects some softness in global 
3G/4G device shipments, particularly in China, the impact of some changes 
we have made to our licensing framework, as well as the impact of increased 
litigation expenses in our licensing business.
 
QCT continues to execute wel
l with strong performance in China and growth 
in adjacent areas, offset by some impact of lower modem shipments. For 
calendar 2018, we are adjusting our growth estimate for global 3G/4G 
device shipments lower. However, handset selling prices continue to be
 
stronger than expected, which continues to be a favorable trend.
 
As we navigate the short
-
term industry weakness in QCT, we continue to 
execute well in that business and our market share remains strong. The 
Snapdragon 845 platform, our latest premium tier
 
offering, has achieved 
substantial commercial success with over 100 design wins already, including 
launched flagship devices by Samsung, Sony, ASUS and Xiaomi.
 
Our modem leadership continues. We recently announced our X24 LTE 
modem, which is the world's f
irst 2 gigabit 4G modem and the world's first 
announced 7 nanometer chip. As the market transitions to 5G, the 
engineering challenges embedded in the 5G opportunity play directly to 
Qualcomm's strengths and the focused investment we have made over the 
last
 
several years. We are leading the industry to 5G and we are pleased to 
see the strength of our roadmap helping to enable the upcoming commercial 
launches of 5G networks and devices, including the 18 network operators 
and 20 manufacturers that have selecte
d our X50 5G modem for trials and 
5G devices.
 
We also recently announced the world's first 5G module solutions, which 
include highly integrated turnkey 5G modules, including application 
processor, baseband, transceiver, memory, power management, RF front
-
e
nd, antennas and other components that are designed to expand the 
ecosystem and accelerate 5G deployments.
 
Our products continue to be differentiated, driven by our unique systems
-
based approach to the complexities across wireless networks and devices. 
We 
are delivering industry
-
leading technologies and performance, which 
translates into a more efficient use of spectrum for operators and a lower bill 
of materials for device makers, delivering attractive economics for our 
partners and higher device content s
hare for us.
 
In auto, our backlog of awarded design wins has increased to $4 billion, as 
automakers and Tier 1 suppliers begin gearing up for 5G
-
enabled cars in 
2021. We continue to be the supplier of choice, given our decades of 
wireless technology leader
ship. In infotainment, we have designs with 14 of 
the top 25 global automaker brands, including Audi, BYD, Geely, Honda, 
Jaguar Land Rover, PSA and Volkswagen.
 
In networking, we see favorable trends with continued share gains and 
growth in the Wi
-
Fi infras
tructure opportunity across enterprise, retail and 
carriers. And we launched the world's first draft 802.11ax carrier gateway, 
which started shipping in March in KDDI and NEC.
 
In summary, we are well positioned to grow in our adjacent opportunities of 
auto
, IoT, networking and compute as we leverage our core competencies to 
gain share in these emerging areas.
 
In November 2017, we announced a global framework for licensing 
Qualcomm's standard essential patents at an effective rate of 3.25%, 
covering multimod
e devices inclusive of 5G Release 15 standards. We also 
recently set the selling price cap for a handset at $400 for all licensees. This 
global rate is consistent with the SEP
-
only licensing program we successfully 
established in China since 2015, which ha
s resulted in over 120 agreements 
for 3G and 4G devices. We are now in negotiations for license extensions 
under the new program announced in November that include rights to our 
5G patents and expect to conclude a number of agreements in Q3.
 
The transparen
cy of our worldwide SEP
-
only licensing program, including 
announced rates for 5G Release 15, facilitates the effort to conclude 
agreements and extensions in 2018 and early 2019, providing for a 
seamless transition for the launch of 5G devices in 2019. Long
er term, we 
believe this SEP
-
only licensing program enhances the stability of QTL with 
extended contract terms that incorporate 5G pricing. While execution of new 
agreements with existing handset licensees will create some near
-
term 
revenue impact in QTL, 
they are consistent with our assumptions that we set 
for fiscal year 2019 EPS targets.
 
Looking ahead, we are focused on executing on our strategy to deliver our 
fiscal 2019 earnings per share targets. We have identified a number of 
specific strategic areas
 
as part of that plan, and we will be updating you on 
our ongoing progress. First, we continue to focus on closing the NXP 
transaction. As we announced last week at the request of MOFCOM, we 
withdrew and refiled our application for Chinese regulatory appro
val. We also 
agreed with NXP to extend the purchase agreement to July 25. While we 
continue to work closely with the Chinese regulators and remain optimistic 
about getting the necessary regulatory approvals there, it is clear that the 
geopolitical environm
ent and trade actions are having an impact.
 
Operator
 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. I apologize, but there will be a 
slight delay in today's conference. Please hold, and the conference will 
resume momentarily. Thank you for your patience.
 
Stev

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
On the timelines we previously discussed and should converge toward 
multiple important milestones later this year.
 
In addition, our breach of contract case against Apple's contract 
manufacturers and our claim against Apple
 
for interfering with those 
contracts is on schedule to be prepared for trial setting by the end of the 
year. As the legal cases progress, we continue our direct engagement with 
Apple and prefer to ultimately reach a negotiated settlement.
 
Regarding our ot
her dispute with a large licensee, we are in discussions 
toward a negotiated resolution and those discussions are very active.
 
Third, we are progressing on our previously announced plans to reduce our 
spending by $1 billion. We have made good progress on t
his commitment, 
taking steps to reduce spending across SG&A and R&D. We are also focused 
on spending reductions in our noncore product areas.
 
Fourth, we are executing our product roadmap and continue to make the 
investments necessary to maintain our techno
logy and product leadership, 
lead the industry to 5G and grow our adjacent areas across the RF front end, 
automotive, IoT, networking and mobile compute.
 
In closing, we are pleased to report strong results this quarter and we 
remain 100% focused on deliver
ing on our fiscal 2019 commitments and 
creating that value for stockholders. We look forward to continuing to update 
you on our progress.
 
I now turn the call over to George.

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon 
everyone. Our fiscal second quarter 
results were above the midpoint of our guidance with revenues of $5.3 
billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 per share, $0.10 above 
the midpoint of our guidance. The non
-
GAAP EPS outperformance in the 
quarter w
as driven by higher MSM shipments, improved gross margins in 
QCT, a more favorable tax rate from lower domestic versus foreign earnings 
and lower operating expenses.
 
In QCT, MSM chip shipments were $187 million, towards the high end of our 
guidance range. 
QCT revenues were $3.9 billion, in line with expectations. 
As we expected, QCT results this quarter reflected the normal seasonal 
effects of lower demand, typical in the calendar first quarter, a reduction in 
orders sequentially from a large modem customer
 
and reduced demand from 
customers in China as they reduced inventory balances. As a result, we saw 
handset inventory balances in China come down in line with long term 
trends. While we remain conservative on demand for the second half of the 
year, we thin
k the lower level of inventory is a very healthy development.
 
QCT's earnings before tax was up 28% year
-
over
-
year, the eighth 
consecutive quarter of year
-
over
-
year growth. QCT EBT margin was 16%, 
above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting stronge
r than expected 
gross margins in mobile, primarily in product cost benefits, including some 
discrete benefits related to conclusion of negotiations with a supplier.
 
QTL fiscal second quarter revenues were $1.26 billion, slightly above the 
midpoint of guida
nce and included a modestly higher amount of out of 
period catch
-
up that we anticipated offset by lower than expected 3G/4G 
units reported by licensees for the December quarter, particularly in the 
emerging regions.
 
Note that these results exclude royalty 
revenues on Apple's products and the 
other licensee in dispute. It is also worth noting that in the December 
quarter we continue to see strong year
-
over
-
year trends in global 3G/4G 
handset ASPs across various price levels.
 
We are seeing significantly highe
r run rate spending this year driven by 
litigation matters related to Apple and the FTC. In the second fiscal quarter, 
we spent approximately $125 million on these cases and expect that to ramp 
further in Q3. Spending is somewhat more heavily weighted in t
he second 
half of our fiscal year, in line with broad
-
based discovery activities and the 
timing of IP cases globally. We will provide information on our OpEx, both 
with and without excess litigation, so that the underlying cost structure 
changes are more v
isible.
 
QTL earnings before tax was $850 million, or 67% of revenues, above the 
midpoint of expectations or 78% if you adjust for extraordinary litigation 
expense. For Qualcomm overall, non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses decreased approximately 2% seq
uentially or down 4% if you 
adjust for extraordinary litigation expense.
 
We began implementing our $1 billion cost plan that will accelerate in the 
latter part of the year. In Q2 we booked restructuring and related charges 
under the cost plan of $310 milli
on or $0.18 per share. These items were 
excluded from non
-
GAAP results. It is important to note that these initiatives 
will not impact our strong investment in 5G and our commitment to grow in 
mobile, RFFE, IoT, automotive, networking and mobile compute.
 
O
ur non
-
GAAP effective tax rate during the fiscal second quarter was 4%, 
favorable relative to our prior guidance due to the catch
-
up associated with 
a lower estimated annual effective tax rate on lower domestic versus foreign 
earnings mix. We ended the qua
rter with cash and marketable securities of 
$39.6 billion or $16.5 billion net of outstanding debt.
 
Turning to our financial guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We estimate 
revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion and 
no
n
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.65 to 
$0.75 per share. Our guidance incorporates a relatively balanced mix of 
positive and negative factors in the quarter with tax benefits related to 
potential restructuring opportunities u
nder tax reform offsetting the impacts 
of initial plan changes in our licensing program, higher litigation costs in the 
quarter and approximately $0.03 of expected ZTE order effects across the 
company.
 
In QTL, we are expecting QTL fiscal third quarter reve
nues of approximately 
$950 million at the midpoint, down sequentially approximately $300 million. 
This outlook reflects three primary issues. First, about half of the sequential 
decline reflects the combined impact of a seasonably low quarter along with 
ge
nerally weak industry conditions along with approximately $40 million in 
higher onetime catch
-
up payments in Q2 relative to our outlook for Q3. 
Second, we have begun to recognize this quarter the impact related to the 
recent amendments to our Samsung licen
sing agreement, including the 
effects of the expanded cross
-
license agreement. And third, we are seeing 
the initial run rate impact of the licensing SEP
-
only framework including 5G 
that Steve described earlier. Slightly less than half of the sequential imp
act 
on revenue is from the changes to the Samsung agreement and other 
licensing program terms.
 
I should note that we have also implemented a voluntary revised cap in 
which the maximum net selling price of a handset on which the royalty is 
based will be cap
ped at $400 per device, down from $500 per device. This 
will be broadly implemented in fiscal Q4 and we do not expect a material 
impact overall.
 
We expect QTL EBT margin to be approximately 50% to 54% in the fiscal 
third quarter, down sequentially at the m
idpoint on lower revenues and 
increased litigation cost. Without the extraordinary litigation expenses, QTL 
EBT margin expectations would be approximately 65% to 69%.
 
Turning to QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 185 million 
to 205 million u
nits during the June quarter, higher sequentially at the 
midpoint on increased demand in China as inventory improved in the last 
two months of the fiscal second quarter. We expect QCT's fiscal third quarter 
EBT margin to be approximately 13% to 15%, down s
equentially, primarily 
due to seasonally weaker product mix including lower thin modem shipments 
and the absence of the discrete product cost benefit in Q2.
 
We expect fiscal third quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses 
will be roughly flat to up a
pproximately 2% sequentially, primarily due to 
increased litigation expenses as we continue to defend our business model, 
somewhat mitigated by the impacts of our cost efforts. Excluding the 
elevated litigation costs, we estimate that our non
-
GAAP combined
 
R&D and 
SG&A expenses would otherwise be down approximately 1%. Non
-
GAAP 
interest expense net of investment income in the fiscal third quarter is 
expected to be roughly flat sequentially.
 
Turning to tax matters. As a result of the recent tax legislation e
nacted in 
the U.S., we anticipate implementing certain restructuring options that will 
reduce our current year tax rate and have been factored into our fiscal third 
quarter guidance. As a result, we expect our non
-
GAAP effective tax rate for 
the fiscal thi
rd quarter to be a benefit of approximately 20% to 25%, which 
we expect to provide a benefit to non
-
GAAP EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per 
share.
 
Regarding our 3G/4G device shipment forecast, we are updating our unit 
estimates for calendar year global device shipm
ents for both 2017 and 2018. 
For calendar year 2017, we now estimate approximately 1.755 billion global 
3G/4G devices shipped, up approximately 3% year
-
over
-
year at the low end 
of our prior estimates, primarily due to lengthening replacement rates in 
North
 
America and China in the fourth calendar quarter.
 
For calendar year 2018, we now estimate approximately 1.8 billion to 1.9 
billion global 3G/4G device shipments or growth of approximately 5% year
-
over
-
year. This is lower from our prior estimate by 50 mill
ion units at the 
midpoint, reflecting a lower 2017 base as well as reduced demand expected 
in China. Within this population, handset growth is expected to be 
approximately 3% year
-
over
-
year.
 
With respect to global 3G/4G device sales for fiscal 2018, we now
 
expect 
growth of approximately 10% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint, as the 
reduction in our estimate of global 3G/4G units in the year is expected to be 
more than offset by strength in ASPs. Within this population, 3G/4G global 
handset sales are expected t
o grow at similar percentage in fiscal 2018, 
driven primarily by strength in handset ASPs year
-
over
-
year.
 
I will provide some additional color on our committed 2019 targets. As I 
noted earlier, we are making good progress on the $1 billion cost plan. This 
is a critical element of our $5.25 non
-
GAAP EPS target, along with closing 
NXP, or alternatively moving ahead with our option to repurchase stock.
 
For our licensing business, the 5G royalty rates, the reduced NSP cap and 
the effects of the amended long
-
ter
m Samsung license agreement were all 
factored into our fiscal 2019 guidance. Taking into consideration these items 
and the expectation of continued growth in global 3G/4G handset sales in 
fiscal 2019, we expect QTL quarterly revenues in the near and medium
 
term 
to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion on average, excluding the 
royalties from Apple's products and the other licensee in dispute. Of course, 
the amount in any one quarter will be subject to seasonal fluctuations, OEM 
mix, out
-
of
-
period ca
tch
-
up amounts and continued progress on the 
licensing and compliance front, among other factors.
 
In QCT, we expect that fiscal 2019 performance will benefit from continued 
handset growth, particularly in emerging regions, continued strength in our 
China s
hare in the mid, high and premium tiers, and growth in adjacent 
opportunities, including automotive, IoT, networking and mobile compute.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.

Thank you, George. 
Operator, we are ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Our first question is from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please 
go ahead with your question.
 
Tal Liani 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hi. Sorry. I was on mute. 
Can you hear me? Hello?
 
John T. Sinnott 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes, we can hear you, Tal. Go ahead.
 
Tal Liani 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Well, good. Can you repeat the reasons for the weak QTL guidance for next 
quarter? And how does it change going forward,
 
especially what happens 
with Release 15 licensing? What I didn't understand is so far 

 
and maybe 
it's just my understanding 

 
so far your license covered all the patents and 
clients had to pay regardless of what patent you're using. Does it mean that 
LTE
 
licensing is separate? And is the royalty rate for LTE licensing different, 
lower than the general licensing rate?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So, what I'll do 

 
Tal, this is George 

 
I'll cover the questions on the bridge, 
and then maybe Alex can ta
lk a little bit about the structure of the SEP
-
only 
program.
 
So if you look at the sequential bridge, we said that it's down about $300 
million. Some of that is the normal seasonal drop
-
off that we get, because 
this 

 
remember, we're reporting on a lag, so
 
this is calendar Q1 activities. 
This is where we saw the significant pullback in demand across four devices 
in general. So, we have a weak market. We also have the pullback that's 
just natural with Q1. The other piece is we also had some higher onetime 
am
ounts in Q2 than we're reporting Q3. So, that's about a little more than 
half of the $300 million.
 
The other half is the changes that we talked about, reflecting both the 
amendment to the Samsung agreement, which among other things includes 
the cross
-
licen
se rights that are quite extensive, and the changes that we 
anticipate to see in the quarter to contracts for licensees that will take an 
SEP
-
only license, which has a number of favorable characteristics that I'm 
sure Alex will cover.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QU
ALCOMM, Inc.
 
So, this is Alex, picking up where George left off. Just a little bit of context, I 
think, is helpful. Since 2015, we established a very successful licensing 
program in China for SEP licenses for 3G and 4G through Release 11 at a set 
of rates 
that came out of the resolution of the China matter. And what we've 
done and what we announced in November of 2017 is that we were 
extending that set of rates to a worldwide program for SEP
-
only licensing for 
3G and 4G through the remaining releases also t
o include the first release of 
5G, where the standard, the specification was finalized in December of last 
year.
 
That is our SEP
-
only licensing program going forward. Of course, we still 
have a portfolio
-
wide licensing program at the standard rate of 5%, b
ut we 
expect on a go
-
forward basis that there will be a number of licensees who 
are interested in extensions and renewals who may want to have SEP
-
only 
license agreements. And of course, we'll negotiate those sorts of 
agreements, and we expect that there w
ill be a few of those agreements 
being reached even in this quarter.
 
So, the program is rooted in a very successful program that came out of 
China with over 120 license agreements. We expect this program to be 
successful and to facilitate a very good trans
ition to 5G in the second half of 
2019. We expect there will be a number of licensees who want to maintain 
portfolio
-
wide agreements worldwide, but there will also be licensees who 
want to have SEP
-
only agreements on a worldwide basis. And that is, of 
cour
se, something that we can accommodate on a case
-
by
-
case basis.
 
Tal Liani 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
And I apologize if it sounds stupid, but would you mind to discuss what does 
it mean SEP
-
only?
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
No problem. Standard e
ssential patents, so our standard essential patents 
that have been declared for 3G/4G, and the first 5G standard. Those patents 
as distinguished from nonessential patents, implementation patents, other 
patents that are relevant to other standards other tha
n cellular standards. 
So when we refer to SEPs, we're referring generally to cellular standard 
essential patents for the technology generations that we all understand to be 
3G, 4G, and 5G.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. P
lease go ahead 
with your question.
 
Chris Caso 
-
 
Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
Yes. Thank you. Just to follow up on the previous discussion a little bit, with 
regard to the fiscal 2019 guidance, you talked about that this new licensing 
scheme was include
d in that. Could you walk us through a bit of how you get 
to that fiscal 2019 EPS guidance, what are the puts and takes there and how 
this new licensing scheme falls into that as well?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yeah. This is George, Chris. The $5.25
 
base, as we said, included 
approximately $1.50 from NXP accretion. It included the benefit of $1 billion 
in the year of OpEx reduction and then it had the underlying run rate of the 
business absent the Apple license payments, new Apple business that we 
pr
esume would be held up as part of the process of the litigation. And so we 
said to help people model, we indicated in my script that for modeling the 
levels of licensing revenue excluding Apple and the other licensee, you can 
plan on, on average between $1
 
billion and $1.1 billion per quarter.
 
Obviously that can fluctuate a little bit depending on some of the onetime 
items that show up or the strength of the market overall changing. We think 
that's a reasonable number. The balance of that, then, is going to
 
be driven 
by fundamentally the performance of the QCT mobile business and the 
adjacent businesses as part of that. And I think the $5.25 is consistent with 
the basic position we have in QCT today and continued growth in the 
adjacents.
 
Operator
 
Our next qu
estion is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. 
Please go ahead with your question.
 
T. Michael Walkley

Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
 
Great. Thank you. Just for the $5.25 in guidance for that out year, can you 
walk us through maybe what you 
expect for QCT in terms of margin targets 
that you expect to hit as the cost reductions come out of the business model 
implied in that guidance? And then also for the $5.25, what is management's 
plans should China continue to block NXP? When do you finally
 
just pull the 
plug and is the buyback really the best thing to do with that cash to get to 
that $5.25? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yeah. We haven't put out margin targets for QCT. Obviously we've said that 
we expect to get to our long
-
term
 
margin target of greater than 20% over 
time, and certainly you would expect to see that as part of the kind of 
recovery case that the $6.75 to $7.50 envisions where we start to get some 
product business back that was taken away and also probably additiona
l RF 
front end business is part of that. So I think overall, the $5.25 is really just a 
continuation for QCT of their current position strength in China, strength in 
the premium tier, which has been a positive relative to what we've seen with 
the fall
-
off 
in the thin modem business and then growth in the adjacents.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

Mike, this is Steve. Maybe on your question related to NXP, there was 
probably a point in there, as I understand in the audio where people couldn't 
hear my c
omments related to NXP, but in short what I said was that we 
continue to work closely with China. The environment is obviously quite 
difficult from a geopolitical point of view, at least right now. However, we 
expect to ultimately receive approval and I'd 
just remind folks that we have 
eight of nine jurisdictions that have already ruled on it.
 
So although we remain committed to it and we think it's going to get done. 
However if it does not get done, as you mentioned, we think we have the 
ability to move ver
y rapidly on a buyback as we communicated earlier in the 
January timeframe. I'll just remind everyone that we did a 90
-
day extension 
to the merger agreement and we're going to work very hard to get that 
done. And if it doesn't get done, we're going to move
 
onto another 
approach. So hopefully that answers the question.

Thanks a lot for taking my 
question, guys. I guess, Steve, maybe just to 
follow up on the line you had earlier, is July 25 sort of the drop dead 
deadline where if this is not done by then, you will move to plan B, i.e. 
buybacks or would you just extend the merger agreement further? 
And then 
any sense on what the MOFCOM issues are or what remedies they want 
above and beyond which you agreed to in other jurisdictions?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Well, I would say, Amit, with respect to the agreement, yes, we have just 
extende
d it by 90 days. So I think both companies are moving toward that 
timeline and we certainly have other ability and avenues to drive value and 
that's how we're thinking about the issue. Of course things can always 
change as we move through the process but t
hat's the way that it's set up 
right now.
 
With respect to MOFCOM and remedies, our evaluation of the environment is 
such that, really, I think the issue is probably more related to the higher 
level discussions between the countries as opposed to any indivi
dual issue 
related to MOFCOM. Of course, we continue to work with the regulators and 
work through any issues that pop up, but I think the environmental issues 
between the countries are probably more the situation today than anything 
else but obviously we w
ork closely with the regulator.

Thank you. Just wanted to closeout one more on 
the QTL part and then a 
question on the QCT piece. So, Alex, I just wanted make sure I understand 
this. So the impact of the SEP
-
only and 5G licenses that's hitting revenues, 
is that because those deals will have a lower rate structure? Or is it because 
th
ere's some kind of onetime impact of nonpayment as those deals are being 
negotiated?
 
And then on the QCT side, units are holding up very well. I think you 
mentioned some ZTE hit in the quarter. You mentioned inventory reductions 
but it's a pretty weak mark
et in China. And I guess we got a new set of 
iPhones coming out, and you guys have intimated that you potentially could 
do a little bit worse there or you're at least planning that you might not have 
as much share in that win. So could you just maybe is th
is predominantly 
market share that you think is keeping your numbers better I'd say than the 
end market for the last few quarters? That would be helpful. Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hey, Tim. This is George. Maybe I'll take the point on wha
t is the impact that 
we're seeing from these changes. Again, what we said is a little less than 
half of the $300 million is related to what I would call the run rate changes 
associated with the amendments to the Samsung agreement that we 
announced last qua
rter and also the SEP
-
only expected impacts that we 
expect to be in the run rate this quarter. So it would be effectively a lower 
effective rate for those licensees than if they had had a portfolio license prior 
to that time.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, I
nc.
 
This is Alex. What I think it's important to note that again, some licensees 
may choose to have an SEP
-
only agreement, including the 5G IP rights going 
forward. And they may choose to expand on that basis. But others will prefer 
a portfolio
-
wide agreem
ent for obvious reasons. They enjoy the benefits of 
the entire portfolio and protected under the entire portfolio. And these are 
going to be determined on a case
-
by
-
case basis as we get into these 
negotiations, but we do believe that some licensees will ch
oose SEP
-
only on 
a worldwide basis.
 
George S. Davis

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hey, Tim. Let me add one more thing I think before Cristiano comes in on 
some of the demand things, the demand environment for QCT. As I look at 
Q3, one of the difficult stories is becaus
e we're seeing some, this is the 
quarter where QCT is seeing some of the weakness in reports that we talked 
about because they report a month lag, so those are the weakness that QCT 
saw in Q2 but is seeing recovery in Q3.
 
But we continue to see an underlyi
ng growth in the licensing markets when 
you look at units and ASPs. If we just looked back to Q3 2017 and we looked 
at the market as for the licensees that are paying today, and we look at 
today the market has grown to the point where essentially the cost 
of these 
changes in the program on a run
-
rate basis is being covered by the growth 
in the market because of the strength of both units and in particular ASPs. 
Cristiano, did you want to?
 
Cristiano R. Amon 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes. Hi, Tim. So on QCT, it's exac
tly a simple story. Q2 has been a great 
quarter for us, particularly if you look compared to our year
-
over
-
year. I 
think we saw continued strength in our portfolio. As we look forward, and 
that's I think George said that we still take a conservative approa
ch. 
However, we do see that the inventory levels came down back to normal in 
China.
 
So it's a story that we look at the units, we still think there is overall the 
drivers of our strength in China business continue. I think we see an 
improvement of mix. 
We see an improvement of handset ASPs. We have 
some interesting transitions ahead of us, such as China Mobile recently got a 
license for FDD. We have 5G coming in 2019. So I think the story is good. 
We're just dealing with how we think about the overall in
dustry is in the 
second half, and we have seen a decline in thin modems, probably 
consistent with everybody else in the industry.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Guys, thanks for taking my questions. I just want to make sure I have this 
straight. So basically, you're folding 5G now into the licensing model and 
you're getting paid less for it and you're talking about it
 
like it's a good 
thing. Why is this a good thing? Is this being proactive to halt the spread of 
other disputes? Or like what's the driving force behind doing this?
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Stacy, this is Alex. We are including 5G in the SEP
-
only 
licensing model. 
We're not getting paid less for it. I think the best way to think about this is 
building a foundation for long
-
term stability in QTL. The current program 
that we've announced for SEPs that we announced back in November has 
tremendous consi
stency with the program that we successfully established in 
China coming out of the China investigation. We actually now have over 150 
SEP
-
only licensees through the 3G and 4G program there.
 
And in addition, with the announcement in November ahead of the a
doption 
of the first release of 5G, we have tremendous transparency for the program 
going forward. And so, what we've done is we purposely built the program to 
facilitate a transition to 5G in a way that successfully enables us to bring on 
new licensees an
d extend their agreements for longer terms. And so, this 
creates tremendous stability. Now, we do expect that a number of licensees 
will want to have portfolio
-
wide licenses, and so there's going to be a mix. 
But the effect of all of this has been consider
ed in our FY 2019 numbers. So, 
we've looked at this and purposely built this program for stability long term.

James E. Faucette

Morgan 
Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you very much. I wanted to, I guess, follow up on that question or at 
least as it pertains to the unnamed licensee. I guess with the new structure, 
how should we expect the impact to compliance and ability to assure 
compliance, firs
tly?
 
And secondly, I guess I'm wondering a little bit why anybody would offer a 
portfolio
-
wide license, especially when from the time that you introduced the 
standard essential patent licensing program in China, you had indicated that 
negotiations around n
onessential IP would be done separately. But I don't 
think we've really seen any movement there. So, it seems like you're 
moving towards a standard essential patent
-
only licensing program, and I'm 
wondering how we should expect you to be able to collect on
 
nonessential IP 
and how this may impact bringing the non
-
complying unnamed licensee into 
compliance. Thank you.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So with respect to the unnamed licensee, having a consistent program that's 
widely adopted is very good thing
 
from a comp perspective. So, it actually 
creates an environment that enables us to essentially engage in the ongoing 
negotiations with that licensee from a position of strength, essentially saying 
that this is a widely adopted program. So, that unnamed li
censee is an 
outlier.
 
In terms of SEP
-
only in the rest of the portfolio, there are a number of 
licensees that still have portfolio
-
wide agreements and will continue with 
those portfolio
-
wide agreements. And we expect that to happen. As I said, it 
will be a
 
mix. The rest of the portfolio is still valuable. It's a very large 
portfolio, as you know, 130 patents and pending applications.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
130,000.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
130,000 patents and pending applications. And the
 
value and strength of 
that portfolio, I think, is demonstrated in the assertions that we've had when 
we've had to have them, including against a company in China that signed 
up to a license and the assertions that we're making now in our litigation 
where 
over 40 nonessential 

 
excuse me, over 50 nonessential patents are 
being asserted. So, the rest of the portfolio is still valuable and licensees will 
still want to have portfolio
-
wide protection. In fact, we have many portfolio
-
wide agreements that will co
ntinue. It will be a mix.

Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Just one question
 
and one 
follow
-
up. So, I guess, two questions here. Just to wrap up the QTL side of 
things, embedded in the $5.25 base and then the road towards $7, et 
cetera, in your 2019 goal, do you believe that the implied royalty rate that 
we had before of roughly 2
.9% will be higher or lower given all the moving 
parts that you've described on today's call?
 
And then the second question more for George, specifically, on the OpEx 
cuts and the $1 billion number, can you talk a little bit about the linearity of 
that, whe
n are we going to start to see some of those absolute dollars come 
out? And how important is that litigation that's currently elevated, going 
back to some normalized level, how important is that in getting to the $1 
billion annualized savings? Thank you.
 
G
eorge S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yeah. Hi, Ross. This is George. So on the implied royalty rate, obviously, 
there's a lot of moving parts when you have two major licensees, one of 
which is reporting, one of which is not reporting. So it's really not a very 
meaningful number, which is why we have stopped guiding total reported 
device sales and some of these other items.
 
We think the rates that are embedded in the SEP
-
only licenses are fully 
consistent, as we said, in the run rate that we had factored into the
 
FY 2019 
numbers. As you remember, we actually announced the 5G program in last 
November. Also, if you applied them to the volumes, these same standards 
to the volumes of the non
-
paying licensees, you would very easily get to our 
$6.75 to $7.50 range. So, 
I think that's a key point.
 
And with respect to litigation normalization, the cost reduction program 
expects to take out $1 billion in the run rate without relying on a change in 
the litigation run rate of the company. I would describe that as a peace 
dividend that would flow through post the resolution of the litigation 
matters.

Romit Jitendra Shah

Nomura Instinet
 
Yes. Thank you, 
guys. I had two questions. One, George, just the litigation 
costs rising a little bit in June. Should we assume this level for litigation for 
the foreseeable future? That's the first question.
 
The second question, I just wanted to ask about just the smartp
hone market 
overall and unit growth. You guys mentioned in your monologue that 
replacement rates are going out. When we saw this happen with PCs, unit 
growth actually went negative and today we're seeing weakness in 
smartphones that for the most part seems
 
fairly broad
-
based. And I guess 
my question is what makes you confident that this weakness we're seeing is 
just temporary and that the market overall can grow from here? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So on the litigation pattern, where we're
 
in a period during this quarter, Q3, 
where we have very, very significant discovery processes and active 
preparation for multiple cases. So I would like to believe that this represents 
kind of a high water mark, but of course it's very important that we g
et this 
right. So we're going to spend what we need to spend as we see necessary 
to protect our licensing program. But I would say the second half is going to 
be heavier in the fiscal year 2018 than the first half, but we're kind of at a 
level now where we
're supporting a lot of activity on multiple fronts. So I 
don't expect it to be significantly higher on a run
-
rate basis, but it could be 
sustained at this level for a little period of time.
 
In terms of the handset market and units, what you're really seei
ng is the 
impact of replacement rates has really slowed growth. In the developed 
markets you're getting a little bit of growth in Europe. But the emerging 
markets continue to be a positive source of growth, and in particular in 
India, in Southeast Asia, in
 
Middle East, Africa, we're continuing to still see 
healthy mid to high, well you've seen double
-
digit growth in India and mid to 
high single digit growth in some of these other areas. So I think that 
remains a positive.
 
Also we think in 2019, you're start
ing to see the first 5G phones come into 
the marketplace, and as you go in 2019 and into 2020, you could start to 
see a replacement cycle just really driven by people wanting to take 
advantage of the capabilities that 5G brings.

Thank you. George, I actually had two questions. The first is I'm wondering 
how you handicapped for the fiscal 2019 guidance, how you handi
capped the 
potential for the trade issues to broaden. Obviously, there's news now that 
Huawei's being looked at as well. So I'm wondering how you handicap that 
in your guidance, number one. And then number two, the guidance for the 
June quarter. If I read 
your comments right, are you basically saying that 
the normalized earnings guidance, if you assume that 8% tax rate that you 
had said previously, would be like $0.50? Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Tim, so on the first, obviously the trade talks 
are current, and it's very hard 
to forecast. Those were not part of our thinking, and we've seen even in 
China some pretty big swings in demand intra
-
quarter. So there's always 
going to be market fluctuations, but we think the fundamentals, if we think 
abo
ut the licensing business, the fundamentals, particularly on ASPs, are a 
real tailwind for that business going into 2019. We also like the growth that 
we're seeing in our adjacent businesses and we like our position overall in 
China. But we'll have to see.
 
The trade issues are an intangible. We'll have 
to see how that plays out.
 
In terms of the June quarter, what I would say is if you back out simply the 
tax items, which to me are really fundamentally offsetting what is a weaker 
market. Also clearly ZTE is 
coming out of there. We have the absence of 
some onetime items that were in our Q2 that are not in the Q3. So I think it 
would be wrong to draw a line to $0.50, which is what I think your question 
was.

end any M&A potential for you guys? Or would you look at doing something

George S. Davis

So on plan B, it would be a large, very large program. It w
ould be in the $20 
billion to $30 billion range. Obviously, at these prices we think the stock 
price is quite attractive. We don't think M&A would necessarily be closed off 
to the company. We think these are pretty unusual circumstances that we're 
seeing t
oday. So we will continue to look at opportunities to add to the

Thank you. I just have a clarification. I guess, Alex, can you talk about 
where we are in the SEP
-
only tr
ansition in terms of how long will it take? 
And then I guess the real question is you're guiding for $950 million in QTL 
revenue for Q2 or the next quarter. And then you also said that that run rate 
will come back to $1 billion to $1.1 billion. So I'm just
 
trying to understand 
what will drive that incremental growth.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So this is George. Maybe I'll take the second question first and then Alex can 
jump in. So remember that our Q3 is the very weak calendar Q1 quarter for 
QTL, so you're seeing some seasonal elements there. That being said, we 
believe in addition to some of the other moving parts that I talked about, not 
to mention just the general, the broader market weakness and the seasonal 
elements, the lower out
-
of
-
peri
od, you factor all of those elements in and 
also we're continuing to see very strong ASPs and ASP growth in the 
marketplace. That all moves you towards the $1 billion to $1.1 billion 
number.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
And then with respect to the fi
rst part of the question, the chronology is that 
in November when we announced the 5G program, the SEP program 
including 5G release 2015, we're anticipating devices coming to market in 
second half of 2019, so we've got close to a two
-
year window. And there
 
are 
a number of agreements that will extend through this entire timeframe. 
Those agreements, there are a number of agreements that will simply 
remain in place but there are other agreements that will come up for 
extensions and renewals.
 
And so the timing 
of the announcement was to essentially provide 
transparency before the release, the specification was adopted but also to 
facilitate a transition to negotiating these agreements, these extensions and 
renewals during this current timeframe. And we expect th
at to happen with 
significant pace. So we do expect a number of agreements to be reached or 
renewals and extensions to be reached even in this quarter and in the 
following quarters, both on an SEP
-
only basis but also on a portfolio
-
wide 
basis.

Arete Research Services LLP
 
Thanks very much. I have a question for Alex and a follow
-
up for Cristiano. 
Alex, I just wanted to talk ab
out the non
-
SEP part of the portfolio. So you 
said there was a transition where you'll be offering SEP
-
only licenses. Can 
you talk about the nonstandard essential portfolio and how you plan to 
monetize the patents here from a licensing perspective? What ro
yalty rates 
do you think can be achieved here and how many deals have you signed 
already for non
-
SEP only deals thus far?
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So the history of the licensing business is that most licensees have wanted 
full portfolio agreement
s. It's the most efficient and most cost efficient way 
to take a license to this portfolio. And so the commercialization of the non
-
SEPs has always been in the context of full portfolio agreements. It is very 
rare that a company asks us for a separate lice
nse to non
-
SEPs only. So 
typically a company will want a full portfolio agreement if they want full 
protection. Again, that has happened historically the majority of the time. 
We don't have a separate distinct program at this point in time for non
-
SEPs.
 
Ag
ain, our primary commercial objective is to license the full portfolio, but 
we do have a number of aspects of the portfolio, for example, in multimedia, 
in position location and then other areas where if we decide to do it, we can 
license them on a disaggr
egated basis, But that's really all that I can say 
about that at this point.
 
Brett Simpson 
-
 
Arete Research Services LLP
 
And so you have not licensed any company who have taken SEP only. 
There's a whole raft of nonessential patents that you have not licens
ed to 
these companies that are taking SEP
-
only deals. Is there a plan to monetize 
that out with doing platform deals, trading up to a platform deal so to 
speak?
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Again, I'll go back to what I said before. I apologize if it 
wasn't clear, but the 
licensees have typically wanted, overwhelmingly wanted, full portfolio 
agreements. SEP
-
only licensing has been primarily a function of the program 
that we laid out in China and very successfully established in China since 
2015. And we
 
do expect that on a go
-
forward basis, even though we've 
offered SEP
-
only in the past, on a go forward basis there will be more 
companies that want SEP
-
only to include 5G. But the primary 
commercialization of the rest of the portfolio will be in the contex
t of full 
portfolio licensing.

1/31/19,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to start by 
congratulating Derek Aberle on his promotion to President of QUALCOMM. 
Derek has been instrumental in creating and growing many important areas 
of QUALCOMM's business over his 
tenure, including our licensing business as 
well as our platforms and services businesses.
 
Under his leadership, QTL has more than doubled its revenues and profits, 
completed key license agreements and established QUALCOMM's 4G 
licensing program. I'm looki
ng forward to continuing to work closely with 
Derek as we lead the next chapter of growth and success for QUALCOMM.
 
Turning to our performance, we delivered another solid quarter driven by 
continued leadership of our multimode 3G LTE chipset solutions and 
record 
licensing revenues. In recognition of our strong financial position and the 
continued growth of our business, we recently announced a 20% increase in 
our dividend as well as a new share repurchase authorization of $7.8 billion.
 
QTL had a record quar
ter from both, the revenue and earnings standpoint. 
Total reported device sales were also a record, but came in at the low end of 
expectations. In particular, licensee shipments in China were lower than 
expected. We believe consumer purchasing decisions we
re delayed in 
advance of the rollout of LTE and TDS CDMA volumes were stronger than 
anticipated and negatively impacted sales of WCDMA CMA 2,000 units. We 
believe much of this situation continued through the March period as well as 
a slower than expected r
amp of LTE sales in China.
 
Despite these near
-
term headwinds, we continue to forecast strong growth 
of 3G/4G 
-
based device shipments in calendar 2014, albeit somewhat more 
backend loaded than our previous expectation. We continue to grow our 
base of single
 
mode 4G OFDMA licensees and now have over 100 globally, 
including more than 60 in China. These are in addition to the over 255 
CDMA
-
based licensees we have globally.
 
QUALCOMM continues to invest heavily in developing the leading and most 
widely licensed p
ortfolio of patented technologies applicable to 3G and 4G 
devices. In addition to our industry
-
leading position in 3G and 4G 
technologies, our licensed technologies include a wide variety of other 
technologies implemented in the same devices.
 
In QCT, we co
ntinued to build on our broad customer footprint as revenues 
in MSM shipments were up 8% and 9% year
-
over
-
year, respectively, MSM 
chip shipments were in line with expectations with a stronger mix of 
products in the premium tier. QCT's strong product leader
ship continues. 
Multiple products based on our Snapdragon 801 chipset have recently 
launched, including the Samsung Galaxy S5, the new HTC One M8 and the 
Sony Xperia Z2 smartphones and tablet.
 
Products based on our Snapdragon 805 and fourth
-
generation mult
imode 
3G/4G modem, featuring Cat 6 LTE are expected to launch later this year. In 
addition, we recently announced several new products in our roadmap, 
further demonstrating our leadership position in bringing 3G LTE modems 
and 64
-
bit CPU architectures acro
ss multiple product tiers.
 
Globally, the momentum of Snapdragon
-
based devices continues to grow 
with more than 525 designs in the pipeline. In the second half of the fiscal 
year, we expect more than half of our MSM chip shipments to be LTE
-
enabled. Our Wi
-
Fi revenues are strong and growing and fiscal year
-
to
-
date 
Wi
-
Fi shipments are up more than 45% year
-
over
-
year. We now have over 
350 802.11ac designs, including more than 250 on our mobile solutions.
 
We also announced our next innovation in Wi
-
Fi, with a c
omprehensive set 
of products that use multi
-
user MIMO to make it to the 802.11ac networks 
more efficient, delivering up to a 3X improvement in throughput. Here, we 
are able to take use of spatial reuse techniques we developed for cellular 
and use them to i
mprove our Wi
-
Fi chipsets.
 
Looking forward, we believe LTE and unlicensed spectrum will provide 
further capacity enhancements and coexist nicely with Wi
-
Fi to help meet 
the expected significant increase in data demand. We are making excellent 
progress with
 
her RF360 solutions, particularly the envelope tracker. Total 
shipments more than double this quarter and we now have over 75 designs 
across 15 OEMs.
 
Looking forward, our long
-
term growth drivers remain intact. Gartner 
forecast approximately 1.9 billion s
mart phones to be shipped in 2018, while 
cumulative smartphone shipments between 2014 and 2018 will reach 
approximately 8 billion. We continue to forecast strong 3G/4G device 
shipments for calendar year 2014 and the rollout of 4G in China continues to 
be a
n important near
-
term growth catalyst for our business.
 
Each of the operators in China have aggressive LTE rollout planned with 
China Mobile alone planning to expand its network coverage nationwide to 
more than 500,000 LTE base stations by the end of 2014.
 
We have strong 
LTE design momentum with the OEMs in China, which is driving significant 
demand for our multimode 3G LTE chipsets.
 
On a global basis, the deployment of overlay LTE networks continues to be a 
key growth driver for us as over 270 operators ha
ve now deployed LTE and 
more than 210 additional operators are planning deployments according to 
the GSA. Further, they report that 48 operators are investing carrier 
aggregation across 28 countries and seven operators have launched 
commercially.
 
The exten
sion of mobile technologies into industry such as automotive, 
healthcare, smart city's, energy and other consumer electronics wearables 
and other segments is also another set of growth opportunities for us. 
Looking forward, industry analysts forecast appro
ximately 400 million 3G/4G 
non
-
handset device shipments in 2017.
 
Our inventions provide key building blocks in solving complex issues across 
these different verticals. Our strategy is to help the ecosystem use these 
technologies in a most innovative and ef
fective ways. On the mobile 
computing front, there have been several positive developments. Microsoft is 
now offering its Office Suite on non
-
Windows
-
based tablets, further 
enhancing the utility of these devices by augmenting their productivity 
features. I
n addition, there are continued efforts from operators to 
encourage wireless data usage on connected tablets, including T
-
Mobile 
which recently announced an offer of up to 1.2 gigabyte of free data monthly 
for connected tablets as well as an offer for LTE
-
enabled tablets at 
equivalent prices to the Wi
-
Fi
-
only models.
 
In closing, we delivered another solid quarter and we are pleased to be 
raising our fiscal year earnings per share guidance. We have strong 
momentum with our semiconductor solutions and see sig
nificant growth 
ahead for 3G/4G devices, including the continued rollout of multimode 3G 
LTE devices in China and elsewhere throughout the globe.
 
That concludes my remarks and I would now like to turn the call over to 
George Davis.
 
George Davis
 
Thank 
you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report 
record non
-
GAAP earnings per share this quarter, driven by better than 
expected operating performance from our QCT business and record QTL 
performance combined with strong investment gains 
and a lower than 
expected tax rate.
 
Fiscal second
-
quarter revenues were $6.4 billion, up 4% year
-
over
-
year and 
non
-
GAAP earnings per share were a record $1.31, $0.06 above the high
-
end and $0.11 above the $1.20 midpoint of our prior guidance range. The 
$0.
11 improvement was driven by about $0.04 of operating items, including 
the combination of stronger margins in QCT and lower than expected 
operating expenses, partially offset by lower total reported device sales and 
mixed effects in QTL.
 
Non
-
operating item
s added $0.07 from the combination of investment gains 
and the impact of the tax agreement. QCT revenue and earnings before tax 
were above expectations, with revenues of $4.2 billion and shipments of 188 
million MSM chipsets. Implied revenue per MSM was hi
gher sequentially on 
mix contributing to a 17% QCT operating margin. That was above our prior 
expectations.
 
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were a record $66.5 
billion, up 9% year
-
over
-
year, but at the low end of our guidance range 
pri
marily reflecting lower than expected total reported device sales in China. 
The estimated average selling price was $224 at the midpoint, higher 
sequentially reflecting a slightly higher ASP in developed regions and 
estimated 3G/4G
-
based device shipments w
ere 297 million at the midpoint.
 
With respect to reported units, we have reduced the midpoint of our 
calendar 2013 3G/4G device shipment estimate by approximately 17 million 
units to reflect the lower than expected device shipments reported for the 
Decembe
r quarter. The unit shortfall was driven primarily by lower sales in 
China and North America.
 
In the second quarter, non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses 
decreased 3%, sequentially, as seasonal increases in employer taxes were 
more than offset by the ab
sence of our Omni business, continued spending 
discipline and other employee
-
related cost reductions.
 
Year
-
over
-
year OpEx in the quarter is up 1% as R&D increases are being 
partially offset by lower SG&A and lower employee related costs, various 
cost initi
atives, lower patent and legal expense and the absence of 
Omnitracs. Returns on our investment portfolio reflect gains from strong 
investment results being recognized as we balance risk in the portfolio in line 
with our increased capital return targets. Ou
r forecast includes continuing 
gain recognition over the next two fiscal quarters although at somewhat 
lower levels than in Q2.
 
During the fiscal second
-
quarter, we returned approximately $1.6 billion to 
stockholders, including $589 million of dividends pa
id and $1 billion in stock 
repurchases. During the quarter, we announced 20% increase in our 
dividend and increased our stock repurchase authorization to $7.8 billion.
 
Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion or 28% of revenues and we 
ended the fiscal qu
arter with cash and marketable securities of $32.1 billion. 
Our tax rate was lower than expected during the quarter as we reached 
agreement with the IRS on certain U.S. tax matters relating to ongoing 
royalties and transfer pricing. We now expect our non
-
G
AAP tax rate to be 
approximately 16% for fiscal 2014.
 
On the legal front, the company received a Wells Notice from the SEC 
regional staff regarding their FCPA investigation. The notice reflects the 
staff's preliminary determination to recommend that the 
SEC file a civil 
action against the company. We responded with a Wells submission 
expressing our belief that we have not violated the FCPA and that therefore 
no action should be taken. We are continuing to cooperate with the 
investigation.
 
Looking ahead, o
ur guidance for fiscal 2014 is mostly unchanged except that 
we are modestly increasing our earnings per share expectations for the fiscal 
year to reflect the better than expected performance year
-
to
-
date. We have 
increased our outlook for QCT business for 
the remainder of fiscal 2014, 
driven by our strong LTE product leadership and the expected ramp of LTE in 
China. We have reduced our outlook for QTL for fiscal 2014, as a result of 
among other things, the soft seen in the December 2013 quarter for 
reported
 
devices and near
-
term spike in sales of TDS CDMA devices in China 
to clear the channel for new LTE devices, a more backend loaded ramp from 
LTE deployment in China, which will push volumes outside of QTL's fiscal 
2014 and lower revenue per unit on the imp
act of global OEM share mix.
 
We now expect fiscal 2014 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range 
of $5.05 to $5.25, up approximately 14% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint 
relative to 2013, and up $0.05 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. We 
are hold
ing our forecast for total calendar 2014 estimated 3G/4G
-
based 
device shipments, but our forecasted now weighted more towards the 
second half of the calendar year, reflecting our updated view of the timing of 
the expected LTE device ramp in China.
 
It is wo
rth noting that this revised forecast results in shifting a greater 
portion of QTL royalty units out of fiscal 2014, which reflects reported units 
for the 12 months ending in June 2014 and then into our fiscal 2015.
 
In QCT, we continue to forecast operatin
g margins to be 18% to 20% for 
fiscal 2014 and to exit the year above 20%. For the third quarter of fiscal 
2014, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.2 billion 
to $6.8 billion, up approximately 4% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint and 
2
%, sequentially. Our estimates reflect high single
-
digit year
-
over
-
year 
revenue growth for QCT and relatively flat year
-
over
-
year growth for QTL as 
unit growth is offset by lower revenue per unit on mix.
 
We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings
-
per
-
share in our fisca
l third quarter to be 
approximately $1.15 to $1.25 per share, up 17% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint. We anticipate fiscal third quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and 
SG&A expenses will be higher, up 6% to $8%sequentially, primarily driven 
by QCT product roadma
p and supply chain initiatives.
 
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $56 billion to $62 billion 
will be reported by our licensees. In the June quarter, for shipments they 
made in the March quarter, up approximately 4% year
-
over
-
year at the 
mi
dpoint, but lower sequentially as compared to the seasonally higher 
holiday quarter shipments.
 
We estimate that the QTL device ASP will be relatively flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter and we expect QTL's operating margin percentage to be modestly 
lower sequentiall
y, primarily due to lower revenue.
 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 198 million to 213 
million units during the quarter, up 9% at the midpoint, sequentially, and up 
approximately 19% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint and we expect revenue 
per MSM to be similar. We expect QCT operating margin to be approximately 
18% to 20% for the third quarter, higher sequentially reflecting increased 
MSM volume.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of 
Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.

Go
ldman Sachs
 
Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions, the first one was on your 
guidance just clarifying. It sounds like you are raising your overall QCT 
guidance for the year on higher LTE expectations in China, but at the same 
time you are loweri
ng QTL because of the how they have held within the 
fiscal versus calendar year, so what gives you the confidence that even 
though the timing is pushed out, the absolute magnitude of that is going to 
be higher, hence driving upside in QCT.
 
Then the second 
question was on the implied royalty rate which has been 
now about 3.1% for three quarters in a row. Previously it had been about 
2.3% for six quarters in a row. Is this the new rate that we should be 
thinking about going forward? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Hi
, Simona. This is George. One of the things I would point to the guidance, 
first off you are right. The biggest single factor is how the LTE ramp is going 
to take place and you'll see it quite demonstrably in the QCT results. If 
anything that should give y
ou confidence in what is coming for QTL, but we 
are also seeing much more TDS CDMA inventory drawdown going on in 
China right now which really QTL doesn't participate in and that's another 
factor that kind of exacerbates the China effect.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Simona, this is Steve as well. In terms of the confidence, what you're seeing 
in the QCT numbers is, I think you are strength really across the board in 
fact broadly in China across tiers and across OEMs and our problem now is 
not really a demand problem. 
Actually in the near
-
term, we are actually 
trying to fight through some short
-
term supply issues because the demand 
has been even more than we thought.
 
I think we feel pretty good about the QCT numbers. Also although it's 
outside of the fiscal year, I thin
k thinking about QCT as a leading indicator 
for QTL is also a good way to think about the business as well.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Simona, this is Derek. On externally imply growth rate that you guys 
calculate, we were at 3.08 last quarter and kind of indicated we e
xpected 
that the trend in Q2. It did come up a little bit to 3.11, but frankly I we 
expected it would be a bit higher and it was hit by a couple of things. One 
was the timing of some of the cash
-
based payments we now have from 
some of the smaller licensees
, little bit of OEM mix and then also a higher 
percentage of the TODS hitting the caps with things like tablets and the 
strength that still remains in ASPs in the developed regions.
 
As we look ahead to the year, I think we gave the range in November of sor
t 
of 31 to 33 for the full
-
year, full fiscal '14 and I think just given away the 
year is playing out we've seen for instance a little bit higher deductions from 
some of the price discounting that went on in the early part of years, year 
before some of the 
iconic phones we expect to come out here in the back 
half. We've also again as I said had a higher percentage of things hitting 
cap, so I think we are now looking at it and assuming for the year we would 
likely to be towards the low end of the 31 to 33 ran
ge for fiscal '14.

James. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Tavis McCourt

Raymond James
 
Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Steve, you mentioned that the MSM 
business potentially being a leading indicator for the royalty business. I 
guess that premise there is that ultimately these LTE chip builds results in 
sales in China, but I am wondering how much visibility do you have on 
promotional activity given the lac
k of demand so far. Then secondly on MSM 
ASPs, can you talk about what drove those up sequentially relative to last 
quarter? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure. On QCT side, that I think if you look at the QCT numbers, obviously 
it's really a quarter prior to t
he same units hitting a QTL, so we feel pretty 
good about what's happening there and how it leads into the QTL side on. 
On the chip shipments, probably the best indicators, we are just seeing a lot 
of design pipeline and request for chips.
 
As if it's almos
t like a spring that wound and they are waiting for kind of the 
official start to happen, but we are really pleased with how that been 
happening so far. Now, as we have said in previous reports, it's very difficult 
to predict the exact timing on the start 
of the ramp and in particular one 
that has so much intensity around it, but we are working like crazy to get 
chipsets into multiple OEMs to support it, and that's why you know we tend 
to have a reasonable confidence based on what we are seeing in QCT.
 
I am
 
sorry. You had a second question, our MSM ASP, really we had a strong 
mix actually. If you look at what happened in the March quarter is the mixed 
was pretty strong, in particular some of the devices that than have been 
launching worldwide that continues 
to be something that's good for us.

Your next question comes from a line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord 
Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Mike Walkley

Canaccord Genuity
 
Great. Thanks. Steve just on the revenue per MSM, I think you guy
s talked 
about in the call, it's 50% plus of your shipments with the LTE in the second 
half of the year show that mix shift to expect the revenue per MSN to 
increase throughout the remainder of the year. Then also with OpEx up a bit 
sequentially R&D, just 
update on the cost optimization program and how is 
that trending versus your 20%
-
plus operating margin target for fiscal year. 
Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
On the second one first, I think we feel pretty good actually how the cost 
discipline in QCT has been
 
in transpiring throughout the years, so I think 
that's it in a good direction. Same thing with the supply chain.
 
Now, in terms of your first question about mix, I think George gave them 
indications about what it would be sequentially, which I think was ro
ughly I 
think if I look at your comments that you just made. The one thing to 
remember about the launch of LTE and in particular our strategy to support 
that launch is that this will be a launch across multiple tiers, so we are going 
to be launching at the
 
high tier with products in 800 class as well as the 400 
and 200 class, so we are going to be refreshing those portfolios as well as 
we go into '16, so I think it's going to be a broad based launch and the way 
to think about at least the way we think about
 
is you are you're adding a 
new tier which is the premium LTE tier, but also replacing the tier which is 
now sitting a TDS CDMA, so those blended numbers may not produce the 
premium uplift hat you are thinking about, but I think that's a good trend for 
us 
broadly as the business.

Your next question comes from a line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. 
Please go ahead with your question.
 
Brian Modoff

Deutsche Bank
 
Hi, guys. A couple of questions. With regard to LTE, you are talking about 
the 6% of
 
volumes in the back half, what are you seeing from (Inaudible) 
demand playing up from we are just talking about low to high end, what are 
you seeing competitively from other vendors in terms of any volume shifts. 
Do you expect to see any of the 
-
 
and any 
volume this year.
 
Then with regards to the Wells Notice, you know what have you guys seen 
historically as kind of what we could expect from the government from a 
standpoint of any disciplinary rulings like what are typical outcomes that that 
you see what c
ompanies do actually end up having to settle with the SEC 
and things like this.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Brian, this is Steve. On your question about the competitive environment, 
it's obviously a very competitive market. A lot of people are going after the 
market,
 
but we feel good about our leadership position and actually I would 
say it's a leadership position across tiers and across multiple technologies in 
the tiers. For example, we have been launching 
-
 
we announced and are now 
ramping the 64
-
bit products acros
s tiers that go along with the LTE and we 
think that's going to be an important component of how we compete and 
continue to compete moving forward.
 
Just being ahead of people and being ahead of them across tiers, I also think 
that that will be very importa
nt outside of China as well, which as you build 
a strong position in LTE across tiers and you use that to convert the 
emerging markets as well, so we feel pretty good about where that sits right 
now from what we are seeing in the accounts.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
Br
ian, it's Don Rosenberg. On your Wells question, I mean, you and 
everybody else can do the same research we do. You can look at the 
historical record on these kinds of things, but I should say that as we say in 
our keep in mind that the Wells Notice is a r
eflection of the regional staff's 
preliminary recommendation. We've responded. We think with our good 
arguments as to why we don't think there is an FCPA violation here. This is 
going to continue in terms of discussions, so at this point I wouldn't want to
 
say anything that sounds like any kind of prediction, but in terms of how 
these things have played out in the past, as I said you can take a look 
yourself.

Tim Long

BMO Capital Markets
 
Thank you. I wanted to go back to the units for the December quarter. 
Maybe for you, Derek. Just looking overall first on the China piece, I am just 
curious do you think there is some of OEMs have repor
ted numbers for the 
December quarter and it didn't really look that bad, so just curious if you 
think other than the mix shift TDS CDMA whatever, do you think you are 
getting paid less by licensees in China now? If so, or if not does government 
and all the
 
U.S. China issues have anything to do with that?
 
Second part of it, the $6 million that you took out of developed for the year 
2013, I'm assuming that's all Q4. That's a pretty meaningful numbers, so 
you mentioned North America, but what do you think is g
oing on there and 
do you think the upgrade programs will help that.
 
Then just last, even if you just give normal seasonality over the last few 
years, it looks to me like you are still probably $25 million $30 million 
phones light, so is there something else going on more broadly that you 
think impacted the December and now
 
the March quarters? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Tim, this is Derek. Let me try that. I'll just take those one
-
by
-
one, maybe I 
will jump into North America first actually, so I think this was pretty widely 
seen across a number of the OEMs. Really in North Amer
ica, in particular is 
where we saw the softness in the developed regions in the December 
quarter and I think it was kind of a combination of a couple things, but one 
of the key drivers was many of the operators appear to have really more 
stringently enforc
ed, the two
-
year upgrade cycles versus kind of their 
historical practice I think in an effort to try to move more people to their 
early upgrade programs and at least initially end of the December quarter 
kind of the net
-
net of that was negative and we saw 
a slowdown in the 
replacement cycle.
 
I don't know if you have caught, but AT&T reported just in the last day or so 
and it looks like they had a pretty interesting shift in Q1 of replacements 
going to the early upgrade program, so what we have kind of done 
for the 
calendar '14 year is assume we had already had a reduction in the 
replacement rate into our calendar '14 numbers and we have taken a little 
bit further reduction on that in North America, but there are at least some 
early signs that more people are
 
embracing the early upgrade programs and 
so we will have to kind of wait and see how that plays out in terms of driving 
the replacement rate in developed regions.
 
In China, I think again approximately 11 million units that we were down in 
the December qua
rter, primarily from China although there were some 
impact in a couple of the regions as well really is again consistent with the 
data that I think that has come out of the China market in terms of a 
slowdown before the LTE launch and I think what got repo
rted to us I think 
is largely consistent with what sort of people expected after the reporting 
came in for the December quarter.
 
Again, I think more of a market dynamic in terms of a slowdown before the 
LTE launch. Then as George pointed out earlier, what 
we saw coming into 
the March quarter is, I think it's very clear to the OEMs that the subsidy will 
be shifting from 3G to 4G devices in the near future so I think an effort 
really to kind of believe the channel of TDS CDMA, which is having a 
negative impac
t on us from a QTL standpoint in the in the March quarter.
 
Again, we continue to be very vigilant in our compliance activities in China, 
and as I have said in the past, there is always a certain amount of leakage 
there, but we continue to do all the things
 
that we think that worked well for 
us in the past and we are going to continue to stay on top of that, but I 
think really you are seeing a lot of market dynamics driving the results 
there.

Cowen and Company
 
Thanks. I had a couple. First of all, can you talk a little bit about the pricing 
environment for LTE, particularly there was a very large semiconductor 
company th
at now is segment about how much money that they are losing 
in their mobile business, so can you talk a little bit about the pricing 
environment in LTE number one. Then number two, can you update us on 
the pace of the ramp for LTE in China and maybe speak 
how long it will take 
until LTE unit volumes in China cross over with TDS CDMA? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Tim, this is Steve, I will hit the first part. I don't have answer to the second 
one. Maybe my colleagues can work on that while I am first part. On LT
E, 
that's actually one of our premium areas, so we tend to have 
-
 
that tends to 
be a good area for us in terms of pricing.
 
As I previously mentioned, in addition to supporting that in the premium 
tier, we also support that across tiers and part of the purp
ose of doing that 
is to accelerate the transition globally to multimode 3G/4G, so therefore we 
actually we do have chipsets specifically designed to hit the price points of 
mass
-
market smartphones and even and even the transition things like that 
TDS CDMA 
volume into the TD LTE volume as well, so it's really a mixed and 
today the majority, actually the vast majority of our chipsets support LTE 
and as has been our practice, we supported across tiers, so it's really a very 
much at a mix.
 
Now, because we have 
a leadership position and we think we can maintain 
leadership position because we were really several generations of folks, we 
have been able to 
-
 
that has been good for the business and we are 
endeavoring to keep that going.
 
Derek Aberle
 
This is Derek. On
 
kind of the shift from TDS CDMA to LTE, again I think we 
are seeing as in the March quarter, I think in anticipation of the shift in 
subsidy from 3G to LTE devices that's coming really the OEMs pretty 
aggressively trying to try to burn through the invento
ry there, so we saw a 
pretty meaningful increase in sales in the March quarter and that also had 
the effect of love cannibalizing to some extent the WCDMA and feeding a 
volumes in China.
 
As Steve has commented on, we really are seeing know the supply chain
, 
the OEM base really aggressively prepared the launch and growth of LTE 
devices so I think we will continue to see some amount of TDS CDMA sales. 
We believe they really be pushed to the to the very lowest tiers of devices. 
LTE is already starting to come 
in the low tier as well, so I think that there is 
going to be pretty accelerated transition as LTE takes off.

guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. A couple of things, in the past you guys 
had mentioned that the caps on tablets were voluntary. Just wondering if 
there is a strategy at some point to take those caps off at the time we get a 
date, but is that something that
's still out there [to consider] and how 
should we be looking at that down the road.
 
George, you talked about exiting the year on the QCT operating margin at 
above 20%. How do we look at that then going forward? Are we still looking 
at kind of the low 20s 
going forward in out years or are we going to get 
some sort of (Inaudible) 21 22 sort of on average as we get to next year and 
beyond.
 
Third question, is China Mobile obviously was in the first calendar quarter of 
the year was still under three mode requir
ement by June, they will move to 
five mode requirement, do you see that impacting at all your success in the 
QCT side and how do you factor that into and what you are telling us. Then 
finally anything else about? I mean, I saw the 10
-
Q commentary in the We
lls 
Notice, I am looking for some more detail on specifically what were the 
instances that that are in question and what are they alleging besides from 
this overall allegation? Is there anything specifically you can tell us as to 
what they are specifically
 
saying and what you are rebutting or is it complete 
kind of secret.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Ehude, this is Derek. On the tablet caps, yes, you are right. We put that in 
as a voluntary program and I have to say obviously we have been a little bit 
disappointed with th
e uptake on the connected attach rates for tablets, but 
the good news is I think we are starting to finally see some positive signs 
both in terms of the way that the operators are approaching data plans and 
some of the incentives that are being provided to
 
drive more WAN connected 
tablets and then also kind of the on
-
ramp in some emerging regions where 
Wi
-
Fi is no less established than in the develop regions, so I kind of feel like 
we are bit at an inflection point and you know this would not be the right 
t
ime to look at altering kind of the licensing model around tablets, but we 
will continue to monitor the marketing and see where things go.
 
On the QCT operating margin, yes we do expect it to be above 20% at the 
end of the year. As we said in our of guidanc
e coming out the analyst 
meeting that the we see 20 to 22 moving from an 18% to 20% regime to 
more of a 20% to 22%
-
type operating margin. We might not get there in '15 
as we indicated on at that time because the dynamics around the supply 
chain for 20 nano
meter devices, so we will see how that plays out. We are 
still confident we can meet with an 18% to 20% range, but we haven't taken 
'15 up yet in line with our long
-
term view.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. On the three
-
mode, five
-
mode, we have 
designs on both and 
we actually have the ability to do on the same chip, so we are prepared, 
whichever way that goes.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
Ehud, this is Don. I think, you are the only that's fiddled four of us in one 
question. Notice and all four of us one questi
on so, I think you know the 
answer. I can't give you more detail than is included in our Q. We have done 
that and you can see over the time that this has been subject of the Q, we 
have been fairly consistent with what we've described in that continues unti
l 
this day and again read the Q. You will get a sense there, but we are still 
obviously in the middle of this process so am unable to give you any more 
details on what we concluded there.

Your next question comes from a line of Stacy Rasgon with S
anford 
Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.

Sanford Bernstein
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for my questions. I think, I have three, so the first one I'm 
trying to wrap my head around the shortfall again in December. Some are 
push out in LTE. I
 
can kind of buy it March maybe, but in December unless 
you had a sizable amount of LTE phones in China in your guidance or there 
is a significant amount of cannibalization of TDS CDMA aiding into WCDMA. I 
am not quite how the logicals given the timing of 
subscribers 40 subscribers 
in China. I don't know why you have had a large amount of 4G phones in 
your guidance for December quarter shipments. I am not sure how a bunch 
more TDS CDMA shipments on China Mobile cannibalizes in China Unicom 
and Telecom unles
s there are 
-
 
I am having a hard time seeing how 
subscribers are moving over and mass in front of what would eventually be 
the 4G launch. Why wouldn't they just stay where they were?
 
Second question, you talked about an upward bias originally to units fore
cast 
and now it sounds like you are taking that off the table, which you are 
pushing it in to 2015. I think the impression you had given before was with 
your basement was conservative and then that you have that potential 
upward bias and it doesn't sound l
ike 
-
 
it sounds like, where China is coming 
in so far is actually the low for our base line was any commentary you can 
give on that would be helpful.
 
Then finally on OpEx, this was the second quarter in a row you have pushed 
OpEx out. That's great. Actuall
y that would take EPS guidance down to the 
back How much room is there I guess to have continued control on OpEx 
and can those cuts kind of be permanent? Does that OpEx eventually have 
to get spent as it pushed into the back half? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
S
tacy, this is Derek. Let me try your first question. Really, let me try to 
break into quarter, so I think there was a few different dynamics which were 
playing out over different periods of time in China. In the December quarter, 
again, which I think this 
is pretty consistent with know the data that's come 
out of China since December. Really, we believe it was more of a slowdown 
of the 3G device sales, kind of a pause in the purchase cycle from folks that 
anticipated LTE launching a little bit earlier than 
it did in '14, so there was 
that slowdown at that point.
 
Then when you shift over into maybe at the tail end of the December 
quarter, but really in earnest in the March quarter, I think the realization 
that the subsidy dollars were going to go away as it r
elated to the TDS 
CDMA devices. There was this window in which the OEMs really decide to 
aggressively push the TDS CDMA devices and those tend to be, I mean, they 
are kind of a broad portfolio, but they certainly create quite a bit of 
competition against C
hina Unicom, China Telecom in the mid to low tier, so 
when TDS CDMA does well, it does have an impact on the volumes by the 
other operators in China, so it's really sort of the two effects there.
 
Then again I think most less expected the ramp to move littl
e bit more 
quickly on LTE and for variety of reasons that's pushed out a bit, yet again 
all indications from the supply chain are that everybody is aggressively 
getting ready for that to happen very shortly.
 
On the units guide, we said last quarter that we
 
thought there were some 
upside to that and really what we are saying is that with the push out in 
timing that really it's more backend loaded, so we would probably be a little 
more cautious in our view, but we are holding guidance.
 
In terms of OpEx, the t
eams have done a very good job of looking for 
opportunities to defer, reduce wherever we can. We do have some things 
that we know we are going to have to get to on the product roadmap and 
also on some supply chain initiatives and just some general cost esc
alations, 
so we will be coming up a little bit, but I would say that we are going to be 
still meeting our objective of only being up 6% year
-
over
-
year and exiting 
the year at a lower run rate in OpEx, coming out of '14 than we had going 
into '14 and that's
 
for the whole company and for QCT.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. Just one more note really on the units is that if you look at the 
units in QCT, they are probably up actually relative to what it would have 
been a quarter ago, and I think that's indicati
ve of some strength across 
different OEMs as the mix has moved around a bit, so they are up and 
actually it has been really strong and that gives us some confidence also to 
make the statements that we made with respect to the full
-
year calendar 
numbers whi
ch is really where George's comments went to, so we are seeing 
an up uplift on units in the next semiconductor business.

Hi, guys. Hopefully you can hear me. I have three quick questions. First, if I 
am right then the tax rate goes down from 18% to 15% on a permanent 
basis, if you can clarify it?
 
Second, have you seen any impact of China litigation on your discus
sions for 
QCT business in China? Is there any correlation between the two or not at all 
if you can discuss the puts and takes?
 
The last part is going back to comment about the QCT margin, you spoke 
about 
-
 
you said hope you can maintain 18% to 20%, what ar
e the projects 
that would bring your QCT margins or what are the investments that you 
may need to make that would bring the QCT margins below the current 
target and what are the projects or the conditions that would bring it above, 
so we have kind of the f
ull range? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
On tax rate, it's 15% actually in the quarter, but that includes a catch up 
from the agreement for the first quarter. I would say the baseline run rate 
that we seeing today based on the agreement would come down about 1%
 
and we had forecasted in roughly 17% or 19% just under 18% for the year. 
That's coming down now to 60% but some of that is the effect of the one
-
time element.
 
Now I'll remind you that does not include any benefit for the benefit for the 
R&D tax credit, wh
ich would have an effect when and if it is renewed and we 
are also seeing a little bit benefit this year from the mix effects on the tax 
rate because we are seeing a little bit more revenue in QCT relative to QTL 
for all the reasons we discussed earlier on
 
the call and that has a positive 
impact on the tax rates for the year, so 16% is sort of the baseline run rate 
for the year, little below that in the second quarter.
 
With respect to the China litigation, I would say it's hard to say really. I 
think there'
s technology leadership tends to jump most concerns actually 
and that's what we are seeing. In fact if anything in that market we are 
seeing probably more concern about our ability to be able to supply as much 
as we have. We are probably fighting more dema
nd than less demand I 
guess and trying to make sure that we can be supply given how quickly the 
people are ramping up the desire to chipsets which is helpful.
 
On the QCT margin, I think the main thing to take away is it's going the way 
that the plan we lai
d out in fact I am very pleased with the organization 
being able to shift and be able to do that things that are applying pressure, I 
mean, we do see the opportunity to work on our supply chain both, from a 
supply assurance but also from a cost perspective
 
and we are interested in 
making sure that those things happen, but the main thing is I think we have 
good visibility into how that's going to layout and it's going according to 
plan.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with 
JPMorgan. Please go 
ahead with your question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Yes. Hi. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ashwin on 
behalf of Rod. Steve, I think questions are primarily aimed at you. The first 
one is on basebands. In light of recent
 
reports that major vendors trying to 
produce their own basebands, I would be interesting to know how open are 
you to license your based band designs for probably a lower price, but better 
margins. Do you think there will be a big long
-
term business opport
unity for 
you? Also, it would be interesting to get your comments on the performance 
of Snapdragon 808.10 versus like an Intel i5 chip that primarily goes into 
laptop, if you could provide any color on, where we have more ARM chips 
shipping into laptops th
at would be good.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure. On the baseband side, it's actually not a new trend for people to kick 
off their own baseband designs. The history of that is that tend not to be 
successful in particular are not terribly successful at the leading t
echnology 
tier. That's really where the majority of the margin is and we have been able 
to maintain and I would submit that's it's actually probably harder to do that 
today than it would've been in the past just because technology is moving 
and it's moving
 
across multiple mode, so I don't know if I see that as the 
biggest concern right now.
 
We have not entertained a licensing model so far and it's actually quite 
difficult to do with the modem unlike and something like an ARM core or CPU 
or graphics, because
 
there's so much technology and so much fieldwork that 
you have to do to make sure that those things work globally. In fact that's 
one of the areas that helps us are just our global scale. It is very difficult for 
people to repeat even if they are large OE
Ms, so that's one of the things 
complicates doing a licensing model. It has not been really one of our 
strategies moving forward on the baseband.
 
In terms of performance relative to some of the others on the tablet side, we 
feel very good about that actual
ly. If you look at our power performance, we 
feel good but then also the name of the game there is really performance 
and feature set across a wide range of technologies. They have to look at 
things across the entire multimedia camera graphics modem connec
tivity 
and CPU and people tend to compete with us on one or two of those factors, 
usually just one but not across all of them and that's really what's important 
in the phone space and important in the tablet space.
 
One of the things that we are hopeful for
 
down the road, it's consistent with 
my remarks is that Microsoft putting Office Suite on OSs other than Windows 
that really opens up I think the tablet device to be more than just a media 
consumption device and it becomes much more of a productivity devic
e, so 
we are anxiously awaiting that the results of how the market excepts that, 
so we tend to think of our position from the smartphone is being the place to 
attack the tablet market versus the other way around when we look at it, so 
we feel pretty good a
ctually where our product family looks relative to those 
aspects.

Good afternoon, guys. Three quick questions. Firs
t, on the supply constrains 
that you mentioned, does that clear up in the quarter and if you could just 
provide any color if possible on where you are seeing the constraints.
 
Then you talked about 30% LTE adoption only seven carriers on 
interrogation, so I
 
am assuming those volumes are small, do you see any 
material uptick this calendar year there you talked about how much that in 
terms of additional [content] and whether accretive to margins. Then finally 
the comments on Wi
-
Fi of those 250 wins, if you cou
ld give any color of 
approximate how many are shipping today. Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure. On supply constraints, I really mentioned, it's something that's cleared 
up actually in this quarter and we are I think well ahead of it now, but I 
really 
mentioned it to provide color as to the demand picture in China. We 
are seeing significant ramp up demand, and the way the China market 
works, it tends to have a little bit less headway or lead time relative to some 
of the other markets and it's also the w
ay that that new product launches 
are intense technology launches work, so I mentioned that not to highlight a 
problem, but more to highlight the intensity of the demand picture in LTE, 
but that does get cleared up in the quarter as I said.
 
In terms of a c
arrier aggregation, it really is the key feature set. This year 
and although I only you have only mentioned mention seven tiers, they tend 
to be the carriers that pushed number one a lot of volume, they also push 
the key design win, so North America, Korea
, Japan and Europe are dealing 
with very complicated spectrum allocation pictures and they tend to be the 
places that determine where key designs are won or lost, so the number of 
carriers are growing, but also the significance of those carriers is actuall
y 
probably more than just one on the scale of one, so we tend to do well.
 
That' tends to be like any new modem feature something that helps our 
margins and that we have a whole list of them of them that are coming out, 
so that's really what we have been go
od at doing. On Wi
-
Fi a lot of them are 
shipping. If you think about our Wi
-
Fi business, it's really an extension of our 
platform business, so if you look at the tiers from the low tiers moving up, 
we have been steadily increasing the attach rate of our Wi
-
Fi in fact with the 
exception of a small number of flagship devices. I think we are closing even 
that window as well, so pretty pleased with what's happening with Wi
-
Fi.
 
I think long
-
term, you are going to see Wi
-
Fi moves a triplet, we are going 
to have a
 
high
-
end AP, the high
-
end mode feature set and the high
-
end 
connectivity feature set traveling together as a triplet and we feel like we are 
in a unique position to provide that.

11/8/18,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report 
another very strong quarter, with record revenues and earnings per share, 
driven by broad
-
based demand for our 3G and multimode 3G/4G chipsets. 
In QCT, we shipped a record 225 
million MSM chipsets, well ahead of 
expectations, driven primarily by strength in emerging regions.
 
We continue to benefit from our tiered roadmap and diversified customer 
base, as revenues in MSM chip shipments were up 17% and 31% year
-
over
-
year respectiv
ely. Total 3G/4G device demand in the March quarter, was 
stronger than our expectations. However, QTL total reported device sales 
and revenues were down from our prior guidance expectations, as a result of 
a dispute with the licensee. Under reporting by ce
rtain licensees, in China, 
and sales of certain unlicensed devices in China. Derek will discuss this more 
fully, including the actions we are taking to address this situation. We will 
also give a brief update on the ongoing NDRC investigation.
 
We began the
 
year with several key objectives; first, we set out to compete 
effectively across all tiers in the LTE rollout in China, while driving the 
modem and AP roadmap to maintain our competitive lead. Second, we have 
developed plans to focus our investments on a
djacent opportunities, that 
adopt our core technologies, as well as technologies that address the 1000X 
data challenge, and drive IOE adoption.
 
Third, we set challenging OpEx targets to achieve greater operating leverage 
from our scale, and finally, we com
mitted to materially increase our return 
of capital. As I will explain further, I am very pleased with our results to date 
on all of these elements.
 
I will begin with the operational front, where we are executing against our 
initiatives to drive productivi
ty. We remain committed to exiting our fiscal 
year at an overall operating expense run rate lower than our exit from last 
year. Our team is executing to this, while making critical investments in our 
roadmap and supply chain initiatives. We also continue t
o make progress on 
our efforts to focus our new business initiatives across the company.
 
As part of that effort, we are accelerating our transition from the current 
generation Mirasol display technology to the licensing of the next generation, 
with a focus
 
on wearable devices. However, we will continue to make and 
sell the current generation Mirasol displays, to support certain existing 
customer requirements.
 
As a result of this new plan, we expect a significantly lower spend in our 
QMT division in fiscal 2
015, providing an expected annualized savings of 
more than $125 million. The actions related to these changes resulted in an 
impairment to the QMT business this quarter, which George will cover in 
more detail.
 
Adding to our portfolio of important technolog
ies, we recently completed a 
few noteworthy acquisitions. First, we acquired Velocity, a leader in the 
development of 60
-
GHZ chipsets based on the IEEE, 802.11ad standard, 
also known as WiGig. We have been working closely with this team for many 
years, and
 
see this technology as important to the new high bandwidth used 
cases we expect.
 
The Black Sand acquisition supplements our RF team, and expands our RF 
360 roadmap. And finally, we acquired leading digital still camera technology 
from CSR, which further e
nhances our differentiation in the important area 
of image processing.
 
On the product front, the first device based on our Snapdragon 805 and 
fourth generation multimode 3G/4G modem was launched. The Samsung 
Galaxy S5 broadband LTE
-
A. The Snapdragon 805 pr
ocessor is the first 
mobile processor to offer system level Ultra HD support, 4K video capture 
and playback and when coupled with our industry
-
leading Gobi modems, 
enables users to stream and watch 4K content over LTE.
 
The fourth generation Qualcomm Gobi 9
x35, is the first 3G LTE modem to 
commercially ship in smartphones, that's the port's global carrier 
aggregation deployment, up to 40
-
MHZ with both LTE TDD and FDD 
Category 6.
 
QCT has seen very strong design traction across its peers, with the emerging 
Chi
na customers. It is worth nothing that our success to
-
date in China is 
based on chipsets that were launched last year, and we are on track this 
quarter to commercialize our new low cost architecture with our Snapdragon 
410. We believe the launch of the Sna
pdragon 410 and our follow
-
on LTE 
chipsets, raised the competitive benchmark and improve product costs.
 
With our Wi
-
Fi and RF360 solutions, we continue to pursue growing our 
share of content in devices. Both product lines continue to ramp, with our 
overall
 
Wi
-
Fi unit volumes on track to grow more than 40% this fiscal year, 
as our attach rate in mobile continues to grow significantly. We now have 
over 100 devices launched or in design incorporating RF360, including the 
first launch of the device to feature t
he Envelope tracker, antenna tuner and 
power amplifier.
 
Looking forward, the continued roll
-
out and growth of multimode 3G LTE has 
a significant opportunity for the company. According to the GSA, 300 
operators have deployed LTE and more than 200 more have 
committed to 
deploy LTE. In addition, over 55 operators have or are planning to deploy 
LTE Advanced services, including carrier aggregation.
 
We are now positioned to help enable this opportunity with our LTE 
Leadership position, including chipsets across m
ultiple product tiers, and we 
expect to launch the Snapdragon 810, the world's first premium tier 
integrated SoC with Category 6 for smartphones, later this calendar year. 
To
-
date, over 2,000 multimode 3G LTE devices have now either been 
launched or are in
 
design, based on our chipset solutions. The LTE feature 
set continues to evolve, with features such as LTE Broadcast and LTE Direct. 
LTE Broadcast has been commercialized in Korea, and has been 
demonstrated in the U.S., Europe and Australia. We have also 
announced an 
LTE Direct trial in Germany, in collaboration with Deutsche Telekom.
 
Although still early in the adoption cycle, opportunities in the automotive, 
healthcare and wearable segments are taking shape. Our automobile 
pipeline continues to add OEMs 
and design wins. Our leadership in LTE is an 
advantage in this segment, as it moves from 3G to multimode LTE and this 
quarter, we saw General Motors launch OnStar LTE. In addition, new Android 
Wear devices were recently announced and Snapdragon 400 is enab
ling 
devices offered by Samsung and LG.
 
Adjacent opportunities allow us to build off our core investments into new 
growth segments. We expect to see an increasing impact of this over time.
 
In closing, we are making substantial progress on the key objective
s we set 
for the company. We delivered a record quarter, and see significant 
opportunities ahead. Our portfolio of multimode 3G LTE chipsets has strong 
design traction, which positions us well, and we are working hard to address 
the near term challenges in
 
our licensing business.
 
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Qualcomm's 
President, Derek Aberle.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We continue to see healthy 
end user device demand, spurred by 
among other things, the transition to 
3G LTE in China. In fact, we now believe 3G/4G device demand, excluding 
TD
-
SCDMA GSM devices for calendar 2014, will be at the high end of the 
1.22 billion to 1.3 billion device range that we provided last quarter, 
ref
lecting strength in both developed and emerging regions.
 
Turning to China, China Mobile has launched LTE service in over 300 cities, 
with over 300 LTE device models, and has seen increased data usage in 
ARPU from its LTE subscribers. In addition, LTE FDD t
rial licenses have been 
granted to both China Unicom and China Telecom. Both operators are 
launching hybrid LTE TDD and FDD trial networks in 16 cities. We expect 
those trials to expand to additional cities throughout the year. We are 
working closely with 
the operators to help them optimize their networks, and 
our chipset solutions, which support both the TDD and FDD modes of LTE, 
provide the mode, band and hand
-
off combinations they require for their 3G 
and LTE networks.
 
As Steve mentioned, we continue to 
have strong LTE chipset design 
momentum with manufacturers in China, and we are seeing significant 
demand for our multimode 3G LTE chipsets.
 
Here in the U.S., we have also seen positive trends as a result of 
competition amongst the carriers. In addition, p
romotions tied into the World 
Cup have shown success in Latin America, and we have seen positive 2G to 
3G migration trends in Southeast Asia as well.
 
Despite this healthy 3G/4G device demand environment, we have reduced 
our financial outlook for QTL for th
is fiscal year, to reflect some challenges in 
China, that could prevent us from collecting royalties in the near term on the 
full 3G/4G device demand.
 
First, we have a dispute with the licensee that has resulted in a portion of 
that licensee shipment activ
ity being excluded from our fiscal third quarter 
results and fiscal fourth quarter outlook. Like other disputes we have had in 
the past, we expect to resolve this situation and are in active discussions 
with this licensee. However, the timing of a potentia
l resolution is uncertain.
 
Second, as we have previously said, the timing of the LTE launches in China, 
as well as device composition at China Mobile, has been a bit difficult to 
forecast. Although, we have signed more than 70 single mode LTE license 
with 
Chinese OEMs, we still need to sign agreements with a number of other 
Chinese OEMs, in order to be able to collect royalties on all three mode 
devices in China.
 
Given the time it will take to complete the remaining single mode LTE 
licenses in China, we exp
ect to experience a delay in the timing of our 
collection of royalties on these devices.
 
Third, we recently have seen an increase in sales of lower tier 3G connected 
tablets by a number of Chinese OEMs, and we expect sales of these devices 
to continue to grow. This is a positive sign for 3G/4G attach rates and 
tablets, but the tablet OEMs are 
largely not the same companies that have 
been supplying the handsets in China, and therefore in most cases, are not 
currently licensed. We are in the process of negotiating licenses with this 
new base of potential licensees, but those discussions will take
 
some time to 
complete.
 
Fourth, we believe that some of our Chinese licensees are under reporting, 
and may continue to under report a portion of their 3G/4G device sales. As 
we have explained in the past, we have robust and active compliance 
programs in pr
iority for the business going forward. We are taking steps to 
confirm the underreporting and to work with the licensees to resolve the 
issues.
 
In summary, primarily, as a result of these four items, a revised QTL fiscal 
year outlook reflects a reduction of
 
approximately 8% in total reported 
device sales for the second half of fiscal 2014. The timing of the resolution of 
these items is uncertain, and we will update you on our progress next 
quarter.
 
For the calendar year 2014, 3G/4G device forecast, we now ex
pect that total 
unit demand will be at the high end of our prior unit estimate, for 
approximately 1.3 billion devices. However, we currently expect that QTL will 
not participate near term in the full device demand, based on the four items 
we just explained
.
 
We now expect that between 1.04 billion and 1.13 billion 3G/4G devices will 
be reported to us for sales during calendar 2014. We estimate the impact 
from these four items on total reported device sales on a percentage basis to 
be between 6% and 9% for ca
lendar year 2014. The percentage reduction in 
units is greater than in total reported device sales, because the units are 
expected to be lower priced devices.
 
Although we have these near term challenges, we continue to expect to 
collect royalties on all LT
E devices globally, including three mode devices 
sold in China, and have executed more than 110 single mode LTE licenses, 
in addition to our more than 260 3G licenses, which cover multimode 3G/4G 
devices.
 
We have had disputes in the past, and have a good t
rack record of 
successfully resolving those disputes. It is also not uncommon for a licensor 
to experience some delays in collecting royalties, while they negotiate 
license agreements covering new entrants or new products.
 
Finally, we are closely monitorin
g and in discussions with companies that we 
believe are underreporting or operating without a license, consistent with 
our longstanding compliance activities around the world.
 
Let me now move on to discuss the status of the investigation in China. As 
previ
ously disclosed, the China National Development and Reform 
Commission or the NDRC, is conducting an anti
-
monopoly investigation of 
certain aspects of the company's business, primarily the company's licensing 
business and certain interactions between the co
mpany's licensing business 
and our chipset business. We have met with and are continuing to fully 
cooperate with the NDRC, as it conducts its investigation, but the timing and 
outcome of any resolution remains uncertain, as does the impact on our 
future bu
siness in China.
 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to our Chief 
Financial Officer, George Davis.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Derek and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to be 
reporting strong operating and financial results th
is quarter, primarily driven 
by record QCT performance.
 
Fiscal third quarter revenues were a record $6.8 billion, up 9% year
-
over
-
year, and 7% sequentially. Non
-
GAAP operating income of $2.43 billion was 
up 19% year
-
over
-
year, and non
-
GAAP earnings per sha
re of $1.44 was up 
40% year
-
over
-
year and up 10% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Overall, non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share were $0.24 above the midpoint of our guidance range.
 
Our results included a $164 million charge or $0.08 per share related to the 
transition of our 
Mirasol business, as well as a $208 million gain or $0.12 per 
share for reversal of expenses, related to the favorable ruling in the 
ParkerVision litigation.
 
Excluding these two items, non
-
GAAP earnings per share would have been 
$1.40, $0.20 above the midp
oint of our prior guidance range. In QTL, total 
reported device sales by our licensees were $58.1 billion, and we estimate 
that 250 million to 254 million 3G/4G based devices were reported by our 
licensees for the March quarter at an average selling price 
of $228 to $234, 
up approximately $7 sequentially at the midpoint.
 
QTL's ASP in the fiscal third quarter reflected strength in mid to high tier 
devices, as well as the absence of lower ASP devices associated with the 
licensing challenges, summarized by Der
ek.
 
In QCT, revenues, earnings before tax and MSM shipments were all quarterly 
records, as demands strongly exceeded our prior expectations. QCT shipped 
225 million MSMs, 12 million units above the high end of our prior guidance 
range, primarily driven by 
shipments to Chinese manufacturers for 3G and 
3G LTE devices. Implied revenue per MSM was approximately $22, slightly 
lower sequentially on the mix of demand.
 
QCT operating margin was 23%, also above our prior expectations, 
reflecting the stronger than exp
ected MSM demand, as well as some 
favorable impact as a result of the ParkerVision ruling.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 7% sequentially, in line 
with our prior expectations. Investment income was strong this quarter, 
adding $0.06 in EPS rel
ative to our prior guidance. Strength in the financial 
markets, and changes in asset allocation to lower long term risk in certain of 
our investment portfolios drove this contribution. Looking ahead, we forecast 
fiscal fourth quarter investment income to b
e in the range of $200 million to 
$250 million, which is down sequentially on lower realized gains.
 
Cash flow from operations was strong at 39% of revenues, and we ended 
the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $32.7 billion. During the 
quarter, 
we returned almost $2.1 billion to stockholders, including 
approximately $700 million in dividends and $1.35 billion in stock 
repurchases. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $6.5 billion 
remaining on our buyback authorization.
 
Our non
-
GAAP tax
 
rate was 13% and lower than expected on business mix 
and the effects of the ParkerVision reversal.
 
Now, turning to our guidance; we are updating our financial forecast for 
fiscal 2014 to reflect our fiscal third quarter results, and increased outlook 
for 
QCT, partially offset by our lower estimates for QTL. We estimate fiscal 
2014 revenues to be in the range of approximately $26.3 billion to $27.2 
billion, up approximately 8% year
-
over
-
year and unchanged at the midpoint 
from our prior guidance.
 
We expect f
iscal 2014 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 
$5.21 to $5.36, up approximately 17% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint, and 
up $0.14 per share from our previous guidance midpoint on the strength of 
our fiscal third quarter.
 
We are increasing our 
estimate for the reported fiscal 2014 QTL average 
selling price to approximately $222 to $228, which is $2 above our prior 
$223 estimate at the midpoint, again reflecting the absence of the mixed 
impact of underreported and disputed devices.
 
We expect comb
ined non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow 
approximately 5% to 6% year
-
over
-
year, and as Steve indicated, we are still 
on track to exit the fiscal year below the run rate at the end of the last fiscal 
year.
 
Turning to the fourth fiscal quarter, we estimate
 
our revenues to be in the 
range of approximately $6.5 billion to $7.4 billion, up approximately 7% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share 
in our fourth fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.20 to $1.35 per share, up 
approx
imately 21% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We anticipate fourth 
fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be between 
2% lower and flat sequentially.
 
In QTL, we forecast total reported device sales of $53 billion to $59 billion, 
down appr
oximately 4% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the 
uncertain timing of potential resolution of the licensing matters.
 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 230 million to 245 
million units during the September quarter, reflecting cont
inued strong 
demand across all tiers, with particular strength in low and mid
-
tier chipsets 
for Chinese OEMs.
 
We expect QCT operating margin to exit the fiscal year above 20% as 
previously forecasted, as a result of solid execution on spending and 
supply 
chain initiatives.
 
We continue to expect 3G/4G channel inventory to remain within the normal 
11 to 16 week range through this calendar year, with China related 
inventory increasing on LTE channel fill.
 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn
 
the call back to Warren.

Great, thank you. Derek, just going back, as you take the midpoint of the 
units now excluded, roughly 215 million units, can you help us maybe break 
it down between the four reasons you gave excluding t
hose units, and the 
one licensee dispute, is that a meaningful piece of that 215 million excluded 
now from your outlook?
 
Derek Aberle
 

units, because of the uncertainty of the timin
g of the resolution, and they 
are all kind of different in kind. But the licensee dispute is a meaningful 
contributor to that number during this timeframe, and of course, if that 
particular licensee were to gain more share or lose share, that can impact 
th
e estimate that we have at this time. But they are all meaningful 
contributors to the numbers that we put out for the year.

Thank you. If I could just follow
-
up on the China piece here; maybe, if you 
could talk to us a little bit about the complexion of some of these customers 
and what Qualcomm could do to some of them to sell outside of China, 
where you mi
ght have a little bit more leverage. Are they chipset customers, 
where maybe you also have some leverage on the supply side? And then 
related to that, do you 
--
 
are you concerned about the spreading maybe to 
some of the other Chinese, and also there has be
en some stories about 
some Google initiatives in China with a few handset companies that are not 
Qualcomm licensees. So maybe can you just talk a little bit about this as 
potentially being a broader issue than just these OEMs in China? Thank you.
 
Derek Abe
rle
 
Sure Tim, this is Derek. Yeah again, there are kind of multiple factors here, 
so let me try to break them down. On the dispute, I think that's something 
that we have had 
--
 
we have had several of these in the past, as you know, 
over the years, and our 
typical process is to try to engage with the licensee 
and see if we can resolve it through negotiation, which we usually are pretty 
successful at. And when that doesn't work, things need to take a different 
course, and even in that route, we have, I think,
 
had a history of pretty 
successful results there.
 
On the other OEM; so it's really a mixed bag. In the white box or the lower 
end tablet space, it's really a set of 
--
 
kind of a new set of suppliers, that at 
least today are I think primarily focused in Ch
ina, and then maybe some of 
the other emerging regions. And much like the mid to smaller sized 
companies in China in the past, we have had a lot of success in getting those 
companies to sign licenses over time. It's really just a timing question, I 
think, 
in my mind, because we are kind of at the outset of this growth in a 
new segment and its new supplier, so it's going to take some time to get 
those licenses in place.
 
The same is really true for the three mode volume. I think its, from our 
perspective, mor
e of a timing question, in terms of getting the remaining 
licenses in place. And then around the underreporting, it is 
--
 
again, we are 
at the pretty early stages of trying to confirm sort of the extent of this, and 
engage directly with the OEMs in China. 
But our typical process is, we will 
uncover something and then we will work with the licensee through the 
compliance and also an audit process which takes some time, to try to get, 
what we believe, is a compliance situation. And when that doesn't work, 
obv
iously, we have different mechanisms we can pursue under the 
agreements themselves.
 
So I think, you know again, I think we have a number of avenues available 
to us, which have proven successful in the past, and we just have, with a 
little bit of more uncer
tainty right now in China, we have a period where we 
need to push these things and its going to take a little time.
 
In terms of things spreading, I am actually 
--
 
my sense is that the units that 
are supplied even into the local brands in India, are really 
supplied primarily 
today out of China, and so it would be sort of the similar set of suppliers as 
we have discussions with for supply in China and the other emerging 
regions. Its not a 
--
 
in other words, it's not a new set of suppliers cropping 
up in India
, that aren't supplied elsewhere from the licensee base.

talking 215 million units for

issue, approximately?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Approximately, that's the midpoint of the range that we gave. Brian, from a 
TRDS standpoint though, the range 
is more like 6% to 9%, so it's about half 
the percentage effect that the units would imply.
 
Brian Modoff 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Okay. and then if you're 
--
 
if these are lower end products, you are probably 
looking at royalties, on ASP of say $100 or maybe 
even lower depending on 
what the product is, is that correct?
 
Derek Aberle
 
I mean these are lower 
--
 
yeah, these are lower priced devices that we 
believe are kind of in this bucket, generally.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Ga
rcha with Credit 
Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Kulbinder Garcha

Credit Suisse
 
Question for Derek again, not surprisingly today Derek. I guess I am trying 
to understand how this whole thing came about? What I am getting at is 
that, you menti
oned the whole thing about connected tablets taking off, 
were you previously assuming your guidance, you would license them, and 
now you can't. I am surprised you have even included that, I guess is my 
point, and then the additional thing I was just thinki
ng is, in terms of the 
--
 
same thing applies to new licensees you were targeting but you weren't able 
to close them. I am surprised that caused you to revise your estimates 
down, so that would be an incremental upside, if it ever occurred? And so 
what I am
 
getting at, is it just the people 
--
 
is the main driver this major 
licensee that's not paying you now, and the underreporting generically by 
everyone? Because that $200 million on the Chinese market is a really big 
number on that market frankly; and so I 
am trying to understand, how this 
kind of came about, and why it suddenly hit you now, or was it warning 
indicator [ph] for the last six months about this? Any kind of context around 
that would be helpful.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Okay. Kulbinder, this is Derek. Let m
e try to break that down a little bit. So 
first of all, the 215 million is the midpoint of, as I said, a relatively wide 
range, and the reason we gave a relatively wide range is just because of the 
number of factors involved and the uncertainty around the 
timing of each 
one of those potential resolutions. The dispute that we have with the 
licensee, as I said, is a significant contributor to these units. If not all of 
their units, we have a dispute around some of them, and frankly, I don't 

ion of whether they are going to end up paying royalties, 
it's just a question of the timing of trying to resolve it, and what that 
resolution will look like.
 
On the white box tablets, we have been monitoring that, and we have been 
in discussions with a nu
mber of those companies. Frankly, just the 
acceleration of the growth that we expect to see over this period is faster 
now than we expected a few months ago, or even before that. And that is a 
contributor, but I am not going to suggest if that's the larges
t contributor of 
the units, it's just a piece of it.
 
On the underreporting, again, if you think back to calendar 2013 as we have 
been monitoring this, and I know you have asked questions about this 
periodically. You know, we have been really on top of the 
compliance 
aspects in China. And really, the first time we are really seeing a meaningful 
impact of this is in the current quarter that we are reporting, and it's really a 
relatively recent phenomena. And part of it is really just trying to understand 
wher
e this will go in terms of a trend, and we have provided a relatively 
wide range on that for that reason. Again, the typical process is, when we 
notice things that look suspicious, we will engage with the licensees quickly, 
and then usually move to an audi
t process, which takes some time to get 
the data and then work through the issues. But once we get through that 
process, we are able to typically get a resolution.
 
So again, I think there is just a number of factors that came together at the 
same time. Obv
iously, we are also seeing a ramp in the LTE volumes, from 
China Mobile, which is a good market phenomena. But given some of the 
uncertainty there right now and the discussions around the LTE licenses, 
although they have been ongoing and we have been progr
essing and 
increasing the numbers, has been a little slower than we had anticipated. So 
it's taking longer now to get to some of these agreements. And so we 
believe we will get there, it's just a question of timing, and it's uncertain in 
terms of when that
 
will be.

Hi, thank you. I just wanted to see if you can give us a little bit of color 
Derek, on 
--
 
of the 70 licensees that you have in China, what percent of the 
total volumes in China do those cover? And then is there a distinction in 
terms of your collection of Chinese
-
made devices that are sold in China, 
versus those that are sold overseas?
 
Derek A
berle
 
Yeah, its really hard for us to pinpoint a 
--
 
or give a range even for the 
percentage of the units that will be supplied over the calendar year, where 
we are giving these projections from the licensee base, that are currently 
licensed for LTE. There 
are significant companies in the group of companies 
that have signed licenses for three mode devices in LTE generally. But there 
are a number of other meaningful suppliers in China that haven't yet signed 
up, which is why you are seeing the impact 
--
 
and t
hose negotiations are 
continuing, and I suspect will get concluded, its just a question of when they 
will be concluded.

Ehud Gelblum 
-
 
Citigroup
 
Hey guys, thanks. I appreciate it. Sorry about that, I was messing up my 
phone. Thank you. A couple of questions again, I am trying to get this 
straight; first of all, on the NDRC, could a possible conclusion of that 
investigation be something that relates
 
to the royalty rates that you will end 
up having with your licensees in China, or is that completely separate, and 
the negotiations you do with the licensees, that will 
--
 
and the royalty rates 
that come out of that, will be totally separate from what the
 
NDRC 
conclusion is? And then again, just to understand a few of the specific 
things, I just want to confirm the dispute that you're having with the 
Chinese vendor, and that is with handsets, as Simona said before, both that 
they sell within China, as well
 
as ones that they sell outside of China, just 
coming back to some of the other questions; we can't get to a player large 
enough in China to be a significant player of that 215 million, if we only 
consider their Chinese handsets. So just trying to get a fr
ame of that.
 
And if I could sneak one more in, these vendors are not paying, or either 
underreporting or not paying you now, are these ones that were licensed in 
the past, and therefore had paid you in the past, not now, or are these new 
vendors that had n
ever paid you? Sorry for all the questions.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Okay, a little hard to 
--
 
hopefully I got all of them scribbled down there. So 
Ehud, I think 
--
 
on the NDRC, I think we have made a pretty robust 
--
 
not a 
pretty robust, a very robust disclosure in o
ur 10
-
Q, in terms of the range of 
potential outcomes that could come out of a decision of the NDRC. And so, 
at this point, we are continuing to fully cooperate, as I said, and try to work 
through this, but we can't comment specifically on what any particul
ar 
outcome may be from that proceeding.
 
In parallel, we are in negotiations with a number of licensees as is typical for 
the business, and there is a little bit 
--
 
I would say, a little bit of a more 
complication and a little bit slower pace of those negot
iations, given the 
backdrop of the investigation, which is having some amount of impact.
 
As to the units, kind of inside versus outside China; the 215 million midpoint 
or the overall range, would not necessarily be limited to sales, in fact, likely 
is not 
limited to sales just for China. Number of these suppliers, as you 

believe unique to Chinese OEMs.
 
And as to the ones that are 
--
 
that we believe are underreporting, its not a 
question of companies that have stopped paying or reporting entirely, I think 
its just 
--
 
as we look at the market data that's available to us, which is a 
very extensive process we have, we now believe that there is a gap between 
what we expect it to be re
ported to us, and what actually was reported to us 
in the third quarter and what we expect for the fourth quarter and for the 
remainder of the calendar year, unless and until we an get resolution on 
some of these issues.
 
So its really companies that are un
der agreement and the typical process I 
outlined before is to go through sort of the compliance discussion, which has 
started already, and then from there, if its not resolved, we move to audit, 
and if ultimately that's unsuccessful, we have other mechanis
ms to pursue it 
under the contracts themselves that they have signed.

Thanks a lot. Just a quick foll
ow
-
up to that then Derek; I think you 
mentioned that you felt like some of the negotiations with potential new 
licensees were being impacted by the NDRC investigation etcetera. Do you 
feel like that some of the compliance issues with existing licensees are
 
also 
being impacted by that same investigation? And then just a quick question, 
maybe for Steve on the overall market for chips into China, and the 
emerging markets is that, clearly you're seeing good success and that's 
evidenced by the large volumes you 
shipped last quarter, but just wondering 
how you're feeling about the competitive environment and anything that you 
need to do from a pricing or a promotion standpoint to continue to 
[indiscernible] that you'd like to, in those developing markets? Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Sure James, this is Derek. I mean, it's clear to us that the investigation, 
among other things is creating an increased level of uncertainty I think with 
the licensee base in China right now. I guess the way I would answer that is, 
we believe 
the investigation will be resolved at some point. We are working 
hard to try to see that through, and once that is resolved, I do believe some 
of the challenges we have had in the near term, will become easier.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
James, this is Steve. With r
egards to your question about chips; it has been 
an area of strength for us, actually shipping chips into the Chinese customer 
base. Not all of those, by the way, are being sold in China as well, we have 
had actually some strength in the 3G portfolio over 
the last quarter for 
devices, head into Latin America and rest of the world. So I think its in 
general, been a very strong picture, and I would say we feel very good 
about where we sit competitively, and I think if you look at the guide, its 
consistent wit
h that view.

Brian Modoff

Yeah guys. The way I was going with that line of questioning earlier was, if 
you 
--
 
its like y
ou assume 215 million units, and you assume probably an 
ASP of around $100 getting into China, and [indiscernible] royalty rate, we 
are talking about say $645 million, $650 million of revenues in royalties that 
you will need to pull back over time, once th
ese disputes get settled. Is that 
a kind of good way to look at it? And then a second question for you Steve, 
you're doing a lot of work around 
--
 
your 28
-
nanometer RF getting ready to 
start shipping in October. You have got a ton of 14
-
nanometer taken off
 
the 
curtain with Samsung. Can you talk a little bit about how some of these 
advances you're doing on the substrate side would help you from an 
economies of scale and margin standpoint against the competitors, that 
should push forward aggressively in these
 
areas? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
Hey Brian, this is George, I will take a shot at your 
--
 
the sizing issue. I think 
your basic math is in general, right. The way I would look at it, in terms of 
--
 
these are lower price devices on average, less than 50% of the 
average for 
the overall ASP for the company that we report. And I think 
--
 
one of the 
things you can do is, this is a very strong year relative to our expectations, 
on the QCT side for the year. Now we talked last quarter about there being a 
bit of a lag, 
just because of the timing of the ramp in QCT that QTL wouldn't 
fully participate this year, all things being equal, but it was really good 
momentum going into 2015.
 
So I think if you look at the 
--
 
if you want to try and size the impact, I think 
you would
 
have started to see this impact more fully realize in the third 
quarter, fourth calendar quarter, and if you look at what the year
-
over
-
year 
looks like there, we are down about 3% year
-
over
-
year on QCT this quarter, 
it widens out a little bit next quarter
 
--
 
QTL, excuse me, not QCT. Obviously 
QCT was up significantly year
-
over
-
year.
 
So I think you can size it. We would have expected and expect this result, 
that this will be a strong momentum for QTL as well.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And Brian, on your question abo
ut the substrates and different technologies 
that we are going to 
--
 
there were a couple of things I think, one is, its 
clearly been an advantage to have the scale that we have and to have that 
scale across multiple foundries that's helped us with supplies
, its helped us 
with pricing, it has helped us with a number of items. And then I think 
probably the most important thing is from the design perspective, your 
ability to go to advanced node and to integrate a number of different 
technologies on to the same
 
die and increasingly, those technologies are F 
technologies, that has been a competitive advantage for us, and we think its 
going to continue to be in a competitive advantage moving forward. So we 
continue to push that 
--
 
that's one of the things that I m
entioned in my 
script, that we were pleased that we are able to even execute on that 
strategy, while cutting back on the OpEx as well. So its 
--
 
we feel like we are 
pretty positioned well from a product perspective.

million units out of your forecast seems too big to me to be strict
ly 4G in 
China situation. So can you give us some feeling for 
--
 
suspect this is 
beyond 4G, this is 3G as well, so do you ha actually have 3G licensees that 
we are paying, who are now underreporting as its leaking out?
 
Secondly on the NDRC, I know in your 
Q you talked about that there would 
be likely a probable impact, a financial impact, but you're unable to size it at 
this point. Can you talk about what some of the possibilities are, anywhere 
from a [indiscernible] business model transitions. Is there a p
ossibility that 
there could be an adverse change to your business in China, and if there is, 
how do you stop that adverse change from leaking out of China into the rest 
of your regions, and impacting your royalty business overall?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Stacy, this 
is Derek. Yeah so on the 215 million midpoint, again, from the 
TRDS impact, you will see significantly less than that. The reason I try to 
kind of break it down into four different buckets, is because of the 
underreporting bucket that you mentioned, that w
e believe is going on right 
now, is broader than just LTE, would include 3G volumes as well, and so 
that's 
--
 
when we look at the market, in terms of both China and devices 
flowing outside of China to other parts of the world, that's encompassing the 
broad
er technology set than just 4G.
 
On the NDRC, really I don't think I can say much more than I said in 
response to a prior question. Other than, yes, we did change the disclosure 
to indicate that 
--
 
we believed some loss would be probable. But given the 
many
 
factors that are involved there, we are really not in a position to be 
able to estimate what that might look like, we just believe whatever the 
resolution may be, will likely include some form of payment.

Thanks. A couple. Derek, first, the NDRC investigation, should we expect 
some resolution this year, or should we be waiting for this thing to spill into 
2015? The other
 
question I had was, on just the strength in MSM this 
quarter, you mentioned emerging 
--
 
can you talk a little bit about how the 
--
 
your tier
-
1 customers influence the performance here in June and your 
outlook for September? Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So this is
 
Derek, I will take the first one. It is pretty difficult to determine 
timing on the NDRC resolution. As I have said in the past, we are 
--
 
this is 
obviously a large priority for the company to resolve it, and we are 
cooperating and actively engaged with t
he NDRC to try to get to resolve this 
as expeditiously as possible.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And on the second question, I think this last quarter, we really benefited 
from our diversified customer base and our strength across tiers, and that 
continues to be somet
hing that we think will be a good part of the business. 
What we are seeing in China, and I think most people probably don't realize 
all the time, is that it is very much a multi
-
tiered market, and we are seeing 
strength across the tiers. And what's really 
interesting is that, you're seeing 
a lot of the OEMs in China going international as well, and that's 
--
 
I think 
that's helping us on the chipset business as well.
 
One other thing that I wanted to mentioned and it was in my script, is that 
we will be focus
ing more and more of our chipset roadmap and energy on 
increasing the pace in which we refresh that roadmap and I think that will 
benefit us as well moving forward, in the customer base.

Thanks a lot. I have two. First Derek, of the 215 million units, can you 
somehow put those into each of the four buckets, the dispute, the tablets, 
the three mode a
nd then the underreporting. And then, a question for 
George; George, I a trying to get the pro forma op margins for QCT. It looks 
like it's about 19%. And if that's right, I am surprised it wasn't a little better 
given the revenue upside, so I wanted you t
o comment on that. Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Tim, this is Derek. Again, the 215 million is the midpoint of a relatively wide 
range of units, and a number of different assumptions in terms of potential 
outcomes are baked into sort of the high end versus the low 
end of that. And 
so it's really hard to break down the bucketing of that. As I said, I think, 
probably the smallest contributor in this timeframe would be the tablet 
space, which shouldn't be surprising, and kind of the other three are all 
pretty meaningfu
l contributors.
 
George Davis
 
Tim, I am not sure I followed that. The operating profit percentage that was 
reported was at 23% for QCT, very strong, certainly above the expectations. 
We said we are going to exit the year above 20%. If you put all those 
toge
ther and look at our 18% to 20% range for the year, we are clearly at 
the high end of that. And I think that's fully 
--
 
in keeping with our outlook 
for the year, and benefiting a little bit more from the upside in MSM units.

Hi guys. Before I go to the main question, just a few housekeeping items; 
implied royalty rate was higher than y
ou said last quarter. Last quarter you 
said its going to be 3.1%, and you reported 3.24%, you can go over it. Also 
the ASPs were higher, is this just related to the elimination of China in the 
number that there 
--
 
that was part of China that we are talking
 
here about? 
Or is it also related to other things?
 
Also financial expenses

Half of the outperformance this quarter outside of the revenues was higher 
financial income, lower taxes, what's going on there, if you can discuss? So 
these are all the P&L items. One question that I 
have on the issues of the 
licensing issue, is 
--
 
what I want to understand is, is it related to MediaTek 
not reporting anymore the numbers to you, so you have more limited way to 
audit the numbers that the vendors are reporting? Or is it more related to 
ne
w technology and vendors basically making it very broad kind of claim 
saying, this kind of technology we are not paying, which is 
--
 
there is a 
difference in the difficulty to convince them to pay in one scenario versus 
another? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
Maybe 
I will jump on the P&L items first, and the implied royalty rate. So I 
think we are looking at different numbers. The reported number would be 
3.1%, which was right on top of what we had guided. So if you have got 
some more questions, you should may be che
ck with the IR team, they can 
go through the calculation.
 
In terms of tax, what you saw is, actually last quarter, we reached a 
settlement which lowered out outlook for the tax rate for the year. We got 
an additional benefit this quarter as well from the e
ffects of the reversal of 
the ParkerVision judgment and so that was a 
--
 
it didn't carry tax with it, so 
it had the overall effect of lowering our tax rate.
 
And as we have been reporting, we are seeing higher investment income on 
gains in the portfolio, as
 
we have started to implement higher return of 
capital, we have had a program to reduce some of the volatility in the higher 
risk assets that are in our long dated portfolio, just to keep our risk levels in 
line and so, that's led to gains; and the gains t
urned out to be a little bit 
higher than we thought in the quarter, because it has just been such a 
strong financial market. As we've sold those down, we have had greater 
benefit.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Tal, this is Derek. On the ASP for the quarter, I think really 
the primary 
driver was the fact that we got 
--
 
we had less volume in than we expected at 
the lower tier devices in China, that's really the primary driver.
 
On your second question, really the underreporting, it's not an issue of kind 
of a new technology is
sue as you described it 
--
 
meaning, licensees taking a 
position that they don't owe royalties on a particular product or technology 
under their agreement. We really think it is just a 
--
 
as we dig into this we 
are going to 
--
 
we believe we will find that t
hey are only reporting something 
less than 100% of their sales, and hoping they are going to be able to get 
away with it. Again, we have always been very clear that, you know, the 
effort involved in making sure we collect on everything in China is 
signific
ant, and we have a lot of resource in that, and we triangulate a lot of 
different information at 
--
 
we get from MediaTek as one element, and 
certainly, having less information makes things a little more difficult than 
having more information. But that, we 
don't believe is the primary sort of 
indicator for what's going on here.

Thank you. Gentlemen, historically, when Qualc
omm worked and settled 
with the Korean vendors, the Japanese, or even the European vendors, we 
have always had a subsequent resolution and subsequent recovery, and 
along the way, there was a little bit of give or take, which then sets a 
precedent. China ju
st seems like a whole new animal in terms of the size 
and the scope; so conceptually, should we think about just kind of the 
different structural rate going forward, considering that there is a balance of 
allocating power that seems to be shifting. How do 
we kind of containerize 
what happens in China, so that is not inflicted by others as a precedent; and 
also additionally, is there additional OpEx that we should be thinking about, 
in terms of the cost of doing business in China, auditing the extra data for
 
example? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
I am not sure 
--
 
again, I think the way that we have been handling China is 
very similar to the way that we have addressed our licensing program 
worldwide, very consistent. You're right that 
--
 
I would say the typical 
reso
lution of these things, when there is a period of uncertainty in a period 
of time where amounts are not being paid to us, that we believe are 
recoverable. That resolution usually carries with it, some kind of recovery for 
past, and I have no reason to beli
eve, that would also be the case with the 
items that we have outlined.
 
Again, we look at the compliance activity very carefully, and that's a 
meaningful part of the program and has been for several years, the number 
of audits that we do has increased prett
y much every year. But we do have, 
I mean 
--
 
I think we do have a reasonable amount of resource and we have 
that in the plan, I don't see like a significant increase in OpEx that would be 
needed to address the issues. Again, our best assessment is, that th
ese are 
near term challenges that given a period of uncertainty we have, may take 
some time to resolve, but will get resolved, and we will just have to see how 
this plays out, as we move forward.

Hi guys, thanks for the question. I guess I had a couple. Derek, I wondered 
if you could talk a little bit about the likelihood this turns into a collective 
bargaining situation, or i
f it is already there, and if that's the case, who the 
negotiator on the other side of the table would be? Would it be a consortium 
of these companies, or some representative of them? So if you could just 
kind of talk about how you expect this to play out 
in the single deal you do 
with all the companies, or do you do individual deals with everybody?
 
Also, I wanted to go back to the question on the reports that 
--
 
the question 
on the chips and the involvement of the chips, it seems clear that that 215 
millio
n number involves people pulling CDMA royalties from you that they'd 
already agreed to pay. So why wouldn't chips at some point, get involved in 
this, if the negotiation drags on? Is there any good logical reason why that 
wouldn't happen? Just would be cur
ious to hear that. And then lastly, given 
that the fun place that China is to do business, we have also got these 
reports the government is talking about limiting high end marketing 
spending from the carriers, I wonder maybe Steve, since you are there, 
cou
ld you comment on what's going on with that? Is that's a real issue? Is 
that's something that's going to impact high end smartphone demand over 
time? Be interested in some color on that, thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Rod, hey this is Derek. Let me try to take the f
irst two, and then Steve can 
cover the last one. So again, we have sort of two things; we do have the 
NDRC investigation ongoing, and as we have said, we are actively engaged 
with them, to try to find a resolution. We don't know exactly what the 
impact or 
the resolution will look like, both looking backwards or looking 
forward; we are just continuing to try to 
--
 
just try to work that one and get 
to a resolution.
 
Beyond that, we don't anticipate that there will be sort of a need or a 
movement to collective 
negotiation with companies in China. That has not 
been the practice that we followed successfully over the last many number 
of years. And that continues to be the way that we were operating. We are 
basically in discussions with individual companies, which 
every company has 
different needs, different business models, etcetera. And so collective deal 
really isn't typically appropriate in any event.
 
So I expect going forward, we will continue to negotiate like we have in the 
past, individually, with the variou
s companies, and that won't be a change.
 
On the chip side, I am not sure I fully understood your question, but let me 
try to answer it as best I can. Certainly, if you look at the magnitude of the 
number of units that we have kind of in this range, there a
re 
--
 
we do expect 
that there will be products in that mix, that aren't reported to us for a period 
of time, that could include our chipsets. Our typical practice, when that has 
happened in the past, is to engage with the licensee and try to work it out 
an
d find a resolution and pursue payment under the license, without an 
impact on the chip side. And that's what we would plan to do here as well.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Rod, this is Steve. There have been reports about the level of subsidy 
changing in China. I don
't know to a degree that we are seeing that reflected 
in the demand. I mean, if you look at the raw number of dollars that are 
actually authorized, its quite a number. And I would say, I would 
characterize our demand across tiers to be fairly robust. So I 
am not sure we 
are seeing a downstream impact of that concern.

Hey guys, if I recall, Derek, some time 
ago you talked about maybe all the 
licensees now due to 2017. I think that was the comment you made maybe 
a year, year and half ago. Can you give us an update on that from the 
Chinese guys? And as a follow

up, Broadcom obviously exiting the baseband 
busine
ss, they talked about even writing down all that stuff, what immediate 
impacts have you seen in your business with them getting out of baseband? 
Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So I think straining my memory a little bit, but let me try. Going back 
several years ago,
 
we did talk about at one point in time, we had basically 
five WCDMA licenses that had to get extended before that time frame that 
you mentioned, 2017
-
2018. And then we kind of knocked all of those off 
some time ago. We haven't really updated that or given
 
color, as to whether 
there are other agreements that need to be extended beyond that. So that's 
a little bit of a dated number, and I don't think we are prepared to update 
that today.

Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone.
 
We reported very 
strong results this quarter, which I will comment on 
shortly, but first I want to update you on the status of the NXP transaction. 
As you've seen from our press release, pending any new material 
developments, we intend to terminate our agreement to acquire
 
NXP at the 
end of the day.
 
The decision for us to move forward without NXP was a difficult one. 
Continued uncertainty overhanging such a large acquisition introduces 
heightened risk. We weighed that risk against the likelihood of a change in 
the current g
eopolitical environment, which we didn't believe was a high 
probability outcome in the near future.
 
In the end, we determined this was the best path forward for our customers, 
partners, employees, and stockholders. To say the least, the 21 months 
since we 
announced the NXP acquisition have been volatile. In spite of all 
the potential distractions, Qualcomm and NXP leadership remained focused 
on laying the foundation for the successful integration of our two companies.
 
I want to personally thank Rick Clemmer
 
and his management team for 
being tremendous partners and compliment them on the excellent company 
they have built at NXP.
 
Consistent with our prior commitment to return capital that was previously 
earmarked for the NXP acquisition, our board has approved
 
a new $30 billion 
stock repurchase authorization. We intend to execute on a large majority of 
the authorization by the end of fiscal 2019.
 
The rationale for the NXP acquisition was to accelerate our strategy of 
growing into adjacent opportunities where mo
bile compute was becoming 
ubiquitous. This strategy remains unchanged. Over the past two years, we 
continued to leverage the powerful industry dynamics of mobile everywhere. 
The results of these efforts are strongly evidenced in the growth of our 
adjacenci
es and RF front
-
end opportunities, which we estimate will 
contribute to our fiscal year, ending this September, approximately $5 billion 
in revenue, up more than 70% in the last two years.
 
In key industries like auto, our pipeline of awarded design wins ha
s 
expanded dramatically this year to $5 billion, up $2 billion from January, as 
auto makers and Tier 1 suppliers leverage the strength of our roadmap and 
begin gearing up for 5G
-
enabled cars in 2021. Our infotainment solutions 
account for more than half of
 
the $5 billion pipeline, just four years after we 
announced our entry in this category.
 
We've continued to gain share in Wi
-
Fi and have now achieved leading 
positions in several Wi
-
Fi segments. Our Snapdragon franchise has moved 
well beyond mobile devices
, becoming the leading platform in areas like AR 
and VR, and is positioned to be a critical enabler in AI and machine learning 
at the edge. We are also transforming the notebook segment to a true 
smartphone experience and are growing our ecosystem of partn
ers, 
including recently adding Samsung.
 
Our industrial IoT product revenues are also growing rapidly and are on 
track to double this fiscal year versus two years ago. We anticipate our 
addressable opportunity in the industrial IoT space to grow at approxim
ately 
a 20% CAGR over the next few years, and we expect to exceed that growth 
for our industrial IoT revenues.
 
In the past two years, we brought forward 5G R&D spending to ensure 
Qualcomm's sustained leadership in the next generation of mobile 
technologies
. Today, with every passing week, carriers around the world are 
announcing an expansion of their 5G rollouts, and we are a partner in nearly 
all of them. Our significant investment in 5G leadership will become even 
more tangible with the early rollouts and
 
device launches in 2019 along with 
larger deployments in 2020 and beyond.
 
As a complement to our 5G modem leadership, our RF front
-
end technology 
will continue to be differentiated in the market, as we bring a systems 
approach to solve many of the technic
al challenges of delivering a 5G 
experience. This transition presents a win
-
win for us and our customers, 
enabling us the opportunity to grow our dollar share of content in mobile 
devices while lowering the total cost for handset OEMs.
 
With continued execu
tion on our growth strategy combined with systematic 
cost discipline and capital return, we are very well positioned to drive 
shareholder return in fiscal 2019 and beyond. As you can see from our 
quarterly results, our business continues to perform well, a
nd the timelines 
we have previously highlighted to resolve our licensing disputes remain 
unchanged.
 
Our fiscal third quarter results were very strong, with non
-
GAAP earnings 
per share $0.31 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Our results 
reflec
t continued strong execution across our businesses and continued focus 
on expense management.
 
In QTL, our third quarter results reflect a $500 million payment from the 
other licensee that is in dispute with us. This is a partial payment made 
while the nego
tiations continue for past royalties due going back to the third 
quarter of fiscal 2017. The payment does not reflect the full amount of 
royalties due under their existing licensing agreement, but we believe it is a 
positive step as we continue the negotia
tions in an effort to reach a 
resolution.
 
Also within QTL, we continue to make progress on signing agreements under 
our new 5G licensing framework. Recently, we have concluded more than 10 
multiyear 5G multi
-
mode handset license agreements, including agree
ments 
with Xiaomi and Sharp, and we are in active negotiations with many more 
OEMs.
 
In QCT, we shipped 199 million MSMs in our third fiscal quarter, above the 
midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting stronger than expected demand in 
China due to the stre
ngth of our roadmap, particularly our 700 and 800 
series Snapdragon solutions.
 
Looking ahead, our fiscal fourth quarter guidance reflects continued 
favorable trends in our businesses. We estimate calendar 2018 global 3G/4G 
device shipments to be approximat
ely 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion units, 
consistent with our prior forecast, and continue to see handset selling prices 
trending stronger than expected.
 
In QCT, demand for our Snapdragon 845 continues to grow, and we now 
have more than 130 Snapdragon 845 devi
ce designs in development. 
Consistent with our prior statements, we continue to see our key Chinese 
OEM partners leveraging our Snapdragon roadmap to improve their products 
in the domestic Chinese region and grow share in new regions, including 
Europe.
 
We 
have also seen very favorable third
-
party test results with our 
Snapdragon 845 and X16, X20 modems significantly outperforming other 
merchant modem solutions in premium
-
tier devices. We are also seeing 
further momentum supporting our RF front
-
end growth st
rategy and product 
differentiation, with four design wins of our complete modem
-
to
-
antenna 
solutions. Our gallium arsenide, MMPA, and module solutions have launched 
in customer premium
-
tier devices, with more key Tier 1 launches coming 
this calendar year.
 
We have also made two RF product announcements earlier this week, which 
are extremely important Qualcomm innovations to help solve the 
challenging, complex antenna requirements for 5G devices. We announced 
commercial shipment of the world's first commercia
l 5G New Radio 
millimeter
-
wave RF solution and also announced a fully integrated sub
-
6 GHz 
RF solution. These announcements further expand our industry
-
leading 5G 
product and technology position, and there are 18 network operators and 20 
manufacturers who 
have selected our X50 5G modem for trials in 5G 
devices.
 
We are leading the industry to 5G commercialization next year and are 
pleased to see our OEM partners finalizing their 2019 5G smartphone launch 
plans. Qualcomm's chipsets are now the leading 5G deve
lopment platform of 
choice for operators, infrastructure suppliers, and smartphone OEMs.
 
In closing, we are pleased to report very strong results this quarter and look 
forward to continuing to update you on our progress across the key strategic 
areas we 
have outlined for shareholders. This is a very exciting time for 
Qualcomm. With 5G approaching, our core technologies of advanced 
computing, connectivity, and security are continuing to drive growth and 
disruption in mobile, automotive, IoT, and networking
.
 
I will now turn the call over to George.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I discuss our 
quarterly results, I would like to join Steve and thank the NXP team for their 
partnership and collaboration ov
er the past 21 months.
 
Now turning to the quarter. We are pleased to report very strong fiscal third 
quarter results with revenue of $5.6 billion and non
-
GAAP EPS of $1.01. As 
Steve mentioned, these results reflect $500 million of revenue in QTL related 
to
 
an interim payment with the other licensee in dispute. This is a partial 
payment made while the negotiations continue for past royalties due going 
back to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and does not reflect the full amount 
of royalties due from the unde
rlying license agreement or our expectations 
of royalties that will be due once the dispute is settled. The interim 
agreement provides for an additional $200 million, with $100 million paid in 
each of the next two quarters.
 
Non
-
GAAP EPS of $1.01 was $0.31 
above the $0.70 midpoint of our 
guidance range. The partial payment accounted for $0.26, with the 
remaining $0.05 above the midpoint driven by favorable interest expense, 
tax rate, and QTL OEM mix during the quarter.
 
QCT earnings before tax was up 6% year 
over year, representing the ninth 
consecutive quarter of year
-
over
-
year growth in EBT. EBT margin was 15%, 
at the high end of our guidance range, on higher volume and favorable 
product cost initiatives. In QCT, MSM shipments were 199 million, above our 
195
 
million guidance midpoint, on stronger
-
than
-
anticipated demand from 
Chinese OEMs. QCT revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, flat on a year
-
over
-
year basis, reflecting strong demand from Chinese OEMs, offset by 
lower demand from Apple. In QTL, excludin
g the $500 million payment from 
the other licensee in dispute, revenue was modestly above the midpoint of 
our prior guidance range on mix.
 
QTL EBT margin was 72%, including the partial payment. Excluding the 
partial payment, EBT margin was 57%, coming in a
bove our prior guidance 
range of 50% to 54% on OEM mix as well as lower
-
than
-
expected litigation 
expenses.
 
In our fiscal third quarter, non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A was up 
approximately 1% sequentially, in line with the midpoint of our guidance 
range.
 
In
 
the fiscal third quarter, excess litigation expenses were approximately 
$140 million, and we expect litigation expenses to be similar next quarter, 
as the cases against Apple continue, including hearings in several of our 
patent infringement cases in the 
U.S., Germany, and China.
 
We continue to execute on our $1 billion cost plan, and as a result incurred 
approximately $110 million in restructuring costs, primarily related to 
severance and asset impairments. These items were excluded from our non
-
GAAP resu
lts. For fiscal 2019, we remain on track to reduce total operating 
expenses by $1 billion from our prior baseline of $7.4 billion.
 
Our non
-
GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was a 6% benefit, lower 
than our prior expectations, reflecting the change in
 
our estimates of U.S. 
earnings, principally due to the interim payment in QTL.
 
We returned approximately $1.9 billion to stockholders during the quarter, 
including approximately $900 million in dividends paid and $1 billion in stock 
repurchases. Our Q3 ca
sh and marketable securities balance was $36 billion, 
which excluded $2 billion held to collateralize letters of credit for the NXP 
acquisition and $2.8 billion restricted for our recent redemption of 
acquisition
-
related debt. We ended the quarter with tot
al debt outstanding of 
$22.5 billion.
 
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance, we estimate revenue to be in 
the range of approximately $5.1 billion to $5.9 billion. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.75 to $0.85 per share.
 
We 
expect non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be flat 
sequentially, including the impact of an extra week in our fiscal fourth 
quarter. Excluding the extra week of operations, we estimate that non
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and SG&A expenses would be down
 
mid
-
single digits 
percentage sequentially, in line with the timing of our cost program despite 
the ramp in 5G development activities.
 
We expect QTL revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter to be in the range of $1 
billion to $1.2 billion. This revenue guida
nce includes the expected $100 
million payment from the other licensee in dispute while negotiations are 
ongoing. We expect QTL's EBT margin to be between 58% and 62%.
 
It is worth noting that beginning in our fiscal first quarter of 2019, we will 
implement
 
the new ASC 606 revenue recognition guidance. This requires 
that we estimate QTL royalty revenues each quarter rather than recognizing 
them one quarter in arrears, and then make revenue adjustments in the 
following quarters once actual amounts are reporte
d by our licensees.
 
Accordingly, the September quarter results for our Licensing business will 
not be reported in our fiscal Q1 results, but will be recorded on the balance 
sheet into retained earnings, with offsetting entries in accounts receivable. 
And o
ur first fiscal quarter will now reflect estimated December royalty 
revenues for our Licensing business, consistent with the absence of a one
-
quarter lag.
 
This change will alter QTL typical seasonality, as the busy holiday quarter for 
our licensees will no
w be recognized in our fiscal first quarter rather than our 
fiscal second quarter each year. Of course, the impact of our two disputes, in 
particular Apple, has also impacted seasonality over the past year given the 
absence of the usual impact of the flags
hip launches of these large OEMs.
 
Turning to QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter to 
be in the range of 205 million to 225 million units, up approximately 8% 
sequentially at the midpoint, on seasonality and strength of our roadmap 
with Chinese OEMs. We expect QCT EBT margin to be approximately 16% to 
18%, up 200 basis points at the midpoint sequentially, on a favorable mix 
toward Snapdragon 700 and 800 tiers, partially offset by lower shipments to 
Apple. We believe Apple intends to 
solely use our competitors' modems 
rather than our modems in its next iPhone release. We will continue to 
provide modems for Apple legacy devices.
 
We expect that non
-
GAAP interest expense net of investment income will be 
approximately flat sequentially. We
 
expect our non
-
GAAP tax rate for the 
fiscal fourth quarter and the full year to be approximately 2% expense.
 
As Steve mentioned, we expect to terminate the NXP transaction after 
today's end date, subject only to receipt of evidence of a material change of
 
circumstances related to the deal. Termination will trigger payment of the $2 
billion termination fee.
 
Consistent with our previously announced Plan B alternative, following the 
termination of the agreement, our board has authorized the purchase of up 
to 
$30 billion of stock, replacing the existing $10 billion authorization. We 
intend to execute on a large majority of the authorization by the end of fiscal 
2019. Our repurchases will be funded almost entirely from balance sheet 
cash, and we will update you 
on the specific plans as we come to market. 
Our fourth quarter guidance does not include any impact of this new stock 
repurchase program or the impact of the $2 billion termination fee. The 
termination fee is expected to have approximately a $1.35 impact o
n GAAP 
earnings when recorded.
 
We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, maintaining a strong 
investment
-
grade rating, and to ongoing growth in our dividend over time.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.

Thank you. Good 
afternoon, guys. I guess just a question on the NXP 
dynamic. I guess, Steve, how do you think about M&A to achieve what you 
really wanted to get out of NXP going forward? And is your sense that 
Qualcomm can't really do any deals till the global macro tarif
f issues 
improve, or do you think NXP was perhaps something unique that you 
couldn't do and you could still go do other deals? I just want to understand. 
How do you go about the divorce that you talked about with NXP?
 
And then on buybacks, how do we think 
about the pace, and how do you 
execute such a large buyback in a short timeframe?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Amit, this is Steve. I'll take the first one. George, why don't you take the 
second half of that? So I'm not sure there was anything par
ticular about this 
transaction or any engagement around the transaction. I think it's probably 
more a statement of the overall macro environment that everyone's 
operating in right now.
 
For us, I don't know if it signals any difference in terms of our abili
ty to do 
things in the future. We are obviously from a capital allocation point of view 
obviously moving very rapidly into a stock buyback, which is where the focus 
is right now. But I don't know if I see anything closed down outside of the 
fact that it's 
just an unusual window, I think, for everybody involved in the 
industry right now.
 
George S. Davis

Qualcomm, Inc.
 
On the pacing of the buybacks, we'll come out with some information on that 
soon. But obviously, if we're going to get a large majority done
 
within 2019, 
there will have to be some form of accelerated buyback as a part of that 
plan.

T. Michael Walkley

Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
 
Great. Thanks, George. And just foll
owing up on the buyback and your 
guidance, is there any changes to the $5.25 in 2019 that you expect to 
generate assuming that the two licensing agreements are not settled? Can 
you maybe just walk us through the puts and takes towards getting towards 
that 
number, if that's still the case?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Let me just give you an update. So first off, we've not changed our FY 2019 
guidance. And as a reminder, resolution of our licensing disputes will be 
critical to our $6.75 to $7.50 objectiv
e. And if you think about the legal 
milestones that we've talked about in the past in support of driving these 
disputes towards resolution, we believe those milestones are on track and 
fundamentally unchanged.
 
In terms of the timing and impact of the share
 
repurchase accretion relative 
to NXP, obviously the share repurchase will depend on the timing of when 
the shares come in. It will also depend on the timing of the licensing 
resolution. You can get to actually a higher number than the NXP accretion 
that w
e talked about for 2019 of $1.50 with share repurchase. But of course 
that requires the licensing disputes to be completed. So right now, no 
change in our outlook of $6.75 to $7.50. On the $5.25, we'll have to look at 
really what the timing is on the share
 
repurchase and the implications of 
that.

Thank you, just two, if I could. First, a lot of talk about 5G. Could you just 
upda
te us on what you think that will mean to the Qualcomm model for both 
the chip and royalty businesses as far as ASP increases or market share 
gains you think that would result in?
 
And secondly on the chip business, it sounds like with thin modems going 
dow
n and a pretty favorable mix, I'm assuming you're expecting a pretty 
good ASP and probably gross margin move the next few quarters. If you 
could, discuss that a little bit. Thank you.
 
Cristiano R. Amon

Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Hi, Tim. This is Cristiano. So I'll s
tart with the 5G chip, and I'll shift to Alex 
for the license, and then we can come back and talk about the modem. 
We're very happy with what we've seen in 5G right now. 5G is accelerating. I 
think we said there are a large number of operators. And I can s
ay that all of 
our Snapdragon 800 OEMs today are planning to launch a 5G device 
smartphone in 2019. I think that positions us well. It's early ramp of a 
technology. But while we have seen revenue generations, I think if we are in 
a good leadership position
 
as the market moves, it could be a significant 
event in the later part of 2019 and 2020. And as you would expect, we see 
an opportunity for both revenue and margin expansion on the chip business.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
So this is Alex. On the Q
TL side, the 5G transition is very good for the QTL 
business. We have a strong IP leadership position, including within the 
standards arena and standard essential patents. We're also very well 
positioned with the licensing framework that we rolled out, as 
evidenced by 
the over 10 license agreements that we have just recently signed. And so we 
think that we're in a very good position for long
-
term stability through the 
5G transition.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Tim, on the gross margin, as you think abo
ut Q4, probably the biggest single 
impact pulling margin down is the absence of the other licensee payment 
which came in. What we're seeing is, despite lower Apple business, both 
quarter over quarter and year over year, you're seeing strength in the 700 
an
d 800 tiers in China in the chip business, and that's actually really 
moderated what otherwise would have been a more difficult margin story.

Chris Caso

Raymond James & 
Associates, Inc.
 
Yes, thank you. Just a question on the 606 adoption and how that affects 
fiscal 2019 guidance. Was that already incorporated in the fiscal 2019 
guidance that you have provided previously? Because I guess my 
understanding, as I'm thinking i
t through, is it would be a benefit to the 
fiscal first quarter against prior assumptions because that would capture the 
strong season. Am I thinking about that correctly?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
606 was always in our estimates for 2019. And reall
y, if you think about it, it 
just affects the shape of the year, not the size of the year. You get all four 
seasonal quarters in.
 
Operator
 
Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research, please go ahead with your question.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon 
-
 
Bernstein Research
 
Hi,
 
guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First on the timing of 
the buyback, if the buyback was supposed to give $1.50 for the full year, but 
it's going to take you through the full year to actually execute on it, how 
does it give you the full $1
.50 in 2019?
 
For my second question, the $100 million in revenue you have built into your 
guidance for next quarter and the quarter after, is that $100 million 
representative at all of your expectations for the run rate following 
settlement? And effectivel
y, did you take down your QTL revenue guide? It 
used to be $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Now it's $1 billion to $1.2 billion, but it 
includes an additional $100 million. So it looks like ex
-
that $100 million, the 
core business was taken down. Is that in fact
 
the case, or is that just some 
sort of seasonal or other issues that are going on? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Yeah. Let me maybe just start on the back end of it, on the numbers with 
respect to the $100 million. And maybe, Alex, after I'm
 
finished with the 
answer, you can jump in. But the $100 million really does not represent a 
change, or the $1 billion to $1.2 billion guide is really not a change. We said 
that depending on seasonal factors, we expect to be roughly between $1 
billion and 
$1.1 billion each quarter. And as you know, we're seeing the 
more seasonally weak quarter, although, quite frankly, a lot of the 
seasonality has come out as we look at the year because we're missing 
some of those flagship launches. So, the absolute market 
is generally pretty 
flat relative to that period. So, I think, overall, you're actually seeing a little 
bit better mix from QTL along with the $100 million.
 
In terms of the buyback, really you're going to need the 

 
you would be 
below $1.50 absent any reso
lution, and you could be well above $1.50 with 
resolution, which is the dynamic between the accretion that would come 
from a full year of NXP with the synergies in place and the share repurchase 
program, no real change in the math.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
Qualc
omm, Inc.
 
So, this is Alex. Really quickly, the $100 million in the quarter does not set 
an expectation for the licensing revenue should there be a resolution to the 
negotiation process. That is just a partial payment, but it does not reflect 
what's owed u
nder the agreement.
 
And as we said before, we're in active negotiations. And this is just a partial 
payment, and the negotiations are ongoing. As long as we think the 
negotiations are heading in a positive direction, we'll keep driving them. And 
we think t
his payment is a good faith indication that they are heading in a 
positive direction.

Thanks. Steve, I wanted to ask you a big pic
ture question back on the 
decision
-
making process, and hopefully we can help interpolate a little bit 
into how you're thinking about the future. But wonder if you could give a 
little more color as to where you saw the opportunity cost of continuing to 
wait
 
for China to go through its process and, as you described it, that 
political window to change maybe back more favorably. How are you 
thinking about the opportunity cost of continuing to wait, and why make the 
decision to move on now? And how should we be 
thinking about that and 
how you're thinking about the future opportunities for Qualcomm, 
particularly in some of these new areas that you're pursuing? Thanks.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Sure, James. So, I think the situation 

 
a quick reminder. 
We signed the 
agreement about 21 months ago. We also had already extended the 
agreement once. And I think very good discussions, by the way, with the 
regulators worldwide and, in particular, in China.
 
It was very clear to us that the macro environment was 
a very difficult 
macro environment to get something of this size through. And it was not 
clear that that was going to change in the future dramatically, particularly in 
the time window that we saw that we had to really move, and I'd say move 
toward two thi
ngs. One is, I think, the company needs to focus on the 
opportunities that are ahead. I think that's important. The other aspect is we 
just need to provide certainty, not only to our partners and shareholders, 
but also to the employees as to where we're go
ing. And we looked at that all 
together in a big mix and basically decided the right thing to do was to move 
on. We obviously have some time left on the clock here today, to be exact, 
but hopefully that helps you understand where we're headed.
 
I think you 
should also view it as a statement of what we feel very good 
about the business, where we're headed and the forward aspects, and we 
want to move on and really deliver that to shareholders, as we said we 
would.

Yes, thank you. George, going from 14 weeks in September to 13 weeks in

you guys believe that you're locked out of that account indefinitely? What 
will it take for Qualcomm to win back that business? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Really, what we see with an extra week is more the purchasing dynamics 
and decisions tend to be more indifferent to whether there's an additional 
week in the quarter or not. It's really around timing of launches. So it's 
really the 

 
we're seeing the major
 
effect on the cost side of the extra week, 
really of the run rate.
 
Cristiano R. Amon

Hi, this is Cristiano. Talking about your question on Apple, look, this is a 
very dynamic industry. I think we've been very clear, and we don't expect to
 
be in the next product launch, and we'll continue to support them with the 
legacy. And I think those are decisions that are made as the industry moves 
and design by design.
 
I think we continue to be focused on technology. We feel pretty good about 
our mod
em leadership. I think we disclosed there are some very interesting, 
I think, third

party customer reports that show our performance, and we will 
continue to be investing on the modem. And if the opportunity presents 
itself, I think we will be a supplier o
f Apple.

Matthew D. Ramsay

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Thank you very much, good afternoon. Steve, I wanted to ask a little bit 
about the adjacencies. One of the big thesis points of doing the NXP 
transaction was to give you guys or sort of jump
-
start the scale, particularly 
in automotive and the micro
-
controller IoT businesses. And now that the 
deal seems to be off the table, if you could, talk a little bit about the scale 
that you currently have i
n the adjacent businesses that you're ramping and 
how you think about that competitively without getting NXP done. Thank 
you.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Matt, I think maybe I'll differentiate it. The answer depends on which market 
you're in. So 
I think in the automobile segment, we already feel that we're a 
pretty large player. We benefited from the fact that we are strong in the 
technologies that are defining many of the new use cases, in particular 
telematics and the connected car through telem
atics as a product line, but 
also in our infotainment business. So we feel today we already have 
significant scale. Obviously, we'd have a much stronger scale with NXP, and 
we liked the transaction as a result. But our auto business is already a 
significan
t business, as I mentioned, $5 billion backlog and growing. So 
we're pleased with that, and I think we're well positioned in the technologies 
that will define the key excitement in the future as well.
 
In IoT, again, I think we're in the right place with th
e core technologies and 
the technologies that the industry is working toward. We do not have as 
strong an organic channel as would be brought to us by the NXP transaction. 
It's growing and it contributes to the business today, but we're going to have 
to au
gment that a bit here in the future. We hope to also move forward on 
that, but also deliver on the stock buyback in the interim as well. So this is a 
two
-
pronged capital allocation perspective I think from the company, but we 
feel lucky and pleased to have
 
a strong position in the technologies, which 
we think are the key technologies to winning in those markets long term.

Thanks for
 
letting me ask a question. Steve, just a follow
-
on to that is the 
first part of my question. How do you reconcile the $1 billion of cost
-
cutting 
where there's a number of press reports saying that adjacencies are exactly 
where the trimming is occurring wi
th your goal to diversify?
 
And then my second question, which is somewhat unrelated is, George, it 
looks like your MSM guidance is at least seasonal if not above seasonal at up 
8%. Considering what you said about Apple, is there something else going 
on the
re? Does the extra week benefit the revenue outlook for QCT? Any 
color on that would be helpful.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Ross, this is Steve. Let me answer that first question about where the focus 
is. Our focus of the cost
-
cutting is really 
more about focusing the company's 
resources on these areas as opposed to taking R&D or resources away. As 
you know the history of the company, we've had a number of other bets that 
I think are a little bit further outside of the core competency of the comp
any, 
and we're trying to focus on R&D in the areas where we think there are 
growth. Industrial IoT, automotive, networking are clearly above the line 
there for us, which we are excited about. We are moving some focused R&D 
toward those businesses versus aw
ay from them in total.
 
We are also looking at how we can spend money to execute on the licensing 
business with less spend. We hope to move into more of a peacetime 
situation with the licensing business, but rest assured we are very focused 
on focusing the 
company toward the areas that we've mentioned.
 
Cristiano R. Amon

Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Hi, Ross. On the MSM, I think there are a number of things that we see in 
our business, and I think that's reflected in the guide. I think number one is 
we see an extension o
f our key China customer going towards the premium 
tier. We mentioned I think we saw high demand on Snapdragon 700 and 
800 as they expand into the segment. We also see large
-
scale Chinese OEM 
international expansion that's increasing the MSM sales for us. 
As an 
example, some of our key customers now have products in the UK, 
Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal, and France, which is a new geographical 
region for them. And we expect that to continue, as China will bring large

scale 5G deployment in the later part

Thank you. I have two. First of all, on the payments in the QTL, George, with 
the $100 million that you're going to get in September and 
the $100 million 
that you'll get in December, does that fully catch you up by the end of 
December? That's the first question.
 
And then the second question is on the potential to get an injunction in 
China against Apple. I think there's a practical process 
around you to 
validate your IP. So my question is what is the process and whether you've 
checked all the boxes so that if you did want to pursue that, you could? 
Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Tim, in terms of the payments, the $700 
million in total is a portion but does 
not represent the full amount that we would expect to receive. In fact, I 
would say it's a fraction of the full amount that we would expect to receive 
under an agreement. It's not meant to be a catch
-
up, it's meant to
 
be a 
good faith payment while negotiations are going on.
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Tim, this is Don. So I think your question was about China and our patent 
litigation there against Apple. And the answer is yes, we are seeking 
injunctive relief
 
there. In some cases in China, you're not only entitled to 
permanent injunctions, but you're entitled to preliminary injunctions on 
occasion. But China is definitely a jurisdiction which is willing to enjoin 
infringers for patent infringement.

Christopher Brett Danely

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thanks, guys, just a couple quick ones. On the dispute with the $700 million 
in catch
-
up payments, I think before you've commented that
 
you expect that 
to end or to close before the end of the year. Do you still expect that? And 
would you expect the royalty rate to decline there? And then could other 
customers get wind of that and have their royalty rates go lower? Then any 
update on when
 
you think the Apple resolution will be settled.
 
Alexander Rogers 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
This is Alex. Again, I would not characterize this $700 million as catch
-
up 
payments because, as we've said, what these payments are, are partial 
payments during the context
 
of a negotiation which we feel has been moving 
along somewhat slowly but in a positive direction. And the partial payments 
are an empirical data point that we're making progress in the negotiation. So 
it's not final by any means. It doesn't represent what
 
is at issue in the 
agreement and what the values are at issue in the agreement and what the 
end result might be.
 
And so this is not a data point for other licensees to take and say somebody 
else is getting a different sort of deal. These negotiations are 
ongoing. We 
think they're positive. If they don't result in an amendment or a resolution, 
then as we've said in the past, there's an opportunity for dispute resolution. 
So again, I would just think about this as a good faith partial payment, not 
indicative
 
of the value of the overall agreement. What was the question 
again on Apple?

Okay, got it. So with respect to Apple, the way you should th
ink about it is 
we're on the same schedule we've laid out over the last several quarters. We 
continue to talk. We also have a number of legal strategies that are in flight. 
They're further in flight than they were the last time we spoke. And we hope 
that t
hrough the combination of either of those paths, we could get to a 
resolution, and we're confident that we will. No change in the timeline from 
what we've said previously.

I have a clarification and a question. George, on the ASC 606, I think you 
said, the September quarter revenue for the devices that are shipped in the 
September quarte
r, you said that's going to go on the balance sheet. I think 
it's going to be more than $1 billion going on to the balance sheet. Just 
curious, when do you expect to recognize that? When will that flow through 
to the income statement?
 
And then my question 
is on the OpEx, the $1 billion savings, could you give 
us an update in terms of where you are in terms of achieving that $1 billion? 
And once we get to that level, what do you expect the OpEx on a non
-
GAAP 
basis excluding legal range to be? Thank you.

So, under 606, the quarter that goes on to the balance sheet goes basically 
directly to retained earnings, never flows through the income statement. So, 
we shift ahead one quarter, which is where we talked about on the call the
 
change in the seasonality. So, our old Q2 is now Q1, and then the Q4 the 
following year will be the old Q1 of the year after that. So, you're going to 
get all four quarters in the year under 606, but you basically lose one 
quarter on to the balance sheet.
 
Obviously, we get all the cash flow and 
other elements associated with it, and we will just report the December 
quarter instead of the September quarter.
 
We continue to make progress on the timing of the cost program. We've said 
the baseline was $7.4 bill
ion for OpEx and that we believe we'll be able to 
take out $1 billion in 2019, which would put it at $6.4 billion. We'd be down 
about 5% quarter over quarter in Q4 or mid
-
single digits, as we said, 5%
-
plus quarter over quarter, absent the extra week. So, t
hat gives you an 
indication directionally. And we would expect another step down in the 
quarter following that as we make progress into the year. We believe we're 
on track and we're still confident we'll take $1 billion out relative to the 
baseline.

Yes, thanks very much. Can you, perhaps, just talk us through the timing of 
the court cases you have with Apple, so the timing of the cases, but mo
re 
importantly the timing of the judgments, and when you expect these to be 
finalized for Germany, for China, for ITC, for FTC, that would be very 
helpful? I've got a follow
-
up. Thank you.

Hi, this is Don. So, 
that's a tall order. I don't think I can give you all the 
precise dates, but we've got, as you said, in the ITC, for example, our first 
case has already had hearings. We're expecting what's called an initial 
determination in September and a final determina
tion there in January. 
We've got another ITC case that will be going to hearings sometime very 
early in the year, I think in January as well.
 
In China, we have multiple patent cases running in at least three 
jurisdictions there. Each of those is on a diffe
rent schedule, but they are 
moving along quite quickly. And so, we would expect something either by 
the end of this year in terms of hearings and trials or early in next year. In 
Germany, we've got a number of patent cases filed there as well in both 
Munic
h and Mannheim, and those are moving toward 

 
same type of later 
this year, early next year in terms of trial dates.

Okay, that's great. Thanks very much, Don. And then just maybe for 
Cristiano, on the RF busines
s, you're talking a bit about design wins for the 
first time on 5G RF. Can you maybe just talk about what type of attach rates 
you're getting with 5G RF with your 5G modem wins? Could you talk about 
addressing system solution modem to antenna? And where do
 
you think 
Qualcomm is really differentiating in 5G RF, specifically?
 
And I just wanted to circle back to the revenue targets for fiscal 2019 for RF. 
You talked about $2 billion to $3 billion, I think, of RF revenue in fiscal 2019. 
What's the revenue oppor
tunity that 5G might give you on top of this, over 
time? Thank you.
 
Cristiano R. Amon

Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Thank you for the question. So, I think maybe I'll start by saying we are 
expanding RF today. We have a number of designs that we have been 
reporting thr
oughout the year. I think those designs, some are getting to 
market; some will get into the market soon. We'll be able to see the 
teardowns, and we're happy that not only we're getting the complete end
-
to
-
end solutions in the low band, but also the mid and
 
the high band, 
including the PAMiDs, and the filters, and we expect that will continue.
 
With 5G, the reason we're optimistic about the opportunity of increasing 
attach rate is, when you think of millimeter
-
wave, you have to design the 
front end in the ant
enna and the transceiver integrated into a package, and 
also you have to optimize performance of a new technology in a new 
environment, where we have a time
-
to
-
market leadership. Those things are 
great trends for us to expand the RF business, which we're a
ctually pleased 
with the results we're starting to get right now.

This is Don again. I just wanted to correct something. I believe I said the 
ITC second case is going to hearing in January. In fact, it's going to hearin
g 
in September.

Edward Snyder from Charter Equity, please go ahead with your question.

Charter Equity Research, Inc.
 
Thank you very much. I'd like to hit, if I could, the QCT results, especially 
with regard to the Snapdragon 700 s
eries. I'm sure you guys have seen the 
uptick in wins for MediaTek's P60. They've seemed to have abandoned the 
high end to you, which is obviously very good news for your Snapdragon 
800 series. I know the Snapdragon 700 series has been positioned to fight 
back on that platform. The checks said they have gotten quite a few dozens 
of wins on that. Can you just help us out with the dynamic between your 
Snapdragon 700 series and their P60 series, especially in the mid
-
tier 4G 
market?
 
And then if I could also, C
hina has lagged in 4G overall. They've really got 
basic 4G, and I know they've put a flag in the ground about commercial 5G 
deployments by next year. That would suggest they're going to have to 
cover a lot of ground between LTE Advanced and LTE Pro between
 
now and 
then to make that target. Do you think there are some risks to their 
deploying 5G? Or maybe it will be delayed a bit beyond where they have 
targeted while they're trying to catch up? And what impact does LTE Pro or 
LTE Advanced increase in mix tha
t China's going to have on your modem 
business especially? Thanks a lot.
 
Cristiano R. Amon 
-
 
Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Thank you, Ed. So let me just start with the Snapdragon 700. The dynamic 
we saw in the China market with our key OEMs have been consistent with 
what
 
we have said for probably the past two years is the market is moving 
up. And I'll answer two of your questions with the Snapdragon 700 series. 
The Snapdragon 700 series, it basically was an opportunity, as a lot of 

 
some of the mid
-
tier devices 

 
OEMs ar
e more interested in bringing that to 
a more premium feature set. And one of the features that also drove a lot of 
the Snapdragon 700 is the advanced modem performance on LTE. In some 
other markets, especially outside China, you see some markets advertisin
g 
that even as a 4.5G technology. We saw that, for example, in Latin America. 
That was how the Snapdragon 700 series got labeled in terms of 
performance. So this is a good sign.
 
But also the Snapdragon 800 series, we saw pickup as some of the key 
customers
 
entered the market. So our view is the market continues to move 
into the right direction for us, and that bodes well with the expansion of our 
customers into other markets. Not to single anyone out in particular, but just 
looking at Xiaomi as an example, 
they're now in 70 countries, and they were 
the number four smartphone in Europe within one year. That's a good thing, 
and look at the global feature set of LTE as the design point for our 
customers in China, not only China domestic.
 
Going to 5G, that's whe
re things become more interesting. The scale of the 
user
-
friendly trial of the largest operator in China, China Mobile, which 
everyone on the infrastructure side and the OEM side is working towards the 
second half, is very large. And that gave us an indica
tion that the transition 
could be as meaningful as we saw with 4G, so that creates an opportunity 
for basically, jump in feature set in China towards the 5G with 5G in radio 
standalone, and we're excited about that as well.

That concludes today's 
question
-
and

answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you 
have anything further to add before adjourning the call?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

Qualcomm, Inc.
 
Yes, thank you. Just an observation that obviously the company has been 
through a lot in the last year, but I
 
also want to recognize that we've 
accomplished a lot as well, not only the strong quarter and outlook that 
we've put in, but also just the breadth and the depth of the product delivery 
that's occurred, the 845, the products Cristiano mentioned, as well as
 
the 
leadership position in 5G.
 
I think it's a testament to the tenacity and the dedication and the 
competitive spirit that Qualcomm has been known for. And I just want to 
thank the employees and our partners and our customers for supporting us 
through thi
s period and look forward to delivering for them in the future. 
Thank you, everyone.

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We 
delivered strong results 
this quarter with better than expected earnings per share reflecting 
continued disciplined execution on the strategy we outlined last year. We 
had a very productive year. QCT delivered the improved operating margin 
target we set la
st year and QTL made additional progress on new license 
agreements in China.
 
Last week, we announced our agreement to acquire an NXP, an established 
global leader in industrial grade computing, security, sensors, RF, and 
networking. The proposed NXP acquis
ition accelerates our strategy in growth 
areas with complementary and world
-
class technology, products, customer 
relationships, and strong sales channels across automotive, IoT, security and 
networking.
 
Our strategy and disciplined execution has put us in 
an excellent position to 
maintain our leading position in mobile, and strengthen it into the next wave 
of growth. And we continue to invest in technology leadership just as we led 
each mobile technology transition from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G LTE, we are 
leadin
g the way to 5G. Further, 5G will be the communications fabric for our 
emerging hyper
-
connected world.
 
In our licensing business, we continue to execute well as we enable the 
industry to benefit from the tremendous opportunities around the world, 
including
 
in China. We have now signed license agreements with nine of the 
top 10 largest Chinese OEMs according to calendar second quarter 2016 
global IDC data. We expect to continue to sign additional licenses with 
Chinese OEMs and increase the level of complianc
e throughout fiscal 2017.
 
Looking ahead we are very excited about the future. We have spent the last 
30 years interconnecting people. We will spend the next 30 years 
interconnecting their worlds by building on our mobile technology leadership 
in advanced c
omputing, connectivity and communications systems. Our 
priority growth segments, IoT, automotive and networking, are being 
transformed by mobile technologies and our proposed acquisition of NXP and 
our 5G leadership further accelerates our positions in the
se segments.
 
As evidenced by our fiscal fourth quarter results, we continue to drive 
operational and financial discipline to execute on our strategy to create a 
competitive cost structure, and we continue to focus our investments in new 
growth areas. As we
've executed this strategy to drive profitable growth, 
we've maintained our strong balance sheet and commitment to attractive 
capital returns, returning $6.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year and $21 
billion over the last two years. We believe we ar
e on a path to build 
QUALCOMM into the semiconductor engine for the connected world.
 
Turning to our QCT business, we continue to invest to lead the industry. In 
the premium tier, the Snapdragon 820 is in more than 150 smartphone and 
tablet designs, includi
ng iconic devices such as the Samsung Galaxy 7 and 7 
Edge, the Xiaomi Mi 5, and the LG G5, and this past quarter we announced 
the follow
-
on Snapdragon 821 that was recently launched in Google's Pixel.
 
In October, we hosted our annual 4G/5G Summit in Hong K
ong, where we 
announced new products in the high and mid
-
tier segments with the 
Snapdragon 653, Snapdragon 626, and Snapdragon 427, designed for 
enhanced experiences and improved connectivity. All three processors 
feature the X9 LTE modem capable of 300 me
gabits per second on the 
downlink and 150 megabits per second on the uplink.
 
We continue to extend our modem leadership across tiers and lead the 
industry to 5G. Our Snapdragon X12 LTE modem with features such as 
carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO, and 256
-
QAM 
modulation is capable of 
supporting 600 megabits per second on the downlink. Recently T
-
Mobile 
launched the first 4x4 MIMO technology service with the Galaxy S7 and S7 
Edge and has publicly talked about plans for implementing 256
-
QAM in the 
near future. SK
T and Telstra have launched similar capabilities, and we 
expect to soon see other operators do the same.
 
In February, we announced our Snapdragon X16 modem, capable of gigabit 
class LTE speeds, and we recently announced the world's first gigabit class 
LTE 
mobile device and gigabit
-
ready network in collaboration with Telstra, 
Ericsson and NETGEAR. This modem also includes support for LAA, the 
global standard for deploying LTE in unlicensed spectrum. The FCC recently 
began issuing equipment authorizations for
 
LAA, and we received the first.
 
We also recently announced our first 5G modem, which will support early 5G 
trials and deployments. The Snapdragon X50 5G modem is designed to 
support peak download speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second and will 
initially su
pport 28 gigahertz millimeter wave spectrum. The first 5G 
commercial products that will integrate the Snapdragon X55G modem are 
expected to be available during the first half of 2018.
 
In addition, QUALCOMM is accelerating the path to 5GNR, the global 5G 
st
andard for a 5G new radio standardized by 3GPP. 5GNR is expected to not 
only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable conductivity and 
management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission
-
critical 
services.
 
In January we announced our pl
anned joint venture with TDK to enable 
delivery of RF front
-
end modules and RF filters into fully integrated systems 
for mobile devices and IoT. The joint venture will draw upon TDK's 
capabilities in micro
-
acoustic RF filtering, packaging and module integr
ation 
technologies and our expertise in advanced wireless technologies to serve 
customers with leading
-
edge RF solutions into fully integrated systems.
 
In our adjacent businesses, fiscal 2016 revenues were up more than 40% 
year
-
over
-
year driven by growth i
n auto, networking and the addition of the 
CSR business. For IoT, we are leveraging our leadership in both connectivity 
and computing to deliver platforms to help accelerate adoption across 
multiple device types. We now offer over 25 platforms that help 
ma
nufacturers quickly and cost
-
effectively deliver IoT products including the 
Snapdragon VR 820 virtual reality reference platform, and a suite of 
connected camera solutions.
 
Smartwatches using Snapdragon Wear processors continue to be launched 
or announced,
 
and drones using our Snapdragon flight platform are already 
commercially available in the U.S. and China ahead of the holiday season.
 
There is also an increasing trend to use LTE connectivity for IoT. Building off 
the 100 plus designs we announced in June
 
using the MDM 9x07 modems, 
we have recent traction among many ecosystem players where the 
MDM9206 category MB1 modems featuring a purpose
-
built design for IoT, 
with lower power consumption and longer
-
range connectivity than previous 
LTE generations. We ar
e broadening distribution of Snapdragon processors 
with two announced parts, the 410E and 600E, available globally by third
-
party distributors.
 
In automotive, we expanded our design win momentum with global 
automakers across telematics, connectivity, and i
nfotainment. We maintain 
our position as the leading supplier of modems for telematics, benefiting 
from increased cellular attach rates in cars and the transition to 4G LTE 
vehicle solutions. And with the pending addition of the NXP business, we will 
have 
the breadth of technology and products to capture even more of the 
opportunity in these rapidly growing adjacent areas.
 
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a very productive year for QUALCOMM. 
Our strong results this quarter reflect the progress on our stra
tegy and 
disciplined execution for technology leadership in mobile and new growth 
areas. We are excited about the future as we continue to build QUALCOMM 
as the semiconductor engine for the connected world. I would now like to 
turn the call over to Derek.

Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a 
strong fiscal fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.9 billion, and total reported 
device sales were $74.2 billion, driven primarily by the conclusion of ke
y 
license agreements in China as well as stronger than expected 3G/4G device 
ASPs. QTL revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter was higher than our prior 
guidance based on the timing of concluding a key new license agreement in 
China.
 
Total reported device sa
les in the fiscal fourth quarter were also above our 
prior guidance with reported 3G/4G device shipments at a record 403 million 
units and ASPs at $184. QTL continues to make good progress in China, both 
in terms of signing new license agreements and colle
cting catch
-
up amounts 
for prior period sales.
 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed new agreements with both vivo 
and OPPO and recorded catch
-
up revenues related to prior quarter sales, 
including a significant amount for prior period 3
-
mode sales. Th
e externally 
implied royalty rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was approximately 2.5%, 
reflecting the impact of the catch
-
up amounts in the quarter, which included 
significant royalties from 3
-
mode device shipments and other device 
shipments in China.
 
In f
iscal 2016, QTL revenues were $7.66 billion, with total reported device 
sales of $267.4 billion, reflecting continued handset growth, particularly at 
Chinese OEMs, and catch
-
up amounts for prior period sales. The externally 
implied royalty rate for fiscal 
2016 was approximately 2.9%, as expected.
 
Excluding catch
-
up amounts related to sales prior to fiscal 2016, the multi
-
year amortization from the agreement that expired after the first quarter of 
fiscal 2016, as well as the acceleration of the license fees 
for the terminated 
infrastructure agreement we previously disclosed, we estimate that fiscal 
year 2016 QTL revenues would have been approximately $7.2 billion. We 
estimate that we collected royalties on approximately 73% of both 3
-
mode 
and non 3
-
mode Chine
se OEM global device sales in fiscal 2016.
 
As discussed last quarter, we initiated litigation against Meizu in order to 
protect our rights, and equally importantly, to prevent Meizu from continuing 
to compete unfairly against our other licensees that 
are respectful of 
intellectual property rights and have entered into license agreements with 
QUALCOMM, consistent with resolution we reached with the NDRC. In June, 
we filed complaints against Meizu in the intellectual property courts in both 
Beijing and S
hanghai, China, and last month we filed a complaint with the 
United States ITC, a patent infringement action in Germany and an 
infringement seizure action in France.
 
Regarding the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation of our licensing 
practices, we hav
e submitted an extensive response to the case team's 
report and are currently in the hearing phase with the commissioners. We 
have been providing further responses to the case team's report.
 
Turning to our expectations for global 3G/4G device shipments, in
 
calendar 
2016 we estimate 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices will be shipped, 
consistent with our prior forecast, with year
-
over
-
year unit growth of 
approximately 8% at the midpoint. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp in 
China as each of the operator
s pursues aggressive subscriber growth targets 
with their 4G plus service offerings, and design momentum continues to 
drive an increasing percentage of all mode devices across China.
 
We estimate that the global ASP for handsets shipped during our fiscal 20
16 
was approximately $185, reflecting an annual decline of approximately 6%, 
which is in line with our prior forecast. As we expected, the year
-
over
-
year 
handset ASP erosion moderated significantly in fiscal 2016 to approximately 
half of the rate we experi
enced during fiscal 2015.
 
Looking ahead to calendar 2017, we expect continued year
-
over
-
year 3G/4G 
device shipment growth. We estimate 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices will 
be shipped during calendar 2017, with year
-
over
-
year unit growth of 
approximate
ly 7% at the midpoint. We forecast healthy 3G/4G handset 
shipment growth to continue in calendar 2017, driven primarily by emerging 
regions, particularly in India.
 
We expect that the annual erosion in the ASP for handsets shipped during 
fiscal 2017 will fu
rther moderate as compared to fiscal 2016, driving mid 
single digit year
-
over
-
year global handset sales growth.
 
We expect strong growth in 3G/4G connected IoT device shipments in 
calendar 2017, driven by the increasing demands of industrial and 
commercial 
applications within the smart cities, connected home, wearables 
and consumer electronic segments. Additionally, several of the world's 
largest cellular providers are expected to launch commercial operations of 
scalable narrowband LTE platforms in the comin
g year.
 
To summarize, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and 
continue to see favorable trends for global 3G/4G device sales. We're 
focused on concluding additional licensing agreements and improving 
compliance in fiscal 2017.
 
That conc
ludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George.

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon everyone. I will begin with comments 
on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2016 results, followed by our first fiscal 
quarter o
f 2017 guidance and some perspective on 2017 overall.
 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.2 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $1.28. Our performance was strong in both QTL 
and QCT relative to expectations. The incremental EPS
 
results that were 
above the high end of our guidance range were largely driven by the new 
license agreements and related catch
-
up payments Derek described along 
with stronger
-
than
-
expected performance in our investment portfolio.
 
In QTL, in addition to th
e new licenses and related catch
-
up, stronger
-
than
-
expected 3G/4G device ASPs also contributed to the above expectation TRDS 
results.
 
QCT had revenues of $4.1 billion, reflecting MSM shipments modestly above 
the midpoint of expectations, driven by higher d
emand in thin modems and 
from OEMs in China. Revenue per MSM was modestly higher sequentially, 
primarily due to growth in adjacent businesses.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 3% sequentially, 
as expected, on cost controls and spending red
uctions under our strategic 
realignment plan.
 
During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1 billion to stockholders 
including approximately $780 million of dividends paid and $225 million in 
share repurchases. For the full year in 2016, we returned just
 
over 100% of 
free cash flow to our stockholders on share repurchases of $3.9 billion and 
dividends of $3 billion.
 
Our goals for fiscal 2016 were designed to improve our cost structure while 
repositioning the company to capture the next phase of growth. We
 
set 
three primary guidance points for 2016 as a result. First, we committed to 
making significant progress on signing new licenses under the approved 
terms in China, and provided a revenue target range of $7.3 billion to $8 
billion for QTL. We executed we
ll on that plan by signing key license 
agreements with leading Chinese OEMs and delivered approximately $7.66 
billion in revenue in the year.
 
Second, we set an ambitious $1.4 billion spending reduction program which 
was comprised of $1.1 billion in savings
 
and operating expenses, and 
engineering costs and COGS, and a $300 million reduction in the annual 
grant of share
-
based compensation. The program was fully realized by the 
end of fiscal 2016. A comparison of the program reductions against the SRP 
baseline
 
is found on our website and our quarterly investor deck.
 
Finally, we targeted to exit fiscal 2016 with a minimum of 16% or better 
operating margin in QCT for the fourth quarter, which was met as we 
reported 16.6% in that quarter.
 
Let's now turn to our fin
ancial outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We 
estimate fiscal fourth quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately 
$5.7 billion to $6.5 billion, down approximately 1% sequentially at the 
midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share to
 
be approximately 
$1.12 to $1.22 per share, down 9% sequentially at the midpoint. We 
anticipate fiscal first quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses 
to be approximately flat sequentially.
 
In QTL, we expect total reported device sales of approximate
ly $58 billion to 
$66 billion in the first quarter, down approximately 16% sequentially at the 
midpoint, primarily as a result of the timing of signing new license 
agreements and related catch
-
up payments recorded in the fiscal 2016 
fourth quarter.
 
In QCT,
 
we expect approximately 205 million to 225 million MSM chip 
shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 2% sequentially and reflecting 
seasonally strong demand, primarily from OEMs in China across a broad 
range of products. Share loss at a large thin modem
 
customer is expected to 
moderate the normally strong seasonal MSM shipment trend in the 
December quarter.
 
We expect QCTs operating margin percentage to be within approximately 
100 basis points of the fourth fiscal quarter. Both of our businesses are 
seein
g a modest impact in their outlook for the quarter as a result of a major 
customer's product launch challenges.
 
Turning to 2017, we are providing selective guidance points for the year. 
We're estimating mid single digit percentage growth for global 3G/4G 
h
andset sales for fiscal 2017, and 7% growth at the midpoint in calendar 
year 2017 3G/4G global device shipments, as Derek described. Consistent 
with last fiscal year and aligned with our semiconductor and large
-
cap tech 
peers, we are not providing fiscal y
ear revenue or earnings per share 
guidance.
 
We estimate our non
-
GAAP fiscal 2017 tax rate to be approximately 18%. As 
we discussed last week when we announce the proposed acquisition of NXP, 
we are modifying our capital return program ahead of the expected
 
close of 
the transaction later in calendar 2017. However, we remain firmly 
committed to our current dividend program and to continuing to grow our 
dividend in the future.
 
We are also committed to share repurchases at a level that at least offsets 
dilution
. Depending on the level of stock option exercises by our employees, 
we could return close to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders during fiscal 
2017 as our outstanding stock options have approximately two years on 
average remaining on their lives.
 
We exp
ect to delever quickly after the NXP transaction is closed, providing a 
strong foundation for future capital returns and enabling us to approach our 
pre
-
transaction leverage ratios within two years of transaction close.
 
That concludes my comments, I will n
ow turn the call back to John.

Great. Thank you. I guess I'll focus the question on the QCT segment with a 
nice increase in the revenue per MSM. Is this just mainly just stepping up a 
higher mix within the Chinese smartphone market? An

Hey, Mike. It's George. I'll take this an
d then maybe Cristiano will want to 
jump in. So if you look at Q4, I would say you saw some benefit from mix 
for sure. I would also add that you saw the impact of the adjacent 
businesses, which had a strong quarter both quarter
-
over
-
quarter and year
-
over

y
ear. Going into Q1, it's definitely the fact that you're seeing real 
strength in the high and mid
-
tier that's helping offset what might be some of 
the other impacts that we're seeing in the quarter. And also you're seeing 
some lower low tier, which helps t
he overall picture there.

And Mike, this is Cristiano Amon. Just an added comment, while we don't

the introduction of our new premium tier Snapdr
agon at 10 nanometer, the 
flagship. We also expect to continue to have growth in adjacent business, 
and that's going to have a positive impact and offset some seasonality we 
saw with OEM mix.

Thank you very much. I also wanted ask a couple of questions related to 
QCT. Steve, you talked about the performance advantages of your modems, 
but yet in the last couple 
of years, we've seen a couple of the highest profile 
phones opt at least in some regions to use modems that were somewhat 
inferior in performance. Can you talk a bit about what you can do encourage 
and make sure that at least the best phones are using the 
best modems and 
really playing to your advantage?
 
And then my second question is that, George, you talked a little bit about or 
your expectation that QCT margin should be within about 100 bps of what 
you put up for the September quarter in the December qua
rter. But how 
should we think about QCT margins on the more medium to long
-
term 
basis? Are we kind of at a new low or is this a new baseline? Or should we 
expect some volatility both up and down from current levels? Thanks.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
QUALCOMM,
 
Inc.
 
James, this is Steve. I'll handle that, the first piece of it. I think it also 
depends on where you're looking the world. If you look in China, for 
example, I think the migration to uplink carrier aggregation in the 4G plus 
has really been helping th
e business actually. So I think that's an area where 
feature leadership in the modem has certainly been able to be highly 
correlated actually with success. But you're right. In some areas we have 
seen people either de
-
feature or go with a less advanced mod
em. Now the 
way we think about that is that the networks themselves are moving, and 
that's not a sustainable long
-
term position to be in.
 
When we look at tear downs are or we look at comparisons between 
competitors' parts, the tear downs are very consisten
t with our view in 
terms of modem leadership. We are getting feedback from operators that 
they do want to upgrade their modems, and actually that includes their end 
market devices. The pressure to go to gigabit
-
class modems as well as 5G 
we think set up a 
good environment for us. But we do like the position of 
having modem leadership in the future, and we think we are going to be 
able to maintain that. We did, as you know, have to make some changes to 
our cost structure to make sure that we can sustain an e
nvironment where 
maybe that isn't always the case at any particular moment, but we still think 
that's strong strategic ground to hold.
 
George S. Davis

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
James, hi. It's George. On QCT margins, as we said, we expect to be within 
the 100 basis
 
points of where we finished the year. And I think that's at a 
time, too, when we're dealing with the impact of the share loss at the 
modem customer. So I think that's a positive sign. It shows a couple things, 
one, the strength of our position in China an
d how that's been impacting us 
overall, the strength of the product portfolio coming out in the second half of 
the year of 2016.
 
In terms of looking forward, clearly we'll be up year
-
over
-
year in our 
expectations. We haven't guided what we think that will 
be for margin, but 
there's still going to be seasonality. Obviously there is usually a big 
movement seasonally between our Q1 and Q2 for QCT and then strengthen 
the second half of the year. I don't know, Cristiano, was there anything else 
you wanted to add
?
 
Cristiano R. Amon

No, I just wanted to add that when we look for 2017, we feel comfortable

base. I think China definitely want to highlight. I think we expect to r
epeat 
in 2017 the success we had in China in 2016. And we're going to be 
upgrading all tiers across thin modems, the premium tier MSM and the mid
-
tier MSM while we maintain the operating discipline implemented during 
strategic realignment plan.

Simona K. Jankowski

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you. I wanted to shift the focus to QTL. I think last quarter you had 
suggested about $400 million in catch
-
up roy
alties that you had expected, 
which was basically the delta between the $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in 
your full year revenue guidance for QTL. And it looks like you recognized 
about half of that in Q4. So is it fair to assume that there's another $200 
m
illion of catch
-
ups left? Or is that amount larger? And by when do you 
expect to collect all of the catch
-
up payments?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Simona, this is Derek. Actually what we said was last quarter in Q3 we had 
about 

 
we had north of 
$400 million in out
-
of
-
period revenue in QTL. Part 
of that was from the resolution of our dispute with LG, and the other chunk 
of it, about $200 million
-
ish was from licensees that we were still negotiating 
with began reporting some of the royalties even a
head of signing 
agreements. That was all in Q3, and it was reflected in the $7.4 billion to 
$7.8 billion annual fiscal year guidance.
 
When you fast
-
forward into Q4, we've got some additional catch
-
up 
payments, as I noted in my remarks, north of $200 millio
n additional coming 
in in Q4, which gets us to 

 
and if you might recall from last time, we guided 
some additional progress with license negotiations in Q4, but not all of it. 
And we kind of over
-
delivered on that in terms of concluding additional deals 
wh
ich brought us above our Q4 guide, and right around the midpoint of the 
annual fiscal year guidance.

And I would just add, we had said going into the fourth quarter that there 
was more risk to meeting the midpoint of our gu
ide because the market had 
been softer than we would have thought at the time when we came up with 
the $7.3 billion to the $8.0 billion, and so 

 
but we felt we were making 
enough progress that we could make the guide that we did, and it turns out 
we made 
even more progress.

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Yes, hi guys. I kind of want to follow up on that last question. So your 
underlying royalty rate calculate
d, as I think Derek had called out, or one of 
you guys had called out, is 2.5%. And you're talking about a couple hundred 
million of catch
-
up payments. Can you give us any idea what the underlying 
royalty rate here was ex the catch
-
up payments? Are we talk
ing about rates 
as we look forward that are similar to the average for the full year? Or are 
we talking about something else? Just to help us think about what the 
underlying rates look like here.
 
And then the other question I had for you is related to the 
overall market 
demand. It's kind of hard because there's so many moving parts in terms of 
your TRDS, et cetera. It's a little bit hard to understand what's happening 
with the end market. So I just wonder if you could help us understand what 
you've seen in 
this last quarter with respect to end market demand and how 
you think that's trending as we look into next year. Thanks.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hey, Rod, this is Derek. So as we pointed out at the outset of the year, this 
year and probably even g
oing forward into fiscal 2017, the externally implied 
rate is going to fluctuate quite a bit quarter
-
over
-
quarter. If you look back in 
Q3, we were north of 3.2%. Then this quarter it swings down to 2.5%. 
Really the main driver in this quarter was the amoun
t of catch
-
up that came 
in within the quarter, both 

 
all of it really coming from Chinese OEMs, a 
combination of folks reporting under the NDRC terms, but also a significant 
portion of that under the lower rates that apply to 3
-
mode.
 
So we think that's la
rgely sort of a historical thing. If you look at the 
projections for 3
-
mode in China, they are expected to be below 30% of the 
volume at China Mobile by the end of 2016, end of calendar 2016. So we 
think this is just going to be kind of the fluctuation tha
t we pointed out 
would happen as we signed agreements and brought in catch
-
up. For the 
year, we came pretty close to the 2.9% longer
-
term kind of normalized rate 
we talked about in February at the Analyst Day. I expect we're going to see 
some continued flu
ctuations through 2017, but structurally and in terms of 
how we see the future unfolding, I think you can sort of think of that 
normalized 2.9% as a good longer
-
term metric. And we do expect next 
quarter will be up, because even if we conclude some additio
nal deals that 
we're making progress on, the amount of the prior period catch
-
up will likely 
be smaller.
 
And then on the end market, really, let me try to unpack it a couple of 
different ways. We're continuing to see good growth in units, so we're 
holding 
our guide for calendar 2016, which is about 8% year
-
over
-
year 
growth, and we put out a guide now for 2017, which is 7% year
-
over
-
year 
growth. And then the story that we really highlighted maybe three years ago 
is playing out very, very accurately to what w
e expected. The ASPs have 
continued to moderate in terms of erosion, and 2016 came in about where 
we called it at the beginning of the year, around 6% year
-
over
-
year erosion, 
and we expect that to further moderate into fiscal 2017.
 
So one of the guideposts
 
we set out in my remarks is if you look at the unit 
growth and the expected ASP erosion, we think the handset piece of the 
market in fiscal 2017 will grow about mid single digit. And then of course on 
top of that, you have the non
-
handset piece as well as
 
some continued 
improvement that we expect to drive in compliance, which means we expect 
to grow the business, the QTL business, at or above the handset growth in 
the market.

Thank you. Derek, just a quick clarification and the question. On the catch
-
ups, I'm assuming you're saying that vivo and OPPO are things that have 
past. Those catch
-
ups are d
one, and anything next year in the future will be 
from new deals.
 
And then I just wanted to talk about that 5% to 11% for this year. Thanks 
for the color on the 2017 number. But IDC and others, IDC I think just 
lowered their number for smartphones from 3% 
to 1.5% for the year. So to 
get to this 5% to 11% range, could you help us out a little bit? Is it more of 
the non
-
handset stuff? And in there that's driving it higher, do you think 
there's some misunderstanding about China? And related to that, the QTL 
lo
ng
-
term goal of $10 billion I think by fiscal 2020, it sounded like 
normalized was about $7.2 billion. So maybe just walk us through the unit 
ASP or new markets that would get us to that longer
-
term number. Thank 
you.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Tim, 
this is Derek. Yeah, the catch
-
up that came in over the last two 
quarters related to the signing of new deals. That's basically largely baked 
and behind us. We have signed nine of the top 10 Chinese OEMs now, so 
great progress throughout the year. We do ha
ve another one that we're 
continuing to negotiate with and continuing to make progress, as well as 
we've noted the litigation against Meizu, which we are hopeful will drive to 
an agreement at some point. So there will be some continued fluctuation in 
the r
evenue in QTL based on catch
-
up, both on combination of new deals as 
well as driving compliance resolutions. But the ones that we've talked about 
from the announced deals are I think basically behind us.
 
In terms of the market, I think if you look at the w
ay the market has 
developed throughout the year, a number of industry analysts have been 
more pessimistic on handset growth than we were at the outset. But at least 
so far, I would say the market's trending more in line with our view than 
what they set out
. China continues to be strong, and we saw another good 
quarter in the September quarter of 4G adds, and going forward we're 
expecting some pretty meaningful growth in 2017 coming from India and 
Southeast Asia, Middle East. So there's definitely big market
s where we see 
the opportunity for a lot of continued growth.
 
On top of that, we do see a lot of good trends with operators focusing more 
attention on things like narrowband LTE and more of the industrial, and in 
addition to consumer launches of IoT device
s. So that will be a growth 
opportunity as well, but the handset, underlying handset growth that we 
called for 2017 mid single digit I think is something we feel very comfortable 
with.
 
We're not going to update the sort of the $10 billion call that we gave
 
in 
February, but guess what I can say there is in terms of the new agreements 
that we've signed, and the way that the market is playing out since 
February, there's nothing really that would change the long
-
term view for 
the business.

Yes, thank you. Just could you help us understand what's driving the 
moderation of ASPs in 2017, Derek? You mentioned a higher mix of 
emerging markets. And I would just think India, Southeast Asia would put 
more downward pressure on ASP. So if you could ta
lk about that. And then 
the timing of the NXPI deal closer for late 2017 seems conservative when 
you consider just the complementary nature of the asset. And if we look at 
other deals in the space over the last year or two, they have been closing 
within ei
ght to nine months. So I'm just wondering if there's potential for 
this deal to close earlier than what you guys communicated a week ago.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
This is Derek. So on the first question, I don't think, it's really nothing new. I 
me
an, we've been talking about the trends that we expected to play out in 
the handset market, like I said, for the last few years. We expected to see 
some pretty accelerated erosion in ASPs for a couple of years and then start 
to moderate. But what we are se
eing in the emerging markets, although 
most of the growth going forward is coming from the emerging markets, it's 
the same trends that we had talked about we're continuing to see play out.
 
The Chinese OEMs are continuing to kind of move up tier as they gai
n share. 
Cristiano mentioned some of that in response to an earlier question. That's 
really been a good story. A lot of growth in China and across the Chinese 
OEMs even outside of China, in the mid to high tier, that volume is not just 
coming in at the low
 
tier. And part of that's being driven by the replacement 
rate story that we expected as people started to replace their phones and 
move up tier. We believe those trends are playing out and they'll continue to 
play out as we go through 2017. And interestin
gly, if you look at the 
reported ASP in the business for fiscal 2016, it was down less than the 
global. So even though we're pulling in some of the catch
-
up amounts from 
prior period, and some that stuff tended to be at the lower tiers, there has 
still bee
n some good stability across the ASP picture.

I'll comment on the NXP closing 
date. We totally agree with your comment that this is a highly 
complementary deal, and the industrial lo
gic for customers is quite 
attractive. So we didn't pick an outside date because we thought there 
would be a lot of regulatory push back. It was just designed to recognize 
that at the outside it would be by the end of the calendar year, but it could 
certai
nly be well before that depending on the regulatory reviews.

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. I guess I had two questions on QTL. First of a
ll, Derek, I think 
you had said that the gap in terms of dollars between TDS and TRDS exiting 
fiscal 2016 would be less than 10%. Obviously that gap is coming down, but 
can you give us some milepost in terms of where that gap will be exiting 
fiscal 2017? C
ould it be only 5% for example?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Tim, so we've given a couple of guideposts. One is that as we continue to 
negotiate and close what we call the key Chinese license agreements that 
were remaining, that if we could get those d
one, we believed we would be 
around 75% of their global sales that would be reported. We're not quite 
there yet. We've got a lot of good progress and certainly the largest player is 
done, but we're still in negotiations with one more of those. So as I'd 
me
ntioned in my remarks, we're kind of at the 73% mark now, and we need 
to make some more progress to get closer to the 75%. But I do think that 
we're on track to get there.
 
And then from there, we'll have to drive some additional signings and some 
complianc
e improvements to get that number up. The 75% that we last 
gave, it sort of aligned with around a little less than 10% global sales that 
would be unreported. And so we don't, I'm really not in a position today to 
guide where we end up in 2017 other than to
 
say we've been making steady 
progress, and we've got a number of initiatives underway in addition to just 
negotiating closing new agreements to drive the compliance in a more 
favorable picture for us. And we're going be working hard on that throughout 
fis
cal 2017 and hope to continue to narrow that gap.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had 
one and then a follow

up to 
it. The first, I guess Derek's comments on OPPO and vivo, what appeared to 
be catch
-
up in Q3, your comments that you just made seem to suggest that 
wasn't catch
-
up. That was actually run rate revenue they decided to report 
while
 
they were negotiating. So can clarify, is that in fact true? Were OPPO 
and vivo actually in the run rate of revenues in Q3, starting in Q3 and 
obviously going forward from now?
 
And then to that end, how do you guys, how to I get your QTL guidance for 
next
 
quarter? At the midpoint, $62 billion, it's only up about 2% year
-
over
-
year, and a year ago you should have been having very serious collection 
issues in China, much better than you're having now, and yet you're only 
guiding it up 2% year

over

year. So I 
guess are those two issues related 
and can clarify both of those, please?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Stacy, this is Derek. Yeah, so the catch
-
up situation is a bit complicated. I 
guess the best way I can lay it out for you is we got some catch
-
up in 
from 
the licensees that we closed on in Q4 into Q3 that were for prior
-
period 
sales, and they were not in the run rate in Q3. We closed the deals in Q4, 
which brought an additional catch
-
up for prior periods, but then also brought 
them into the run rate in
to Q4. So it's a blend of the two. Now George, if you 
want to take the next one.
 
George S. Davis

Thanks a lot. You mentioned that some of the offset to your QCT business 
was because of share loss in thin modems, and you made comments on the 
premium that QUALC
OMM has enjoyed and still enjoys among performance 
isn't as valued by some of your OEM customers as it has the past. Do you 
see that reverting back to the mean in any of the product roadmap in the 
next year or two that you're looking at? Because I know tha
t a lot of these 
phones are white boarded three years in advance. It suggests that there will 
be an increase on a premium for performance at some of those OEMs. Or is 
this going to be the state of the industry for some time on both competitor 
solutions, sa
y like Intel, but also in internal solutions? So I'd get a feeling for 
that.
 
And then in terms of Note 7, I know the cancellation, how much of an impact 
did that have on the quarter? And I know there's probably some forecast for 
that into the March period.

little bit more out in the first calendar quarter of next year? Thanks.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yeah. This is Steve. I'll take the first piece and maybe George can jump in 
on the end. What I 
meant to say earlier was I think there's maybe points in 
time where you can get away with not the leading quality or the leading 
edge feature set, but I don't think that's good strategic ground to hold. And 
our view of where our roadmap is going, the speed
 
at which the industry is 
moving, meaning the networks that are in the operators 

 
what their plans 
are to upgrade the networks, we feel very good about where our modem 
roadmap and modem business is going.
 
I gave a couple of data points about people launch
ing some of the more 
advanced either MIMO or 256
-
QAM networks. We see that happening. We 
see things like license assisted access happening, particularly in the United 
States, being a positive thing. The upgrade to 802.11ax, and the 
interconnection or the s
imultaneous operation between that and cellular 
being a good thing. And then just the general pressure on OEMs from other 
OEMs to use, let's say things like gigabit
-
class modems, we think is creating 
a positive design win, good feedback from our customers 
in terms of how 
that sets up.
 
So the individual, how that relates to an individual model and such and 
timing of that I think is really a better question for the OEMs. But we like 
where the modem business is headed, particularly as 5G happens and things 
lik
e narrowband IoT come into the networks as well. So I think that's where 
we are.
 
Quickly, maybe on the Note 7 and other devices, I think we did comprehend 
a little bit of impact from that in the forward guide. I think you should think 
of that as if there's
 
kind of a momentary hole in the market and we have a 
view as to how that's going to fill in. It may fill in maybe not perhaps in the 
entire first quarter, but it will fill in and we feel like we're well positioned for 
almost any scenario that you can thin
k of. I mean a lot of different OEMs 
could fill it in, including just a product transition within the OEM that we're 
talking about. So we feel like we're well positioned in any of those scenarios, 
and we did comprehend some impact of that in the first quar
ter guide.

When we look to next year, the growth is mainly coming from India. So 
wondering if you guys could discuss the strategy there and how can you 
differentiate in such a low ASP market? And then just se

wondering if the share loss at that key thin modem customer was greater 
than you guys had originally baked into your QCT planning and margin

Cristiano R. Amon

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hi, Dan, it's Cristiano. Maybe let me just 
start talking about the growth. I 
think one of the things we had said priorly, that we have been quite 
successful with our product line in China and we see a lot of the Chinese 
OEMs, and particularly the market in China, you see some of the larger 
OEMs in 
China consolidating the volume. And they look to export that into 
growth opportunities in emerging markets. That is actually a differentiating 
position of QCT. So I think the more that the Chinese customer base export 
outside China, I think actually help o
ur position both within China as well as 
the growth opportunities.
 
Specifically to India, we're actually excited about it. There has been a very 
large
-
scale LTE launch with Reliance that is moving the market towards 

 
from feature phone accelerated path to
wards smartphone with 4G and 
technology such as Voice

LTE. All of the concepts of all mode that has 
been successful in China can also be a driver in India. So I think that's how 
we feel good about basically ability to generate growth in those market a
s 
well. I think your second question, you want to take the second question?

Sure, be happy to. So we had talked actually the previous quarter about the 
fact that we had contemplated the impact of second sourcing in our full
 
year 
guidance in terms of where we thought QCT would come out on margin. And 
actually if you look back on the year, QCT not only exceeded the new margin 
target that we set, but they did it in a year where quite frankly the market 
itself was weaker, partic
ularly in the thin modem area. And it required us to 
recapture an important slot in the premium tier, which they did, but also 
rolled out a series of products across the low, mid and high tiers where we 
saw much stronger traction in China than we expected 
going in. So I think 
overall, it's a very strong year and our planning assumptions with respect to 
the second sourcing were always a part of that.

looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, 
including our most recent 10
-
Q, which contain important factors that could 
cause actual re
sults to differ materially from the forward
-
looking statements.
 
We have also recently provided a presentation detailing how we are creating 
substantial near and long
-
term value for our shareholders, including our 
fiscal 2019 financial forecast. That presen
tation as well as additional 
materials, including videos from our management team are available at 
qcomvalue.com.
 
And now, the comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve 
Mollenkopf.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, John and good 
afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a 
strong set of results in our first fiscal quarter with non
-
GAAP earnings per 
share above the high end of our prior guidance range, driven by better than 
expected ASPs and units reported by our Chinese license
es and stronger 
than expected demand for MSMs. Our strong results reflect the actions we 
have taken to drive our strategic objectives and improve profitability. We are 
benefiting from our technology and product leadership in mobile and 
leveraging that lead
ership into a growing set of opportunities across RF Front 
End, Auto, IoT, mobile compute and networking.
 
Our fiscal second quarter guidance reflects some higher than normal 
seasonality due to near
-
term inventory build in the handset market, 
consistent wit
h what others are reporting as well as the ongoing impact of 
our non
-
paying licensees. In QCT, we expect the strong year
-
over
-
year 
performance to continue in our fiscal second quarter, driven by favorable 
mix and product cost actions. Longer
-
term, our outl
ook for our business 
remains unchanged as we continue to see positive trends with higher than 
expected global smartphone ASPs in QTL and stronger share and product 
trends in QCT across multiple growth areas.
 
We made two very important announcements today t
hat expand and 
strengthen our overall relationship with Samsung. In our licensing business, 
we announced that we have amended and expanded our long
-
term licensing 
agreement. The license remains at the device level and continues through 
2023. It is importan
t to note that the amended agreement reached with 
Samsung is fully consistent with brand licensing practices and is consistent 
with our long term model. More importantly, it provides the foundation for a 
long
-
term stable licensing relationship with Samsung
 
following the KFTC 
investigation. And importantly, as part of the agreement, Samsung is 
withdrawing its opposition to our appeal of the KFTC's order. We look 
forward to continuing our long and mutually beneficial relationship with 
Samsung for many years a
head.
 
In our product business, we also announced a multi
-
year strategic 
agreement with Samsung in various technology areas and across a range of 
mobile devices. This agreement expands the company's longstanding 
relationship as technology and business partn
ers into 2018 and beyond as 
we transition to 5G. QCT had another very successful Consumer Electronics 
Show earlier this month with important product and partner announcements 
across RF Front End, auto, networking, mobile computing and IoT. QCT and 
its part
ners were awarded 52 Best of CES Awards this year, up from 17 last 
year, clearly indicating execution in adjacent opportunities and the strength 
of our design pipeline.
 
In automotive, we now have more than $3 billion of order backlog, including 
more than $
1 billion of order backlog in infotainment alone. At CES, we 
announced new auto designs with Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and BYD in 
China as well as a collaboration with Ford on cellular V2X. We also 
announced new flagship RF Front End design wins with Google
, HTC, LG, 
Motorola, Samsung and Sony, as we expand our share position, including 
filter rich modules and newly designed gallium arsenide power amplifiers.
 
We also introduced our unique 5G tunable front end solution, which utilizes 
modem intelligence at a 
system level to dynamically tune multimode RF 
performance and power efficiency when sharing radio frequencies and 
components across 3G, 4G and 5G. We believe this disruptive technology 
will transition RF Front End design leadership from dedicated component
 
suppliers back to the system solution provider in 5G, consistent with what 
happened with prior wireless generation transitions.
 
In networking, we announced solutions with expanded WiFi mesh capabilities 
as well as a new and upgraded mesh networking platfo
rm. We are the 
number one provider of retail and enterprise WiFi and we are reshaping the 
carrier segment with our mesh solutions while gaining share from key 
incumbents. Our success in networking is a result of a deliberate investment 
several years ago to
 
position our WiFi business with the structural changes 
we anticipated in the market.
 
Last week, we also made some significant announcements at our China 
Technology Summit in Beijing, further demonstrating our strong ecosystem 
partnerships and product lead
ership in China. Lenovo, OPPO, Vivo and 
Xiaomi joined us at the summit to announce that each had signed non
-
binding MOUs for the multi
-
year purchase of our RF Front End solutions, 
totaling at least $2 billion, which would represent a substantial increase i
n 
our RF Front End share at these accounts. The scope of our broad RF Front 
End platform includes gallium arsenide Pas, envelope trackers, LNAs, 
multimode PA and modules, RF switches, discrete filters and filter rich 
modules and antenna tuners across cellu
lar and connectivity technologies.
 
We also announced collaboration agreements in China called the 5G Pioneer 
initiative with Lenovo, OPPO, Vivo, Xiaomi, ZTE and Wingtech for the 
development of advanced 5G Mobile devices, targeting the 2019 timeframe. 
5G re
presents a market discontinuity in the mobile ecosystem and it 
coincides with China based OEM's plans to expand globally in the premium 
tier.
 
In our dispute with Apple, we continue to move closer toward a number of 
key legal milestones later this year and 
early next year. In various 
jurisdictions around the world, in cases concerning Apple's infringement of 
Qualcomm's patents, there will be hearings and determinations on whether 
Qualcomm should be entitled to injunctive relief and exclusion orders. Also, 
Qu
alcomm's case against Apple's contract manufacturers for breach of their 
license agreements continues to move toward resolution in the same 
timeframe, as does Qualcomm's case against Apple for improperly 
interfering with those license agreements.
 
We value 
Apple as a customer and would like to continue that relationship 
into the future, but it is in our stockholders best interest that we ensure that 
Apple pay a fair and reasonable royalty and operate on a level playing field 
with the other OEMs. While the li
tigation with Apple is necessary to protect 
our IP assets and our contract rights, we remain open to finding a path to 
resolution and collaboration with Apple as a partner.
 
Turning to demand trends for 3G, 4G devices around the world. Consistent 
with what 
others have been reporting, we are forecasting some short
-
term 
end market softness, driven by larger than typical sequential correction in 
orders from a fin modem customer and near term smartphone trends in 
China. George will provide more details on our up
dated forecast, but we 
continue to see favorable long term trends, including flagship handset 
launches later this year and the ramp of 5G device shipments beginning in 
early calendar 2019.
 
Turning to our pending acquisition of NXP, with recent approvals in
 
both 
Europe and Korea, only Chinese regulatory approval remains and we hope to 
receive that soon. We continue to see this as an attractive deal for both our 

brings together a compreh
ensive set of capabilities to address next 
generation auto and IoT devices and provides us with greater scale in auto, 
IoT, security and networking with their highly complementary products and 
world
-
class sales channel.
 
On January 16, we released an invest
or presentation that outlined the near 
term and long term value opportunity for our stockholders and our plan to 
deliver $6.75 to $7.50 in non
-
GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2019. We 
believe this appropriately frames the core earnings power of Qualcomm 
and 
the multiple levers we have within our control to achieve this, along with a 
significant value for our shareholders as we work through our outstanding 
licensing disputes. We took a conservative approach to modeling our fiscal 

nd our management team is very committed to 
driving this result for our shareholders. We outlined a huge opportunity for 
growth and diversification through our expansion into new complementary 
adjacent opportunities. This growth is underpinned by the expan
sion of our 
service addressable market from $23 billion in 2015 to approximately $150 
billion in 2020 or more than six times the size of Qualcomm's 2015 SAM.
 
Another important area of value creation is 5G and Qualcomm is leading the 
industry. Whether you a
re a phone maker and infrastructure company or a 
network operator, Qualcomm is already identified as the key partner for 
accelerating your roadmap to 5G commercialization around the world. We 
are partnering with leaders across the globe as we work to bring
 
5G to 
market, including Verizon, AT&T, Nokia, Ericsson, China Mobile, SK Telecom, 
Telstra, Vodafone, Orange, NTT DoCoMo, T
-
Mobile, Sprint and now 
Samsung. Our announced 5G Pioneer initiative further builds on this strong 
global momentum.
 
In closing, we re
ported a very strong set of results this quarter and our 
products and technologies are leading in their respective categories and are 
set to lead as we enter the 5G generation. These generation changes have 
always provided us with the opportunity to benefi
t from our significant 
technology lead and this will be true again to an even greater degree in 5G. 
Our technologies will expand into many industries as we enter the age of 
IoT, autonomous vehicles, always on mobile computing and ubiquitous 
networking.
 
I w
ill now turn the call over to George.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal first quarter non
-
GAAP results were very strong. Non
-
GAAP revenues were $6 billion, just 
above the midpoint of our prior guidance range and non
-
GAAP ea
rnings per 
share were $0.98, $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance range, 
reflecting strong performance in both QCT and QTL, In QCT, MSM shipments 
were 237 million, towards the high end of our guidance range. Overall 
performance in QCT was above expecta
tions, driven primarily by the higher 

before tax in the first fiscal quarter was up 32% year
-
over
-
year, the seventh 
consecutive quarter of year
-
over
-
year growth, reflecting the st
rong MSM 
demand, improved product mix and product cost initiatives.
 
QCT EBT margin was 21% for the quarter, above our prior guidance on the 
higher MSM volume and up more than 280 basis points over the same period 
last year. In QTL, revenues were $1.3 billi
on, at the high end of our prior 
guidance range, driven primarily by stronger than expected 3G, 4G device 
ASPs and units reported by OEMs in China for the September quarter. Recall 
that this excludes royalty revenues from Apple's products and the other 
lic
ensee in dispute. QTL EBT margin was 68%, at the low end of our prior 
guidance. EBT margin would have been 72% or at the high end of prior 
guidance, if not for bad debt expense recorded in the quarter related to a 
licensee that is facing significant financ
ial difficulties.
 
This charge also accounted for the modestly higher than forecasted OpEx 
expense in the quarter. The GAAP loss this quarter reflected the impact of a 
$6 billion charge related to the enactment of US tax reform legislation and 
the accrual o
f the European Commission's $1.2 billion fine announced last 
week. These two charges impacted fiscal first quarter GAAP EPS by $4.79 
per share and were excluded from non
-
GAAP results. The $6 billion book 
charge largely relates to the one time repatriation 
tax on our offshore 
deemed repatriated earnings and profits.
 
After application of applicable tax credits, we expect to pay $3.3 billion in 
cash taxes, back end loaded over eight years, beginning in January 2019. In 
general, we expect US tax reform in the l
onger term to result in a modest 
positive improvement in our effective tax rate as the increase in tax on 
offshore innings is more than offset by the benefit to onshore earnings. The 
European Commission fine relates to a decision on its investigation of a 
modem chip agreement that was in effect from 2011 through 2016. While 
we disagree with the decision and will immediately appeal it to the General 
Court of the European Union, it is important to note that the decision does 
not relate to our licensing busine
ss and has no impact on ongoing 
operations. We will post a bond in lieu of paying the fine during the appeal 
period. Turning to return of capital, we returned $1.1 billion to stockholders 
in the quarter in the form of dividends and buybacks.
 
Turning to our
 
financial guidance for the fiscal second quarter, we estimate 
revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion and 
non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of approximately $0.65 to 
$0.75 per share. These expectations are re
flecting weaker than forecasted 
smartphone demand in the December quarter. As a reminder, the fiscal 
second quarter is normally the seasonally high quarter for QTL revenues, 
absent the two disputes and the seasonally low quarter for QCT. In QTL, we 
estimat
e revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion in the fiscal second 
quarter, down approximately 4% sequentially at the midpoint.
 
We expect QTL EBT margin to be approximately 64% to 68%, down 
sequentially at the midpoint on lower revenues and 
increased litigation 
expenses. It is important to note the impact of Apple nonpayment is more 
pronounced in the fiscal second quarter as it is typically an outsized quarter 
for royalties related to Apple products relative to other licensees, given the 
timi
ng of their product launch cycle. Our QTL revenue forecast for our 
second quarter is also being impacted by softer sell through as demand in 
China in the December quarter was down on a year
-
over
-
year basis. We'll be 
closely watching Chinese New Year device
 
sell through results to assess the 
time period necessary for the supply and demand dynamics to rebalance.
 
Turning to the chip business, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 
170 million to 190 million units. This outlook includes the normal seasonal 
ef
fects of lower demand in the calendar first quarter, a larger than normal 
reduction in orders sequentially from a large modem customer as well as 
near
-
term lower than expected orders from customers, particularly in China 
on inventory concerns from the dema
nd dynamics. This forecast is 
consistent with continued strong chip share in the quarter. We expect QCT 
revenue per MSM to be up on a sequential basis in the fiscal second quarter, 
driven by seasonal factors and favorable product mix.
 

l second quarter EBT margin to be approximately 13% 
to 15%, down sequentially on lower MSM volumes, offset by benefits from 
product cost initiatives, but up 100 basis points year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint. We anticipate fiscal second quarter non
-
GAAP combi
ned R&D and 
SG&A expenses will be flat to down approximately 2% sequentially, as 
increased litigation expenses and the reset of Employee Benefit taxes are 
more than offset by the absence of the prior bad debt charge. We will be 
implementing the cost reduct
ion initiatives in the quarter and are in the 
process of determining the expected charges for severance and other related 
costs. We will provide that information once that estimate is finalized.
 
Non
-
GAAP interest expense, net of investment income, in the f
iscal second 
quarter is expected to be roughly flat sequentially at approximately $60 
million. Given the market dynamics we have described, we are updating our 
unit outlook for calendar year global 3G, 4G devices for both 2017 and 2018. 
For calendar year 2
017, we have adjusted the midpoint lower and narrowed 
our range. We now expect 3G, 4G device shipments of approximately 1.75 
billion to 1.8 billion units, up approximately 4% at the midpoint year
-
over
-
year. For calendar year 2018, we are bringing down our 
estimate modestly 
to reflect the lower 2017 base. We now estimate a range of 1.85 billion to 
1.95 billion 3G, 4G device shipments for calendar 2018 or up approximately 
7% from the midpoint of our expectations for calendar 2017.
 
With respect to fiscal 2018 
global 3G 4G device else, we now expect global 
device ASPs will increase year
-
over
-
year, based on strength at the mid and 
premium tiers as opposed to our previous expectation of a low single digit 
percentage decline. We are not revising our estimate for fi
scal 2018 device 
sales until we get a clear picture of whether the ASP pick up well more than 
offset the sell through issues discussed earlier.
 
Turning to 2019, we continue to be highly confident in our outlook for fiscal 
2019 as recently disclosed in our 
investor presentation with base non
-
GAAP 
EPS of $5.25, growing to between $6.75 and $7.50 per share upon 
resolution of the licensing disputes.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.
 
John Sinnott
 
Thank you, George. Operator, we a
re ready for questions.
 
Question
-
And
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Tim Long with 
BMO Capital Markets.
 
Tim Long
 
Just wanted a little more color on the Samsung arrangements here. It 
sounds like you ext
ended with FRAND terms, just talk to us a little bit, I 
know the prior deal had an upfront payment, it had some technology IPR 
transfers as well, so can you just talk a little bit about how those two in the 
new collaboration factor into the FRAND rate disc
ussion for Samsung? And 
then I have a follow
-
up after that.
 
Alex Rogers
 
Tim, this is Alex. So the amended and expanded agreement basically takes 
the prior deal and just adds some changes to it. So a lot of what was in the 
prior deal remains in place. So fo
r example, the upfront payment that you 
talked about. The key things to keep in mind about this Samsung amended 
license agreement is that it's consistent with our FRAND licensing practices. 
It remains a license at the handset level. This is not a chipset l
evel royalty 
bearing license. And so it also 
--
 
one key element also is an expansion of 
rights back to Qualcomm to Samsung's patent portfolio. And one of the key 
factors to keep in mind is that as part of this amendment and this new 
arrangement with Samsun
g, Samsung is going to be withdrawing from its 
intervention in the KFTC appeal, adverse to Qualcomm. So they'll no longer 
participate in that matter adverse to Qualcomm. And from a financial 
perspective, it supports the numbers that we put out for 2019 fis
cal year 
and beyond and provides a strong foundation for Qualcomm and its 
relationship with Samsung through 2023.
 
Tim Long
 
And then just if I could just follow
-
up on the China business, it sounds like a 
lot of moving parts there. September was really stron
g for the device 
manufacturers, then weakening. Could you just talk a little bit about what 
you think is going on with the reason for the change in demand there and 
second could you talk 
--
 
it's been a pretty good market share gain region for 
you. Can you 
talk about if you still think you're taking share in the Chinese 
end market? Thank you.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi, Tim. This is Cristiano. I think we talk about a near
-
term weakness in the 
domestic China market based on the sell through data in the December 
quarte
r and that was contemplated in our guidance. I think you need to 
think about there was a super 
--
 
expect a super cycle and I think one of the 
flagships and you think that the Chinese OEMs didn't want to go ahead and 
most of the new products are going to la
unch in the Chinese New Year. So 

we will monitor the Chinese New Year data and whatever could be inventory 
into the quarter, we should rebalance in the first half of the year. We 
also 
see that the forecast is consistent with two things happening for QCT. I think 
both are strong chip share with those OEMs as well as mix improvements. 
So we can't really talk about the second half of the year, but the Chinese 
New Year launches is just
 
ahead of us.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Cristiano, just talking about 5G, Qualcomm historically gains share with new 
wireless technologies. Can you just update us on how you see 5G ramp
ing 
and why Qualcomm is ahead of the competition, maybe what technology 
areas you see the competitors might lack and then also just on the China 
side, also a follow up question, just can you talk about some of these RF 
agreement and how you see your RF bus
iness ramping over the next two 
years?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Yes, Mike. So let me start with 5G. We have been pretty consistent talking 
about a 5G acceleration in the industry and we now probably have line of 
sight of a number of the appointments that are going t
o happen of the 
network, of the 3GPP global 5G standard in the later part of this year and we 
are working with a number of OEMs to have smartphone launches in the first 
half of 2019. And part of that, I think we also announced in China last week 
a 5G Pione
er I think program of a number of OEMs of the China market, 
they see 5G as a discontinuity to basically enable their expansion plans to 
become global players, leveraging their 5G transition. So I think the 
motivation to have early launches in the first hal

marching towards that date.
 
So your second question is about competitiveness of 5G. 5G brings a 
number of complex technologies. One is you have the foundation, which is 
gigabit LTE, which is we've been investing in 4G continuous t
o evolve the 17 
smartphones in the market today with that capabilities used in a Qualcomm 
modem. We also have the addition of two other frequencies, sub
-
6 and 
millimeter wave and we continue to see complexities in the RF. So we're 
looking at our position a
s been a company that has been in a good position 
for the 4G, which continues to evolve and being supporting multiple global 
activities with 5G. We have announced probably trials in over the year, I 
think test towards all of the infrastructure vendors acro
ss all of the operators 
launched. So I think scale is going to be an advantage for us and we're 
optimistic about the prospect.
 
Your last question is RF Front End. We announce a total of $2 billion in RF 
Front End purchase across four OEMs. We're starting t
o ramp designs. I 
think, it's probably a second set of announcements. The first one was CES, 
when we announced a number of OEMs and then Chinese OEMs was in the 
second wave. We also feel good about the 5G story in front end. When 5G 
technology gets launche
d, I believe the baseband in the system platform, 
the reference design plays a stronger role in defining RF Front End 
configuration. As part of the same discussion, we saw support in China for 
our tunable front end solution.
 
Operator
 
Our next 
question is from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital 
Markets.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
Couple from me as well. Could you maybe help us understand how much of 
an impact are you seeing in your revenue line from the China inventories 
that you guys talked about 
and do you think this is something that gets 
worked through the March quarter or could it persist through the June 
quarter as well?
 
George Davis
 
Clearly, I think two major factors when we think about Q2 is, one is the 
China weakness really impacted custome
rs that felt they were going to have 
a stronger sell through at the end of December. And so as Cristiano said, 
we're going to be watching very closely the Chinese New Year sales to see 
how much of that gets absorbed in the second quarter. So we don't know 
yet. There may be some activity that carries on beyond that. But for our 
revenue overall in the second quarter, there are some other factors that are 
also at play.
 
One in the licensing business, normally, obviously, this is the very strong 
quarter for lice
nsing, but it also happens to have usually a very heavy 
weighting of Apple because their flagship launch tends to take place as you 
know in the fourth calendar quarter, which is the second fiscal quarter for 
our licensing business. The absence of that, we'
re not seeing as much of a 
seasonal pick up as we would normally see there plus the licensing estimates 
reflect the lower sell through that we ended up seeing in December that 
really didn't impact the chip business.
 
Amit Daryanani
 
And I guess if I could fo
llow up, the OpEx guide that you guys have for 
March quarter, if my math is working correctly, the implication is OpEx as a 
percent of sales will be something north of 35%, and I realize there are 
some one
-
time variables there, but should we talk about wha
t are these 
one
-

percentage of revenues and when do you get to realize all the $1 billion cost 
takeout benefits you talked about.
 
George Davis
 
Yeah. I think the OpEx as a percent of revenue, it c
ertainly had a little bit of 
a bounce, but that was more in Q1 relative to the bad debt charge. When I 
think about OpEx for the company, I think you've seen really since the 
strategic realignment plan, the major drivers of any pick up have either been 
our 
investment in pre
-
commercial 5G or the increase that you've seen in 
SG&A to support the higher litigation and model defense spending that we 
have. We think under the $1 billion plan, we can absorb the 5G costs that 
you've seen.
 
We think as we move our focu
s further into these new sort of available 
markets we've talked about, we're going to be able to reprioritize our 
investment portfolio and take an additional cost out, but really the biggest 
savings are going to come out of SG&A, which has been a big drive
r of our 
growth in OpEx over the last four or five years. In particular, in the licensing 
area and in this model defense and we think we have a clear path to 
--
 

real focus on ove
rhead cost as well as part of the SG&A.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
I had a question on the 2019 guidance. So you're talking a lot about 5G 
ramping and everything else, which sounds grea
t. But it seems like if I take 
a look at that guide, 525 without fixing licensing, 375 without the buyback, if 
I take out the 1 billion cost cut that isn't really in numbers right now, it's 
more like 315, which seems to be quite a bit worse than where the 
street is 
and I would say inconsistent with some of your commentary on some of the 
good things coming down the pipe. So I guess can we talk a little bit more 
about what's actually in that guide, what are you assuming is getting worse 
between now and then. 
You mentioned Samsung's new royalty payment line 
with your numbers, are those getting worse versus where they are now, 
what you assuming for Apple share and any color you can give us on that 
would be helpful? And then I have a follow up.
 
George Davis
 
Sure,
 
Stacy. This is George. I think your math is generally good, but what 
we 

 

conservative assumptions into the numbers that quite frankly if you did the 
math based on a run rate today, you would sa
y would be a lower run rate 
than we're experiencing today and that is by taking out Apple, all Apple 
revenue related to new products, including both the modem and the front 
end and saying if for whatever reason, we're still litigating or pursuing an 
agreem
ent with Apple and haven't reached it and they decide to take the 
decision to carve us out completely, what does that look like?
 
So again the purpose of that estimate was really to provide stockholders 
with a high confidence based number before resolution 
of the licensing. So 
as they consider alternatives that they can understand what does the kind of 
core earnings look like on a conservative basis, but you're right, it would be 
below the run rate today and it was purposefully conservative. We also have 
som
e tax impact in the 525 number. Tax reform for us is a little higher tax 
on offshore earnings, lower earnings on onshore. Net
-
net, it's slightly 
positive, but when you break it out the way we did in that analysis, it's 
negative in the 525 and it's positive
 
on the resolution basis.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
So my follow
-
up, you mentioned a lot of the 1 billion coming out of SG&A 
and obviously have a lot of accelerated litigation and other costs there. Is it 
imperative that you actually do sell out licensing in time for 2
019 in order to 
realize that full 1 billion.
 
George Davis
 
No. We think there's some contribution but that's not the primary driver. 

--
 

that as part of the process of addressing the many o
ther challenges leading 
up to this. We think we have some opportunities there. We certainly believe 
that as we look at our roadmap that we had to reduce overhead related 

not highly
 
dependent solely on a piece dividend to get this number. We think 
we'll be able to deliver the number.

Our next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Equity.
 
Romit Shah
 
I had two. George, just on the tax rate. There's a lot there. C
ould you just 

assuming? And then the other question I had was just on NXPI. It would 
seem that closing this deal in a timely manner would be an important part of 
your value creation s
tory. And so assuming you close or you get regulatory 
approval from China, could you give us a feel for what the timeline would 
look like from there to the actual closure of the deal?
 
George Davis
 
So on tax, we've guided the tax rate this year for 
non
-
GAAP at 8%. 
Obviously with the impact of tax reform and the fine, which is not tax 
deductible, the GAAP number doesn't really hold a lot of information. 

somewhat accretive relative t
o our history. We have not guided, but we were 
in the midteens before in our tax rate and I would be closer to that number 

 
And then on NXP, not a lot we can say at this time other than we're very 
focused on working with M
OFCOM to secure the final approval. Shortly after 
regulatory approval, the tender process will begin and then within 
--
 
depending on, there's two tender processes anticipated depending on how 
that process goes and you could close within say three weeks of 
the 
approval of regulatory.

Our next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Cristiano, just a question on the RF strategy. It looks like you're winning a 
lot of designs out there. If I look at the lands
cape out there, the margin 
profile in that business is quite strong at least at the operating margin level. 
As you expand your footprint, how should we think about QCT margins? Do 
you see an expansion potential here or are you being a little bit aggressive
 
on the pricing side, given that you're starting very early?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
We talk about in our 2019 projections, I think this could contribute $2 billion 
to $3 billion in revenue and I think we're starting to, as we have the 
complete portfolio and partic
ularly the ones that have higher value such as 
the PA and the high filter content modules, we see as an opportunity for us 
to grow faster than the market because we attach an existing MSM and an 
expansion of margin contribution in the device and I think th
at's consistent 
with the strategy we have pursued of diversifying and growing in other 
areas, leveraging our existing channel.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
 
James Faucette
 
I had a couple of quick follow
-
up questions. I guess the first one for 
Cristiano, you talked about bringing to market a mobile device 5G in 2019. 
At the same time, we've heard a range of comments from carriers on their 
own outlook for 5G. So maybe you can help us understand kind of thei
r 
circumstances and the geographies where 5G starts to make first 
--
 
makes 
sense first and then where we would sit it develop from there.
 
And then I guess my second follow
-
up question is just on the cost 
containment or reduction program, what are the thing
s that would allow you 
to expand that further and further reduce expenses versus what are the 
competing elements that may limit it to that roughly $1 billion target? Thank 
you very much.
 
Cristiano Amon
 

the second question. So 
on 5G, I think 5G as it becomes a significant contributor of volumes are 

and particularly, for our position in the chipset, I think early launches and 
a
bility to cover that globally define your competitive position and the ability 
to have a mature product, so you can ramp volumes in premier devices 

activity across all the developed
 
markets, we see activity in the United 
States with at least two of the four carriers that is consistent with the 

see in Europe, at least three operators.
 
You should expect in 
markets such as the UK and markets such as Germany, 

announced trial activities and the timeline is the same as the first half of the 
2019. Of course, you have Korea with all of the
 
operators driving o the 
timeframe. You do have a technology race there. You have Australia in the 

beginning of 2020.
 

h is 
China Mobile. In an event that we had in China last week, I think the 
executive management of China Mobile made a presentation together with 

The reason China is important be
cause China, it's a very technology focus 
and harder focus market and as you look at the position that the Chinese 
OEMs have in the market, that enables an acceleration of the scale for the 
smartphone market. So China is likely going to be a significant de
velopment 

 
George Davis
 
On OpEx, I think the 
--
 
if you think about our R&D, we're always going to be 
focused on making the level of R&D investment that is necessary to keep us 
ahead in things like generation transistors and where 

the ramp 
--
 
one of the ramps, the biggest part of the ramp and spending 

not only to the ability of the chip business to come out very strong in a 
leadersh
ip position in the early phase of the generation, but it's also why the 
value of our licensing program remains strong throughout the ecosystem. So 
you're going to see us take actions that are consistent with maintaining a 
strong level of R&D to preserve th
at position over time.
 
We do think that SG&A has been inflated by a number of the challenges that 
we've seen over time. We think we have the opportunity to take that down, 
something on the order of 200 to 300 basis points on a stabilized basis. And 
we will
 
look very strong within the industry with SG&A at that level. It'll look 

focus on R&D because quite frankly we have the channels to get a return on 
that R&D, not only from the chi
p business and the licensing business but 
we're now seeing an even greater return on R&D as we expand in to 
automotive, IoT, networking, mobile compute, all of these markets are 
looking to the technologies that we lead in mobile as part of their next 
roadm
ap. And so we think that's ahead of us. We think that's part of the 
growth and we think anything we do on this billion dollar OpEx action will be 
consistent with that outlook.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete.
 
Brett S
impson
 
I just had a question about the margin structure in QCT long term. I guess 

margins structurally rise over the last few years, typically leadership 
franchises that are returning 40%
 
or so operating margins. And if I look at 
your QCT PBT margins, they have been really disappointing in the 4G era. 
So I was just wondering when you look to 5G and you believe you have a 
competitive advantage, a structural competitive advantage in this mar
ket 
and you're going to be selling more platform into RF and baseband and RF 
has been a much higher returns business than QCT over the years, is it a 
path where you see the QCT margin starting to inflect and you can reflect 
the returns of a real leadership
 
franchise long term? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
This is George. As we said, we expect QCT margins to continue to improve 
over time and rise above the 20% level. But one of the things I would point 
out, we've said that the growth in adjacencies has been a pos
itive in that 
respect and it's certainly growing. It is accretive to the margin profile and I 
think it is getting us into markets where the structure 
--
 
the margin 
structure is more attractive over time. And so we'll continue to push hard on 
margin expansi
on and I should point out as the 2019 performance that we 
put out for the company doesn't include the margin benefit that we would 
expect to see as we enter the 5G era where we get both improvements in 
share and improvements in ASPs in the new devices and 
that's part of even 
in the core business where we're going to see expansion of margin.
 
Brett Simpson
 
And maybe just a follow
-
up on the Samsung arrangement that you 
announced, does it have any bearing on how you think about foundry 
relationships long term. 
I think in the last couple of years, you've been 
exclusively using Samsung LSI at 14
-
nanometer and I'm wondering whether 
that's something you think will continue as you move to 7 or particularly 
with this recent agreement with Samsung or will you be multi
-
sourcing 
leading edge going forward? Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

them on an individual basis depending on what node and the details of a 
node. So it really just depends on the 
generation in terms of where we go. 
Now that being said, I think it is advantageous for us to have a broader set 
of assets in the company to be able to resolve issues with companies. And 
so we view our wafer volume and the fact that we have wafer volume fr
om 
RF to the leading node as being a strategic asset for us. It's actually proven 
to be that way over the last several years. So I won't talk about where we're 
going, but I do think it is something that helps us strategically.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is
 
from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Seymore
 

earnings targets out there, it looks like you have a high level of confidence 
that the licensing issues will be re
solved. So my first question is what gives 
you that confidence? And then the second question that's somewhat related 
is I wondered if we could get an update if any on the unnamed dispute that's 
going on and I assume given the arrangements today and agreeme
nt that 
that second dispute is not with Samsung? So those are the two questions.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

but on the disputes, a couple of things. I think there are a number of legal 
milestones that occur this year that are helpful typically in a licensing 
dispute, legal milestones provide an opportunity and a forcing function for 
the parties to sit down and to finally work things out. We've seen that in the 
case of our past history, b
oth recently and over the last decade, which I 
think is helpful.
 
Don can 

 
with any follow up can answer that pretty well. I'm sorry you had 
another question toward the end.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
So on the unnamed other licensee, our practice has been that while w
e still 
believe there is 
--
 
it's productive to continue with negotiations that we don't 
name the licensee in a dispute. t's only when we get to the point where we 
feel like we've exhausted all practical activities there and so you should take 
that as we're
 
still negotiating to see if we can resolve the dispute.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And I would say also, this is Steve again. I think that the significance of the 
agreements that we announced today with Samsung I think are 
--
 
I think 
they're pretty evident, but we'
re quite pleased with those agreements. 
They're consistent with what we have done in the past in our forward looking 
plan and I think they also provide a good benchmark or reference point for 
our general licensing program moving forward as well. So I think
 
those 
things to us provide good indicators that I think we're headed in the right 
direction as a business.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
 
John Pitzer
 
I guess my first question is for Cristiano. 
Cristiano, I was wondering to make 
sure I understand the RF market opportunity. To what extent can you guys 
drive revenue on the 4G node versus the 5G node and I guess as you think 
about 5G and it sounds like your value proposition goes up significantly at
 
5G. How are you guys thinking about sort of the dollar capture potential per 
phone 
--
 
the incremental dollar capture?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi, John. Thank you for the question. In 4G, we have been in the process to 
complete our product portfolio. We have been p
layers within the antenna 
tuner and the envelope tracker and I think now we add into the portfolio 
starting to have designs and get ready to ship with our PAs in filters and 
actually going after the higher value segment, which is the multimode PA 
and the p
ayment modules. And I think you're going to start that traction 
--
 
starting to happen within the second half of the year. That's the reason we 
talk about China in the China announcement with our OEMs.
 
I think the China nature of the market, they look more 
of a system solution. 
I think as we establish our business there, we see a power off our MSM 
platform and be able to actually have a complete platform and so it's natural 
that you see that reaction coming from the China OEMs and that's how it's 
going to st
art building the business in 4G. As you said, 5G changes the 
landscape significantly because it changes giving a little bit more voice to the 
system solution provider and the baseband provider about what is the 
technology and they are at design that goes i
n the technology launch 
configuration as well as the opportunity for innovation with the tunable front 
end. And as we said earlier, I think we expect that to be an expansion of 
margins and allow us to grow faster than the market.
 
John Pitzer
 
George, maybe 
as my follow
-
up, in your comments around the chipset 
guidance being below seasonal for March, you called out both in modems 

driver of the below seasonal for the March quarter on the c
hipset business?
 
George Davis
 
Yeah. I would say from a below seasonal, China certainly is a factor, because 
the drop off at the end of December was more significant than expected. I 
would say sequentially, clearly, the big pullback by the modem customer is
 
an important factor as I look sequentially for the chip business.
 
Operator
 
That concludes today's question
-
and

answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you 
have anything further to add before adjourning the call?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you. Yes. I would just wa
nt to thank the employees for their hard 
work and for the good quarter, for the hard work in terms of not only 
delivering across the expectations, but also for the number of 
announcements that have gone out here over the last quarter or so. So keep 
up the

11/2/17,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We are off to a solid 
start in fiscal 2014, and we are pleased to report record revenues this 
quarter driven by strong growth in both, QTC and QTL.
 
Steve will provide more color on the 
businesses, but I did want to comment 
on the executive changes we recently announced. First, I am extreme 
pleased that Steve Mollenkopf will become our next Chief Executive Officer. 
He is an exceptional leader with a stellar track record over his 20 years 
at 
QUALCOMM.
 
Throughout his tenure, he has played a critical role in developing a number 
of new technologies and strengthen our relationships with our industry 
partners. This change will ensure management continuity, will allow me to 
work on new technologi
es and help set the future direction for the company 
as Executive Chairman of the Board. I look forward to continuing to work 
closely with Steve and the rest of management team.
 
Secondly, I wanted to thank our employees, customers and suppliers for 
their s
upport over my tenure as CEO. We have seen tremendous change 
over the last almost nine years, I began my services CEO, we were 
predominantly known as the CDMA2000 Company.
 
Fast
-
forward to today and we have developed a broadly license and 
diversified portfo
lio of technologies not only from an air interface 
perspective, but also in many other mobile technologies such as computing 
and connectivity, with an industry
-
leading approach of integrating these core 
technologies that define the mobile experience.
 
Looki
ng back, we had a vision for what a smartphone could be and we 
worked together with our partners to bring this vision to reality. Really dates 
back to the early 90s, when we had the idea to put the Internet protocols in 
to CDMA. We really knew that data wi
ll unlock tremendous opportunities for 
mobile devices. We were the first to put GPS in phones. We developed the 
first Palm OS based smartphone. We were pioneers in the mobile apps space 
with our Brew Appstore and we continue to lead with innovation such as
 
first 
gigahertz smartphone processor and obviously more recently advanced 
multimedia technologies such as Ultra HD video capture and playback.
 
Looking forward, opportunities are vast. We work with our partners to help 
them expand their data capacity by up
 
to 1,000 fold with solutions such as 
our small cells and other innovations such as LTE in unlicensed spectrum. 
We are helping to drive adoption of mobile technologies into several exciting 
new categories including automotive, healthcare and the connected 
home 
through our industry leading mobile computing connectivity offerings. And 
the AllSeen Alliance was recently formed to drive interoperability for the 
Internet of everything which is based on the use of the AllJoyn software 
framework.
 
Now this industry 
leadership and vision has translated into strong business 
performance with revenues more than quadrupling and EPS more than 
tripling since Fiscal 2005. In addition, we have returned over $25 billion in 
capital to stockholders during this timeframe and rece
ntly announced our 
intent to return 75% of free cash flow to stockholders. We expect that we 
will more than double the amount returned to stockholders over the next 
five years as compared to the last five years.
 
So we continue to be extremely excited about
 
the future, but still in the 
early rounds of global smartphone adoption, we are in the early rounds of 
the transition to mobile computing and then we have this broad connection 
of the Internet of everything. So we have the right technologies and more 
impo
rtantly we have the team to execute on these opportunities ahead. So 
we are pleased with the start fiscal 2014 and I look forward to continue to 
work with our team to drive growth in the years ahead.
 
Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Steven Mo
llenkopf.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Good afternoon, and thank you, Paul. I appreciate your kind words. I am 
humbled and extremely honored to have been named CEO elective of 
QUALCOMM. Under Paul's tenure as CEO, the company has established a 
leadership 
position in 3G, 4G and next
-
generation wireless technologies, 
developed a deep and diverse set of industry
-
leading mobile technologies 
and has generated extraordinary results. We are well
-
positioned to address 
the significant opportunities ahead and I look
 
forward to guiding the 
company during its next phase of growth. Paul, I would like to thank you for 
your leadership and mentorship and I look forward to continuing to work 
closely with you in the years ahead. I am proud to have been given this 
opportunity
 
and I look forward to assuming the CEO role in March.
 
Turning to our fiscal first
-
quarter. Our QTL and QCT delivered strong 
financial results and we are off to a solid start to fiscal 2014. In the quarter, 
we also returned approximately $1.6 billion to sh
areholders in dividends and 
buyback activity, consistent with the increased capital return targets that we 
outlined in November. QTL had a strong quarter, in line with our 
expectations with revenue and earnings before tax of 8% and 9% 
respectively, year
-
ov
er
-
year. Total reported device sales by our licensees 
was a record and above the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Global 
smartphone adoption continues to be a key driver of royalty revenue growth. 
In the fiscal first quarter we saw increased sequentia
l shipments by our 
licensees of smartphones in emerging regions. According to Gartner, 
emerging regions smartphone shipments are expected to grow at close to 
30% CAGR between 2012 and 2017. Globally, Gartner expects 
approximately 7 billion smartphones to b
e shipped from 2013 to 20 17.
 
In QCT, revenues and MSM shipments were up 12% and 17% year
-
over
-
year respectively MSM shipments were above our expectations driven by 
demand in emerging regions. Actions taken to manage spending contributed 
to better than exp
ected operating margins. From an operating expense 
standpoint, our outlook for moderate year
-
over
-
year growth remains on 
track. We are still investing in both the core businesses and new business 
opportunities and with our expense management initiatives th
is year, we 
continue to forecast that we will exit fiscal 2014 at a lower operating 
expense run rate for the company than we exited fiscal 2013.
 
Tuning to China. We are pleased to see that the 4G spectrum licenses have 
now been issued. We are working close
ly with the operators as well as 
domestic and international OEMs to meet this new growth opportunity. We 
continue to add single mode OFDMA licensees including in China. Given the 
high degree of similarity between the TDD and FDD modes of the 
international 
LTE standard and our position as the leading contributor to LTE, 
the royalty payable by our licensees under their single mode or OFDMA 
licenses are the same for devices that implement either or both of the TDD 
and FDD modes of LTE. QUALCOMM continues to in
vest heavily in developing 
the leading and the most widely licensed portfolio of patented technologies 
applicable to 3G and 4G devices.
 
For QTC, the growth of LTE, FDD and TDD in China aligns with our strength, 
both from supporting local Chinese OEMs looki
ng to leverage LTE and build 
their business outside of China, as well as global OEMs hoping to leverage 
LTE growth to grow their businesses in China.
 
For each of these customer types, our multi
-
mode 3G LTE modem leadership 
and Snapdragon solutions, combine
d with our global launches position us 
well. We have over 70 3G LTE multi
-
mode designs with leading Chinese 
OEMs based on our Snapdragon 400 chipsets for the high
-
volume handset 
tier.
 
We believe the recently announced Snapdragon 410 with integrated LTE wil
l 
also be the world's first 64
-
bit processor for the high
-
volume tier and will 
establish our 64
-
bit leadership there.
 
On the legal front, as we previously announced in November, the Chinese 
National Development and Reform Commission or NDRC, notified us th
at it 
had commenced an investigation of us related to the Chinese Anti
-
monopoly 
Law. The NDRC has advised us that the substance of the investigation is 
confidential. We will continue to cooperate with the NDRC as it conduct its 
investigation.
 
Globally, the
 
momentum of Snapdragon
-
based devices continues to grow, 
with over 1,350 designs announced for shipping and more than 500 designs 
in the pipeline, including over 40 tablets. We are pleased with our design 
activity and anticipate good volume growth in flags
hip tablets, such as the 
new LG G Pad tablet, the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro and the Samsung 
Galaxy Tab Pro announced at CES.
 
Looking ahead, our newly announced next
-
generation chipsets are 
progressing well and continue to demonstrate our leadership. Since 
Sn
apdragon to go five sets a new bar for performance and premium tablets 
and smartphones with end
-
to
-
end Ultra HD capability and the world's fastest 
mobile CPU. It is on track to ship in commercial devices in the first half of 
this calendar year and will hel
p our customers take advantage of the 
increasing interest in Ultra HD across the entertainment and consumer 
electronics industries.
 
Our new 9x35 modem delivers our fourth generation of LTE, and is on track 
to extend our LTE leadership into Category 6. We h
ave already 
demonstrated the world's first 300 megabits per second LTE Category 6 data 
session on Ericsson infrastructure and we expect to see our Category 6 
modem in the cards, hotspots and smartphones this year.
 
Our overall Wi
-
Fi sales are strong and gro
wing, with unit sales this quarter 
up 50% year
-
over
-
year and we have over 200 designs of our premium 
802.11 AC solution in the pipeline. Our RF 360 family of products also 
continues to progress well. Our envelope tracking solution has been shipping 
for a n
umber of months and is in key devices such as the Samsung Galaxy 
Note 3, the Google Nexus 5 and the LTE Nubia 5S.
 
Our dynamic antenna tuner recently launched in flagship Lumia 1520 and 
remaining RF 360 products are on track to ship later this fiscal year a
s 
expected. In closing, we are off to a solid start in the first fiscal quarter and 
we see the year developing broadly in line with our previous expectations.
 
That conclude my remarks and I would now like to turn the call over to 
George Davis.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results 
came in above expectations on solid operating performance and the positive 
net impact of certain discrete items. Fiscal first
-
quarter revenues were a 
record $6.6 billion, up 10% yea
r
-
over
-
year and non
-
GAAP earnings per 
share was $1.26 above our prior guidance range.
 
Our results this quarter included a $655 million gain or $0.25 per share 
related to the sale of substantially all of our Omnitracs business. We also 
recorded a $444 milli
on impairment or $0.20 per share in other expenses 
related to the fab assets in our QMT business.
 
The remaining items in other expenses impacted results by an additional 
$0.01 per share. In total, these items added a net $0.04 per share gain to 
results. Excluding these items, our non
-
GAAP EPS would be $1.22 per share 
or $0.07 above the midpoint of guidance and $0.02 above the high
-
end of 
our guidance range. Result in QCT and in our treasury portfolio was a major 
contributor to above expectation p
erformance.
 
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licenses were a record $61.6 
billion, up 16% year
-
over
-
year and above the mid
-
point of our guidance 
range, with an average selling price of $222 at the mid
-
point and shipments 
of $278 million 3G/4G bas
ed devices at the mid
-
point. We saw strength in 
both emerging and developed regions with increased penetration of 
smartphones into lower tiers. Emerging regions continue to show the highest 
unit growth rates for 3G/4G based devices.
 
QCT earnings before tax
 
were above expectations with record revenues of 
$4.6 billion and record shipments of 213 million MSMs. Revenue per MSM 
was lower sequentially reflecting a higher mix of thin modems and increased 
MSM shipments for emerging regions. QCT operating margin was
 
20% in the 
fiscal first quarter above our prior expectations reflecting actions to manage 
spending in the quarter. For the company overall, non
-
GAAP combined R&D 
and SG&A expenses were below our guidance decreasing 3% sequentially 
primarily driven by our 
QCT business.
 
Turning to capital structure. During the fiscal first quarter, we returned 
approximately $1.6 billion to stockholders including approximately $600 
million of dividends paid and $1 billion in stock purchases. As of the end of 
the first fiscal 
quarter, we had approximately $3.8 billion remaining of the $5 
billion stock repurchase authorization announced in September of last year. 
Cash flow from operations was very strong again this quarter at 
approximately $2.8 billion or 42% of revenues. Timing
 
of shipments in Q4 
and Q1 led to a higher than normal reduction in receivables which was the 
major factor in our above trend working capital and cash flow performance. 
We ended the fiscal quarter with cash and marketable securities of $31.6 
billion.
 
Now t
urning to our guidance for fiscal 2014. Our outlook for the fiscal year is 
mostly unchanged but we are increasing our earnings per share guidance to 
adjust for the above expectation performance in the fiscal first quarter, 
modestly tempered by a somewhat s
ofter outlook in our fiscal second 
quarter. We expect fiscal 2014 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the 
range of $5 to $5.20, up approximately 13% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint 
relative to 2013 and up $0.05 at the midpoint from our prior guidance.
 
As i
t is still very early in the year we are also holding our forecast for 
calendar 2014 3G/4G based device shipments, however we do see some 
potential upside to our forecast perfectly related to LTE deployment in China. 
We are also holding the midpoint of our
 
calendar 2013 3G/4G device 
shipment estimate, although modestly narrowing the range. As we outlined 
in November, we forecast improving trends in the second half of our fiscal 
year versus the first half. We expect higher device ASPs for QTL and a better 
mi
x of leading parts in QCT including the impact of LTE in China. We also 
continue to forecast favorable trends in product cost.
 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we estimate revenues to be in the 
range of approximately $6.1 billion to $6.7 billion, fla
t to up approximately 
9% year
-
over
-
year. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal 
second quarter to be approximately $1.15 to $1.25 per share, up 3% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and 
SG&A expenses will be slightly higher, up 1% to 3% 
sequentially, reflecting modest growth in R&D. In QTL, we estimate total 
reported device sales of $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion, it will be reported by 
licensees in the March quarter for shipments that th
ey made in the 
December quarter, up approximately 14% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint 
reflecting the busy holiday season. We estimate that the QTL device ASP will 
be relatively flat sequentially. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of 
approximately 180 mill
ion to 195 million units during the March quarter 
down 12% at the midpoint sequentially and up approximately 8% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect revenue per MSM to be up modestly on mix 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. We expect QCT operating margin to be ap
proximately 
15% in the fiscal second quarter, lower sequentially as expected, reflecting 
the impact of lower seasonal volumes and the effects of annual pricing 
resets typical for this time of the year.
 
We continue to forecast QCT operating margins to be 18
% to 20% for the 
full fiscal year.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first

Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.

BMO Capital Markets
 
Thank you. [Two] you mind if I could. Maybe could you give us some 
update? It looks again the calculator went down a litt
le bit more. Was there 
anything in there, we are hitting more tabs what's going on with that?
 
Then secondly, if we could just get your perspective on China, collecting in 
China, particular as it seems like there has been a lot more three
-
mode 
products bein
g announced relative to the five
-
mode? Do you think that 
changes the dynamic at all in collecting with the Chinese OEMs? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Tim, this is Derek. On the rate question, I think again we have kind of gone 
through a numbers of times all the
 
factors that move this thing around. This 
quarter, it's sort of a combination and probably for the few things you know 
TRDS obviously was up again another record, so again we get a little bit of a 
drag based on the fixed elements of the revenue. Also, you
 
know, I think 
just given sort of the product launches there were some discounting going 
on during this quarter that impacted the deductions that our licensees take 
and so that has also an impact as I explained in New York a couple of 
months ago.
 
Then a li
ttle bit of OEM mix again, so a number things bounce around. I do 
think based on the visibility we have into next quarter that the rate should 
improve some into next quarter and we still believe kind of the range that 
we gave for the year is still where we
 
think we are going to end up in and 
that was I think 31 to 33.
 
On China, really I think not much of a change from again what we went 
through in New York. Again, we are very active. We are continuing to 
negotiate agreements on single mode OFDM in China and
 
we added some 
additional licensees to the mix here over the last quarter. We got a number 
of other discussions ongoing and expect some other agreements to get 
signed here hopefully in the next couple of months, so I think we are just 
continuing to do the 
work that we started several years ago to make sure we 
are in a position to collect and still feel comfortable that that will be the 
case.

Great. Thank you. Paul, just wanted to say congratulations on a great job of 
navigating some tough time this year with all those renegotiations a few 
years back. Steve, I just want to ask questions to you about the QCT 
op
erating margins. Doctor and the teams here in Q1 just seasonality, but 
can you talk about how you feel on the cost optimization programs and 
some of the steps that gives you confidence the recovery in the second half 
of the year. Thank you.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Tha
nks a lot. I certainly hope we don't see anything like that, for Steve is 
starting his tenure. It was, I think, a lot of people decided that was time to 
test our management team and it wasn't the most fun thing to go through 
but it was good to get it behin
d us and also the to see with all the stuff 
that's going on in the world in terms of litigation that we are no not in the 
middle of a lot of that stuff. We are actually partners with a lot of those 
companies that we had battles with in the old days. So its
 
nice to see that 
change. But thanks for saying that.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Mike, this is Steve. With respect to the Op margin, if I look at the year, 
particularly as the year, first
-
half, second
-
half, its unfolding basically the 
way that we thought it 
would. I think Q1 was pretty strong and I think 
particularly strong actually in the emerging markets which we were pleased 
to see. So I think we are still confident in our outlook in terms of that Op 
margin guidance that we gave in November. Just pleased t
o have a good 
quarter in the book in order to head our direction. As you know there's 
always some seasonality in this quarter. I don't think we are seeing anything 
more than that really in what you are seeing in the outlook.

Hi, guys. I have two questions. First is, what was impact of foreign exchange 
on the numbers in the guidance or 
if you can explain given the broader 
picture of hedging and the impact on the P&L?
 
And then secondly, when I look at your number for next quarter, they are 
below street expectations somewhat. When I look at your numbers for the 
year, you have brought them 
up and that means that you expect a second
-
half recovery in EPS or second
-
half recovery in the trends. Could you go 
over the reasons for second
-
half acceleration versus the previous 
expectations and what stands behind the increase in EPS? Thanks.
 
George Da
vis
 
Sure. This is George. Let me start off with the FX impact. We had a modestly 
positive impact in the in the first quarter. As you know, really most of our 
exposure comes from our licensing business and we have hedging programs 
in place to help us with t
hat. We expect that the full year again to be 
modestly positive after our hedging programs but FX has not been a major 
impact for us over the last couple of years.
 
In terms of the second quarter and the full year, really actually the year is 
pretty much pl
aying out in line with our expectations. A little bit more 
positive in the first quarter but we are seeing a little more softness in the 
second quarter. Net net, the first half looks about as we said in the second 
half that really were not calling for anyt
hing other than the same 
environment that we expected going into the year. We have said that we 
think that whether you are looking at devices or you are looking at potential 
sales around the world, China LTE looks like an area where there may be, 
depending
 
on the timing, there might be some benefit, more benefit the hits 
our fiscal year which as you know closes out a quarter before of the calendar 
year.

Deutsche Bank
 
Yes, guys. A couple of them. So at the beginning of the call, you talked 
about being in the early rounds of smartphone adoption growth and can you 
kind of give a little more color around that, looking at what we a
re seeing 
from a maturation standpoint in places like the U.S. but growth in the 
emerging markets and how do you see that playing out in terms your ASP 
trends?
 
Second question. Steve, each of your main competitors in LTE in the last 
nine months has gone ou
tside their company to acquire technology to try to 
compete with you in that market and none of them have really come to 
market with a product of any scale. Can you talk about what you see for LTE 
competition in the year.
 
And then Paul, just briefly, can y
ou give us a rundown of some of your 
focuses in terms of your venture ideas or venture investments as you move 
on to your next role? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Brian, this is Derek. Let me answer your first question. Obviously we look at 
the market as a whole
 
which we break up in developed and emerging 
regions. Yet while it's true that there is a fair amount of maturation of 
smartphone adoption in the developed regions, we do still think that there's 
a lot of things coming that will drive replacement cycles th
ere and then bring 
the last bit of the tail over, but then when you look at emerging regions, 
there are still a huge runway for growth there, so I think when we look at it 
in totality, although the areas where we probably spend most of our time 
seems like 
the smartphone space is well penetrated there is still a huge 
opportunity for us in the emerging regions.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Brian, this is Steve. On LTE, yes, I think what we have seen a lot of folks 
are, obviously, working on LTE. We are continuing to see
 
strong design
-
in 
activity and I think what's happening we had an early lead we are driving it 
across tiers. At the same time, the feature set is turning over, and one of 
the things that has been important for us, we since day one of our LTE 
solution we ha
ve had the TDD mode in there. That's been, I think, 
exceedingly important in terms of being able to grow our business into 
China, which is a good thing, but also what we are seeing in China the effect 
where people want to use the LTE solution that, number 
one, has maturity 
and feature leadership, but also gives them the ability to deliver a product 
outside of China and to become a global smartphone OEM and not just a 
regional smartphone OEM, so I think we are continuing to stay ahead of 
people in terms of t
echnology and certainly maturity and scale, but the 
things that we bring seem to also be more important as well, so we hope 
that continues. We are going to continue to invest in that area as it has been 
our practice.
 
Paul Jacobs
 

he future and obviously there is a whole set of 
projects that we have favorite continue to invest in that area as has been 
our practice and so on the familiar look at the images and obviously visible 
set of projects that we have going on right now 
-
 
think 
it will be nice to 
spend a little bit more time hands
-
on with those projects and hopefully it can 
help accelerate some of the those coming to market.
 
Then sort of farther out stuff that we haven't talked a lot about yet and 
everybody is talking about 5G al
ready, I think we have some good ideas for 
what 5G should be and the kinds of things that it should do in addition to 
just being faster and more spectrum and more bandwidth and those things, 
so I got some good projects ahead of me.

Hi. Thanks very much and I want to congratulate both of you, Paul and 
Steve on the new roles. I just wanted to ask you firs
t about your guidance 
as it pertains to QTL and device sales in particular. It was relatively strong 
even though we have seen some of the major OEMs actually come in with 
slightly lower than expected results for the December quarter, so I was just 
wonderin
g if you can go into some of the drivers for that. Is it emerging 
market? Is it tablets or any other categories. Then relative to your unit 
guidance for MSM chipsets in the March quarter, it's a bit below seasonal 
and I just wanted to dig into that a littl
e more if it has anything to do with 
market share or inventory or end demand, if you can just give us a bit of 
color there as well. Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Simona, this is Derek. Why don't I start and if George wants to jump in and 
add something he can. As yo
u know, we at this stage, we get a fair amount 
of visibility in from our licensees typically before we provide guidance, so we 
do have a reasonable amount of confidence in the guide that we have 
provided for the December quarter sales.
 
I think it is 
again a blending, we are seeing a lot of strength in the emerging 
regions, continue see strength in places like China. Although there was little 
softness, I think in the in the U.S., some of the other developed regions, it 
continue to do well such as Europ
e and I think we are probably going to see 
a little stronger tablet uptake as well and there are evidence of that coming 
out of some of the statements Verizon and AT&T made this last week.
 
George Davis
 
On the MSM front, I think what we are seeing and it's 
one of the reasons 
why we didn't update the number for MSMs for the full year. We think there 
were some of the benefit that we saw on Q1 were MSM that were being 
pulled in, so maybe a little bit of a timing issue between Q2 and Q1, but 
again overall the fi
rst half of the year looks very much like we thought it 
would and second
-
half the same, so probably not a lot of news in those 
numbers.

Nomura
 
Yes. Thanks a lot. You basically reiterated guidance for the full year 
revenues, but year is turning out to be a little bit backend loaded than I was 
thinking. June is historically flat, which if that plays out again, would imply 
that September 
is up, north of 10% sequentially. Is that the right way to 
think about the rest of the year? That's my first question.
 
Then second. Steve, China Mobile indicated, I believe, in December that they 
expect to sell 100 million LTE devices. That number seems li
ke it is 
overstated but I wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
So on the first
-
half, second
-
half, again all I can say is, and we spent some 
time on this in the original guidance, the year does look a little bit different 
than the his
torical pattern with more of the earnings coming in the second 
half. We still believe that is the case and also you get a slightly higher 
revenue rate in the second half of the year. So I think in terms of any 
specific quarter, it is too early to comment b
eyond our second
-
quarter 
guidance but that's why when we raised our guidance, it really was more 
just to reflect the outperformance in Q1 than a fundamental change in first
-
half and second
-
half.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. On the China Mobile forecast
 
for devices. My guess is if I 
remember correctly, that was a calendar year number. It is difficult for me 
to comment on the numbers but I will say that the intensity with the 
industry is getting prepared for the launch of LTE is quite high. If you look at
 
our designing intensity and you look at the preparations that we are going 
through with carriers, it is consistent with the big launch of that scale. Now 
it's always difficult, as we have said before, to pick when those things 
happen and the start of a ne
w launch is always difficult to pick, particularly 
as early as it is but we expect that to be a big, pretty significant launch 
when it occurs and we are going to be prepared for it.

Hi, guys. I appreciate it. Thanks. A question for you on China. Is there a 
reason that China Mobile having said they are going to test three mode 
phones rather than five modes? Is there any reason th
at your royalty rates 
on three mode phones will be different than on a five mode phone, obviously 
due to some difference because of the lack of 3G but, if you can get us a 
sense as the difference between those two?
 
On that note, then also, if the share of 
TD
-
LTE China Mobile ends up being, 
say, roughly similar share wise to what 3G looks like right now in China, 
given that you count a lot of the major Chinese players like Huawei, ZTE, 
Lenovo, Coolpad as good customers of yours, and I presume therefore 
payin
g whatever royalty that they do pay you, if they end up getting the 
similar shares in the TD
-
LTE world as that develops, can you give us a sense 
as to what would that mean for the royalty rates that you collect on LTE?
 
And then, you made a comment, Steve, 
I think that there is a higher 
percentage of thin modems sold, or George, you may have said that, thin 
modems sold this quarter, and that's what effected the ASP on your MSMs. 
Is that a trend you are seeing as nonintegrated chips in smartphones or is 
that 
an indication that 3G/4G feature phones are making a comeback? 
Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hi, this is Derek. Let me answer your first question. We have talked a lot 
about some of the challenges we have had with collecting on TD
-
SCDMA in 
China and the things that
 
we have been doing to either push things like five 
mode, so that there is WCDMA in the device or also the move to LTE should 
be a good one for us. So our 3G deals would cover anything that you called 
a five mode and in fact in many cases would cover the p
hones that are three 
mode. So absent the challenges we have had around TD
-
SCDMA, we 
wouldn't really have a need to negotiate new deals on those but like I said, 
we are signing a number of companies to the LTE licenses and so as we 
talked about we do expect
 
the rate on what we call the single mode LTE 
device to be lower than 3G. Although I spent some time going through that 
in New York, if you recall, in terms of trying to explain the delta between the 
3G and 4G royalty picture as a whole based on the compan
ies that were 
signed up so far, so maybe you can go back and think about that. I can't 
really specifically comment on any particular licensee or any particular 
agreement and obviously we are going to have to see how the market 
develops in terms of the thre
e
-
mode versus five
-
mode adoption and who are 
the suppliers that get share moving forward.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve, so just one follow
-
up on that question by the way. I think what 
you are going to see in China Mobile, because it's so big and because
 
the 
launch is likely to happen across tiers, you are going to get a lot of attraction 
from international OEMs using their LTE expertise worldwide to exploit that 
technology change. At the same time, I think you are going to see domestic 
OEMs looking to le
verage their strength in China to the international OEMs. 
Both of those trends, we think, are positive to our core businesses, which I 
think is important.
 
With respect your high or to the number about the thin modems, I don't 
think is really a trend. I wou
ld say the vast majority of our chipsets are 
actually shipped as integrated and that's really what most people do in the 
industry. What you are probably seeing is just sort of concentration of some 
of the OEMs that used in modems and how that might be asso
ciated with 
particular phone launches in the timing of those phone launches through the 
year as opposed to a trend.

Stacy Rasgon

S
anford Bernstein
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, I just wanted to dig in a 
little bit. You are guiding QTL ASPs for December shipments flattish. You saw 
upside on chipsets, so that shift in the December quarter from the low
-
end, 
how 
do I reconcile those two things, upside from chipsets and December 
low
-
end versus guidance for device shipments in December ASPs flattish.
 
Secondly, in the current quarter, the quarter just past you had ASPs down, 
but a lot of unit outside which would impl
y a lot of growth at the lower end. 
What is it actually imply for continued QRD traction? I think you had said 
last year the revenues in QRD were in the ballpark of $1 billion. Do we read 
into the results that we just saw continued traction with QRD or mor
e 
traction with QRD than we have had?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Stacy, this is Derek. I think that part of this might be a little bit of timing in 
terms of the chip shipments versus one of the devices actually gets sold into 
the market and reported to us, but we do 
see some strength in the emerging 
regions really driving the Q4 results as well. The ASP I think as we said last 
quarter, we expected this to be kind of in line in the calendar Q4 quarter 
versus Q3 and that's what we are expecting. We do expect the back ha
lf of 
the year, which is consistent I think with what we have seen in the last three 
years to be stronger from an ASP perspective just given the timing of some 
of the iconic product launches we expect to see here shortly.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Stacy, this is S
teve. Regarding the QRD, we have had another good quarter 
for our emerging accounts. I would probably categorize that group of 
accounts. A lot of them use the QRD, but this is really a new channel that we 
had to develop over the years and with strong quart
er for them in the 
December quarter and we expect that to continue to be a good channel for 
us moving forward, something we can we can also use our LTE leadership 
into as well, so we are pleased to be able to see the upside there.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple for you. I just 
wanted to go back to China and see if you guys could talk about two things 
mor
e there. One is, maybe Derek, if can give us any idea what proportion of 
the potential LTE volume is licensed or some idea how far it's utilized in 
process for LTE you are there. Then and also maybe George, you could 
comment or someone could comment on the
 
if there is any press ruling in 
China, how that plays our recruiting for potential fine there, when do we get 
more sort of I guess firmed up in terms of what the impact might be 
financially from that.
 
Then lastly, Paul, I just wanted to ask you to give us
 
an update on 1000x 
and just kind of where that is. I know guys have thought you might have 
some trial this year. I just wonder how that's progressing along and whether 
we will be doing trials on that this year. Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Rod, this is Derek. Lit
tle bit of a hard to answer, but let me give it a shot. 
We have signed more 50, I think it's more than 55 companies now to LTE 
licenses in China, but actually I think large part of the volume initially here 
will be stuff that is actually covered by our 3G 
deal. Certainly the volumes 
that go to China Telecom, China Unicom, the five mode volumes at China 
Mobile and then also, as Steve mentioned, the international volumes that 
will be coming in to China likely will be of the same flavor. So its going to 
depend
, like I said, we are continuing to be in discussions and find additional 
companies as we speak. So again, I think, we are on track to doing the 
things we needed to do. Without knowing exactly who is going to have what 
share and how this is all going to pl
ay out, I can't really give you any more 
granularity than that.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
Rod, this is Don, and George may answer after me, but just to be clear, you 
talked about an antitrust ruling. There isn't any ruling in China. The articles 
that you read are spec
ulating at this point. There is investigation. We have 
talked about that. We have been told by the NDRC that it is confidential but 
we are cooperating with them and we are going to continue to cooperate 
with them, and so at this point anything that anybody
 
is saying is pure 
speculating at this point, while this proceeds.
 
George Davis
 
One the 1,000x, obviously I don't want to announce other people's products, 
we are supporting the technology. We have obviously done a number of our 
own trials based of our own
 
products but the traction with the customer base 
is good and so I feel confident that's continuing to move along and there's 
obviously a lot of dynamics in the operator market between operators who 
have a lot of spectrum, operators who have fixed network 
capabilities and so 
there are certain ones who will be, I would say, more the leaders and that 
we are focused on the driving opportunity with those people but it would be 
done through customers of ours who will deliver the product.

Credit Suisse
 
Thanks, Just a couple of questions, if I can. On the addressable market 
growth for the overall business of 15%, also unit g
rowth, you guys are 
talking about, you mentioned I think George, that just you saw more upside 
to that number. I guess the things that we have heard suggest otherwise, in 
the sense that you had a number of large handset smartphone vendors, 
there is point n
ear
-
term involvement give us a relatively cautious guidance 
and I understand the upside in China, so equally, China Mobile's network is 
only really rolling out now. It may take some time. the service pricing seems 
a bit on the expenses side. So I just kind
 
of curious that there seems to be 
more kind of downside distance than three or four months, given those 
things we have learned than before. So what is that you are seeing that 
gives you the confidence you could see the upside as we go through this 
year? T
his is my first question on the addressable market and the confidence 
you have in that growth rate.
 
And then, for Steve, is it the case that, I think, when you initially were 
rolling out LTE chips that they were meaningfully accretive to our ASP 
because of
 
just the technology, the competition as well as the fact that you 
were selling more integrated devices and higher end Snapdragon chips. As 
we go through this year, will that level of accretion still hold, or do you guys 
have to become more aggrieve even i
f your peers aren't as competitive, just 
to kind of ensure that you really dominate that segment. How do you think 
about managing the business between those various levers? Thanks.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Sure. Let me start off with the size of the market and the outl
ook for '14. I 
try to leave the message that, if anything, we have a bias to the upside in 
these numbers and I think sometimes in the year
-
over
-
year comparison 
when you see the U.S. coming in a little bit softer than people may have 
expected, it's easy to 
lose the track of the very high growth rates, certainly 
well above 15%, 20% type growth rates in emerging markets. You are also 
seeing actually developed markets maintain overall their growth rates similar 
to what we saw '12 to '13, because you are seeing,
 
on a year
-
over
-
year 
comparison, more strength in both Europe and Japan and while the rates 
may not be comparable to emerging market growth rates there, on a year
-
over
-
year basis, they contribute to our outlook. So in the upside, we would 
assign to how the
 
LTE deployment in China plays out.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
So with respect to LTE pricing. So you should really think of LTE as a tiered 
offering. In the leadership tier, the high
-
tier, it's a strong area for our 
pricing. We continue to have leadership there, we
 
continue to drive there, 
but we expect the lower tier or more the entry
-
level LTE feature set to be 
important and we assumed that that's going to be have to be a priced at a 
different pricing level than will be one of the leaderships here.
 
I would also ju
st generally say that I think that the scale that will be built up 
in the LTE world will also spread to the developing market as well and 
provide I think some positive view on chipset ASP relative to what you see 
really like more commoditized 3G pricing in
 
terms of the 3G chipset, so LTE 
it's definitely a tier, I think it something that provides some kind of an 
upward trend in terms of pricing for us relative to see in 3G.

Great. Thanks. A couple of quick question. You might have answered these 
before, but the chip QCT, you are looking at ASPs or pricing for those to 
trend up in the March quarter. Maybe you could 
explain a bit some of the 
drivers.
 
Then for George, so housekeeping questions on your guidance specifically, 
how much interest income? There was a pretty big difference you did like 
$255 million of interest other expense. Usually would prefer to dwell on t
hat, 
but that was a pretty big mover earnings. Any assumptions or can you give 
us a sense of what you are assuming on your guidance for the full year on 
that line item? Thanks.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Mark, thanks. I will start with your last question first and then I
 
will get to 
the QCT ASP. On investment income. It's one of the things, actually the 
performance in the portfolio that we cited as part of adder to the 
outperformance in the first quarter.
 
As we have been accelerating return of capital, we have a portfolio
 
that has 
a broad range of risk and so we are starting to take that risk level down as 
we draw down more cash for repurchase, so you are seeing some gains 
embedded in the quarter associated with that. Again, maybe I would say 
above trend maybe, $0.02, $0.0
3 from that.
 
I wouldn't count on that every quarter, that's really more a function of just 
making sure that we keep the risk level and the portfolio in the right place. 
For QCT, really what you are seeing is a little bit of a reversal of what you 
saw in Q1
 
which is that the mix particularly thin modems will not be quite as 
higher percent that gives a natural lift to the ASP.

Thanks for taking my question. First, a housekeeping question, George. The 
$1.26 non
-
GAAP earnings, does that include the Omnitracs sale and I was 
under the impression that the previous guidance and full
-
year guide 
excluded that sale. Just
 
want to make sure we are talking apples
-
and
-
apples.
 
Secondly, a question for Derek. It's been an interesting trend. Nokia has 
now sold their business and kept the patents. Ericsson did the same and now 
Google is doing the same. What I am wondering is, doe
s that change the 
competitive dynamic of QTL at all having multiple patent pulls out there that 
aren't associated with devices? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
Okay. Let me cover the housekeeping. As we said, the Omni gain was 
always going to be in non
-
GAAP, but when
 
we gave guidance, we treated it 
as a discrete item, so we guided excluding the discrete items. We also had 
another major discrete item, which was the impairment on the QMT asset, 
so the net effect of that was $0.05 and then there was about another $0.01 
o
f items and other, so a net $0.04 benefit that's how when we talked our 
performance would have been $1.22 if not for those which is really the 
comparable apples
-
to
-
apples that you are looking for, so still $0.02 above 
the upper end of the guidance range an
d $0.07 over the midpoint?
 
Derek Aberle
 
This is Derek. I don't think it really changes the competitive dynamic for QTL 
for our business. I think, we have obviously been very successful in 
establishing the value for our own portfolio in the marketplace and 
the fact 
that other companies may decide to come in and become more active 
doesn't really impact our value proposition, per se. Both Ericsson and Nokia 
have had active licensing programs for many years. The way that they have 
positioned and valued their pa
tents won't simply change based on whether 
they have an active business. Now it might change any individual deal based 
on the relative exposure but again they have been active and I don't think 
there will be a major disruption or impact in the industry as 
a results of it.

Thank you. Paul, it's a matter of time before the smartphone market 
matures and it's o
ne of the reasons that the stock multiplied over the last 
few years. As we look out over the next few years, what do you think will 
replace the smartphone market in terms of opportunity growth where 
QUALCOMM can really dominate similar to what they did in 
smartphones? If 
we look at tablets, for example, the attach rates have been low because of 
the pricey data plans, although it seems like a niche opportunity. Just maybe 
how we should think about it longer term.
 
And then George, as growth matures for the co
mpany and the free cash flow 
improves, any thoughts on your preference between the split between 
dividends and also share repurchase? And longer term, can that 75% returns 
move higher so that we could actually decompress the stock multiples?
 
Paul Jacobs
 
I 
think we are going to do better and better in the computing space and I 
agree that it's been not as successful as we had hoped in the past in terms 
of attach rates. I think the operators are getting better at that. We are also 
building other technologies, 
obviously, LTE and their license bands do, I 
think, a lot, some of the small cell stuff should do a lot there. But the other 
part is just mobile as an enabling technology into other areas.
 
You can see the beginnings of things, automotive space. Yes, those 
numbers 
are relatively small, but people talk about Internet of everything as only low 
value, low margin devices and I think there is going to be a tiering of 
different kinds of devices. So there will be high value segments in the 
Internet of everything. T
here will be also the very cheap ones, but then we 
are talking about high volumes also. So there is some kind of decent growth 
there.
 
Then you look out and there is a bunch of areas where we can do things that 
are just adjacent to the phone, additional con
tent in the phone. Obviously to 
this point, this play of investments have been not as quick to come to 
fruition as we had hoped, although I think the wearable spaces is a really 
interesting part, but also connected home spaces is quite interesting. So lot 
of opportunity for that going forward.
 
We have some other display technologies as well that are getting a lot of 
traction with the Pixtronix technology which is more applicable to larger 
displays, and you know that's a nice licensing business. We have got 
a 
bunch of other things in the hopper. The vehicle charging and we are looking 
at working with partners on that in terms of a larger play there as well. So 
there is a broad range of technologies out there that we are working on that 
will drive, I think, a 
reasonable amount of growth going forward.
 
George Davis
 
Mark, just to answer your questions on the capital structure and return of 
capital. So what we have said is that we expect to grow double digit topline 
and bottomline over the next five years and real
ly largely driven by the core 
businesses that we see today and with that we expect strong cash flow to 
continue. We are going to grow the dividend rate ahead of earnings is what 
we have committed to. We are going to return 75% of global free cash flow 
and 
so then you will see a large, what isn't going through dividends will 
obviously go for share repurchase, and as Steve mentioned in the script, we 
expect to more than double the return over the next five years from what 
we have returned in the past five yea
rs.

Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Dr. 
Jacobs, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
I just wanted to say thanks again to everybody for all the support over the 
years and 
it's been a great run as CEO, I think both, measured by the 
financial metrics and also by sort of the way we expanded the business and 
the way the company operates and it's really not one person that does that. 
That's our employees, our partners, all my co
lleagues here have done just 
an amazing job over the years and I am looking forward to Steve take the 
reigns as CEO and drive the company forward.
 
I am very, very excited by the future. It's going to be very fun to see how 
we have this expanding impact of 
mobile and I am saying that given the 
background of how much it has already impacted all of our lives, so it's 
going to be great to be able to refocus my energy on innovation.
 
I don't think I am going to be presenting at any future earnings calls, but if 
y
ou guys want I may show up for Q&As and I hope to see you guys, or some 
of you at least, at Mobile World Congress, so thanks everybody.

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, John, and good 
afternoon, everyone.
 
We are pleased to report a strong set of results this quarter, as we 
continued to execute on our strategic priorities to drive technology and 
product leadership, particularly in 5G, manage our operating expenses, and 
return capital to 
our stockholders.
 
Fiscal 2018 was an extraordinary year in the history of Qualcomm. We 
successfully navigated through many challenges, yet remained focused on 
execution and the significant opportunities in front of us. I believe we enter 
fiscal 2019 a stro
nger company and extremely well
-
positioned for the future. 
Our fiscal fourth quarter results reflect continued strong performance, with 
non
-
GAAP earnings of $0.90 per share, $0.05 above the high end of our 
guidance range, reflecting better than expected QC
T performance and lower 
operating expenses.
 
The growth of our leading customers in China was a positive for the 
company in the fiscal fourth quarter, both on volume and improving mix of 
devices. We expect further growth from our China business in fiscal 20
19, 
particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. The combined impact of 
Apple instructing their contract manufacturers to stop paying their 
contracted royalty payments and Apple's decision to use a competitor's 
modem for their latest device has had 
a significant impact to our financial 
performance. Notably, over 50% of the expected fiscal 2019 headwind 
related to Apple is reflected in our first fiscal quarter guidance and impacts 
our QCT business. As we progress through the year, this will become les
s 
impactful to our quarterly results.
 
Despite this, as you can see from our results, we are continuing to execute 
well with our customers. Importantly, we've laid a strong foundation for 
growth as we differentiate through our industry
-
leading innovation ah
ead of 
some very big opportunities, including the launch of 3G (sic) [5G] (4:00), 
the ramp of our RF front
-
end business, as well as industry transitions in Wi
-
Fi and the connected car.
 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, the entire company remains focused around
 
these three key priorities. Priority number one is to drive the transition to 
5G. When the world is introduced to 5G early next year, we believe we will 
be the technology partner in nearly all the commercial launches around the 
world. This position is no 
small accomplishment. Transitions in wireless like 
3G, 4G, and 5G are unforgiving to companies and competitors that are late 
to these transitions, especially in the initial ramp years. Our focus and 
investment priorities over the last couple of years have 
enabled us to 
successfully establish a strong technology position and lead the 5G industry 
transition, which will represent a significant opportunity for Qualcomm to 
expand revenue and earnings as we exit fiscal 2019.
 
Just as 5G launch dates were accelerat
ed by one year from the original 
timeline, we also expect the pace of 5G adoption to meet or exceed that of 
4G. The first mobile 5G network launches will begin in the second calendar 
quarter next year, and there will be commercial launches occurring 
simult
aneously across North America, Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, 
and Australia. In total, we are working with more than 18 OEMs who have 
committed to launch 5G handsets in 2019 based on our 5G and our X50 
modems. We believe that Qualcomm is the leader in 
5G, with the ability to 
launch sub
-
6
-
gigahertz, millimeter wave, standalone and non
-
standalone 
5G.
 
Furthermore, 5G brings an order of magnitude increase of complexity over 
4G across spectrum, network dark architecture, RF front
-
end, device form 
factors, es
pecially the millimeter wave frequencies, power consumption and 
application and AI processors. This complexity plays directly to Qualcomm's 
strength as an innovator and systems provider.
 
Priority number two is resolving our dispute with Apple. Regarding Ap
ple, 
our view on the timeline to resolve our licensing dispute has not changed. 
We have previously highlighted key litigation milestones in fiscal 2019 that 
we believe could help drive a resolution. Those litigation milestones have not 
changed, including t
he potential for multiple patent infringement rulings in 
China and Germany before the end of this calendar year.
 
Aside from infringement of unlicensed intellectual property and other claims, 
including the recent product
-
related claims, there are billions o
f dollars in 
damages in the breach of contract claims against Apple's manufacturers. We 
expect a trial date to be set for that matter in San Diego during the early 
part of next year.
 
We have continued to have discussions with Apple to try and reach a 
resol
ution, and we remain focused on driving the appropriate value for our 
stockholders, either through settlement or litigation. Resolution of the 
outstanding licensing disputes represents significant value to our 
shareholders and provides the foundation for v
ery strong earnings growth, 
separate and apart from the 5G opportunities we have described.
 
Priority number three is to execute well across our core product businesses. 
The strategic decisions we made to diversify our revenue in our mobile 
channel while ex
panding into adjacent opportunities is working. Our 
engagement with customers across multiple industries continues to expand, 
and our QCT business outside of Apple continues to grow.
 
Our Snapdragon 800 solutions continue to define the premium tier 
benchmar
ks, and we expanded our leadership to the high tiers with 
Snapdragon 700. Consistent with our expectations, the product mix is 
improving in the China region, and key Qualcomm China
-
based customers 
are gaining share globally, most recently in India and Euro
pe.
 
In fiscal 2018, our non
-
Apple RF front
-
end revenue nearly doubled year over 
year, reflecting the full
-
year impact of the TDK acquisition and revenue 
growth across all key OEMs, leveraging one of the broadest portfolios of RF 
front
-
end products in the i
ndustry. Given our strong design win pipeline, we 
expect to grow RF front
-
end revenues by double
-
digit percentage in fiscal 
2019.
 
In 4G, our RF front
-
end traction includes 80 module design wins across key 
OEMs such as Samsung, Google, Sony, LG, Oppo, Vivo,
 
Xiaomi, and 
OnePlus. Importantly, current commercial devices such as the Pixel 3, Pixel 
3XL, Samsung Galaxy Book 2, and Sony ZX3 all have our complete RF front
-
end modem to antenna solution. We are pleased to have established RF 
front
-
end design wins at m
ajor accounts in a mature 4G technology cycle 
going against more than four RF front
-
end suppliers. This validates the 
competitiveness of our components across PAs, filters, switches, tuners, and 
modules.
 
In 5G, we are well
-
positioned with design wins at al
l our key Snapdragon 
800 customers. The added complexity of 5G is also driving additional RF 
content per device, including combinations of sub
-
6
-
gigahertz and millimeter 
wave. As an example, a large number of 5G smartphones in the United 
States will requir
e millimeter wave capabilities at launch.
 
Across our adjacent opportunities, we are continuing to see exciting traction 
for our technologies and products in these new growth industries. In auto, 
our integrated platforms are driving leadership and growth ac
ross 
telematics, infotainment, and in
-
car connectivity, with an order pipeline of 
more than $5 billion, up from $3 billion earlier this year.
 
We are leading 5G innovation in cars and have secured the world's first 
major 5G design win with a leading automak
er, and we are working with 
numerous other automakers and Tier 1 suppliers to bring 5G to vehicles. 
Infotainment is a particularly strong story for us given our very strong long
-
term order pipeline with a broad set of key global customers.
 
In networking, w
e remain the number one share leader in retail and 
enterprise channels and continue to gain share. We are also number one in 
mesh Wi
-
Fi, which accounted for 50% of all U.S. retail Wi
-
Fi network 
equipment sales during the first half of 2018. In fiscal 2018,
 
leveraging our 
success with Wi
-
Fi mesh, we have expanded into the carrier segment and 
have significant design traction headed into fiscal 2019.
 
Historically, we have benefited from technology transitions, and we are now 
driving industry adoption of 802.11
ax, now called Wi
-
Fi 6, with more than 50 
design wins in the pipeline. Looking ahead to 60
-
gigahertz Wi
-
Fi, we just 
announced the industry's first 802.11ay chipset, recently
-
announced 
802.11ad devices from NETGEAR and ASUS, and are working with Facebook 
on
 
the Terragraph project.
 
Turning to QTL, fiscal 2018 results were impacted by the disputes with Apple 
and its contract manufacturers as well as the other licensee. However, global 
3G/4G device trends were favorable, driven by strong trends in average 
selli
ng prices. Our number of 5G licensing agreements is growing, with more 
than 20 agreements signed to date based on our previously
-
announced 5G 
licensing framework, including Meizu and Motorola Lenovo, and we have 
significantly more manufacturers in discussi
ons for 5G agreements and 
amendments, positioning QTL for stability as the 5G transition gains 
momentum.
 
On regulatory matters, we are pleased to announce in August that we 
reached a court
-
approved settlement with the Taiwan FTC. As a result, the 
underlyin
g decision was revoked and replaced by the terms of the resolution.
 
Regarding the U.S. FTC, we continue our discussions to work toward a 
resolution outside of the current litigation. Yesterday, the court issued a 
ruling in the case regarding 
licensing practices of certain standards 
organizations. This is a partial summary judgment ruling on one of the 
issues, and a full trial is still to come next year. In our view, the ruling is 
incorrect.
 
In addition to the product and technology actions I h
ave discussed, we are 
driving operating leverage into our business by delivering on our operating 
expense commitments. With the potential resolution of our dispute with 
Apple in front of us, we believe there is a very substantial opportunity to 
grow value 
for our stockholders that is incremental to the strength of the 
current business. The combination of these elements leaves us well
-
positioned to drive stockholder value throughout fiscal 2019 and beyond.
 
Finally, I want to thank our employees for their har
d work and focused 
execution throughout the past year. Our team has made great progress on 
our important strategic objectives, and we are extremely well
-
positioned for 
the upcoming transition to 5G and to grow into the many exciting new 
industries that are
 
adding our leading
-
edge technologies to their products in 
fiscal 2019 and beyond.
 
I would now like to turn the call over to George.

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with 
comments on our fiscal f
ourth quarter and 2018 results, followed by our 
fiscal first quarter of 2019 guidance and some additional perspective on 
2019 overall.
 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, results were strong, with revenues of $5.8 
billion, above the midpoint of our guidance rang
e, and non
-
GAAP EPS of 
$0.90, above the high end of our prior guidance range. Revenues benefited 
primarily from stronger than expected demand for chips from Chinese 
customers.
 
Non
-
GAAP EPS results exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.10. 
$0.06 of th
at impact was driven by operating performance in QCT and QTL 
and from lower operating expenses. The remaining $0.04 was driven by 
favorable tax impacts and lower share count from our repurchase activity.
 
QCT delivered revenues of $4.6 billion and an EBT ma
rgin of 17%, driven by 
strength in MSM chip shipments of 232 million, above the high end of our 
guidance range on stronger than expected demand from Chinese OEMs.
 
In QTL, revenues were $1.14 billion, in line with the midpoint of our 
guidance range, and EBT
 
margin was 65%, better than expected, reflecting 
lower operating expenses, largely from litigation spending. We also 
recognized $100 million of revenue from the other licensee in dispute under 
the interim agreement.
 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, non
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and SG&A expenses 
were down 1% sequentially on cost reduction actions and lower than 
expected excess litigation expense more than offsetting the impact of an 
extra week of operations in the fiscal fourth quarter.
 
Our non
-
GAAP tax rate was a 1%
 
benefit in the quarter, lower than our prior 
expectations, reflecting a modest benefit related to tax restructuring 
completed in the quarter.
 
Now, turning to fiscal 2018, non
-
GAAP revenues for the year were $22.7 
billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share we
re $3.69. We returned $26 billion 
to stockholders in fiscal 2018, including approximately $3.5 billion of cash 
dividends paid, an increase of 7% year over year, and $22.6 billion in share 
repurchases, largely via our accelerated programs, including a $5.1 
billion 
Dutch auction and a $16 billion ASR. In terms of average price realized 
under the ASR, that will be based on ratable pricing over the term of the 
ASRs, which will run through August 2019.
 
Turning to 3G/4G devices, for calendar year 2018, we continu
e to forecast 
approximately 1.8 billion to 1.9 billion 3G/4G device shipments, growth of 
approximately 5% year over year at the midpoint. Our forecast for handset 
unit shipment growth in the year is approximately 100 million units lower 
than our forecast a
t the outset of the year on lower demand in both 
developed and emerging regions, particularly in China. Global device sales 
have been less impacted, as global handset ASPs have been better than 
expected, growing more than 10% year over year in fiscal 2018.
 
In QCT, we saw strong performance in fiscal 2018, with 8% year
-
over
-
year 
growth in earnings before tax dollars and EBT margin at 17%, with strong 
demand trends in China, particularly in the mid and high tiers, offsetting the 
impact of lower share at Apple
.
 
In QTL, results in fiscal 2018 were significantly impacted by the disputes 
with Apple and the other licensee and by the related litigation costs. These 
dynamics mask the strong global device sales growth in fiscal 2018, as 
higher handset ASPs across mult
iple price tiers made up for the modest 
handset unit growth. Looking at handsets in the fiscal year, we estimate that 
global sales grew 13%, driven by 1% unit growth and 11% ASP growth.
 
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the first fiscal quarter o
f 2019. We 
estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately 
$4.5 billion to $5.3 billion. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be 
approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share.
 
Our first quarter estimate assumes continuing nonpayme
nt of royalties by 
Apple and the other licensee. As we have noted on previous calls, the impact 
of these nonpayment of royalties has largely eliminated the seasonal effects 
that we would normally see in QTL. Our fiscal first quarter outlook also 
reflects t
he change in our share in Apple from approximately 50% modem 
share in our fiscal first quarter 2018 to zero share in the flagship launches in 
our first fiscal quarter 2019. We have also seen our RF front
-
end share at 
Apple drop in the current launch. I wil
l discuss the impacts here in more 
detail shortly.
 
More than offsetting the demand and share impacts in the quarter is a one
-
time estimated benefit of approximately $0.45 of deferred tax asset impacts 
resulting from tax elections made in the first quarter 
of fiscal 2019 as part of 
our previously announced tax restructuring.
 
We anticipate fiscal first quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses to be down approximately 5% to 7% sequentially, primarily 
reflecting one less week of operations. Our cost mana
gement efforts will be 
somewhat muted in the quarter due to timing of certain divestitures 
expected to be completed later in the fiscal year.
 
In QTL, we expect revenues of $1 billion to $1.1 billion in the fiscal first 
quarter. As a reminder, we are adopti
ng revenue accounting standard 606 in 
the first quarter, which results in us moving from reporting QTL revenue in 
arrears to estimating revenues in the period our licensees sell their products. 
ASC 606 requires us to report revenue in a manner that will in
clude an 
estimate of our QTL royalty revenues before all information is received from 
our licensees. This will lead to quarterly true
-
ups against reported numbers.
 
Despite the change in revenue recognition method, we continue to expect 
revenues to range be
tween $1 billion and $1.1 billion quarterly in the near 
term, as we see more muted seasonality on the absence of Apple licensing 
revenues. This range also excludes any payments from the other licensee in 
dispute under the $700 million interim agreement sig
ned in fiscal 2018. As a 
reminder, the final $100 million payment received under that interim 
agreement is being taken to retained earnings and not reported in the P&L 
as a result of the transition to ASC 606.
 
We expect fiscal first quarter QTL EBT margin 
to be approximately 53% to 
57%, lower sequentially, reflecting the absence of the $100 million interim 
payment and a change in R&D cost allocations, which I will discuss shortly.
 
In QCT, we expect approximately 175 million to 195 million MSM chip 
shipments
 
for the fiscal first quarter, down 20% sequentially at the 
midpoint, which is a result of one less week in the quarter, lower Apple 
legacy shipments, and lower demand from China on weaker sell
-
through 
following very strong demand in fiscal Q4.
 
Year over y
ear in the first fiscal quarter, we see a large decrease in units, 
which is fully explained from both a unit and EBT basis by the loss of share 
in the new Apple devices. We expect the Apple share reduction to be most 
impactful in our fiscal first quarter. 
In fiscal 2018, Q1 units represented 
approximately 50% of the full
-
year MSM orders from Apple. Compared to 
the same quarter last year, Apple volumes are expected to be down 50 
million to 55 million units.
 
We expect QCT EBT margin to be between 13% to 15% i
n the quarter, 
reflecting the lower MSM volumes and the impact from a lower mix of 
modem sales. We expect a recovery to high teens percentage in the second 
half of the fiscal year on improved product mix, the initial 5G launches, 
growth in adjacencies, and
 
the impact of cost actions. We expect QCT's 
demand profile and EBT in the fiscal second quarter to reflect more muted 
seasonality, as the normal pullback in Q2 versus Q1 was historically heavily 
driven by Apple.
 
Non
-
GAAP interest expense net of investment
 
and other income in the fiscal 
first quarter is expected to be approximately $100 million, which is a 
reasonable estimate for each of the remaining quarters in fiscal 2019. We 
forecast diluted weighted average shares for the first fiscal quarter to be 
app
roximately 1.23 billion.
 
Turning to 2019, as Steve mentioned, resolving our two licensee disputes is 
a key driver for fiscal 2019 performance. Upon resolution, we continue to 
forecast significant positive revenue and EPS impacts.
 
For calendar year 2019 
3G/4G/5G device shipments, we are estimating 
approximately 1.9 billion to 2 billion units, up approximately 5% at the 
midpoint, reflecting low single
-
digit handset growth, driven primarily by 
migrations to 3G and 4G in emerging regions, and strong double
-
d
igit 
growth for non
-
handsets.
 
We currently see limited macroeconomic risk to our outlook from the trade 
dispute between China and the U.S., as there are currently tariff
-
related 
impacts on only a limited number of our revenue drivers. For Chinese 
imports t
o the U.S., some networking products will be subject to U.S. tariffs, 
potentially impacting end market demand if the incremental cost is passed 
to consumers. Cellular phones at present are not currently subject to U.S. 
tariffs, and for U.S. imports to Chin
a, ICs are not currently on the China 
tariff list.
 
In fiscal 2019, we expect relatively flat global handset average selling prices 
and low to mid
-
single
-
digit percentage handset sales growth year over year, 
with strength coming from the emerging regions, p
roviding solid end market 
trends for QTL once the licensing disputes are resolved.
 
We are making some changes with respect to our allocation of certain 
technology items, predominantly in our corporate R&D spending. With the 
commercialization of 5G devices 
in 2019, the spend for device development 
will be reflected in QCT, consistent with past practice, and the technology 
development currently in corporate will largely be reflected in QTL. Also 
moving into QTL is a minority share of some IP technology items 
previously 
shown in QCT, but which are related to future technology.
 
The net effect of these changes will be decreased spend in our corporate 
expenses by approximately $500 million and an increase in QTL expenses of 
approximately the same amount. The incre
ases and decreases in these R&D 
changes are solely related to location of reporting in the segments and are 
not related to the cost reduction program.
 
The cost program remains on track to deliver $1 billion in savings from our 
$7.4 billion baseline spend. 
At present, we are trending somewhat above the 
$6.4 billion run rate, as excess litigation expenses have increased relative to 
the baseline. However, we are on track to deliver the $1 billion in operating 
savings and expect additional savings post
-
licensin
g resolution as litigation 
costs will come down significantly.
 
We expect the net effects of the cost reduction in corporate and other plus 
the change in corporate R&D expense allocation and increased interest 
expense to result in savings of approximately $
300 million in our Other 
segment outside of our core businesses in fiscal 2019.
 
Our forecast for our non
-
GAAP tax rate in fiscal 2019 is approximately 3% to 
4% and reflects both the run rate tax impacts of tax reform and the fiscal 
first quarter impacts of
 
our tax restructuring. Excluding the impact of the 
deferred tax asset item, we expect the non
-
GAAP tax rate to be 
approximately 15% for the year.
 
We expect fiscal 2019 weighted average diluted shares to be approximately 
1.19 billion to 1.2 billion, lower 
year over year by approximately 280 million 
shares or 19% of shares outstanding on the full impact of our ASR, the 
Dutch tender, and open market repurchases.
 
In summary, we expect fiscal 2019 earnings to be heavily weighted toward 
the back half of the year
, as the impacts of a number of factors increase 
over the next several quarters. We expect QCT to return to year
-
over
-
year 
earnings growth in the second half on growing China OEM share, initial 5G 
shipments, growth in adjacencies, and margin expansion. Our
 
additional cost 
actions and share repurchases over the year will further lever our second 
half performance.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.

Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah

Nomura Instinet
 
Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could talk about the dispute 
with Apple. 
We've noticed during the quarter that there were judgments in your favor, 
ITC, for example, but those judgments are coming without any injunctive 
relief. I'm just curious why this hasn't changed your timeline on resolution. 
It would seem like t
his dynamic would allow Apple to kick the can down the 
road for as long as they can.
 
Donald J. Rosenberg

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Romit, this is Don. I think you got it a little off. So the ITC ruling that you're 
referring to was the recommendation of the administ
rative law judge. We've 
previously given the dates, so that was the initial determination. That now 
goes to a final determination before the commission. It's true that he found 
infringement, which we were very pleased with, but he also decided that 
from hi
s perspective, there shouldn't be an exclusion order issued. We 
obviously disagree with that, and we have the opportunity before the 
commission to convince them otherwise.
 
Romit Jitendra Shah

Nomura Instinet
 
In China, what do you expect? Do you think it'
s going to play out like it has 
in the U.S., or do you think there could be more punitive actions, for 
example?
 
Donald J. Rosenberg

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yeah, sorry. Your first part of your question, I think, was in China. You were 
asking about our actions in 
China?
 
Romit Jitendra Shah

Nomura Instinet
 
Just the process in China and how that might compare to what we've seen 
so far here in the U.S.
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Sure, so I think as I've said in the past, we've got over 20 patent 
infringeme
nt cases in multiple jurisdictions in China, where the IP courts 
have shown to be very good at protecting intellectual property rights and 
issuing in many cases injunctions. And so we continue to press those cases, 
and we remain optimistic about the result
s of those. We've also, I should 
say, gone through multiple reviews of the validity of our patents that are at 
issue in those cases, and we have won all but one, I believe, so there are 
many validity findings already through the CIPO, the Chinese Intellect
ual 
Property Office.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Walkley with 
Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.
 
T. Michael Walkley

Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
 
Great, thanks. George, I just wondered if you could walk 
us through some of 
the changes in your guidance. Earlier in the year when Broadcom was trying 
to buy you, you shared some financial targets for fiscal 2019. Now you've 
given us some startup guidance for the year that's going to be lower than 
those targets.
 
Can you just maybe walk us through some of the things that 
might have changed, whether it's higher legal costs, a weaker smartphone 
market, maybe less of a buyback given the timing of NXP? Can you help us 
reconcile your guidance relative to the one earlie
r in the year? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hi, Mike. Let me generally characterize it for you. And as we've discussed 
previously, the extension of the NXP contract, first from April and then to 
July, and then of course the termination last 
quarter and then the 
implementation of our capital return program in August, accounts for a 
material part of the difference, as accretion is still the biggest single 
difference in the share repurchase case versus NXP, which came with 
accretion on day one. 
And under the share repurchases, we've said it's the 
combination of the licensing resolution and the share repurchase can 
actually bring higher accretion than we would have seen with NXP.
 
I think in terms of just looking back to what we see now versus the 
beginning of last year, clearly we see a weaker handset market in both 2018 
and 2019 than we saw at the beginning of the year, and I think that's one of 
the major factors. I think there's other minor factors like interest rates being 
higher. You've got som
e other factors like operating expenses related to 
what we were referring to as excess litigation being higher.
 
But the key point is the same elements that drove our earnings performance 
at $5.25 and actually the higher range, which is really how we have 
d
iscussed our performance post
-
dispute resolution, those things are all still 
in front of us, even with a weaker handset market overall.
 
So the key thing is going to be resolution with Apple, and then of course, 
obviously the various implications of that re
solution, whether it includes 
possible reengagement on products, and then of course, the ultimate 
accretion that comes with that. We also see, quite frankly, 5G, which ramps 
in 2020 and 2021, as providing further underpinning to that strong earnings 
potent

T
hank you. If I could just go back to Don, you mentioned, or maybe Steve 
mentioned in the initial remarks about the FTC complaint and the initial 
decision and not agreeing with it. Could you just talk a little bit? Just a few 
of the questions I had, one, I 
thought Qualcomm had previously been 
licensing to modem suppliers since they're shipping in the market. And then 
second, is this potentially risking the whole license royalty rate based on 
system rather than chip? And then third, if you can just maybe talk
 
about 
how the FTC may impact or may not impact some of the other Apple or ODM 
cases that are out there, that would be helpful. Thank you.
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yeah, sure. So the first 

 
let me go back to the order. The first question was 
w
ith respect to 

 
no, the modem was the third question, wasn't it? Yeah, 
with respect to the ITC?
 
John T. Sinnott 
-

No, I think it was the FTC.
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Sorry, the FTC.
 
John T. Sinnott

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Could you go
 
ahead and repeat your question so we make sure we get the 
proper answer?
 
Timothy Patrick Long 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Sure, it was the FTC. Were you previously licensing to modem suppliers 
since they are selling to market, what's the impact 
of a potential decision on 
chip level versus device level? And then what's the relationship with this 
case potentially and anything with Apple or the other ODMs?
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Sorry, I've got it now. So on modem licensing, your assum
ption was right. 
That is to say that competitive chip makers have been free to sell their chips 
to device makers. Our practice has been because we license to device 
makers that competitive chip suppliers can sell to licensed device makers 
and not have to p
ay us a license fee, and that's been the case for many, 
many years. There was a time long ago when we provided some non
-
exhaustive licenses to some chip makers, but that was in the past.
 
So your point is well taken because there was no need for a license 

 
there 
is no need for a license on the component level as long as the device makers 
are licensed, which the industry has practiced since the very beginning of 
industry practice here. The primary standards bodies have constantly 
reiterated device
-
level lice
nsing is the norm, and every player in the industry 
has followed that process. So that's why I say I think the judge respectfully 
got it wrong here, and we're looking forward to an opportunity for a full trial 
later in January.
 
I think I've answered your second question as well, so I'll pass that one. And 
in terms of the impact, there really is, on ODMs and other Apple situations, 
there's no immediate impact here. We have licenses, as you know, which 
remain valid. This is a parti
al summary judgment, which the judge decided a 
particular issue in this case. It's not a final judgment, and so we'll just 
continue advocating our position in court and continue to have multiple 
licenses around the world, as you know.
 
Timothy Patrick Long

BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Okay, thank you.
 
Alexander Rogers

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hey, Tim. This is Alex. I'm calling in remotely. Let me just jump in very 
quickly. On the royalty rate issue, one of the things I think is important to 
remember is tha
t our licensing program with respect to essential patents in 
cellular is really properly valued at the system level and the device level. 
And so the value of this intellectual property is realized at that level, and 
that doesn't change by virtue of this pa
rticular partial summary judgment 
ruling.
 
The other thing I think is important to keep in mind is that we've dealt with 
similar issues like this before, for example, in the TFTC matter, and we 
found a way to resolve it there in a way that's not disruptive 
to the licensing 
business and satisfactory to the TFTC obviously. So I just wanted to add a 
couple of those additional points.
 
Timothy Patrick Long

BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Okay, thanks for the extra color.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

Tim, this is Steve. Also, I would just add. In all of, I would say, the legal 
detail, I want to make sure the point is not lost. Really our focus here in the 
near term is really how do we settle the FTC case. It's been public that we've 
had some discussi
ons in that regard. And that's really where the focus is 
right now, and there's nothing really in that order that we think complicates 
that or keeps us from doing that. And in the meantime, we're really not 
compelled to do anything differently with the bus
iness. But that's really 
where the focus is. Hopefully, that isn't lost in the discussion as well.

Amit Daryanani

Thank you, I have two as well. I guess first off, to get towards the high 
teens operating margin target for QCT, what sort of MSM unit expectations 
do you 
have on the back of this? I'm just trying to understand. To go from 
low teens to high teens, how much of this is going to be volume
-
driven 
versus some of the cost take
-
out benefits that you guys are already 
implementing? That would be helpful.
 
And then the
 
second question, I think ahead of the FTC, ahead of the judge 
giving you this preliminary judgment, I think Qualcomm and the FTC had 
asked for a 30
-
day deferral to reach some sort of settlement. Does the 
ruling by the judge in any way prevent you guys fro
m getting to some sort 
of settlement with the FTC away from the courts? And is that a likely option 
over the next six to nine months for you guys? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Amit, hi. This is George. I'll cover the MSM. We're seeing both b
enefits more 
from mix in our MSM outlook in the second half versus the first half, not so 
much a volume question, although it's good. But we're continuing to see a 
trend that we've seen before, which is a very strong volume move from low 
and mid up into th
e high and premium tiers, and that continues. And that 
also relates to the timing of launches in China, which Cristiano is probably 
better to comment on. Of course, we still expect to see some additional 
benefit from the cost program as well.
 
Cristiano R. 
Amon

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Maybe I'll just make a small comment and hand it over to I think Don on the 
FTC question. So, Amit, also at the very tail end of fiscal 2019, that's when 
we're going to start to see the ramp of some of the 5G devices. And it's 
meaning
ful volume in fiscal 2020, but the initial launches will also happen at 
the very end of 2019 fiscal for us. Thank you.
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
And I think your question was does the partial summary judgment ruling 
affect our continuing settlem
ent discussions. And I think as Steve just 
indicated, we have ongoing settlement discussions with the FTC and we will 
continue those discussions with the FTC.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to know why you're 
including a discrete tax benefit in your Q1 non
-
GAAP earnings. Did you know 
it was there when
 
you gave the guidance for 2019 last year? And does that 
benefit, $0.45, go toward the $5.25 EPS target that your compensation is 
based on? And if so, why is that there?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hi, Stacy. The timing of the tax adjustment item 
relates to the timing of the 
tax restructuring that we've taken. And that's been a process that has been 
continually under review over the last several months, but it really relates 
and reflects the timing of the actions.
 
In terms of the compensation, we s
till are very focused on delivering the 
numbers that we have talked about and that the board has based the 
compensation plan for management. And I think the one
-
time items are not 
the driving factor in delivering that business or those business results.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brett Simpson with 
Arete Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brett Simpson

Arete Research Services LLP
 
Yes, thanks very much, a question for George. I think earlier this year 
during 
the Broadcom situation, you guided on adjacency revenue for fiscal 
2019 at $7 billion to $8 billion from QCT. Can you give us an update on this? 
Just give us some sense as to what the December quarter looks like for 
adjacencies and how you see fiscal 2019 
now playing out.
 
And maybe, George, can you give us some insight in terms of QCT sales 
overall for fiscal 2019? Just now you've given some guidance for December 
quarter, why we can't get a revenue guide overall for fiscal 2019 for QCT. 
Thank you.
 
George S.
 
Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So adjacencies, when we look at the previous forecast, probably the biggest 
difference is we've seen slower adjacent growth in 2018 than we had 
forecasted. We start to see recovery to that growth rate in 2019. We also 
have seen our 
RF front
-
end business, which had an Apple component, which 
was in that forecast, all of that business has moved away from our front
-
end 
group. Despite that, absent that, there's been strong growth outside of 
Apple.
 
In terms of the mix, though, as we've see
n some of the favorable business 
trends that Steve talked about, not only in the win area but in the IoT and in 
auto, we're actually seeing far less margin EBT impact from the slower 
growth than what we had forecasted as opposed to what we saw in 2018.
 
Wit
h respect to guidance on revenue, our practice, consistent with really 
what the rest of the industry does, is to give it a quarter out.
 
Brett Simpson 
-
 
Arete Research Services LLP
 
And maybe just to confirm, can you give us any sense as to 

 
you said $7 
bil
lion or $8 billion earlier this year. Can you give us a range or any insights 
on adjacencies for fiscal 2019 now? I understand it's slower growth.
 
And maybe just a separate question for Cristiano. On 5G, when you talk 
about Snapdragon 800 wins and the RF o
pportunity as well, can you maybe 
just frame? What is the revenue opportunity per 5G phone when you're 
selling a Snapdragon 800 and the RF, the complete RF front end for 5G? 
Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Again, we're not providing an updated 
guide against the $7 billion to $8 
billion. The biggest difference between the range and what we see today is 
really slower growth in IoT and the impact of the Apple change in our front
-
end business. But from 

 
again, when I look at the EBT impact relative
 
to 
our expectation to get to the earnings potential that we talked about, it's a 
very minor impact overall.
 
Cristiano R. Amon 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hi, Brett. This is Cristiano. On 5G, we expect 5G to be a significant 
expansion, even on existing units, both in
 
revenue and earnings for QCT, but 
also likely to be an expansion of share. And we see two drivers. One is we 
have a lot more content in the device. Besides the performance of a 
premium
-
tier application processor and the 5G modem, we also have high 
tractio
n on the RF front
-
end design, including the incremental value you get 
from millimeter wave modules, which is going to be very important. Certain 
markets, for example, the United States, will require millimeter wave. Thank 
you.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hi, guys. You gave guidance before for expense cuts of $1 billion. Can you 
discuss the linearity? Should 
we expect a drop in expenses early in the year, 
or is it going to be even throughout the year? That's for modeling purpose.
 
Second, your guidance for next quarter for MSM shipments was lower than 
expectations, I believe, that are in line with the Street. C
an you discuss the 
areas of strength and the areas of weakness as you see it next quarter? And 
how do you refer to the reports about global weakness in demand for 
smartphones? Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Great. So on the operating expense line
arity, we expect to continue to see 
operating expenses coming down over the year and more in the back half 
than we would normally see in a cost reduction program just because of the 
timing of some of the divestitures that are a part of it but not a key and
 
driving part of it. The other part is just the timing of some roadmap items 
and when it made sense to take certain actions. So overall, we're very 
confident that we're on track for that.
 
In terms of the MSM share, maybe I'll just comment on the big deltas
. I 
think the year
-
over
-
year is, in some ways, most instructive because that's 
where you really see the Apple effect. And we're down in the first quarter 55 
million units versus where we were last year in the same quarter with Apple, 
and that's really the 
effect of zero share.
 
One of the things that I think has made the impact of that harder to see is 
that, in 2018, we saw very strong demand increase in China, and at the 
same time, the mix of that demand improved in the high and premium tier. 
And so the imp
act of going from 100% to 50% share last year was really 
addressed by the growth of the non
-
Apple business. Obviously, this quarter 
we don't have that same benefit. So you're seeing a front
-
loaded 

 
which is 
how Apple ordered last year 

 
so comparatively, 
a front
-
loaded Apple 
environment that we're not participating in.
 
Cristiano R. Amon 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Maybe I'm just going to add one thing. This is Cristiano, Tal. So if you 
remove the Apple effect, the seasonality we see in 2019 is very similar to 
what we saw in 2018. And I think as George outlined, when you look on the 
MSM shipments versus Street, if yo
u look at it 

 
because, as George said, 
Apple front
-
loaded 50 million to 55 million units, you see the strength for the 
MSM is still with the growth on the non
-
Apple business. And that's why we're 
going to continue to see that as we go to the second half w
hen we don't 
have that Apple impact anymore.

UBS Securities LLC
 
Hi. I had two. George, so just going back to the guidance
 
for fiscal 2019, so 
is the apples
-
to
-
apples number now $4.80 versus the original $5.25 
baseline? Is that right?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So, Tim, we're not re
-
guiding 2019 against the numbers. Again, the largest 
delta as I look at where we are ver
sus 

 
and again, it depends on whether 
you're looking at a $5.25 case that had NXP coming in on day one or how do 
we get to the higher range that we talked about back in January of 2018. It 
comes down to, again, the largest part of that being the timing ef
fect of 
when the share repurchase activity started, and also the impact of getting 
the accretion that comes with a resolution, which then I think we're in a 
much stronger position. Otherwise, the biggest difference is really the 
market is a little bit weak
er than we had expected before, and the balance 
being things like, such as I said, the slower growth in adjacents, actually a 
little bit higher interest rates having an impact, and slightly higher tax rates 
having an impact.

Okay, George. Thanks. And then there's a lot of moving parts obviously with 
Apple, but it seems like every call we hear more about a potential for an 
injunction in China. Maybe that's why they don't want to talk about units 
anymore, but I'm wondering.
 
What is the catalyst for you to get an 
injunction? Is it a single one of these infringement cases going your way, 
which sounds like it might happen this quarter? So I guess the question is 
could you get an injunction before the end of this year? Thanks.
 
D
onald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hi, this is Don. Yes, as I mentioned, there are over 20 cases that we've filed 
in various jurisdictions within China. And the vehicle for an injunction is we 
request an injunction as part of the case. China, unlike some 
other 
countries, actually will issue even preliminary injunctions and not wait 
through a full trial for permanent injunction. But as I said earlier too, they 
also have a parallel process where the patent office reviews patents for 
validity, and we've been 
very successful so far there. So as soon as we get 
an infringement judgment in our favor, there is a real chance of injunctive 
relief there.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with 
Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
 
question.
 
Ross C. Seymore

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I had two. First on the MSM 
side dropping 20%, George, you've said there were a number of things, 
Apple, extra week, et cetera. Can you just talk ab
out 

 
even if I took the 
Apple out, on a year
-
over
-
year basis it looks like the MSMs are flat to very 
slightly up. Given the dynamics of taking share in China, I'm surprised that 
it's not a little bit better than that, so any color on that.
 
And the second 
unrelated question is on your tax commentary, not for the 
quarter, but you indicated it would be 15%, I think, for the rest of the fiscal 
year after fiscal 1Q. Is that correct? And how does that tax rate of 15% 
change after you resolve the two outstanding 
disputes?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
So let me 

 
maybe I'll start with the tax rate first. You're correct. It's 15% 
on the remaining quarters, which gets you at roughly 3% to 4% for the full 
year given the tax benefit in the first quarter. Effectivel
y, the tax 
restructuring is bringing our offshore revenue onshore, and most of that 
revenue is going to be subject to the FDII rate, the foreign
-
derived income 
rate, which is 13% as opposed to the statutory rate of 21%.
 
And so I think, as we said, I think 
the mid
-
teens is still a good number to 
think about in terms of modeling because of that. The 15% you get pulled 
up a little bit because not everything falls into that bucket, and so you get 
pulled up a little on rate from the FDII rate.
 
In terms of the MS
Ms, I want to make sure I understand. Are you talking 
about sequential or year over year? Because it's a very different story as we 
look at sequential versus year over year.
 
Ross C. Seymore 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
On year
-
over
-
year you're guiding 
to 185 million units at the midpoint. And if 
my model is right, I think you did 237 million in the same quarter a year 
ago. So if I just did the math of taking the 50 million to 55 million units that 
you said from Apple out of the equation, it seems like y
ou're still only talking 
180 million 

 
182 million units.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Now I've got your question. So the difference 

 
one of the differences, we're 
seeing some lower demand in China. As we said Q4, part of our 
outperformance in Q4 was 
high and premium tier devices in China. And so 
we're seeing that come down a little bit as sell
-
through for some of our 
customers was below expectations. So there's a little bit of a digestion 
period, and I think that's part of why it looks like we're not 
getting as much 
pickup year over year potentially from the growth in China. And by the way, 
Q1 last year was not a bad quarter for China units either.

release and an executive presentation that 
accompany this call on our investor relations website. This call is also being 
webcast on Qualcomm.com and a replay will be available on the website 
later today.
 
During this conference call, we will use non
-
GAAP f
inancial measures as 
defined in Regulation G and you can find the reconciliations to GAAP on our 
website. As well, we will make forward
-
looking statements regarding future 
events or the future business or results of the Company. Actual events or 
results co
uld differ materially from those projected in the forward
-
looking 
statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10
-
Q 
which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from the forward
-
looking stat
ements.
 
I'd also like to remind you that our Analyst Day will be held on Thursday, 
February 11 at our headquarters in San Diego. To attend in person, you 
must be a financial analyst or institutional investor. The analyst meeting will 
be webcast for those o
f you unable to attend in person.
 
And now to comments from Qualcomm's Chief Executive Officer, Steve 
Mollenkopf.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Warren and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a stronger 
than expected quarter, with earnings per share 
coming in above the high 
end of our initial guidance, driven by strong 3G/4G device sales and lower 
operating expenses in QCT.
 
QCT chipset shipments were near the high end of expectations, with low tier 
strength across OEMs particularly in China, offsettin
g some weakness in thin 
modem sales at a key customer. QTL revenues were higher than 
expectations on strong 3G/4G device volumes and ASPs and we continue to 
make progress in signing up Chinese licensees, although there is still more 
work to be done on that
 
front.
 
During the quarter, we also returned approximately $2.8 billion to 
stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases which included the 
completion of the incremental $10 billion in stock repurchases we announced 
last March. This $10 billion is o
ver and above our commitment to return a 
minimum of 75% of free cash flow to our stockholders.
 
We're also very pleased to have announced an agreement to form a joint 
venture with TDK to enable the delivery of RF front
-
end modules and RF 
filters into fully 
integrated systems for mobile devices and other IoT 
applications. Once closed, we will add TDK's capabilities in micro
-
acoustic RF 
filtering, packaging and module integration technologies to our RF 360 
portfolio to offer leading
-
edge RF solutions in fully 
integrated systems that 
we believe will provide significant advantages in performance and time to 
launch across our Snapdragon product tiers.
 
The deal is expected to close in early 2017 and is forecasted to be accretive 
to non
-
GAAP earnings in its first ye
ar. We have a strong pipeline of new RF 
front
-
end products, including new generations of our envelope tracker, 
antenna tuner, switches and CMOS and gallium arsenide PAs. Our gas PAs 
are anticipated to enter production in 2017.
 
In addition, we continue to d
eepen our level of cooperation with an 
investment in China. We just announced a cooperation agreement with the 
province of Guizhou, including the formation of a joint venture that will 
design, develop and sell advanced server chipset technology in China. T
his 
builds on the announcement we made in October, detailing the availability of 
our server development platform which is now sampling to tier
-
one cloud 
customers and the strategic partnerships we have established with Xilinx 
and Mellanox. We continue to m
ake good progress on the elements of our 
strategic realignment plan and are on track to achieve our cost
-
savings 
targets.
 
I would also like to welcome Jeff Henderson to the Board. Jeff brings 
extensive financial and operational management experience to his
 
position 
as an Independent Director, including 10 years as CFO of Cardinal Health 
and past automotive industry experience. Following our annual meeting in 
March, assuming our slate of directors are elected, our Board size will be 
reduced to 12 members and
 
the average tenure will be reduced to 
approximately five years.
 
I would also like to congratulate Cristiano Amon on his promotion to 
President of QCT. He provided exceptional leadership over his 18 years at 
Qualcomm and will play a critical role in expand
ing QCT's road map, 
enhancing our customer relationships, structuring our efforts for success in 
our adjacent opportunities and positioning the business for long term 
success.
 
On that note, we continue to be pleased with the performance and design 
traction
 
of our Snapdragon 820 processor.
 
The first product announcement based on the 820 occurred at CES and we 
expect a number of exciting launches in the first half of this calendar year, 
including many at Mobile World Congress. We now have more than 100 
design
 
wins based on the 820 and the product is entering mass production 
using 14 nanometer LPP technology.
 
At the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month, it was clear that many 
industries are looking to leverage mobile technology into their products and 
b
usinesses are looking to the leaders in communications and computer 
systems, such as Qualcomm, to make the world more connected and 
smarter. Our many announcements at the show reflect our progress 
extending Qualcomm technology into adjacent and new areas, 
including 
automotive, IoT and networking.
 
In auto, we announced that Qualcomm Snapdragon 602A processors will be 
commercially available in 2017 Audi vehicles. We also introduced our next
-
generation Snapdragon 820 automotive processor, as well as several ot
her 
products, including our wireless charging technology. For IoT, we announced 
a smart home
-
reference platform using the Snapdragon 212 processor, the 
new Qualcomm aptX HD solution for high
-
resolution audio over Bluetooth, a 
new Bluetooth smart SOC, the f
irst commercial drone based on the 
QUALCOMM Snapdragon Flight platform and the Snapdragon X5 9X07 LTE 
modem which broadens our family of modem solutions for IoT.
 
In networking, we launched Qualcomm Wi
-
Fi SON which is a self
-
organizing 
network solution, to 
simplify Wi
-
Fi networking and optimize user experience. 
And we showed significant traction in multiband Wi
-
Fi 802.11 AC and 11 AD, 
enabling products across multiple segments.
 
As we did in both 3G and 4G, we're leading the industry in the development 
of a u
nified, more capable 5G platform that will take on a much larger role 
than previous generations and deliver new levels of efficiency. The 
foundation of this platform is an OFDM
-
based unified air interface, that will 
not only enhance mobile broadband servic
es, but also enable connectivity for 
the Internet of Things and new types of mission
-
critical services that require 
lower latency, higher reliability and robust security. 5G will also include 
native support for advanced technologies, such as the use of unl
icensed 
spectrum, multicast and device
-
to
-
device capabilities. We're pioneering 
these technologies today with our leadership in LTE Advanced and LTE 
Advanced Pro. These new technologies are paving the way for 5G and 
accelerating our path to a truly connect
ed future.
 
Overall, we're pleased with our progress on key initiatives, execution of the 
strategic realignment plan, design traction for the Snapdragon 820, 
refreshing the QCT road map across tiers, broadening our presence in 
adjacent opportunities, progre
ss on new licensing agreements in China, 
execution of our data center strategy and advancements that will extend our 
technology leadership position. I want to reiterate that we remain focused 
on execution to improve our financial trajectory, exiting the fi
scal year.
 
Our industry and Company are undergoing rapid changes and we're 
enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead. We're extending our leadership 
in mobile and are driving our mobile technologies and core competencies in 
communication systems and high
-
performance low
-
power computing into 
significant new areas. We have taken action to enable us to seize these 
opportunities, while delivering improved performance.
 
I'm optimistic about the future and have great confidence in our employees 
to execute on our 
strategies and drive growth. I look forward to seeing many 
of you at our upcoming Analyst Day and would now like to turn the call over 
to Derek Aberle.

Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. QTL had a strong fiscal 
first quarter, with 
total reported device sales of $60.6 billion which was 
above expectations on both higher ASPs and reported units, as well as some 
catch
-
up reporting from recently concluded license agreements in China. 
QTL revenues in the quarter were higher than expectati
ons and would have 
been even higher if not for a contract dispute with LG that resulted in us 
deferring revenue of more than $100 million for the quarter.
 
Although LG continues to report and pay, we're not recognizing revenue 
while the arbitration regardin
g the dispute proceeds. We believe LG's claims 
are without merit. The deferral of this revenue has the effect of depressing 
the implied royalty rate as you would calculate it, as their shipments are 
included in total reported device sales without the corre
sponding revenue. 
Assuming we conclude this matter successfully, as we have done with others 
in the past, we would expect to recognize the deferred revenues at that 
time.
 
Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G/4G device shipments continues to 
be strong. 
With respect to smartphones in particular, there continues to be a 
significant opportunity for Qualcomm. LTE penetration is only 14% of cellular 
connections globally and smartphone unit shipments are forecast to be more 
than 8.5 billion from 2015 through 2
019, according to GSM Intelligence and 
Gartner.
 
Calendar 2015 global 3G/4G device shipments are largely in line with our 
prior expectations, driven primarily by migrations to 4G in China, partially 
offset by some recent weakness in developed regions. We co
ntinue to 
estimate that calendar 2016 global 3G/4G device shipments will grow 
approximately 10% at the midpoint, driven primarily by the migration to 
3G/4G devices in emerging regions, with particular strength in India.
 
Our estimate for premium tier shipme
nts is down slightly versus our prior 
view, driven by slower
-
than
-
expected sell
-
through at a large OEM. But that 
is offset by a slightly stronger outlook for emerging region shipments. We 
continue to expect low single
-
digit growth in global 3G/4G device sa
les in FY 
'16, as unit growth more than offsets ASP declines. We will provide further 
color on our long term outlook for the 3G/4G device opportunity at our 
upcoming Analyst Day.
 
Now let me provide an update on our progress with licensing in China. 
We're 
continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreements on the 
NDRC terms with the remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance. 
We're making progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new 
agreements with Xiaomi, Haier, QiKu 
and Tianyu. These agreements include 
royalty
-
bearing licenses for three
-
mode devices and contain terms that are 
consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted to the NDRC. 
Having said that, we still need to conclude agreements with a handful
 
of key 
Chinese OEMs and those negotiations continue.
 
Our progress and our ongoing interactions with the NDRC and other parts of 
the Chinese government continue to give us confidence that we will be able 
to conclude agreements with the remaining key OEMs. 
While we're working 
to conclude new license agreements and improve compliance through 
commercial negotiations and audits, we're prepared to enforce our 
agreements and take other actions against certain OEMs that are not 
negotiating in good faith, underrepo
rting royalties or refusing to conclude 
agreements in the near term.
 
Turning to our outlook for FY '16, we continue to expect QTL's revenues to 
be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. Although additional risk has been 
introduced as a result of the n
ew LG dispute, given that it could be resolved 
outside of FY '16. In conclusion, although we're seeing some near term 
softness in the premium tier, the sales of smartphones remain healthy and 
should continue to grow. We remain confident that we will be abl
e to resolve 
the dispute with LG, conclude new agreements with the remaining key 
Chinese OEMs and improve compliance over time.
 
That concludes my comments and I look forward to seeing many of you at 
our upcoming Analyst Day. I will now turn the call over t
o George.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Derek and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results 
reflect a strong quarter relative to November guidance and are consistent 
with our update a few weeks ago. Fiscal first quarter revenues were $5.8 
billion and n
on
-
GAAP earnings per share were $0.97, $0.12 above the 
midpoint of our original guidance. The outperformance primarily reflected 
stronger revenues in our licensing business and accelerated cost reductions 
in QCT.
 
We also benefited at the end of the quarter
 
from the permanent 
reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, impacting non
-
GAAP earnings per share 
by approximately $0.01 to $0.02. In QTL, higher
-
than
-
expected ASPs and 
shipments led to stronger revenues at $1.6 billion and more than offset the 
dispute impact
 
in the quarter.
 
Total reported device sales include some reported devices without the 
corresponding revenue from the LG dispute that Derek described, as well as 
some deferred three
-
mode revenues. QCT shipped 242 million MSMs, with 
revenues of $4.1 billion
 
and operating margin of 14%, reflecting stronger
-
than
-
expected demand in the low tier, particularly in China, partially offset 
by lower
-
than
-
 
expected shipments of thin modems.
 
For the Company, non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were lower 
than our e
xpectations, decreasing approximately 2% sequentially, reflecting 
an acceleration of some of our SRP cost initiatives originally forecasted to be 
taken later in the fiscal year. Operating cash flow was strong at $2.7 billion 
or 47% of revenue for the quart
er and we returned $2.8 billion to 
stockholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.
 
As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had approximately $4.9 billion of 
our stock repurchase authorization remaining. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate was 
17% in the fiscal
 
first quarter and we now estimate that our FY '16 non
-
GAAP tax rate will be approximately 18%, including the impact of the 
permanently reinstated R&D tax credit, down from our previous estimate of 
19% to 20%.
 
Now turning to FY '16, for QTL, we're not modi
fying the prior $7.3 billion to 
$8 billion revenue range for the year. However, that range did not anticipate 
deferral of revenues related to the LG dispute. While we're working hard to 
resolve this dispute and believe their claims are without merit, it is
 
possible 
that the resolution will not occur in FY '16. In this case, the deferral of the 
LG revenue outside of the fiscal year could impact the range by several 
hundred miIlion dollars.
 
In QCT, we continue to expect improving trends in the second half of 
the 
fiscal year on new product traction. We also continued to expect to achieve a 
QCT operating margin of 16% or better in the fiscal fourth quarter.
 
We remain on track to meet the spending reduction objectives under the 
strategic realignment plan and now 
expect at least $700 million of savings in 
FY '16 and to exit the year at a savings run rate of $1.1 billion. We expect FY 
'16 non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down 
approximately 2% to 4% year over year, down an additional 1% at the 
midpoint
 
on earlier capture of cost savings relative to previous estimates.
 
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of FY '16, our outlook reflects 
a seasonally strong December quarter for 3G/4G device shipments for QTL 
and the seasonally lower first calend
ar quarter MSM shipments for QCT. 
Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include a forecast of 
potential revenue from signing new license agreements in China and we 
have excluded estimated revenue from LG as a result of the dispute.
 
We estimat
e revenues to be in the range of approximately $4.9 billion to 
$5.7 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 
approximately $0.90 to $1 per share. We anticipate fiscal second quarter 
non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be down 
approximately 
2% to 4% sequentially, reflecting continued progress on our SRP initiatives.
 
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $65 billion to $73 billion 
will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter for shipments they 
made in the D
ecember quarter, up approximately 14% sequentially at the 
midpoint, reflecting the seasonal strength of the holiday quarter. If the 
dispute
-
related units continue to be reported and the matter is not resolved 
during the quarter, then we could again see uni
ts included in PRDS for which 
revenue would not be recognized.
 
Also in QTL, we're expecting a one
-
time benefit of approximately $250 
million in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, based on termination of an 
infrastructure license agreement that resulted 
from one of our licensees 
acquiring another one of our licensees. This was partially offset by the end of 
a multi
-
year amortization of approximately $100 million in quarterly license 
fees. These events were expected and contemplated in our prior guidance.
 
In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 
million units, lower sequentially, reflecting seasonal trends, somewhat 
exaggerated by an above seasonal decline in demand for thin modem 
products. We also see some modest negative impact 
from mix shift across 
OEMs and devices in China.
 
We expect revenue per MSM to be higher quarter over quarter, reflecting 
stronger mix, including a lower mix of thin modem shipments. And 
consistent with our prior guidance, we expect QCT's fiscal second quar
ter 
operating margin percentage to be in the low to mid
-
single digits.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.
 
Warren Kneeshaw
 
Thank you, George. Operator, we're ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operat
or Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mike 
Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.
 
MikeWalkley
 
George, just following up on the QTL guidance, is that $250 million from the 
merger of your infrastructure customers, is that inc
luded in the guidance? I 
just wanted to clarify that. And then overall, longer term, as you look at QTL 
with the royalty rate and more three
-
mode devices coming in, Derek, can 
you just help us think about maybe the implied royalty rate going forward? 
That 
would be very helpful.
 
GeorgeDavis
 
Sure, hi, Mike. This is George. Yes, the $250 million is included in the 
guidance. And remember, it is netted against the expiration of about $100 
million a quarter from a previous multi
-
year agreement. Mike, this is 
Derek. 
On the implied royalty rate question, I think there are so many moving 
pieces on this, but let me give you a high
-
level view. I think there's going to 
be some lumpiness as we go forward just in terms of catch
-
up units coming 
in and some of those wil
l be three
-
mode units for prior periods, as well as 
then as licensees start reporting more three
-
mode, that will put some 
pressure on the rate.
 
Although, actually what we're seeing in the market in China is more of a 
shift to five
-
 
and six
-
mode devices and
 
away from three
-
mode devices. And 
so a lot of the design traction has moved and I think as you go into the 
second half of 2016, we will probably start seeing, as a percentage of units 
in China, a reduction in the amount of three
-
mode on a go
-
forward basis
.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. 
Please go ahead.
 
TimLong
 
Just sticking on the royalty rate and the QTL business, Derek. First, I just 
wanted to make sure I understand. I guess there's the moving parts, bu
t if 
the LG is a little more than $100 million and that number still seems like the 
calculated number would be 10 or 15 basis points under 3. So is that 
--
 
do 
we have a new reset to rate there or is there something else that dragged 
the number in the quart
er down? And then, the unit numbers, the paid units 
were pretty good above what we've seen as normal seasonality. Can you 
break down for us how much of that was catch
-
up? Or maybe how much of 
that was contribution from some of these new deals that have bee
n signed 
recently? Thank you.
 
DerekAberle
 
On the rate, there's a few things affecting it in the quarter. We gave $100 
million, we said more than $100 million and so we're not being entirely 
precise on that number. So I think you need to be a little bit car
eful about 
just taking it to the $100 million. But we also had some catch
-
up units come 
through in the quarter, for which we didn't have revenue in the quarter, 
given the structure of the deal in terms of when it's going to get paid out. 
That revenue we ex
pect will come in in future quarters, so that's also having 
a drag.
 
So you have got the disputed TRDS, as well as this three
-
mode element that 
is collectively putting some pressure on the rate. There are catch
-
up units in 
the quarter. I would say that they
 
are not a huge contributor, but they are 
probably less than about 20 million units for the quarter.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit 
Suisse. Please go ahead.
 
KulbinderGarcha
 
Can you just maybe talk through th
e drivers of the QCT modern decline into 
the next quarter? It seems like quite a severe drop. I know there's 
seasonality, but we haven't observed it to be that volatile in the past. That's 
the first question on QCT. And on QTL, Derek, maybe thinking about 
it 
another way, it looks like now, if my math is right, you've signed with 
vendors all 
--
 
with the new terms that account for almost 50%, 60% of the 
Chinese smartphone market.
 
And I would've thought at some point, the increasing compliance in China 
will dr
ive an uptick to the QTL revenue profile. It doesn't seem to be doing 
that, even if I take out the impact of LG this year. So how should we think 
about the future compliance of more vendors you want to sign up? Should 
that QTL revenue [indiscernible] refle
cting that or are there other factors at 
work that we should think about this year? Thanks.
 
GeorgeDavis
 
So on the margin decline quarter over quarter and again as a reminder, we 
actually guided this at last quarter's call as well. As you see, the big 
seaso
nal pull back in volumes and the mix change that we see, that has both 
an absorption of OpEx issue and a gross margin reduction element to it. And 
the combination of those at this level of revenue pulls it down to our 
forecast. I will say, as we've talked 
about, we see those dynamics actually 
reversing themselves and actually providing momentum into the back half of 
the year in terms of margin improvement. And we still see getting to 16% in 
Q4 in QCT.
 
DerekAberle
 
Again, I think you got to break down the TRD
S picture in China. There's 
really three elements. One is the underreporting which I think is largely 
referred to as the compliance issue. Then there is three
-
mode volume that is 
unlicensed and we're working actively to get companies signed up so that 
they
 
start paying on three
-
mode. And then the third thing that we talked 
about last quarter were actually a small number of companies, but actually 
meaningful in size that had actually started withholding reports and payment 
of licensed non
-
three
-
mode units. A
nd so as we conclude new agreements 
with those companies, you'll see a meaningful improvement in the run rate 
collection because there also tend to be some of the larger three
-
mode 
players in China.
 
So you will capture the three
-
mode, plus you'll get them 
back reporting on 
the non
-
three
-
mode which will leave you really with this compliance question 
which will still be something we need to work through. But those two, I think 
it's really a relatively small number of companies that need to get signed 
and you'
ll see a pretty material improvement in the run rate in QTL.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
JamesFaucette
 
I just had a couple of questions related to royalty collections. First, in th
e 
contract dispute with LG, can you give a little color there as to is this at all 
connected to the KFTC process within Korea? Or is resolution somehow of 
one dependent on the other? And then along those same lines, maybe if you 
could give any update on yo
ur engagement and progress with the different 
governments that are looking at Qualcomm's practices in Korea, Taiwan and 
the EU? Thank you very much.
 
DerekAberle
 
I will take the first part of that. Really the dispute we have with LG is really 
unrelated to t
he issues that are before KFTC. We've had this throughout the 
history of the licensing program. It is just part of the business that will from 
time to time have disputes with our licensees. This is really a contract 
dispute under their agreement similar to
 
a number of the ones we've had in 
the past which we have resolved successfully for the Company. And we feel 
very firmly that we're going to be able to do that again here. And so there 
will be a question of timing.
 
We decided for now not to adjust the QTL 
revenue guidance for the year, 
because we still have three quarters left to resolve it. And we think there is a 
chance that that can happen. If it goes all the way through the arbitration 
process, that will likely push it outside the fiscal year. But we fe
el very good 
in our position and again, we've been through a number of these in the past 
and they have worked out well.
 
DonRosenberg
 
In terms of the more color on some of the regulatory issues that we're 
dealing with, not much more color we can add other t
han to say our 
licensing model, as you know, has been in effect for quite a few decades. It's 
been modeled after others. Everybody in the industry follows the device
-
level licensing, for example. And we're very confident in the chances of 
trying to convinc
e regulators that this model has not only been effective, but 
has enhanced competition.
 
We have through our licensing model of sharing our intellectual property, I 
think we have broadened the field and our immense investment in research 
and 
development and the core technologies which we patent and then share 
I think has contributed to the growth of this industry. And hopefully, we will 
be able to demonstrate that as we go through these regulatory matters.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes fro
m line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go 
ahead.
 
RodHall
 
I got a couple. First one I wanted to ask you, you talked about 
--
 
you said 
less than 20 million catch
-
up units in the quarter. I wonder if you could talk 
a little bit about the potential timing of
 
catch
-
up in China and what the 
outstanding unit number looks like. We have our estimates, but it would be 
nice to get some indication from you guys. And then I also wanted to talk a 
little bit about QTC margins again. Two questions within that. One is, ca
n 
you give us some idea of what the fixed cost level there is? And should we 
be looking at fiscal Q1, fiscal Q2 and that margin move as some indication of 
where that number is?
 
The second question I had is those margins are pretty strong in Q1 and just 
won
dered if you could talk a little bit about what is going on underlying that 
since the mix was shifted to the low end. I would've thought that would drag 
margins down, but they were actually quite strong. So could you just 
comment on that? Thank you.
 
DerekA
berle
 
On the catch
-
up units and compliance, we've 
--
 
we gave some color on that 
in
--
 
for the full
-
year FY '15. And if you looked at the delta between what we 
gave as the global device sales and the reported device sales, it was about 
9% or $25 billion. So 
that was the range for 2015. For 2016, it's really going 
to be dependent, I think, highly on the timing of getting these additional 
agreements signed.
 
The underlying underreporting by licensees that have agreements, I would 
say has largely been in line ove
r the last couple of quarters. It's not 
materially improving or worsening; it's really been more the dynamic of the 
people that have withheld payment and reporting which will get resolved 
upon signing the agreement. So I think the rough
-
sizing that we gave
 
for 
2015 with that color hopefully will get you there.
 
GeorgeDavis
 
On Q1, I think one of the things that you saw was better performance by 
QCT, particularly on OpEx pulling in some of the cost savings earlier into the 
year which actually helped that margi
n and improved that margin relative to 
our expectations going into the quarter. I would say that some of that has 
narrowed. In terms of the OpEx improvement quarter over quarter, you're 
not getting quite the move.
 
So on lower revenue, OpEx as a percent of 
revenue is obviously going to 
weigh on the margin. And then of course, you just have the natural gross 
margin impact when you see a big seasonal adjustment in units and that's 
really what we're seeing. So nothing more than that and again, those things 
tend
 
to reverse themselves, as I said earlier, in the second half of the year.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Another question on the royalty rate, I just wanted to clar
ify again of the 
2.65% implied rate in the quarter, if you took out the one
-
off impacts like 
the catch
-
up of the China licensees as well as the LG, what would that 
number have been? And then once we get past the March quarter and that 
one
-
time $250 million
 
benefit from the infrastructure merger, did I 
understand you correctly that there is going to be a $100
-
million impact on 
the royalty rate collection on a go
-
forward basis past that? So effectively 
about a 15
-
basis
-
point hit to the implied rate? And then 
I have a follow
-
up.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So I think last quarter, basically what we said about the implied royalty rate 
for the year, we said, listen it's going to be highly dependent on the timing 
of signing up some of the new agreements in China and moving peopl
e over 
to the CPLA rates. But on balance, we expected it to be down modestly for 
the year. So I would say if you adjusted for the impact of the disputed 
revenue and the reported sales in the quarter that didn't have revenue 
coming along with it because of 
the catch
-
up units, we would be broadly in 
line with that.
 
You are correct, that once this amortization of the $100 million expires that 
will come out. We've talked about the fact that we have license fees and 
those are amortized over a period of time. So 
once those go way, that will 
become a drag. But that was anticipated. And so when we gave the color of 
what we expected the rate to do for the year with all of the moving pieces in 
mind, that was factored in.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Okay, so the clean rate for th
e quarter was something close to 3%. And then 
looking out a couple of quarters, like for like, it would come down to 
something like 2.8% once you remove the infrastructure amortization.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yes, that is generally correct. I would say that the seco
nd part of your 
question, it would imply no other changes. But we do think that there is 
some other things that could potentially play out throughout the year that 
would be a positive bias on the rate. So I think that's maybe the piece you're 
missing. But 
otherwise, I think that's generally right.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Okay, understood. And then just a quick separate question was on the 
comment about your server chips sampling with the tier
-
one hyperscale 
customers. When would you expect to see production volume
s? And when 
would you expect that to be something that can move the needle for QCT?
 
Derek Aberle
 
When we first started talking about this, we were pretty clear that we're 
going to be in investment mode for a period of time here before this 
becomes a meanin
gful contributor. We're very positive on the signs we're 
seeing, both in North America with the large cloud players, as well as in 
China. And so you'll start seeing some shipments within probably the next 
year or so. But really, when you think about it as 
a contributor, it's going to 
be out a few years.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and 
Company. Please go ahead.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
I had two the first one is on M&A. Obviously, you have a lot of offshore cash 
and I 
just wanted to get your opinion. I think that the TDK deal was great, 
but I wanted to get your opinion on maybe something bigger, some sort of 
transformational deal that maybe you could do in QCT. So, just wanted to 
get your general thoughts there.
 
Steve M
ollenkopf
 
Sure Timothy, it's Steve Mollenkopf. The way we think about it is we 
obviously have the ability to execute on something like that. We don't feel 
like there's really a gun to our had to be able to have to do it. We feel we 
have a good growth path.
 
But we're pleased to be able to return the cash 
that we have and will continue to do and have options to do that. As the 
industry consolidates, I think we're going to consider ourselves to be getting 
in a stronger position versus a weaker position to be a
ble to take advantage 
of that trends that I spoke about it my script. So, we feel like we're in a 
good spot, but we don't feel like we have to do something in order to grow.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
And then a question for George, on the 185 million MSMs in March, c
an you 
give maybe a sense in terms of how many of the new design wins for 820 
are included in that number? Or is that more of a June event? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
Yes, I can't give you the specifics too much on that. But what I can tell you 
is that we really
 
see the 820 as more of a second half. We certainly see that 
we'll be shipping some devices in the latter part of this quarter, but it's really 
going to be more evident in the second half of the year. And maybe 
Cristiano, I'll let you jump in on that. It's
 
--
 
we're seeing more 
--
 
it's more 
--
 
I would say Q2 is more of a strong season effect with an exaggerated effect, 
as I said in my prepared remarks, on thin modem.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Just one comment, I think it's very optimistic about the 820 design traction.
 
Right now, we're supporting key flagship designs through care 
recertification, then volume ramp will happen the second half of FY '16.

Your next question comes from line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch. Please go ahead.
 
Tal Liani
 
Just one clarification before my question, you said in response to what 
Simona asked you, you said that there are positives on the rate that could 
come through the rest of the year. Outside of LG coming back, is there any 
other positive on the royalty rate
 
that could 
--
 
any other positive that could 
impact the royalty rate? So that's question number one. Question number 
two is about the implications of 820 in the second half of the year. Can you 
discuss the implications on margins and the implications on AS
Ps? I think 
the ASPs are quite straightforward. But the question is, when you start 
ramping 820, does it have positive implications on margins right from the 
beginning? Or to the contrary, it has negative implications at first until you 
ramp to a certain l
evel or you expense certain expenses and only then it 
goes up? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
On your first question, there are couple of things. Really the primary positive 
driver would be OEM mix. So share gain by companies that are paying a 
higher 
running royalty rate than others and we think there is some potential 
for that as the year progresses.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
On the 820, I think as we said is the volume ramp is going to be in the 
second half of the year, that's where we go into mass production. 
But I think 
we feel pretty good about the 820 and the overall economics. I also think 
we're on, as we said, on a 14 LPP process node. Another thing to think about 
[indiscernible] the second half is, we're seeing increased design traction 
across all tiers, 
not only the 820, in particular in China because of the 
acceleration of LTE Advanced which is 4G plus and the all mode that was 
mentioned by Derek earlier.

Your next question comes from line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein 
Research. Please go ahead
.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
I have two, first on the chipset guide, I know you're pointing to a seasonal 
effect, obviously driven by 
--
 
exasperated by thin modems. At the same 
time, it's a 24% quarter
-
over quarter decline, 57 million units. I think this is 
your biggest
 
sequential chipset decline ever. Can you give us or at least help 
us parse out the impact of the seasonal effect? Is there any inventory 
flushing going on? Do you think this is a normal run rate exiting the quarter? 
How should we be thinking about those o
ther seasonal drivers impacting 
that guide? And for my second question, you have this $100 million license 
amortization rolling off. Do you have any other licensees with amortization 
that's rolling off, say within the next three years?
 
George Davis
 
Let me 
just respond to the chipset guide question. So I would say it, we're 
certainly seeing above normal seasonality in this quarter, in particular on the 
thin modem side. We have also seen some OEM mix in China having an 
effect. But I would say that is a deep t
hird effect to what is a seasonal first, 
above seasonal in modem and then some modest OEM mix where customers 
of ours are ceding some share to customers that use other devices.
 
Derek Aberle
 
On the amortization question, we have over the years done differen
t kinds of 
deals, some of which have license fees that are amortized over a period of 
time. And so there are things that come into the amortization and go out. 
That's just an ongoing basis, but beyond that, you saw an acceleration of 
$250 million of licens
e fees that would've been amortized over a longer 
period of time that will come in next quarter. And those are really the two 
that we're highlighting this time.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. 
Please go 
ahead.
 
Tavis McCourt
 
George, just to make sure I have 
--
 
the $250 million coming in, that is 
coming in through QTL, correct? And then, I think you mentioned in the 
prepared comments outside of the thin modem customer, I forget if the 
verbiage was you're se
eing some strength or least stability in emerging 
markets in your chipset business. That is not completely obvious to me why 
that should be typically in a strong dollar environment, handset sales can 
really get hurt in emerging market. So I'm wondering if 
you're just not 
seeing that yet? Or is there some channel inventory issues going on? Or 
perhaps some market share gains as we exited last year and enter this year. 
And then a final one for you, Steve, on the TDK joint venture. You 
mentioned gas PAs and was
n't sure if you were referring to having them 
sampling in FY '17? Or we should see those in commercial products in FY 
'17? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
So on the $250 million, that will be reported in QTL. In terms of what we're 
seeing in the channel, I would s
ay we're not seeing an unusual inventory 
build like we saw a couple of quarters ago, with the exception, like I said, 
we're probably seeing a stronger
-
than
-
normal seasonal pullback in thin 
modems. But that's really what I would say is more of the outlier f
or our 
quarter.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Just to add a comment, I think when you look at the Q2 $185 million 
midpoint of the guidance, I think what we said is the China was a very minor 
impact. It's not any unexpected design change. What it is the mix of OEMs in 
the
 
marketplace. We saw a slight increase of volume for an OEM that is not 
used in QCT as a vertical OEM in China, but I think it's very minor. The main 
thing really is seasonality and the thin modem demand adjustment.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve, just one
 
other additional thing. Really what's driving worldwide 
unit demand for the products is just the transition to 4G. So you're still only 
seeing what something like 14% of the market is using 4G now and that 
continues to be a positive trend for us across ti
ers. With respect to TDK, the 
TDK commentary and the gallium arsenide PAs, we will be in production in 
2017 and I think comfortably so. So we expect to see products in the market 
using those PAs in that timeframe.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from lin
e of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities, 
please go ahead.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
A couple of questions, first a clarification, George, on the annual guidance 
for licensing, I'm just curious if LG is impacting only $100 million or is it 
$100 million per quarter? And
 
then a follow
-
up to Steve's question or answer 
on the gas PA and TDK deal. Steve, obviously RF market in general has been 
growing very nicely over the past few years and some would argue that 
actually that market is slowing down now. It grew very nicely l
ast two years 
ago and it is beginning to slow down now. I'm just curious as to why the 
deal now? What do you see out there that gives you that this is the right 
time to invest more aggressively in this market?
 
George Davis
 
So the LG impact that we talked a
bout of over $100 million is a quarterly 
number, so the annual impact, of course, is going to be dependent on what 
their royalty obligation would be for the year, relative to the guidance range. 
It was not anticipated or included in the $7.3 billion to $8 
billion range. So it 
would be an adjustment to that and it really will be a function of when it is 
resolved as to what the potential impact would be until then.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
On the RF front
-
end business, I think it continues to be a very large TAM 
that
 
for us, we haven't been participating in outside really largely by our 
envelope tracking business. And like all of our RF businesses or analog 
businesses, they are actually, that's a good, profitable business. So our 
ability to grow that, even within that
 
TAM is, I think a good story for us. Our 
view of the market is that you're going to need to have all the pieces, filter, 
module, PA, base fans, switches to really be meaningful as a long term 
player.
 
And that that capability will continue to be important,
 
not only in the 
handset market, but also across all of the connectivity markets that open up 
as everything becomes connected and certainly in 5G. So we think that's a 
good set of assets. We will be able to grow that moving forward. We've got 
some executio
n to do to prove that. But we feel like we're getting the right 
pieces and we're going to make it happen.
 
Operator
 
Your final question comes from line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity. 
Please go ahead.
 
Edward Snyder
 
On the same theme on the RF, I think
 
you launched RF 360 in early 2013 
and now you've got the TDK [ph] relationship which expands upon that. 
Should we expect revenue from RF material to consolidate results in FY '17? 
Or is that something more of a 2018 event? And then with respect to the RF 
products you're selling now, do you anticipate that you'll be selling these RF 
modules into solutions that don't use your base 
--
 
obviously your solutions 
that do use base benefits, you would be a natural home for those. But do 
you think you are intending 
to reach beyond where you are, your baseband 
sockets wins move out to general markets? And then a follow
-
up if I could 
on makeshift in QCT
 
George Davis
 
We will consolidate as soon as we close the transaction, because we will 
have 51% and effective control 
from a reporting standpoint. In terms of 
supporting other devices and other customers, we would anticipate 
continuing to do that just as TDK does today.
 
Edward Snyder
 
Would this show up in one of the existing segments once the consolidated 
[indiscernible] 
are you considering breaking it out on its own group?
 
George Davis
 
It will be reported in QCT.
 
Edward Snyder
 
Okay. And finally, was the mix shift away from thin modems in the 
December period, was that a major component in this sequential increase in 
QCT 
margins? Or was it not really material?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
I think George answered that earlier. I think one of the things where we're 
ahead of the plan of delivering some of the cost savings that we had a part 
of our strategic realignment plan. I think that h
as been a key contributor of 
our stronger margin in Q1.

improving licensing in China. I look forward to the second half of the year as 
our new products ramp. I also want to remind everyone that we will hold our 
An
alyst Day in San Diego in two weeks, where we will go into more detail on

1/26/17,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with 

licensing business, we delivered record revenues of $26.5 billion and record 
non
-
GAAP earnings per share, up 17% 
versus last year.
 
Total reported device sales and MSM chipset shipments also set records, as 
our multimode 3G LTE and related technologies continue to enable the global 
growth of wireless data and our broad range of semiconductor solutions 
continue to be u
sed in leading devices across all price tiers globally. We 
increased our dividend for the 12th consecutive year and returned 
approximately $7.1 billion to stockholders in the form of buybacks and cash 
dividends.
 
Looking at the fourth fiscal quarter, we shi
pped a record number of MSMs, 
driven by broad
-
based demand for our 3G and multimode 3G/4G chipsets, 
particularly in emerging regions. We continue to benefit from our tiered 
roadmap and diversified customer base as MSM chip shipments were up 
24% year over y
ear.
 
QTL was in line with expectations, as we continue to work through the issues 
facing the licensing business. Eric will discuss this more fully and update you 
on the ongoing NDRC investigation.
 
We made significant progress against our strategic and oper
ational 
objectives this year. First, we set out to compete effectively across all tiers 
in LTE while driving the modem and AP roadmap to maintain our competitive 
lead. We are very pleased with our design activity in the premium tier, 
including the leading 
flagship devices.
 
The Snapdragon 805 is the first processor to offer system
-
level ultra HD 
support and 4K video capture and playback. In addition, our fourth 
generation modem, the Gobi 9x35, featuring CAT6 carrier aggregation, is 
now shipping.
 
Further, we 
introduced our new lower
-
cost architecture that debuted in the 
Snapdragon 410, which is now shipping in volume, and we recently 
announced the Snapdragon 210 processor, which will offer integrated 
multimode 3G/4G LTE and LTE dual sim for entry
-
level smartph
ones.
 
This effectively brings multimode LTE with carrier aggregation across all tiers 
of the roadmap. Second, we continue to focus our investments on adjacent 
opportunities that adopt our core technologies as well as technologies that 
address the 1000x dat
a challenge and drive IOE adoption.
 
Notable milestones this past year include the extension of our wifi solutions 
with a comprehensive set of products that use multiuser MIMO to make 
802.11 AC networks up to 3x faster and more efficient. Our overall wifi 
h
andset related revenues grew more than 40% in fiscal 2014.
 
We acquired Wilocity, a leader in the development of 60 GHz chipsets based 
on the IEEE 802.11 AD standard, which provides us with a technology to 
address high bandwidth use cases. We announced our 
second generation 
RF360 products and now have over 225 devices launched or in design that 
incorporate one or more of our RF3560 components.
 
On the automotive front, we have very strong design traction with our LTE 
solutions, and have announced our automoti
ve grade infotainment chipset, 
and we are now engaged with over 15 OEMs on 40 different programs.
 
We completed the sale of our Omnitracs business and restructured our 
Mirasol business. And finally, we recently announced our offer to acquire 
CSR, which woul
d complement our current offerings by adding products, 
channels, and customers in the important growth categories of IOE and 
automotive infotainment.
 
Third, we achieved our operating expense targets while continuing to invest 
in our leading roadmap and our
 
long term supply chain initiatives. We 
believe that we are operating at scale and have exited fiscal year 2014 at a 
lower level of R&D and SG&A spending than last year.
 
And finally, we committed to significantly increase our return of capital to 
stockhold
ers and finish the year well ahead of our target of returning 75% of 
free cash flow to stockholders.
 
Separately, as we note in the 10
-
K, two competition agencies have recently 
commenced investigations related to our licensing and/or our chipset 
businesses.
 
We are fully cooperating with these agencies and believe our 
practices comply with the laws of our countries, but given that these matters 
are in their early stages, it is difficult to predict what, if anything, will come 
of them.
 
Looking ahead, we have c
lear strategic priorities for fiscal 2015: resolve the 

tiers, further expand our business into adjacent and new growth 
opportunities, continue to manage operating expenses, and contin
ue to 
return capital to stockholders.
 
Our fiscal 2015 guidance reflects the following: continued healthy growth of 
global 3G/4G devices, particularly in emerging regions, at the mid and low 
tiers, which impact the financial outlook for both QTL and QCT; co
ntinued 
QTL challenges in China, coupled with increased spending on compliance and 
enforcement efforts by QTL; prioritize QTC R&D investments to maintain our 
leadership and balance our long term competitive roadmap with scale 
efficiencies to succeed across
 
all price tiers, particularly the rapidly growing 
lower cost segments in emerging regions; a reduction and refocusing of our 
spend outside of QTC and QTL to a smaller number of potentially larger 
opportunities; focused efforts on our expanded set of adjac
ent growth 
opportunities.
 
Key mobile technologies are increasingly becoming adopted into new 
categories, and we are well
-
positioned to use our design expertise in 
connectivity, compute, and other technologies to address these evolving 
opportunities.
 
Fundam
entally, our long term growth drivers remain on track and we are 
aligning our resources to continue to capture these opportunities. Gartner 
estimates that more than 8 billion smartphones will be sold over the next 
five year period through calendar 2018. Th
e installed base will reach 
approximately 4.4 billion, representing the largest technology platform on 
which to innovate and drive upgrade opportunities.
 
We believe the smartphone will be central to the growing number of 
connected things around us, and our
 
focus is on aligning our resources to 
continue to capture these opportunities. We will discuss the many growth 
opportunities that we see ahead and the strategies and actions we are 
pursuing to capitalize on them during our upcoming New York analyst day on
 
November 19, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
 
In conclusion, I would like to thank each of our employees and partners for 
their dedication, inventiveness, and leadership. Although our fiscal year 
2015 guidance reflects some challenges, the 
growth in global 3G/4G device 
demand remains strong, and our new opportunities are emerging.
 
In this environment, we remain well
-
positioned for long term growth while at 
the same time continuing to return significant amounts of capital to 
stockholders, con
sistent with our previous expectations.
 
That concludes my remarks, and I would now like to turn the call over to 

 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I would first like to provide 
an update on 
our view of global 3G/4G device demand for the remainder of 
calendar 2014 and 2015. As a reminder, global 3G/4G devices include not 
only those devices reported to us, but also our estimates of unreported and 
unlicensed device sales, but excludes TD
-
SCDMA d
evices that do not 
implement LTE.
 
Prior to calendar 2014, we believed that our estimates of global 3G/4G 
devices and reported 3G/4G devices were not materially different. Last 
quarter, however, we introduced the separate global and reported naming 
conventi
ons in light of the challenges we are experiencing in China.
 
We think it is important and helpful to discuss both global and reported 
3G/4G device estimates so that we can separately explain our views on our 
overall demand trends versus the portion of that
 
demand that we expect will 
be reported to us during the applicable periods.
 
We believe that global demand for 3G/4G devices continues to grow at a 
very healthy pace, particularly in the emerging regions at mid and low price 
tiers. The broad availability o
f compelling devices at these price tiers is 
driving demand for, and the migration to, 3G/4G devices.
 
Although we are not increasing our calendar 2014 global 3G/4G device 
shipment estimate at this time, we now have a positive bias to our prior 
estimate of approximately 1.3 billion units, up approximately 20% year over 
year.
 
As we explained last quarter, several factors primarily related to challenges 
in China are creating a divergence between our estimates of the global 
3G/4G device that I just 
explained, and what is being, and what we expect 
to be, reported to us in the near term.
 
We estimate that approximately 258 million 3G/4G devices were reported to 
us during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. For calendar year 2014, we 
continue to estimate 
reported 3G/4G devices will be in the range of 1.04 
billion to 1.13 billion units, which is approximately 215 million units below 
the global 3G/4G device estimate of approximately 1.3 billion units at the 
midpoint. This is in line with our prior expectatio
ns.
 
Look forward to calendar year 2015, we estimate global 3G/4G device 
shipments to be approximately 1.5 billion units, up approximately 15% year 
over year. Turning to 3G/4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices reported to 
QTL during the fourth quarter of fisc
al 2014 was $223 at the midpoint and 
$225 at the midpoint for the full fiscal 2014.
 
We estimate that the reported ASP for fiscal 2014 was approximately 6% 
higher than it would have been if the full global 3G/4G device demand had 
been reported to us during 
fiscal 2014, given that the ASP of the unreported 
units is estimated to be below the reported ASP.
 
We forecast that the global 3G/4G ASP will further decline by approximately 
9% to 10% in fiscal 2015. Although we forecasted a modest year over year 
decline 
in the global 3G/4G device ASP at the outset of fiscal 2014, the 
global 3G/4G device ASP decreased more than we expected in fiscal 2014, 
driven by accelerated migration from GSM and TD
-
SCDMA devices to low 
and midpriced 3G/4G smartphones in emerging region
s.
 
As price elasticity drives strong unit growth at lower tiers, we believe the 
total dollar amount of global 3G device sales grew by approximately 10% in 
fiscal 2014, despite the approximate 6% ASP decline at the midpoint, and 
we forecast approximately 7%
 
to 8% year over year growth of such sales 
again in fiscal 2015.
 
Beyond fiscal 2015, we expect further declines in the 3G/4G global ASP to 
moderate as the weighted impact of the factors that are driving the near 
term declines in ASP ease, and users in emer
ging regions trade up as they 
replace their low tier devices.
 
We will provide more detail on these trends during our upcoming analyst day 
in New York. I would now like to provide an update on the four issues 
impacting our licensing business in China that w
e discussed last quarter.
 
We are still in discussions with the licensee regarding a dispute that has 

our results. Like other disputes we have had in the past, we expect to 
resolv
e this situation in due course and have been making progress toward 
that end.
 
We now have signed more than 75 single mode LTE licenses with Chinese 
OEMs. Having said that, OEMs supplying a meaningful percentage of three
-
mode devices remain unlicensed. We r
emain in discussions with many of 
these OEMs, but the negotiations are being delayed, at least in part by the 
pending NDRC investigation. We also believe the volume of three
-
mode 
devices that will ship during calendar 2014 has increased from our prior 
expe
ctations.
 
Despite these near term challenges, we do expect to collect royalties over 
time on substantially all LTE device shipments, including three
-
mode devices 
sold in China. We continue to believe that some of our licensees are not 
reporting all of thei
r license shipments. We are engaged in conducting audits 
of these licensees and attempting to identify and resolve instances of 
underreporting.
 
Of course, if these efforts are unsuccessful, we are fully prepared to enforce 
our rights under our license agre
ement. We have also seen an increase in 
sales of lower tier 3G connected tablets by a number of Chinese OEMs, and 
we expect sales of these devices to continue to grow.
 
This is a good trend from a market growth perspective, but we still need to 
conclude lic
ense agreements with many of these tablet suppliers in order for 
QTL to participate in that growth. We are continuing to pursue licenses with 
this new base of potential licensees, but those discussions will take some 
time to complete, and the timing may be
 
impacted to some extent by the 
pending NDRC investigation.
 
As to the status of the NDRC investigation, we continue to meet with, and 
are fully cooperating with, the NDRC as it conducts its investigation and 
have discussed with the NDRC a number of proposa
ls for addressing its 
concerns. But the timing and outcome of any resolution remains uncertain, 
as does the potential impact of our future business in China.
 
We also believe that the timing of the resolution of some of our other 
challenges in China will be
 
impacted by the timing of the conclusion of the 
investigation. Bringing this matter to closure remains a top priority for the 
management team.
 
Given the difficulty in predicting the timing and impact of resolving our China 
challenges, our QTL outlook for 
fiscal 2015 incorporates a wide range of 
potential outcomes. The low end of our guidance reflects the status quo 
[unintelligible], relative to the four China issues I just covered, in other 
words, no material resolution or change to these items, and the hi
gh end of 
the range reflects more favorable outcomes with respect to several of the 
items.
 
Due to the uncertain timing and range of potential outcomes, the potential 
for higher than normal quarterly variation in our results is possible. We have 
widened our
 
guidance ranges as a result.
 
Finally, again it is important to remember that our forecast for reported 
TRDS units and ASPs reflect only that [unintelligible] 3G/4G device demand 
that we currently expect will be reported to us, and will therefore vary from
 
the global 3G/4G device metrics we have described.
 
Although QTL revenue growth may be muted to some extent, as we work to 
resolve the current challenges in China and global device ASPs are expected 
to decline during fiscal 2015 at a faster pace than in re
cent years, we still 
expect reasonable growth in global 3G/4G device sales driven by very strong 
unit growth.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to our chief 
financial officer, George Davis.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Derek, and good af
ternoon to everyone on the call. I will begin 
by covering our fiscal fourth quarter results, followed by a summary of fiscal 
year 2014 before discussing our outlook.
 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $6.7 billion, up 3% 
year over year,
 
and non
-
GAAP operating income was $2.3 billion, up 20% 
year over year. Non
-
GAAP earnings per share grew 20% year over year to 
$1.26.
 
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $57.4 billion, above 

eported ASP was $223 at the 
midpoint, and down $8 quarter over quarter.
 
QCT had record MSM shipments in the quarter, as forecasted, although the 
demand related to mid
-
tier chipsets was somewhat below our expectations. 
Implied revenue per MSM was down seque
ntially, reflecting an increased mix 
of thin modem chipsets in the premium tier.
 
QCT operating margin was 22%, achieving our target to exit fiscal 2014 
above 20%. Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were 5% lower 
sequentially, better than expected due 
to spending discipline across all 
businesses.
 
During the fiscal fourth quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to stockholders, 
including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and $1.2 billion in 
stock repurchases. As of the end of fiscal 2014, we had app
roximately $5.3 
billion remaining on our stock repurchase authorization.
 
Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion and 24% of revenues, and we 
ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $32 billion.
 
Turning to our results for fiscal 
2014, revenues were up 7% from last year, 
reflecting stronger than expected QCT shipments, partially offset by the 

division in the first fiscal quarter and the impact of the absence 
of this 
business was just over 1 percentage point on our growth rate on the year 
over year comparison.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating income was $8.9 billion, up 3% year over year, led by 
strong performance in QCT, partially offset by certain impairments and 
higher sp
end in our emerging businesses, reported in other.
 
Non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $5.27, up 17% year over year, led by 
QCT performance, along with the benefit of gains on rebalancing of our 
treasury portfolio and the positive net impacts of the gain on t
he sale of 
Omnitracs and the ParkerVision reversal, partially offset by the writedown of 
[QMT] assets.
 


87% 


 
Operating margin was 20%, and at the high end of our full year guidance 
range, overall, a very strong year for our QCT team, where 
product 
leadership across all tiers led the stronger than expected top and bottom line 
growth in an environment where we saw increasing margin compression, 
particularly in the mid and low tiers.
 
In fiscal 2014, we generated $8.9 billion in cash flow from o
perations, or 
34% of revenues. We exceeded our 75% of free cash flow commitment, 
returning approximately $7.1 billion or 93% of free cash flow to stockholders 
during the fiscal year.
 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2015, we estimate total Qualcomm 
f
iscal 2015 revenues to be in the range of approximately $26.8 billion to 
$28.8 billion, up 1% to 9% year over year. We expect QCT segment 
revenues to be in the range of $19.3 billion to $20.3 billion, up 6% year over 
year at the midpoint, and QTL segment r
evenues are expected to be in the 
range of $7.3 billion to $8.3 billion, up 3% year over year at the midpoint.
 
Our range for QTL is relatively wide, as it is difficult to forecast the timing 
and potential outcomes in China. We expect 2015 non
-
GAAP operatin
g 
income to be in the range of $9.2 billion to $10 billion, up 7.5% year over 
year at the midpoint.
 
Overall, non
-
GAAP operating profit is expected to grow modestly as a 
percent of revenue. We estimate fiscal 2015 QTL operating margin will be 
approximately 
85% to 86%. Consistent with the guidance provided over the 
past year, we estimate 2015 QCT operating margins will be in the range of 
18% to 20%.
 
We expect fiscal 2015 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 
$5.05 to $5.35, down modestly at the mi
dpoint versus fiscal 2014. Non
-
GAAP year over year EPS growth is expected to be impacted by the 
continuing challenges in QTL, lower QCT revenue per MSM and margin flow 
through, lower investment gains in our treasury portfolio, and to a lesser 
extent, negat
ive foreign exchange impacts.
 
Our estimate is that revenue per MSM will be modestly lower year over year, 
down 3% to 5%, as a result of continuing pricing pressure, product mix, and 
increasing competitive dynamics. Combined non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A 
expenses a
re expected to grow approximately 3% to 5% year over year, 
driven by continued investments in our multitiered chip roadmap and 
increasing compliance and enforcement initiatives in QTL.
 
We estimate our fiscal 2015 non
-
GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17%, 
higher year over year due to business mix, the absence of the federal R&D 
tax credit, and other unique items in 2014.
 
The impact from the potential CSR acquisition has been excluded from our 
fiscal 2015 forecast.
 
For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we es
timate revenues to be in the range 
of approximately $6.6 billion to $7.2 billion, up approximately 4% year over 
year at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal 
first quarter to be approximately $1.18 to $1.30 per share, down 2% 
year 
over year at the midpoint, as stronger chip performance is more than offset 
by the absence of favorable one
-
time items and lower licensing revenues 
related to China.
 
We anticipate first fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses will be up
 
5% to 6% sequentially, reflecting increased investment 

for the quarter will be in the range of $53 billion to $59 billion, as reported 
by our licensees in the December quarter for s
hipments they made in the 
September quarter.
 

competitive dynamics at the premium and high tier, and an increased mix of 
lower
-
priced handsets in emerging regions. In QCT, we anticipate MS
M 
shipments of approximately 250 million to 270 million units during the 
December quarter, up approximately 22% year over year at the midpoint 
and 10% sequentially.
 
We expect fiscal first quarter implied revenue per MSM to be down 
approximately 5% quarter 
over quarter and down approximately 10% year 
over year, reflecting a greater mix of thin modems and chipsets for lower 
cost smartphones.
 
That concludes my comments. I look forward to seeing many of you at the 

rther detail supporting our 

Warren.

Derek Aberle
 


relatively wide range on the QTL gui
dance given just the uncertainty on 

 

assuming probably more or less a status quo scenario on the four items that 
we discussed last quarter and updated you on 
today, and then towards the 
high end of the range would anticipate that we actually reach resolution at 
various points in the year on several of those items.
 
And certainly, part of that could include things like catch up payments, but 

ability adjusted set of assumptions that got us to this 
range.

the focus of a lot of our discussion in New York. But I do think, as you look 

ine was impacted by what QTL experienced. They 
were flat year over year as opposed to growing with the market. And with

far as 


mean that if it were in fact to happen, that you could actually exceed the 
high end of the range. Jus

that would, I think, be helpful.
 
And then back on QCT, maybe broader question for the team. Just 

demand for chips in China, wit

relationship there and margins at all. And finally, just last question, can you 
just, a couple of comments on the new EC and FTC investigations might be 
useful as well.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Just let me clarify on the r
ange. So what I was saying is the low end of the 


 

nd also the 
estimates on the September quarter sales. As I mentioned in my comments, 



ngs, that would get you to the low end of the range.
 
The high end of the range basically includes assumptions that several of the 
items would either be resolved or get better for us. And to be clear, the 
midpoint is basically sort of a probability adjusted
 
version of several different 
scenarios that kind of put you in the middle.

situation, but I think the team has done a good job really separating the 
issues b
etween the product side and the licensing side. And I would 

bit more three mode than five mode, which is really a mix statement relative 
to what we would have thought a year ag

in the K what we can say th
ere, both very early stage. The E.U. relates to, 
as far as we can tell, the chip business and the FTC relates to, as far as we

QTL, maybe on the ASP front, one, on t
he high end, the high tier market, 
with Apple in a strong product cycle, and our surveys and work show them 
taking share from high end Android, how much does that impact your ASP 
outlook?
 
And then second, assuming a lower mix of these emerging market units
 
for 
the underreporting, if that could help the ASPs. And then thirdly, if some FX 
headwinds that could hurt Qualcomm. So how much of those factors may be 
impacting your ASP outlook, or is it more just the mix that is leading to the 
ASP outlook?
 
Derek Aber
le
 
I would say sort of elements of all of those things are kind of embedded in 
our guidance. You probably noticed that unlike prior years, where we gave a 
fiscal year ASP range, this year we decided to just give a new metric, which 
is the all
-
in TRDS. Beca
use given the uncertainty in the timing of some of 
these resolutions, and in addition to the normal market dynamics that we 
need to forecast, trying to give a meaningful range on the ASP was pretty 
difficult.
 
For example, if we get the dispute resolved and
 
some of these 
underreporting issues resolved, and that comes with it catch up units that 


depending on what
 
comes out.
 
But yes, certainly as OEM share ships around at the high tier, that can 

do anticipate, both from a reported and kind of a global market dynamic, 
that the emerging marke
t units will be an increasing portion of the units sold 
in 2015 compared to 2014.

Just first on QTL, the step off in the device ASPs, how much does the three
-
mode have to do with that, and just any expectation on the mix between 
five
-
mode and thre
e
-
mode next year. And then George, just on the opex 


change as the top line seemingly is a little weaker.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yeah, so if you look at kind of what we referred to as the global ASP, if all 
the units have been reported to us this year, really a big part of the year 
over year decline is driven by growth in China, and in particular three
-
mode 
and Chinese
 
OEMs I think gaining share over non
-

big part, coupled with strong unit growth in other emerging regions as well.
 
I think we see similar dynamics playing out as we go from 2014 to 2015. 
Throughout the course of this year, the perc
entage of three
-
mode devices 

-
mode has really continued to 
shift over time to more a three
-
mode. And we expect that will probably 
continue at least into 2015 as well.
 
George Davis
 
On opex, we are slowing the growth
 
of opex. Last year we had forecasted

First, on the back to the long term growth rate, obviously the QTL, you are 
the market there, so single digit growth there is probably a given. But on th
e 


integration of functionality like wifi and RF360. So how do those two things 
play into the overall growth ra
te of QCT?
 
Second, Steve, if you could talk about LTE competition, how you see that 
evolving as we move into next year. And then finally, given you have a 
couple of investigations going on, what are you assuming in your guidance 
relative to legal expense. 
Is it kind of the midrange, or is it high or low? 
Could you give some measure of that? That would be great. Thank you.

our long term model. We had a very strong 2

bit of a mix issue now in 2015, but still consistent with our long term. 
Remember, we had a really strong 2014, I think is important to remember.
 
Long term, I think all the growth vectors that we talked about that you 
men
tioned, integration, a bunch of adjacent markets, just continual, actually 
even improvement of our cost structure, which we continue to focus on, 
contribute to that.
 


 
bit weaker market from a mix perspective here sequentially in

The concept of three
-
mode ver
sus five
-
mode comes up a lot in conversation, 
and you mentioned it today as well. Can you just give us a sense, in both 
modes, you have LTE. In three
-
mode you have TD
-
LTE and five
-
mode you 
have both TD and FD LTE. For you, is there a distinction between th
e two? Is 
there any reason we should be seeing a distinction between the two?
 
Have any vendors or any carriers or anyone been able to make a distinction 
between the two that you can discern? Is there a reason that the royalties 
you eventually get on three
-
mode would be different from five
-
mode, as a 
percentage, other than the fact that three
-
mode will most likely have a lower 
ASP.
 
If we can just kind of understand. I was always under the impression that 
LTE was LTE was LTE, so if you can kind of clarify tha
t a little bit, as well as 
this large licensee that seems to be making a distinction between a portion 

distinction between three
-
mode and five
-
mode?
 
And then I just want a 
clarification, when you said the 9% to 10% ASP, that 
was including China, I assume, and the 1.5 billion units. If we exclude China, 

right now going to be looking at going forward, as 
opposed to hoping this 
thing gets resolved issue?
 
Derek Aberle
 
The three
-
mode versus five
-
mode question, just to clarify. So three
-
mode, 
when we use that term, refers to devices that have GSM, TD
-
SCDMA, and 
TD LTE. And five
-
mode is both flavors of LTE as w
ell as GSM and WCDMA. 
And so when you think about the five
-
mode devices, those are essentially 

need to go out for us and sign up new agreements to cover those products.
 
The three
-
mode

in many cases, either companies did not take licenses for TD
-
SCDMA or as 

TD
-
SCDMA.
 
So as they roll those TD
-
SCDMA devi
ces to include LTE, we believe that 
really puts us in the position to collect royalties on all of the formerly TD
-
SCDMA volume. So in many cases, that requires us to actually negotiate and 

ll hear 
us refer to as LTE only or single mode LTE agreements.
 
Really, from an OEM perspective, we did have some concerns a while back 

TDD, similar to TD
-

eing that to be a big issue. 

 


negotiations, primarily around th
e timing of the NDRC resolution.
 

in too much detail, other than to say it is really the underreporting aspect of 

ally a 

just have companies taking position under the agreement in terms of what 

to be engaged with that parti
cular licensee, and are trying to make progress 
towards a resolution.
 
On the ASP, when I referred to the 9% to 10% estimated year over year 
decline, that was referring to the global ASP, which is sort of the all
-
in 
number that would include China. Yes, if 
you extracted out China, we would 

to provide guidance at this point on the fiscal year reported ASP. Instead, we 
gave you the TRDS range for fiscal 2015.

implied that the shortfall, a significant part was just this one licensee, and 
the re
st of it was a bunch of underreporting. My question is what other 
remedies are possible for the licensee that you had? Because you obviously 
have or had an agreement with them, and they just suddenly stopped 
paying. And I would have thought that that would
 
leave us there to bring 
that to some sort of close quite quickly. And what I was thinking of it, these 
other underreporting vendors is just much more complicated. Is that the 
right way of thinking of it? Or is this whole thing very uncertain?
 
Then for Ste
ve, my question is despite the cash that you guys did pay out, 


-
odd billion cash on your 

s LTE position and their 

shareholder returns?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Let me try to kind of step through this. Remember, we gave a range last 
quarter. It was relatively wide, of potential
 
units that would not be reported 
to us for calendar 2014, and the midpoint of that estimate was about 215 
million units. And as we explained, that was made up of four elements. One 
of them was the dispute that you mentioned. Another was underreporting by 
licensees. A third was the unlicensed three
-
mode activity in China, and the 
fourth were these white box tablets.
 
And the white box tablets, although also meaningful, are probably the 

e 
composition of what made up the 215. So I just wanted to clarify that.
 
The dispute that we have currently with the licensee does involve a company 
that has an existing license agreement. And so our typical process, when we 
have these types of disputes, a
s you probably recall from years earlier, is 
our first and preferred approach is to try to engage with the licensee and 

going
 
through right now.
 

t in the past, but from time to time, that 

which is typically seeking to enforce your rights under the agreement, which 
would either be in litigation or in arbitration, and you mi
ght recall for 
instance the arbitration that we had with Panasonic a few years back. That 
resolved quite favorably for us.

dispute resolution procedures, 



that will ultimately happen without the need for some other mechanism to 
resolve it. But those do take some time. Even when you resort to the 

 

can just do overnight.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
I think the way you characterized our view of the business is consistent with 
our view. That being said, I think we talked about last fiscal year about how 
we incre
ased our capital structure commitment to return 75% of free cash 
flow to the shareholders. Given our split of offshore and onshore balances 
and kind of the future view of what might happen with tax reform, we think 


about that, and also provide our own perspective of that again in New York.

the majority of these 80 million to 90 million handsets wil
l be paying 

-

that are supposed to pay royalties.
 

more about the Chinese not willing to pay you, period,
 
and there is 

also for the exports, not just for the imports. So can you discuss this? What 
suddenly prompts this, after they paid for so many years according to the 
plan?
 
And the second question is about R&D. You referred to opex before, but 
R&D, if I look at the last five, six quarters, R&D, the growth rate had been 
constantly down from 36% year over year to 11% the previous two 

t is the outlook for R&D, and 
how do you manage to maintain the leadership with R&D only growing 1% 
year over year?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Just to clear up maybe the potential confusion there, last quarter when we 

activity and underreporting 

to a particular technology. So I think we were pretty clear that the three
-
mode was sort of a unique issue that was a combination of probably 
under
reporting and unlicensed activity.
 
But the underreporting itself, given the magnitude of the 215 million unit 
midpoint we talked about included more than just LTE. It was across 3G as 

include 
sales by Chinese OEMs that would be for export outside of China to some of 
the other emerging regions. So I think when you go back and maybe look at 
your numbers in that context, hopefully things will make a little more sense.
 
In terms of timing, r
eally, I think you can think about this from a couple of 

a situation where product begins to ship before you can finally get 
agreements in place, so they come usually closer 
to the time of shipments. 

-
mode is a bigger issue for us right now than the 
five
-
mode or other 3G devices.
 


e obviously working very 



t
erms of thinking that they can get away with not reporting all of the activity 

 


good
 

little bit differently than we have in the past, just given where we are in our 

a little further down the 

things change.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 


that is just timing of ce
rtain activities within the programs, but if you look at 
the full year of 2014, where we had a little more front end loading, we grew 
R&D at about 3 points higher than the top line rate of the company. If you 
look back over five years, R&D as a percent of 
revenues is about 18%, and

e guidance next quarter, 


TRDS goes down year over year, which implies something must be going on 
in the r
est of the business. So can you tell us about how you see the rest of 
the business trending ex
-
China?
 


driving that?
 
Thirdly, with the issues signing these China guys to three
-
mode licenses, I 

have agreements. So if they continue to refuse to sign, what are your 
options? Do you have to go into 
China and make the explicit decision to sue 
them for patent infringement?
 
Derek Aberle
 
I think the first question was from a reported TRDS year over year. When 
you look at the numbers, that appears to be down. I think actually the 
midpoint would be up year
 
over year, about 5%. So you should probably 

 
Steven Mollenkopf
 

one of the reasons why we gave a range 
of what the top line for QTL would 

saying TRDS up 5% on FY 2015 guidance.
 
And again, I would say to draw a straight line between that and saying 



 
Derek Aberle
 
And then I guess on the last question, about three
-
mode, really I think 

-
plus companie
s that have already 
signed agreements for three
-
mode in China. So obviously the way that we 
would ensure payment and compliance on those companies would be 

 

tors involved in terms of if we run into 
problems getting companies to actually sign agreements for three
-
mode. 
And one of the potential actions would be to assert patents against them in 
China. There certainly are other avenues at our disposal as well, in
 
particular, as these companies continue to grow their businesses and their 
aspirations outside of China as well.

First of all from me, t
he guidance takes into account the issues in China, but 
can you assess the potential for the new FTC and the E.U. investigations to 
maybe add some risk to the low end of the guidance? And then secondly, 
are the new FTC and E.U. investigations fully indepen
dent from the NDRC 
issues? Because it seems like in some other situations that the various 

wondering if one can be resolved totally separately from the other two.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
The 
first question was in terms of the impact. Look, these are investigations 
that, as I said, are very preliminary. As you know from our experience and 
other experiences in the past, these take some time. As I said, these are 
informational at the moment. So t



not going to be a short term kind of impact.
 
Derek Aberle
 
I 
think if you look back historically, we obviously had an investigation in 
Europe and in Korea previously. The European investigation went on for four 
years and ultimately resulted in no findings or actual complaints against us. 
Korea, that was a multiyear 
process as well.
 

investigation by one competition agency, that potentially others might 
become interested and ask for information, but the regulatory regimes and 
the legal process
es in each country are quite different, and in particular 
quite different than China.

cer, Steve 
Mollenkopf.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to 
report strong results in the first fiscal quarter with non
-
GAAP earnings of 
$0.99 per share, above the high end of our guidance range, led by stren
gth 
in our chip business. We're also pleased to see strong year
-
over
-
year 
revenue growth in our licensing business.
 
As you can see from our strong results, our business reached a key inflection 
point exiting fiscal Q1, demonstrating the positive financial 
impact of our 5G 
strategy to grow our addressable dollar content per device with higher
-
performing core chipsets and new RF front
-
end content. Virtually all of our 
5G Snapdragon design wins are using our RF front
-
end solutions for 5G sub 
6 and/or millimete
r wave, including design wins based on our second
-
generation solutions.
 
As we continue to execute on our RF front
-
end strategy, we are pleased to 
see our RF design win pipeline contribute to the strength of our quarterly 
results and our outlook. We are in 
a strong position with leading technology 
and intellectual property and the best products in the company's history. Our 
5G roadmap extends beyond release '17, placing us on the cusp of a multi
-
decade mobile transformation as 5G increasingly becomes the fou
ndation for 
the digital transformation of industries beyond smartphones.
 
Turning to QTL, we have now signed over 85 G license agreements up from 
75 license agreements last November. Most recently, we signed extensions 
with 2 key Chinese OEMs through the en
d of March as we work to complete 
long
-
term 5G license agreements.
 
Let me now spend some time updating you on 5G traction globally. As we 
start the year, there are over 345 operators in nearly 120 countries, 
investing in 5G, including 45 operators in over 
20 countries that have 
launched commercial 5G services, spanning both the sub
-
6 and millimeter 
wave spectrum. Looking forward, we continue to expect millimeter wave to 
be deployed in all regions.
 
Additionally, more than 45 OEMs have launched or announced c
ommercial 
5G devices, many of which are using our Snapdragon 5G platforms. On the 
product side, we recently introduced our flagship Snapdragon 865 mobile 
platform that we expect will power many premium tier Android smartphones 
this year. We also introduced
 
the Snapdragon 765 and 765 Gaming Mobile 
platforms with an integrated 5G modem.
 
With over 275 5G devices announced or in development, spanning multiple 
price tiers, our product offerings will help make 5G more accessible to 
consumers. We also expanded our
 
4G lineup with new mobile platforms that 
enable our partners to offer sophisticated solutions that meet global 4G 
demand, particularly in emerging economies across multiple tiers and price 
segments.
 
Turning to Korea, last December, all three Korean operat
ors combined 
reported approximately 4.7 million 5G subscribers and are forecasting 
continued growth throughout calendar year 2020. We see Korea as a leading 
indicator for the pace of 5G adoption. Of note, the expected 5G subscriber 
growth is not just isola
ted to the sub
-
6 frequency bands. Carriers are 
planning millimeter wave service in 2020.
 
Turning to China, 5G device sell in increased through December. The China 
Academy of Telecommunication Research reported sell
-
in of 13 million 5G 
handsets in calendar 
Q4 2019. Importantly, 5G handset sell
-
in penetration 
reached 19% in December 2019. We are already seeing devices priced as 
low as RMB 2,000 or approximately USD 285 million. At this point, 5G can 
address approximately 40% of domestic China smartphone sales
.
 
In the U.S., the 5G network build
-
out is progressing well at the top 4 
carriers across sub
-
6 and millimeter wave spectrum. Verizon is leading the 
deployment of enhanced mobile broadband with millimeter wave service in 
31 cities and is expanding their dev
ice roadmap to approximately 20 new 5G 
products this year.
 
T
-
Mobile's 5G network now covers more than 200 million people and more 
than 1 million square miles across the United States. AT&T expects to have 
nationwide 5G coverage by calendar Q2. And Sprint e
xpanded their 5G 
network coverage to 9 metropolitan areas.
 
I would also like to highlight two recent developments on spectrum in the 
United States that will help drive even greater momentum for 5G. First, the 
FCC gave final approval for commercial use of t
he CBRS band, taking 
advantage of spectrum sharing techniques that we and others in the 
industry began working on years ago. The CBRS band is well suited for 
enterprise, smart city and industrial IoT deployments.
 
And second, the FCC's latest millimeter wav
e auction which includes the 
largest amount of millimeter wave spectrum ever up for bid in an auction, is 
ongoing and will bring up to 3.4 gigahertz of additional millimeter wave 
spectrum to the U.S. market.
 
Turning to automotive, as a measure of our conti
nued automotive success, 
our design win pipeline is now over $7 billion, up from $5.5 billion a year 
ago, which does not include any impact from our recently launched 
autonomous driving platform, Snapdragon Ride. We continued to benefit 
from our systems le
vel expertise, expanding our automotive solutions to 
include an autonomous driving platform, Snapdragon Ride.
 
With a long history of automotive innovation, we now 
--
 
we have now 
become a trusted adviser to many of the world's leading automakers. Over 
125 m
illion vehicles use our broad range of automotive solutions, including 
telematics, in
-
car connectivity and infotainment platforms.
 
Our Snapdragon Ride ADAS platform represents a significant expansion of 
our addressable market. We look forward to seeing our
 
Snapdragon Ride 
ADAS and autonomous solutions on the road in 2023.
 
We are very pleased with the FCC's unanimous vote in December to move 
forward with allocating spectrum in the 5.9 gigahertz band for cellular 
vehicle to everything technology. Since that v
ote, we are seeing traction for 
cellular V2x in the 5.9 gigahertz band across regions. Looking forward, we 
continue to remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in IoT, always 
connected PCs and cloud AI.
 
Lastly, as the coronavirus situation continue
s to unfold. Our thoughts are 
with the many Qualcomm employees in China, our customers and suppliers, 
their families, as well as those who are impacted by this unprecedented 
situation. As Akash will share with you, we have considered the impact of 
the coro
navirus in our forward guidance based on the limited information we 
have at this time.
 
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a 
discussion of first fiscal 
quarter earnings. Our results demonstrated strong 
execution with revenues of $5.1 billion at the high end of our guidance range 
and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.99, $0.14 above the midpoint of our 
guidance.
 
The outperformance in the quarter was driven
 
by strength in QCT across 5G, 
RF front
-
end and adjacent platforms with revenues of $3.6 billion, an 
EBITDA margin of 13%, which was above the high end of our guidance 
range.
 
MSM shipments of 155 million units were consistent with the midpoint of our 
guida
nce. QTL delivered revenues of $1.4 billion, a 38% increase year
-
over
-
year and EBIT margins of 72%, reflecting the benefit of a seasonally high 
quarter. We returned approximately $1.5 billion to stockholders during the 
quarter, consisting of $710 million i
n dividends and $762 million in stock 
repurchases..
 
With that, I'd like to turn to our global 3G/4G/5G device forecast. We 
continue to expect approximately 1.75 billion devices for calendar 2019. Our 
forecast for calendar 2020 remains unchanged at 1.75 bil
lion to 1.85 billion 
devices, including 175 million to 225 million 5G devices. This forecast 
continues to reflect flat handsets and low double
-
digit growth in non
-
handsets.
 
Now let me walk you through our financial guidance. For our second fiscal 
quarter g
uidance, we are estimating revenues to be in the range of $4.9 
billion to $5.7 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.95. 
There is significant uncertainty around the impact from the coronavirus on 
handset demand and supply chain. Based on t
he information we have at this 
time, we are widening and reducing the low end of our guidance range. We 
remain in active contact with our employees, customers and suppliers as we 
continue to monitor the situation.
 
In QCT, we expect second fiscal quarter re
venues of $3.9 billion to $4.5 
billion, an EBIT margin of 15% to 17%. The midpoint of our revenue 
guidance represents approximately 16% growth sequentially.
 
We estimate MSM shipments of 125 million to 145 million units, a 13% 
sequential decline at the midp
oint. This trend is consistent with historical 
seasonality and reflects the latest demand signals from our customers. 
Sequentially, we expect revenue per MSM to be meaningfully higher, 
reflecting increased content with 5G device launches in addition to nor
mal 
seasonal mix shift towards higher tier chipsets.
 
Our guidance includes a greater than 50% increase in RF front
-
end revenues 
in the second fiscal quarter on both a year
-
over
-
year and sequential basis.
 
For QTL, we estimate second fiscal quarter revenues 
to be in the range of $1 
billion to $1.2 billion with EBITDA margins of 61% to 65%. We anticipate 
second fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be up 
5% to 7% sequentially due to normal seasonality.
 
Looking forward, we continue to see tw
o inflection points in fiscal 2020. The 
strength in the first half of the fiscal year reflects the first inflection point on 
the acceleration of 5G demand. We expect our third fiscal quarter 
performance to be in line with our second fiscal quarter, consist
ent with 
historical trends in our QCT business. We expect the next inflection point 
with the launch of additional 5G flagship handsets to be in the fourth quarter 
and extend into fiscal 2021.
 
In conclusion, we remain confident in the long
-
term growth oppor
tunities we 
outlined at our Analyst Day, including 5G adoption, RF front
-
end content 
capture and expansion of our technology into adjacent platforms.
 
Thank you and I will now turn the call back to Mauricio.

Thank you, Akash. Operator

Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
So if I can just start off on the guidance itself and you mentioned kind of the 
seasonal decline in some unit shipments. So just wondering if you can walk 
us through the ki
nd of sequential move from the 155 million unit shipments 
you had this quarter to the new range of $125 million to $145 million. How 
much of that is seasonality and what are you really factoring in terms of the 
kind of budgeting for the virus impact? And w
hat you're hearing from OEMs 
in terms of delays that might be impacting that range that you're guiding to?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Samik, this is Akash. So if you take the midpoint of our guidance range and 
look at the sequential decline, it's approximately a 13%
 
decline. And if you 
consider the seasonality in previous years, we've seen a decline of 16% to 
22%. So it's largely consistent with the sequential decline we have seen in 
the past. So that's kind of your question on seasonality. This also 
--
 
our 
forecast 
also reflects the demand that we currently have from our OEM 
partners. And so that's 
--
 
it's also consistent with the demand we're seeing 
at this point.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Okay. And then if I can just follow
-
up on the ASP ramp here. So if you take 
the guidan
ce that you have, the average ASP seems to ramp up sequentially 
from $23 on the MSM unit to $31. I'm just wondering if you 
--
 
that's already 
a 23% sequential increase, if you're doing the math right. Just wondering if 
you can share your thoughts about what
 
that ASP ramp looks like because it 
sounded like you're expecting more RF content to come through later half of 
the year?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. Samik, yes, you're doing the math right, it's consistent with our view. 
Really, there are 3 drivers to the ASP 
increase. First is our normal sequential 
increase because of the benefit of the mix improved. What happens is we 
launched our new premium tier and high tier chip during this time frame and 
new devices are launched with it. And so you see a mix shift to pre
mium and 
high tiers, which benefits us. So that's the first driver.
 
The second driver is with 5G coming in, the transition from 4G to 5G, it gives 
us an opportunity to increase the content in the core chipset before RF front 
end. And so you have incrementa
l monetization from that. And then finally, 
RF front
-
end also impacting that because we have, as we've talked about, 
we have a very strong design win pipeline, not just on the core chipset, but 
on RF front end as well. And now that is being reflected in ou
r guidance.
 
I'd also note that in my script, I went through 
--
 
I provided a data point on 
RF front
-
end revenue growth. So we're seeing 50% 
--
 
greater than 50% 
revenue growth in RF front end both on a sequential basis, so first quarter to 
second quarter, an
d a year
-
over
-
year basis. So it's our design win pipeline 
going up and the revenue and the forecast now.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Great. Yes, just building on some of those questions. I 
guess, first, maybe 
for Cristiano. Can you update us on the competitive environment for 5G, 
particularly on the Android side? How do you see 5G ramps potential 
Qualcomm share improving over the course of the year? And with the x55 
coming, how should that a
lso maybe impact share and ASP trends?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Mike, thanks for the question. So there's a lot there. Let me just talk a little 
bit about the ramp and the impact on the new chipset. So we said in our 
script that the number of designs on 5Gs are now 
275. 2/3 of that design 
pipeline now is on our second
-
generation chipset. So we continue to see 
traction especially as we go from our first 5G product or second product that 
is increasing. And in that traction, we continue to see the trend of high RF 
front
 
end attached on Snapdragon.
 
Competition, we expect to have competition since the very beginning. This is 
a very competitive market. However, we're not seeing anything on 
competition different than what we expected in our planning assumptions. 
So we expect
 
QCT share to remain strong. We have made assumptions on 
--
 
throughout the year, that it is consistent to what we have seen in the 
market, and there's nothing new there.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Great. And just a follow
-
up for clarification with the ramp laid out in t
he 
guidance on Q4, is that also an ASP ramp coming again on better 5G mix? 
Or is it more towards a unit ramp? Obviously, new customer, Apple coming 
back into the model and just more seasonal trends, can you help us think 
about what kind of ramp on those 2 
metrics? That would be great.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Yes. So on the ASP side, the way we think about ASP is a factor of 
--
 
a 
combination of a couple of factors. One is just as we go from 4G to 5G, 
we've talked about how we expect the revenue opportunity for us to 
expand 
by 1.5x between the core chipset and the RF front end. But then also, as we 
go across the tiers, down the tiers, starting with the premium and high tier, 
but then eventually going into mid
-
tier later in the year as well with 5G, the 
combination of t
hose factors will inform the average revenue per MSM.
 
And then for later flagship launches that happened in the fall time frame. 
Again, it will 
--
 
kind of the same 1.5x rule should apply as we go from 4G to 
5G, and it's really a question of how the mix pla
ys out across the tiers and 
the OEMs that drives the weighted average ASP.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.
 
Chris Caso
 
Just first question is just a clarification of what you guided to for the third 
fiscal quarter. And y
ou said the performance to be in line with the second 
fiscal quarter. Just give some more color around that, is that with regard to 
QCT, QTL together? Is that simply referring to revenue? Is that a margin 
assumption as well?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So I mean
, the way we think about the year, Chris, it's kind of playing 
out largely as we had expected. In the last call, we outlined that we saw a 
couple of inflection points through the year, kind of both in the first half of 
the year and then in the fourth quart
er. And our view kind of hasn't 
changed. We've seen a little bit of an acceleration in 5G deployment which 
shows up in our results for the quarter and the guidance. And beyond that, 
as you go from second quarter to third quarter, it just plays to the norma
l 
seasonality of our businesses.
 
Chris Caso
 
All right. And with regard to QCT now. Just a couple of questions there. With 
regard to the MSM guidance for the March quarter. Of the 135 million 
midpoint units, how many of those are 5G now? Can you give us som
e sense 
of how, I guess, the 5G penetration into the product line right now and then 
following from that, with the big jump that you've had in ASPs for all the 
reasons that you mentioned.
 
Is that something we should expect to be sustainable through the yea
r? 
Perhaps, does it get better as 5G attach rates increase? Is there perhaps 
some natural ASP declines as products mature? Could you give us some 
sense of how that progresses through the year?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So Chris, this is Akash. We're not breaki
ng down our 5G units at this 
point as a percent of our total MSM units. But the way to think about that 
number is really look at new handset launches. That launches that will 
happen in the quarter and over the next 6 months. And those where we 
expect prima
rily to be, at the premium and the high tier, mostly be 5G 
launches. And so the volume driven by those launches would be 5G.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Chris, this is Cristiano, just to add a data point maybe it will help to get to 
the answer. If you look at markets s
uch as United States, I think the device 
requirements where they move on some of all the flagships and the high tier 
products, they are 5G products today. But the China one is an interesting 
one we said in the script, which is 5G sell
-
in penetration reache
d 19% the 
month of December. And some of the price points already can address about 
40% of the total China market based on the price points we see in the 
market. So all of this is good indicator about the 5G transition.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes fro
m the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein 
Research.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
I was wondering if 
--
 
I want to ask the coronavirus question a little more 
explicitly. What was your QCT MSM guide be for Q2 if you weren't baking in 
any coronavirus?
 
Akash 
Palkhiwala
 
So Stacy, what we are factoring into our guidance is really looking at the 
demand that we have from the customers and the information we have from 
them. When you look at 
--
 
on the MSM side, when you look at the overall 
EPS guidance, as you're aw
are, we typically guide a $0.10 range. And what 
we did to include the impact of the viruses to reduce the bottom end of the 
range by $0.05 to reflect the information we have at this point. But it's really 
something that we're going to continue to monitor a
s we go forward.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. For my follow
-
up, I want to ask about QCT pricing and margins into 
Q2. So you're guiding revenue per MSM up 33%, give or take, sequentially. 
And I get that. Why are you guiding chipset margins only up a few points, 
lik
e 3 points. Like, what are the gross margins of these 5G parts look like? Is 
there like a headwind there? Or is there something else that's going on with 
the remainder of like 4G pricing as that flushes out? I guess, I would have 
expected more margin upsid
e given that share of magnitude of ASP upside? 
What's going on there?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, Stacy, it's Akash again. I think the numbers we gave out are actually 
very consistent with what we had outlined at previous earnings release. We 
had indicated a mid
-
teens growth in revenue and a mid
-
teens margin profile. 
And we're guiding 15% to 17%.
 
I mean, as you know well, it's a combination of this total units, the pricing 
environment and then 
--
 
and the profitability around it. And it's very 
consistent with our 
expectations.

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Seymore
 
I wanted to stick on the theme of the revenue per MSM side, but maybe take 
a slightly different spin to it. You guys always do a great job of explaining in 
de
tail what the revenue per MSM assumptions are and then you tie it 
together to the EBT margins. But I wanted to see just conceptually going 
forward, if the AP side or the revenue per MSM is the most powerful driver of 
the business, is that accretive to the 
gross margin side?
 
And I guess, somewhat similar to Stacy's question, is there something 
detrimental to the gross margin side that's capping how much the operating 
margin would otherwise go up? Because I would think the ASPs or the 
content going up that mu
ch would be a very accretive outcome for you?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Ross, so it's a combination of a couple of things. I think as we see more 
percent of our devices move to 5G, we're going to see a benefit not just on 
the revenue per MSM, but also in the operat
ing margin. The second is we're 
going across tiers. And so as we go across tiers and we have a second 
inflection point, that will further expand the scale of the 5G opportunity for 
us.
 
As we outlined at the Analyst Day, we definitely expect to realize the 
operating leverage from the investment in 5G. And so as we go forward, 
we'll continue to see, as we had 
--
 
especially as we hit the second inflection 
point later in the year, expansion in our operating margins.
 
Ross Seymore
 
I guess as my 1 follow
-
up, movin
g over to the QTL side of things. I think 
Steve said earlier that you had 10 new licensees or 85 versus the 75 before. 
Does that do anything to change things in the QTL revenue outlook to some 
sort of above seasonal trends, whether it be in the March quart
er or beyond 
as you're getting more people to pay for you with those 
--
 
the new 5G 
licenses?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So the way we think about we planned QTL from a 5G perspective, is 
we've assumed that the market kind of stays at its current structure. And 
any 5G benefit that comes either from higher replacement rates and more 
devices as a result of that. Or it comes through an improved ASP, especially 
at the mid and the low tiers, that would be incremental to our forecast. I 
mean, clearly, as we go and sign
 
the remaining licensees on 5G and go 
through our entire licensing base to convert the 2 5G licenses, that's 
something that's very important to us and critical to us as the transition to 
5G happens.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Co
wen.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Yes. Thank you very much. I guess, I wanted to ask a little bit about 
--
 
I 
know I caution in the commentary in the guidance, you talked about the 
normal seasonality from December to March of 13% on units. But if you look 
back on a year
-
ove
r
-
year basis in both of those quarters, the total numbers 
are down fairly substantially. And with 5G ramping, I wonder if the team 
could give a little bit of update on the 4G business that you have and the 
market share shifts that may or may not be happeni
ng? Or is this just all a 
market volume story?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. Matt, it's a combination of a couple of things. In these quarters last 
year, a year ago, we had a higher volume at Apple since we were in the 
previous models and still shipping volume to 
them, which is one reason for 
the decline. And then second is Huawei. While in the scheme of things, 
they're a small customer for us, they were a small customer for us, we still 
had material volume with them. And so when you adjust for those, the delta 
to 
what you would expect is extremely small and it just reflects the general 
market environment.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Got it. And as my follow
-
up, I don't know if this is for Christian or Steve. It's 
sort of an interesting juxtaposition that one of the big drivers of 
growth at 
your company is 5G RF content. At the same time, one of the big players in 
RF is deeming that business as noncore. Maybe you could just share your 
reactions to that news if do you think is a result of your business or a future 
opportunity for you
r business? And just how you've seen the customer base 
react? That would be really helpful.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure. This is Steve. I would say, obviously, it's not a surprise to us. We've 
been building this for some time and working really to get this 
opportunity 
into the business. The growth of opportunity on the RF side for us due to 5G, 
I think, is a good story, a good continuing story. We're happy to see it grow 
across tiers. I think there's still an opportunity for other players. There's 
obviously 
an opportunity on the 4G side.
 
In terms of competitive dynamic or what we're seeing from the customers, 
we're definitely seeing the customers resonate with the system solution. 
There are some features that we can add, that we've been investing in, that 
I t
hink people are finding valuable. But we're happy to see it flow into our 
business. We've been talking about it for some time, and it's great to see it 
actually in the results and in the guide.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Matt, this is Cristiano. I'll just add one thin
g real quick. Look, for us, the way 
to think about it, this is going to become part of our core business. And 
that's what you see reflected in the revenue per MSM. We expect that uplift 
that we've seen on 5G and RF to continue going forward, especially as 
we go 
down the tiers.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.
 
Rod Hall
 
I wanted to start with channel inventory. And kind of 
--
 
I know you don't 
generally like to comment on it. But as we exit March, given what's going on 
with demand in China, do you have an expectation that handset channel 
inventory there will be higher than normal as we exit March? And just kind 
of what you think the flow of inventory might look like over the course of a 
couple of quarters here.
 
And then 
I also wanted to kind of come back to the competitive environment 
on 5G and ask you, how important share is to you in that environment? And 
maybe, Steve, you could comment on what you would see as advantages to 
having higher market share? Obviously, there 
are cost advantages and so 
on. But there are other strategic advantages we might not be thinking about 
that are important to you.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Rob, from a channel inventory perspective, I mean, obviously, given how we 
are closely following the situatio
n in China, but this is something that we 
need to continue to monitor. The key driver for us is 5G and 5G launches. 
And so in terms of inventory on 5G, we're really at the front end. And we 
have increasing demand from our OEM base. And really, the challeng
e for us 
is how do we keep up with increasing demand, because it's an incredible 
opportunity for us to grow.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes, I think on share. I think 
--
 
this is Steve. I think on share, we're not 
seeing anything that we didn't anticipate. We benefit
, I think, a bit from a bit 
more geographical capability. We sell into handsets that sell into more 
markets. They tend to be better units for us and they give us not only scale 
kind of from the normal scale perspective, but also, I would say, feature and 
d
iversity scale from things. If we have an issue, a supply chain issue in the 
-
-
 
or demand issue in China, we tend to have the ability to have other regions 
to back it up.
 
So we tend to look at the business in terms of our planning. We want to 
make sure tha
t we maintain that strength across different markets. And I 
think that's going to serve us well.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Just a follow
-
up question on the corona, earlier question to Akash, just 
trying to get
 
this right, have you tempered the midpoint of your guide either 
on royalties or chipsets or you're just reflecting a wider EPS range?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, C.J., you should think of it as a wider EPS range. I mean, it's clearly 
something that we wanted to
 
factor in our guidance. So what we did is we 
kind of held our normal guide but moved the lower end by $0.05.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Okay, helpful. As my follow
-
up, you're guiding revenues up roughly 5%, 
OpEx up 5% to 7%. So I guess, can you walk through what's dr
iving the 
greater spending on the OpEx side? And how we should think about 
operating leverage as we proceed through calendar '20 and beyond?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So maybe two points to it. First is on the OpEx side, the increase is 
being driven by normal 
calendar year resets for employee expenses. And so 
it's really 
--
 
that's the primary driver.
 
As you think about the full year, we are 
--
 
we have given guidance before 
where we expect it to be 
--
 
expect to be at the exit rate for '19 plus some 
small increme
ntal on top of it. And so we're still sticking with that. I think if 
we execute to that and we have the growth on the revenue side, it will allow 
us to expand our margins and realize operating leverage.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri wit
h UBS.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
There's a lot of questions on MSM ASPs. But obviously, RF front
-
end really is 
the big piece of the story. But I guess, we don't really have any benchmarks 
in terms of what your revenue is there. And I guess, in early 2018, I think 
you said that you thought
 
that fiscal '19 revenue would be roughly $2 billion 
to $3 billion for RF front end.
 
And it sounds like, in prior calls, you sort of hinted that you didn't get there. 
But I guess, just because it's such a big piece of the story. Can you sort of 
anchor it f
or us, where are you right now? How much revenue maybe in 
fiscal '19, did you do for RF front end. If you're doing so well, I would think 
you want to give us some numbers there?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, Tim, this is Akash. At this point, we're not giving a br
eakdown of our RF 
front
-
end revenue base. I mean, you have data points from a while ago. And 
kind of the market has changed since then. And we've kind of grown our 
business through the RF 360 transaction and just the incredible opportunity 
to grow RF front
 
end on top of 5G. So we're excited about where it takes us, 
and we'll look for opportunities as we go forward to provide more data to 
you. But at this point, we're not providing any additional information.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Okay. Okay. Okay. I guess then, I 
had a question on expenses in QTL. And it 
looks like they bottomed in the mid $300 million range back in September. 
But based on the guidance, they're sort of ramping back up by about $40 
million per quarter. Is all of that legal expense related to the app
eal? And 
sort of how do you think about the trajectory of margins in QTL and 
particularly the OpEx ramp through the year in that business?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So for QTL, if the way to think about the OpEx and the business going 
forward is really look at
 
the first quarter actuals and use that as the basis for 
the expense going forward. I mean, it's 
--
 
at this point, we're not necessarily 
looking to scale expenses and litigation we see it as largely steady state. You 
will see some normal increases and decl
ines. But it's really kind of flat OpEx. 
And then based on how the revenue shape changes through the year, that 
will 
--
 
that is how the margin will get impacted.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko 
Securities.
 
Sr
ini Pajjuri
 
A couple of questions. Akash, on the gross margin, obviously, a lot of 
questions there. My question is, my model, I think I'm getting close to 
flattish gross margin with almost 40% ASP increase here. My question is, I 
know you're ramping 5G and
 
I'm suspecting most of the 5G initially is high 
tier. As we go through the year and as you ramp more mid and low
-
tier, is 
there a risk that gross margins could actually decline? Or are you 
comfortable saying that gross margins can at least remain at these
 
levels?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. Srini, we're not giving guidance on gross margins. But really, from an 
operating margin perspective, the way we think about leverage is really as 
we transition from 4G to 5G, we should be able to hold or improve our 
structure
. And then with OpEx guidance that we've previously provided, the 
combination of those factors should allow us to meet our long
-
term 
operating margin guidance.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Got it. And then maybe for Cristiano. Cristiano, on the RF, you said vast 
majority
 
of the modem design wins are using your RF solutions. Any way to 
give us an idea as to what percent of the mix is using millimeter wave? And 
where do you see that going by the end of the year?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Thanks for the question. Right now, we see mill
imeter wave as a 
requirement for at least the majority of the United States operators in this 
year, we are working towards the millimeter wave launch of Japan and 
Korea. So we expect that to start to be a requirement on devices as well. 
And we have an opti
mistic view that by 2021 we're going to start to see that 
going into other geographies such as China and Europe. So 2020 is a United 
States, Japan and Korea story.

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a stronger 
than expected 
quarter as we continued to execute on our strategy to 
position the company for the next phase of profitable growth. Non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance range, driven 
by strength in both QTL and QCT.
 
QTL revenues reflect seas
onably strong December quarter activity, and we 
are pleased with the progress we are making in China. We signed several 
new China licenses in the first few months, with more than 100 companies 
now having accepted the NDRC [National Development and Reform 
C
ommission] terms. We remain in active discussions with the few key 
Chinese OEMs that have not yet signed and believe we are making progress 
in those discussions. We are also pleased to have recently resolved our 
licensing dispute with LG.
 
In QCT, our chips
et shipments were above the midpoint of our prior 
guidance range, driven by strong demand from Chinese OEMs, and we had 
favorable product costs.
 
During the quarter, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders 
through dividends and stock repurcha
ses. We also announced a 10% 
increase in our quarterly cash dividend, reflecting our confidence in the 
strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth. We remain 
focused on improving our financial trajectory exiting the fiscal year, and we 
ar
e on track in this regard.
 
In QCT, we have updated our roadmap across tiers, and our new products 
have been very well received. The flagship Snapdragon 820 is now available 
in leading devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S7, the LG G5, and the 
Xiaomi Mi5, al
ong with devices from Sony, HTC, HP, and others. We now 
have over 115 Snapdragon 820 designs, and expect volume to ramp on this 
platform through the second half of the fiscal year.
 
Our strategy of offering differentiated all
-
mode modem solutions with carri
er 
aggregation capability is extending our leadership and enabling strong 
design traction, particularly in China at the mid and high tiers. In China, new 
use cases for carrier aggregation are providing product differentiators for our 
customers and enhancin
g our design traction.
 
We are continuing to pursue additional content opportunities in the 
smartphone and recently announced a suite of next
-
generation Qualcomm 
RF360 technologies. We are on track to deliver our next
-
generation CMOS 
and Galliumarsenid PAs 
in 2017 and will extend our product offerings, 
including complete RF front
-
end module solutions once the TDK transaction 
closes.
 
Further, we are broadening our presence in adjacent opportunities, including 
automotive, networking, mobile compute, and IOT. C
ollectively, the 
serviceable addressable opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to 
grow at a CAGR of 18% over the next five years, from $12 billion to $29 
billion, according to a combination of third
-
party and internal estimates, and 
we are well 
positioned to benefit from this expanding opportunity. We expect 
these adjacent opportunities to drive approximately $2.5 billion in QCT 
revenues in fiscal year 2016.
 
We are seeing significant momentum across these areas. In automotive, we 
have very strong
 
design traction in telematics across Tier 1 manufacturers. 
With the completion of our CSR acquisition, we now have a comprehensive 
connectivity portfolio, including Bluetooth Smart, Wi
-
Fi, and LTE, which 
allows us to offer a broader suite of products to o
ur expanded set of 
customers.
 
In networking, we have a strong pipeline of over 240 designs with our 
802.11ac solution across router, home gateway, and set
-
top box 
implementations. We continued to gain significant traction and win category
-
defining designs 
in IOT segments such as wearables, action cameras, 
security and surveillance cameras, virtual reality headsets, drones, and 
smart city infrastructure.
 
At MWC, we announced ecosystem expansion for our next
-
generation 
Snapdragon Wear platform, and we are ple
ased to report that there are now 
over 100 wearable devices using Qualcomm technology, which includes over 
80% of all Android Wear smartwatch designs. Looking at the IOT more 
broadly, there are now over 1 billion IOT devices that have shipped using 
Qualcom
m technology.
 
We continue to forecast QCT operating margins of 16% or better in the 
fourth fiscal quarter and are targeting 20%
-
plus operating margins longer 
term. It is important to note that for planning purposes, both our near
-
term 
and long
-
term margin 
targets have consistently factored in a range of 
second sourcing assumptions at our large customers, and we believe our 
margin targets are achievable under those scenarios.
 
We have strong confidence in our technology leadership, differentiated 
modem roadma
p, and unique global scale. For instance, we recently 
demonstrated our Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, the first commercially 
announced gigabit
-
class LTE chipset, designed to deliver fiber
-
like LTE 
Category 16 download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, at le
ast two 
generations ahead of the competition. This modem also supports Licensed 
Assisted Access, the global standard for LTE in unlicensed spectrum, 
becoming the mobile industry's first commercially announced LTE advanced 
pro modem and marks an important s
tep towards 5G as we enable deeper 
unlicensed spectrum integration with LTE and more advanced MIMO 
techniques to support growing data consumption.
 
Further, we are leading the world to 5G, as we did in both 3G and 4G. To 
support this, we are designing a new
 
OFDM
-
based 5G air interface that will 
not only enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity 
and management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission
-
critical 
services that require lower latency, higher reliability, and robust s
ecurity. We 
demonstrated our 5G millimeter wave 28 GHz prototype system at Mobile 
World Congress, showcasing robust and sustained mobile broadband 
communications at these higher spectrum bands.
 
Looking ahead, we continue to execute on our strategic plans t
o position us 
well for the future. Fiscal 2016 is a transition year, and we are making very 
good progress. We are taking decisive steps to enable us to capitalize on the 
significant opportunities ahead while delivering improving near
-
term 
performance.
 
I wo
uld now like to turn the call over to Derek.
 
Derek K. Aberle

President
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a 
stronger than expected fiscal second quarter, with total reported device 
sales of approximately $70 billion, 
reflecting the seasonally strong holiday 
quarter.
 
I am pleased to report that we recently resolved our dispute with LG. As a 
result of the resolution, we will resume recognizing quarterly LG revenues in 
fiscal Q3 in addition to recording the revenues we de
ferred from the first two 
fiscal quarters. As a reminder, LG continued to report and pay during the 
dispute, so the sales they reported for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016 
were included in the total reported device sales for those quarters, but we 
di
d not recognize revenues for those quarters given that the arbitration was 
underway.
 
We are also continuing to make steady progress in China, completing new 
China license agreements. We recently signed new agreements with Lenovo, 
EWPE, Yulong, and Hisense,
 
and now have more than 100 companies that 
have accepted the NDRC terms, including the top five worldwide Chinese 
licensees. Yulong and Hisense were signed after the close of our second 
fiscal quarter and will be reflected in our third quarter results. In 
addition, 
we are still actively negotiating with several of the other remaining key 
Chinese OEMs and are making progress in those discussions.
 
As we explained at our Analyst Day in February, we are also working hard on 
a number of fronts to improve complia
nce with our licensees in China. We 
have begun implementing those plans and expect them to deliver 
meaningful improvements over time. The percentage of global units not 
reported to us during the second fiscal quarter increased modestly quarter 
over quarter
, driven primarily by share gains from OEMs that have been 
withholding royalties during license negotiations.
 
Looking ahead, we continue to see growth in global 3G/4G device 
shipments. LTE penetration is only approximately 16% of cellular 
connections globa
lly, and cumulative smartphone unit shipments are 
forecast to be more than 8.7 billion from 2016 through 2020 according to 
GSM Intelligence and Gartner.
 
For calendar year 2015, we now estimate global 3G/4G device shipments 
were approximately 1.55 billion u
nits, slightly below the midpoint of our 
prior range and up approximately 13% year over year. We saw strong 
growth in emerging regions, particularly in China, and expect this trend to 
continue in calendar 2016.
 
We are adjusting our estimate of calendar 201
6 global 3G/4G device 
shipments to 1.625 billion to 1.725 billion devices, with year
-
over
-
year unit 
growth of approximately 8% at the midpoint, down from our previous 
midpoint estimate of approximately 10% growth. The strong 4G ramp in 
China continues, as 
each of the operators pursues aggressive subscriber 
growth targets with their 4G
-
plus service offerings, and design momentum is 
moving rapidly towards all
-
mode devices across China.
 
The strength in China, however, is being offset by a reduction in 
growth 
rates in other emerging regions, which we believe is attributable to 
macroeconomic headwinds. In addition, our forecast for premium
-
tier device 
shipments is down slightly versus our prior view, driven by slower than 
expected upgrades within one of t
he premium
-
tier ecosystems.
 
Global 3G/4G handset ASPs are tracking slightly better than our prior 
expectations of an approximately 6% year
-
over
-
year decline for the fiscal 
year, driven primarily by stronger premium
-
tier ASPs. We continue to expect 
low sing
le
-
digit growth in global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2016, as unit 
growth is expected to more than offset ASP declines. Despite adjustments to 
near
-
term shipment estimates, we believe the long
-
term growth drivers for 
3G/4G device sales remain intact and 
provide a solid foundation for the 
licensing business to deliver greater than $10 billion in revenue in our fiscal 
2020.
 
Turning to our QTL revenue outlook for fiscal 2016, despite weaker than 
expected unit shipments for the fiscal year, we continue to exp
ect QTL 
revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. Given the weaker 
than expected 3G/4G device demand, we will need to make some additional 
progress on signing the remaining license agreements in China in order to be 
within that range, but 
continue to feel that is achievable.
 
As we said at our Analyst Day, although there will be quarterly fluctuations 
in the externally implied royalty rate that you calculate based on the 
information we provide, we estimate a normalized rate for fiscal 2016 w
ill be 
approximately 2.9%. This is based on adjusting for one
-
time items and other 
anomalies such as a difference in timing between when revenues for catch
-
up payments are recognized and when the related TRDS may be reported.
 
In conclusion, we continue to 
make good progress in China and are pleased 
to have resolved the LG dispute. We are keenly focused on concluding the 
right long
-
term agreements with the remaining China licensees as well as 
improving compliance, and expect continued progress throughout the
 
rest of 
the fiscal year.
 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George.
 
George S. Davis

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal second quarter non
-
GAAP revenues 
were $5.5 billion, and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were 
$1.04, up 7% sequentially and above the high end of our prior guidance 
range.
 
In QCT, MSM shipments were 189 million, 2% above the midpoint of our 
prior guidance, reflecting stronger demand in China. 
QCT revenues were 
$3.3 billion, with a sequentially higher implied revenue per MSM. QCT 
operating margin was 5%, toward the high end of our prior expectations.
 
In QTL, total reported device sales and revenues benefited from strength in 
both developed and e
merging regions during the holiday quarter. As a 
reminder, we report QTL on a one
-
quarter lag, so these results reflect the 
strength of fourth calendar quarter holiday demand. QTL results also include 
a one
-
time revenue benefit of $266 million, resulting f
rom the merger of two 
infrastructure licensees, as we forecasted on last quarter's call. This was 
partially offset by the end of a multiyear license fee amortization of 
approximately $100 million per quarter as well as the impact of the LG 
dispute revenue 
deferral, which will now be included in our fiscal third 
quarter results, consistent with the settlement announced today.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses decreased 1% sequentially, 
slightly less than our guidance range, due to an increase in legal 
and 
litigation related expenses.
 
We returned approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders in the quarter, 
including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and $1.5 billion in 
stock repurchases at an average price of approximately $49 per share. We 
ende
d the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $30 billion.
 
Our non
-
GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 18%, consistent with our 
expected rate for the full year.
 
Now turning to fiscal 2016, in QTL, as Derek indicated, we continue to 
forecast revenue
s will be between $7.3 billion to $8 billion despite a weaker 
overall TRDS outlook for the year. In QCT, we continue to see improving 
demand for premium and high
-
tier devices in the second half of the fiscal 
year, offset by reduced demand for thin modem pr
oducts and low
-
tier 
chipsets. We remain on track for operating margin of 16% or better in the 
fourth fiscal quarter.
 
We also remain on track to meet the $1.4 billion reduction in spending under 
the strategic realignment plan, and we continue to expect at l
east $700 
million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the SRP baseline, ahead of our 
original $600 million target. A summary of the savings program is included 
in the investor presentation for this call on our website.
 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 n
on
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% year over year, which 
includes the full
-
year impact of acquisitions of approximately 5%. Adjusting 
for M&A, estimated spending in these areas would be down 7% to 9% year 
over year.
 
Turning to our fiscal third quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range 
of approximately $5.2 billion to $6 billion, up approximately 1% sequentially 
at the midpoint, driven by strong product mix in QCT and the favorable LG 
dispute resolution in QTL, 
including catch
-
up revenues from prior
-
period 
activity. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter 
to be approximately $0.90 to $1.00 per share, down approximately 4% year 
over year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter n
on
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be approximately flat sequentially.
 
In QTL, fiscal third quarter revenues will include recognition of more than 
$200 million that was deferred in the first fiscal and second quarters related 
to the LG dispute res
olution.
 
Separately, we estimate total reported device sales between $52 billion and 
$60 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for 
shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to 
the seasonally high holiday q
uarter shipments. We have not included any 
potential benefit from license agreements under negotiation, consistent with 
our prior practice.
 
We expect QTL's operating margin percentage to be down sequentially, in 
line with seasonal trends reflecting the fir
st calendar quarter. In QCT, we 
anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 175 million to 195 million units 
during the June quarter and expect revenue per MSM to be up more than 
10% sequentially. We expect QCT operating margin to improve sequentially 
and be
 
in the range of 9% to 10% for the fiscal third quarter. These 
expectations reflect the benefit of a stronger chip roadmap on both 
performance and cost leadership across tiers, favorable product mix, growth 
in adjacent opportunities, and lower operating ex
penses.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.

Thank you. Your first question co
mes from the line of James Faucette with 
Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James, please make sure that your line is

Yes, we can hear you, James.
 
James E. Faucette

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Hello? Okay, I'm sorry. So I just had a couple of quick questions. First, I just 
want to clarify the comments around QTL and its potential licensing. Sho
uld 
we take from your comments that the risk of it potentially falling outside of 
or below the targeted range for this year have gone up, or are you just 
trying to clarify that?
 
And I guess my second question is related, and that is as you continue to 
purs
ue licensing agreements with some of the larger Chinese OEMs with 
whom you don't have agreements, does it reach a stage or when do we 
reach a stage that you may have to start to pursue legal options through the 
courts there, and what would that look like? 
Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Great. Thanks, James. On the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion, our point 
was the range was initially defined solely by the outcomes based on our 
market assumptions at the begin
ning of the year if we were able to. If we 
weren't able to make much progress, we saw ourselves ending up at about 
$7.3 billion in QTL on the licensing agreements. If we made significant 
progress, that could take us to $8 billion.
 
Obviously, the LG issue f
rom last quarter created some confusion. We said 
that was really outside the range. Now that that has been resolved, what 
we're saying is that the end market is softer than we had anticipated when 
we set the range up front, and that's pulled down the overa
ll size of the 
market. So we would have to make up some of that in the form of some 
additional progress on the licensing agreements. And we feel that we're 
making progress there, so it would be premature to say that we don't 
believe that we'll end up somew
here in between the $7.3 billion and $8 
billion that we started with.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
James, this is Derek. On your second question, right now we're really 
focused on trying to conclude the remaining agreements through negotiation 
if that's pos
sible. And I think as you've seen and Steve mentioned and I 
mentioned in my comments, we have been continuing to conclude additional 
agreements over time. So if we get to the point where we don't believe that 
that's possible through continued negotiation o
r the companies aren't 
negotiating in good faith, then we're certainly prepared to take the next step 
and enforce our rights. With most of the companies, it would really be more 
along the lines of an action to enforce their agreement that they have in 
plac
e today. And like I said, we've been preparing for quite some time to do 
that if necessary, but so far have felt like we're still making enough progress 
with the licensees. And I think the progress that you're seeing through the 
announcements is supportive
 
of that. And so we're going to keep at it and 
see if we can get across the finish line without the need for litigation. But of 
course, that's always an option for us if we need it.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capit
al 
Markets. Please go ahead.
 
Timothy Patrick Long 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Thank you, just two if I could. Steve, you mentioned chip margins with 
regard to thoughts about second
-
sourcing at large customers. Could you talk 
to us, just expand a 
little bit about that on timing, when you think you might 
see second
-
source at most of your major customers? And on the cost side of 
it, do there need to be OpEx cuts if there is a second sourcing going on, or 
can you handle it without that?
 
And then just 
one follow
-
up for Derek on the Chinese, could you just clarify? 
There have been a lot of announcements from these large players. Have 
they pretty much all been just adding three
-
mode to existing deals, or have 
any of those large ones announced been fully i
ncremental? Or again, has it 
just been just three
-
mode additions? Thank you.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Tim, this is Steve. So on the second
-
sourcing, I think the main point is that 
we have been assuming that in our plans rea
lly since the beginning of when 
we did our restructuring. Difficult for me to talk about timing related to that, 
but I think the point we wanted to communicate was that we are assuming 
for planning purposes that that is the case. And even with that, we are
 
comfortable with our margin targets and our improving financials in the chip 
business in the second half.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
Tim, on your second question, I would say we've commented on this a 
couple of times, and unfortunately there's still a li
ttle bit of confusion on the 
catch
-
up picture. As we've said, most of the companies that we've been 
negotiating with to try to conclude agreements on the non
-
three
-
mode part 
of the market have been continuing to report and pay under their 
agreements. And s
o when we sign them to the new NDRC terms, that 
doesn't result in most cases any significant catch
-
up on the non
-
three
-
mode 
part of the market. As you noted though, in many cases, it will result in 
them starting to pay royalties and pay past royalties on t
hree
-
mode devices 
that were previously not licensed.
 
It's turned out so far that a number of the players have been the smaller 
players in the three
-
mode market. And so the contributions from that 
haven't been significant, or the way we've structured the de
als and how the 
past royalties have been structured to be paid over time, those are things 
that will come into our P&L through probably a period of time later in 2016 
and maybe even into 2017. And so we are getting agreements for those to 
be paid. It's jus
t that they're being probably spread over a longer time than 
people anticipate.
 
There are less than a handful of companies that we're in negotiations with 
that are larger players also on three
-
mode and non
-
three
-
mode that have 
been not reporting while they
're negotiating. And when we conclude those 
deals, you would expect to see more significant catch
-
up payments for prior
-
period sales compared to the ones that we've signed to date.

Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Go
ldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Simona K. Jankowski 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Hi, thank you very much. Can you clarify for the June quarter, what is the 
royalty rate that we should be thinking about? I understand that 2.9% is the 
longer
-
term number. But just in 
the nearer term given the LG and the China 
catch
-
ups, how should we think about that for the June quarter?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
Simona, this is Derek. At this point, we're not going to guide quarter by 
quarter on the implied rate, as I spent a fair 
amount of time at the Analyst 
Day going through, there are so many factors that impact it. And the timing 
of a number of these elements, some of which are in our guidance, some of 
which are not in our guidance because we haven't yet reached closure on it, 
can have an impact on the rate.
 
We do feel, continue to feel, as I noted in my script, that for the year, for 
the full fiscal year, that we will be in the range of around the 2.9% that I 
spoke about at the Analyst Day, so still consistent with that. But yo
u are 
going to continue to see fluctuations quarter over quarter as some of these 
disputes get resolved or catch
-
up payments come in. That is going to move, 
so we're not going to be guiding one quarter out on that.

Great, thanks. Switching over to QCT, to hit your 16% margin, can you walk

plus going to 
conti
nue to go higher based on mix shift? And then also, if you could, just 
talk about your momentum in China on the mid to high tier. How sustainable

revenue per MSM trends longer

George S. Davis

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Hey, Mike, it's George. We're seeing a lot of factors that support stronger 
revenue per MSM growth, not only in the third quarter but also in the fourth 
quarter, including t
he lower thin modem. You've got very attractive mix shift 
between the low tier to the mid and the high tier. All those things will play 
strongly in revenue per MSM, and we expect that to hold in the third and 
fourth quarters.

Hey, Mike, this is Cristiano. I think to your question on China, I think if you 
remember, in the last earnings call and during the Analyst Day, I think we 
talked about an interest
ing trend in China that was very helpful, is the 
transition of the market to the new version of LTE with carrier aggregation 
and as well as all
-
mode. I think we're starting to see this strategy 
materialize not only in this quarter but as we think about the
 
coming 
quarters. And this is driving also the mix improvement on the mid and the 
high tier. We see the mid and high and premium tier in China actually 
growing faster than the market. That helped drive the mix improvement for 
QCT. Thank you.

Your 
next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I had two. One, I wanted 
go back to this change in the TRDS unit expectation for the calend
ar year 
versus the guidance range for QTL, and just understand. Is the reason that 
you're not changing the QTL guidance range because these puts and takes, 
you've signed some deals, the market's a little bit weaker than you thought, 
you just end up at the 
same midpoint? Or can you give us some more color 
around why those two things seem to differ from each other in terms of 
movement?
 
And then the second thing I wanted to do, Derek, you mentioned in your 
commentary I think an ecosystem player and expectation
s for slower 
upgrade cycle there. Is most of that expectation happening later this year, 
or are using it happening now? Can you just clarify what's your definition of 
ecosystem player? Is that a vendor or is that a particular region of the 
world? Just give
 
us a little bit more clarity there. Thanks.

Rod, so let me try to take the first one on. So really what we're seeing is if 
we look at the market for calendar 2016, and 2015 came in just slightly 
lower than what we expected for 
the year. We are seeing some softness in 
the premium tier, some puts and takes, some other weakness in emerging 
regions, but actually improvement in China. China continues to be quite 
strong. And overall also, the ASP picture is looking good as well. We 
ex
pected moderation in the ASP declines year over year, and that seems to 
be at least so far tracking better than our assumption.
 
So we do feel like there is 

 
the net
-
net of that is a bit weaker market for 
the fiscal year, but we gave a pretty wide range on
 
QTL revenue for the year 
just given all the different elements in there. And we felt with still some time 
left in the year, we do believe we can continue to make progress in China as 
we have been demonstrating over the last few months. And so as George 
me
ntioned, we just felt it was premature to adjust the range. We will need 
to make more progress relative to where we were before, just given the 
change in the market, but we still think the range is a reasonable range to 
hold for now.
 
On the second question
, really I think what we're saying is we are seeing 
some continued softness in the premium tier. We saw that earlier, and our 
projections were based on that. It's a little bit more softness, and I think 
that plays out. It has played out through some of the
 
previous quarters 
already and will continue through the year.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, just two relate

when you talked about with the second sourcing that you had a good idea

Blayne, this is Steve. I'll take the first part and maybe Cristiano can jump in 
on the long

term question. I think we took an appropriate planning 
assumption really f
or sizing the OpEx. We wanted to make sure that when 
we implemented our realignment in terms of cost structure that we 
comprehended, I think, the proper range of outcomes. I think we feel quite 
strong or quite good about our modem roadmap and where it's go
ing, but I 
think we're doing the appropriate thing from the perspective of planning our 
OpEx. And maybe Cristiano could add some of the product details of that.

Hi, this is Cristiano. Look, I think it's important to understand. When we 
think about technology, not only in the modem space but even on the MSM, 
I think we continue to maintain at least two generations lead over the 
competition. But I think 
more important is some of the transitions and 
trends we're seeing in the market.
 
I think one of the things is more the Internet is becoming wireless, and you 
see the 4G transition becoming more mature in developed markets. You see 
carriers now competing fo
r premium customers. And the transition that 
we've been talking about, LTE to carrier aggregation, I think that's actually 
growing faster. So I think you're starting to see gigabit LTE modem that we 
demonstrated. And we will see from that one, the user fro
m licensing 
spectrum with the global standard, I think was mentioned by Steve, the 
LAA, and maybe within the next two to three years an accelerated timeline 
of deployment of 5G. As we continue to invest and we see those technology 
transitions ahead of us, 
we feel very confident that the whole nature of the 
market is probably going to demand the latest technology and the key 
devices. So that's how we're feeling about the market and our modem 
business. Thank you.

Thanks. I just have a couple of questions. For Derek first of all, at the 
an
alyst meeting, Derek, you laid out Chinese OEM revenue of $83 billion this 
year, and you guys really weren't collecting on I think about 44% of that 
between what was unlicensed and what was basically under
-
reported. Just 
given you've now got 100 of these d
eals done and you've got some of the 
negotiations and you're doing your compliance program and auditing as well, 
should we think about 

 
is the hard work by the end of this fiscal year done 
that that level that you're not really collecting on today you wou
ld have at 
least addressed through deals and under
-
reporting, or is this a program and 
situation that could roll all the way into 2017?
 
And then for Steve and for Cristiano maybe, on the LTE modem probably the 
last comment you made, I take the point, by th
e way, that there's carrier 
aggregation and everything else. It looks like you lost market share last year 
in the chipset industry on the wireless side. It probably sounds like there's 
some risk as we go through this year as well, and I'm just wondering. D
oes 
it take till actually 5G comes out and carrier aggregation wouldn't really 
drive home your competitive advantage, or could the market share for you 
at some point start inflecting and you start gaining share in this industry 
again? Many thanks.

Kulbinder, this is Derek. On your first question, I think you got the numbers 
right. The chart that we showed at the Analyst Day was again for fiscal 
2016, basically just in your revenue note catch
-
up from prior periods. And 
we said i
f we completed these remaining negotiations with the handful of 
companies we have left that that would get us to about 75%
-
ish collection 
rate on the TRDS, but that we would continue to have compliance issues 
that we were going to need to work through. And
 
that really is going to be 
something that we hope to make progress on and expect to make progress 
on as we move through 2016, but certainly will also be a longer
-
term 
project. There's a fair amount of work involved and it's going to take some 
time. So I t
hink the way to look at it is if we can achieve the results that we 
hope in the negotiations, we'll have a meaningful step function up on 
collections, but to get to the remainder of that 25% issue is going to take 
some time.
 
Cristiano R. Amon

EVP, Qualco
mm Technologies, Inc.
-
President, 
Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm, Inc.
 
This is Cristiano. I think maybe to address your question on share, I think it 
may be important to decompose that question into different segments. One, 
if you look on the premium 
tier, we have been 

 
there have been a number 
of announcements. We've been very confident in the Snapdragon 820. I 
think we made a lot of progress there. I think even if you look with one of 
the large customers, both the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge that 
launched in the second fiscal quarter, they're using the Snapdragon 820. 
And I think we have about 117 designs. We feel good about that portfolio.
 
And in China, if you look at what happened, when China entered 4G 

 
when 
we started the transition to 4G, we 
expected over time, we started with very 
high share. We expected that to normalize over time. But what we've seen 
actually in this year, we are doing better than we expected in share in China, 
and also seeing the impact of those technologies changing the p
roduct mix 
from growth being higher from the low to the mid and high tier, showing 
that modem continues to be a good point of differentiation even in a growth 
market like in China.
 
I think maybe to clarify this, I believe we had said early in the year as w
e 
went through the SRP that we were planning so that we could derisk the 
market concentration in our planning assumptions, I think that's what we're 
saying. We're planning that we have conservative planning assumptions. But 
at the end of the day, we're sti
ll designing a very competitive product 
roadmap, and we're seeing good traction in the marketplace, not only on the 
modem, but the MSM premium tier and the product portfolio that we have 
been commercializing in China. Thank you.

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Thanks, I had two. I guess first of all, a question for all of you. Do you worry 
that we're talking about share loss at the premium tier? And there's
 
some 
consensus as to who you're going to lose that to on the chip side. And of 
course, they make their own chips. So do you worry that that becomes a 
competitive disadvantage over time, having access to world
-
class 
manufacturing that your foundry partners
, just frankly, aren't able to just 
keep up?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
So, Tim, this is Steve. I think a couple things. One is just to reiterate that 
for the purpose of when we plan OpEx and our margin trajectories, we do 
as
sume that something will happen, but we're quite confident in our 
roadmap.
 
Now right now, our products that we are competing against are really not 
manufactured by 

 
it's not a vertical play in terms of who we're going after. 
And then specifically when you
 
look at our foundry partners, they 

 
we're 
very happy with what we're seeing from a transistor roadmap out in time, 
actually from multiple sources. So we feel not only can we compete in the 
modem tier and the connectivity tiers, but even more importantly 
in 
computing and even computing going into very high
-
performance 
computing, we have the transistors to be able to make that successful. So I 
think we feel very confident both in the transistor roadmap that we're seeing 
from our suppliers and also with the 
business model that we will be in a 
strong position.
 
I think also our scale within the fabless industry is actually helping us a lot in 
terms of pricing. I think that's one of the things you're seeing the benefit of 
in terms of some of the margin improveme
nt that you're seeing embedded 
in the business in the second half and even delivered out here in the second 
quarter.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on the 
QTL licensing guide, I've got to be honest. I still don't understand why you're 
guiding like you're guiding. I understand what you're saying. You need to 
get more collection 
out. But if your trends of collection, the range of 
collection right now was the same today as it was when you first gave the 
guidance, what would the guidance range be? What are we talking about 
here?
 
Secondly, it seems to me like you are implicitly guidi
ng your QTL margins, 
your operating margins into the mid
-
70% for next quarter, which is lower 
than seasonal. And I know you said you had some increase in legal and 
litigation costs, which I assume is what's driving that. So are these 
compliance
-
related, or
 
is there something else going on the legal and 
litigation front that's taking the QTL operating margins down next quarter?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
Stacy, this is Derek. If you look at the Q3 guide, I think our view has been 
that we're not going to inc
lude in guidance in
-
quarter deals unless we have 
clear line of sight to those and they're essentially either done or close to 
done. And so we've been taking a more conservative approach maybe than 
we have in the past, and we've been doing that for a couple
 
of quarters now. 
I think as you see, the guide in Q3 is consistent with that. And I think really 
if you step back and look at it, the difference may be just the terms of the 
assumptions and timing if I look at some of the other models out there in 
terms o
f what lands in Q3 versus Q4. Because of the way we're guiding, that 
would essentially mean that more is in Q4 versus Q3 as you look at the 
profile for the year, assuming we're able to conclude those remaining deals. 
So that may be part of it.
 
On the margi
n question, I just think you're 

 
I'm not sure how you got to 
your number. That's not consistent with what we're modeling in the 
business.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
I would add that that would be well below our as
sumption for QTL in any of 
the remaining quarters. And I think what we've seen is on some of these 
licensing arrangements, they can be large and lumpy, and trying to forecast 
what is inherently a negotiation process proved over a number of quarters to 
be s
omething that either: one, was hard to do; or two, created unnecessary 
negotiating leverage. And so I think we'll stick with this process. But we 
have said for the full year in the $7.3 billion to $8 billion that we'll have to 
conclude some activity on the
 
licensing front to get back within that range 
because of the softness in the market. Thanks.

Hi, guys. I wanted to understand two things. First, the contribution of LG 
this quarter, when you guided the quarter, I think that LG was not in. And 
I'm trying to understand how much of the strength this quarter is related the 
addition of LG v
ersus your previous expectations and how much is the 
underlying market.
 
And then second, this is a broader question. Your QTL is down 11.6% year 
over year, and I know there was a catch
-
up payment last year. But if I look 
at 

 
think about things at a high l
evel, China was not in last quarter outside 
of the catch
-
up payment I think from Huawei. This year, this quarter you do 
have China in. You also have LG in. So why are we seeing 

 
we don't see 
much higher contribution of China just on a like
-
for
-
like basis.
 
Again, the 
TRDS between the two quarters is down 7.5%, but your revenues are down 
11.6%, so you're down more than the TRDS. That shouldn't happen given 
that China is kicking in this year. So I'm just trying to understand the 
dynamics of China contribution
 
and why isn't it at a much stronger pace or a 
much stronger revenue level than we are seeing right now. Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Tal, just to be clear, the LG settlement happened in our third quarter, so
 
it is 
not in the second quarter numbers. It will be roughly $200 million. We said 
it's a couple hundred 

 
roughly $100 million a quarter for the first two 
quarters that will be catch
-
up that's embedded in our guidance. And then 
we'll be back to a run rate
 
with LG. But that's all in Q3. Really, the Q2 item 
that we talked about was the fact that you had the ALU [Alcatel
-
Lucent] 
agreement, which added approximately $250 million. And then we had seen 
the discontinuation of a licensing amortization of about $10
0 million in that 
quarter. Derek, did you want to comment on...
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
Yes, I think just to add to what George said, I think really what we said 
about LG was it's in the quarters we've talked about, it's been more than 
$100 million per
 
quarter. So as George said, that is not in Q2. That will be 
reflected in Q3, both the in
-
quarter activity for Q3 as well as two prior 
quarters of catch up.
 
In terms of trying to do the walk between last year Q2 to this year Q2, 
George hit on some of that.
 
Obviously, we've got a one
-
time event in Q2 this 
quarter with the acceleration of the license fee that came in, the $266 
million
-
ish payment, but then being offset by the fact that LG revenues are 
deferred, they're not in the quarter. And then we also hav
e the end of this 
$100 million
-
ish a quarter amortization that's reflected in this quarter. Plus, 
as you mentioned, a year ago we had some catch
-
up payments, about $150 
million from the resolution of a prior dispute.
 
And then the China contribution, China 
was reflected pretty strongly in a 
year
-
ago quarter, meaning that was the last quarter that was reported to us 
before the NDRC resolution. The effect of that took hold in January of 2015. 
And so one of the other issues you're dealing with, with the year
-
ov
er
-
year 
comparison is you've got application of the NDRC terms now in this quarter 
that wasn't a factor a year ago, as well as we saw the amount of units that 
are being under
-
reported accelerate throughout the year last year, in 
particular related to these
 
negotiations where licensees stopped paying. And 
that was not really a primary driver in a year
-
ago quarter. So I think that's 
the walk as probably best we can break it out.

Tavis C. McCourt

Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, a couple of them here. First on 
the MSM guidance, unit guidance for next quarter, so if I look at that on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis, it's down h
igh teens. And obviously you're gaining 
some share at a major customer. I assume all of that cannot be related to 
unit weakness at the other major customer. And yet everything I hear so far 
is China is good, China is good. So help me with that disconnect. 
What's 
driving that unit growth in light of some share gains at one of your 

 
or unit 
decline year over year in light of some share gains at one of your larger 
customers?
 
And then secondly, to help me get to that 16% operating margin guidance 
for June, sho
uld we expect a more material change in the R&D or SG&A line 
item as we go from Q3 to Q4 than we've seen earlier this year? Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. On the MSMs, as you look at year over year, there
's definitely a 
significant delta from one major customer that is contributing. And what 
you're seeing in China is a shift in low/entry to mid and high, and so it's one 
of the reasons why you're seeing strong pickup in revenue per MSM in the 
quarter. So it
's a story more of mix shift. It's pretty neutral outside of that. 
And so the low tier units, they tend to be more of those low
-
tier units that 
we're trading off, but we're picking up a significant amount of mid
-
high.
 
In terms of OpEx, we expect OpEx to co
ntinue to decrease into the fourth 
quarter, but I think some of the comparisons that you may be doing would 
be looking at R&D period over period. But in one period, we didn't have the 
CSR OpEx; in the other period we do. So just make sure you're doing an 
a
pples

to
-
apples comparison because we've already seen a fair amount of 
the reduction already in the base level OpEx.

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess two questions. 
First on OpEx, your fiscal year guide implies OpEx down 7% in 
September. 
I'm curious if that's right, and what we should think about going into the 
December quarter.
 
And then secondly, with the nice uplift to ASPs for MSM in the June quarter, 
I'm curious how we should think about that heading into the back half of th
e 
calendar year as you layer in both the high
-
end as well as mid
-
level 
handsets. Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Yes, we said for the full year on OpEx, if you just look at the reported 
numbers, we'll be down
 
2% to 4%, but we have about a 5% impact from 
acquisitions. So it would be down in the range of 7% to 9% year over year. 
And as I said, we would continue to expect some cost reduction continuing 
through the back half of the year just on some of the actions
 
that have 
taken place.
 
In terms of revenue per MSM, as I said earlier, I think the dynamics that are 
driving the significant pickup that we are seeing in Q3 remain in place for 
Q4, very good mix, strong demand for our premium tier, again, a shift from 
low
 
tier into the mid and high tier, and then some softness certainly 
comparatively year over year on thin modem volumes, which tend to 
depress revenues per MSM.

Thanks. Steve, you said that the forecast for QCT margins include 
expectations for second

source at your largest customers. Are we to imply 
from that statement that the mere mention of it mean
s that it will be 
material in either units or margins, or do you see it more as a headline risk?
 
And then along those same lines, since we are talking about Intel, it is true 
that every modem they've shipped so far has been fabbed at TSMC. But 
does your ca
lculus on competition or market share change if they move that 
modem into their own process, or does it have no bearing at all on your 
outlook? Thanks.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

Ed, I think on the second question, it really 
doesn't bear much to it. The 
modem business is all about feature leadership and RF, and it's really about 
technology breadth and technology complexity. It tends to be less about die 
size and those things. And first to market, first to market with complexit
y 
tends to be the thing that leads the most.
 
I think on your first question, it's really a communication of a planning 
assumption and also confidence in us meeting our long
-
term trajectory, both 
in this year and outside of this year with that assumption. I
 
think it's 
important to make sure people understand that. We do feel very confident,

Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal third quarter 
non
-
GAAP earnings of $0.86 per share was above the high end of guidance, 
driven by strong licensing revenue and solid performance in our chipset 
division. We recently signed a new long
-
term global patent license 
agreement with Huawei, including a cross license granting back rights to 

 
We also entered into an agreement settling amounts due under the prior 
license agreemen
t. We are pleased to have successfully reached resolution 
with Huawei. As Akash will explain later, royalty revenue from Huawei 
begins in fiscal Q4 and is not included in our fiscal Q3 results. Alex and the 
QTL team have done an outstanding job in executin
g over 100 agreements 
covering 5G and building by a wide margin, the most extensive licensing 
program in mobile. This is a tribute to our track record of driving important 
and fundamental innovation. With the signing of the Huawei agreement, we 
are now ent
ering a period in which we have multi
-
year license agreements 
with every major handset OEM.
 
Our entire company has executed very well despite the ongoing impact of 
COVID
-
19, while maintaining the safety of our employees as our highest 
priority. We continue
 
to advance our product and technology roadmaps, 
support our customers and meet a very complex set of R&D and supply 
chain requirements. And the current environment has not impeded the pace 
of our innovation. In the last four months of work
-
from
-
home, inve
ntion 
disclosures are up over 30%, with 5G related invention disclosures up even 
more.
 
Turning to the handset market, fiscal Q3 was better than the expectations 
we shared with you last quarter. In China, just midway through the calendar 
year and despite th
e impact of COVID
-
19, 5G now represents the majority of 
domestic mobile phone shipments. According to the China Academy of 
Telecommunication Research, June domestic 5G smartphone shipments 
represented 63% of total smartphone shipments, more than double the
 
penetration in the month of March.
 
Given the strength of June 5G handset data in China along with flagship 5G 
device launches in the second half of the calendar year. Our calendar year 
2020, 5G forecast of 175 million to 225 million handsets remains uncha
nged, 
with our bias now towards the upper end of that range. As Akash will explain 
shortly, we are anticipating the next inflection point in our 5G ramp to start 
in fiscal Q4, with strong year
-
over
-
year growth in revenue and earnings per 
share, leaving us 
well positioned for continued growth in fiscal year 2021.
 
Turning to QCT, design win momentum remained strong. There are now 
over 660 designs announced or in development based on our broad portfolio 
of 5G solutions using Snapdragon 8 Series, 7 Series and 6
 
Series platforms, 
who are using our X55 modem, with a strong pipeline headed into next year. 
In the premium tier, we now have over 165 designs announced or in 
development from our Snapdragon 865 5G mobile platform. We recently 
announced our 6 Series Snapd
ragon 5G mobile platform, which has the 
potential to make 5G accessible to more than two billion smartphone users 
around the world.
 
Our systems approach to 5G RF front
-
end has been extremely well received. 
Virtually all of our 5G design wins continue to be
 
powered by our RF front
-
end solutions, whether they support 5G in sub
-
6, millimeter wave or both. 
And as a consequence of our RF front
-
end strategy, we expect to emerge in 
fiscal 2021 as one of the largest global RF front
-
end vendors by revenue.
 
We remain
 
focused on executing on the significant growth opportunities that 
we have in place today in the handset space. As you would expect, we are 
also working in parallel to position Qualcomm for similar success as 5G 
moves beyond smartphones. We see a significa
nt market transition 
occurring as the cloud converges with 5G and AI, positioning 5G as the next 
evolution of the internet. This new architecture at the edge plays directly to 
our strengths in low
-
power, high
-
performance computing and connectivity, 
where Q

opportunities for growth, as we have in 5G enabled smartphones.
 

how we are working with the mobile ecosystem to meet the high t
echnical 
requirements to drive adoption of 5G to new industries. Just this month, 
3GPP completed 5G New Radio Release 16, the second 5G standard that will 
greatly expand the reach of 5G to new services spectrum and deployments. 
It delivers key technologies
 
spearheaded by Qualcomm for transforming 
industry, such as enhanced ultra reliable low latency, advanced power 
saving and high
-
precision positioning needed for mission
-
critical applications 
like industrial IoT.
 
While Release 16 is now complete, our work d
riving 5G technology evolution 
to fully realize the potential of this latest release continues. In addition, we 
are already working with the mobile ecosystem on Release 17 projects and 
are researching advanced technologies for Release 18 and beyond. We are
 
very excited about our 5G future and our ability to commercialize the 
breakthrough technologies that will drive differentiation for Qualcomm over 
many years.
 
I would like to now turn the call over to Akash.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afte

to report strong third fiscal quarter results, demonstrating the resilience of 
our business in a challenging economic environment. We delivered total 
revenues of $4.9 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.86
, which 
was above the high end of our guidance range, primarily driven by stronger 
results in QTL.
 
In the third quarter, we saw an approximately 20% year
-
over
-
year reduction 
in 3G, 4G, 5G handset shipments due to the impact of COVID
-
19 relative to 
our prio
r planning assumption of a 30% reduction. In addition, we saw a 
stronger mix with higher shipments in China and developed regions offset by 
weakness in emerging regions. In QTL, we delivered revenues of $1 billion, 
and EBT margin of 62%, both above the hig
h end of our guidance range due 
to higher units and stronger regional mix.
 
Please note our third quarter QTL results do not include any revenues from 
Huawei settlement or global patent license agreement. In QCT, we delivered 
MSM shipments of 130 million un
its, revenues of $3.8 billion and EBT margin 
of 16%, which was at the high end of our guidance range. The impact of 
COVID
-
19 on emerging regions resulted in fewer, low tier MSM units, offset 
by improved gross margin as a result of favorable mix.
 
QCT revenu
es and EBT increased 7% and 20% respectively on a year
-
over
-
year basis. This performance reflects 5G design traction, RF front
-
end 
growth and strength in certain adjacent platforms that benefited from the 
work
-
from
-
home environment.
 
Our non
-
GAAP combined R
&D and SG&A expenses of $1.68 billion were 
slightly below our guidance. During the third quarter, we paid $733 million in 
dividends, refinanced $2 billion in debt, and temporarily suspended stock 
buybacks.
 
I will now provide a financial overview of the res
olution with Huawei. We 
expect to record approximately $1.8 billion of revenue in our fourth fiscal 
quarter for amounts due under the settlement agreement relating to the 
prior license period and the new license agreement for the first half of 
calendar 202
0. This amount will be excluded from our non
-
GAAP results. 
Please note that this amount is consistent with the framework of our 
licensing program and incremental to the partial payments received from 
Huawei under the interim agreement in prior years.
 
In ad
dition, our fourth quarter non
-
GAAP financial guidance includes 
estimated QTL revenue from Huawei sales in the September quarter. With 
the completion of this agreement, we have now licensed all significant 
handset OEMs worldwide.
 
Turning to the global 3G, 4G, 5G device forecast. Given the ongoing 
uncertainty around the timing of economic recovery, our fourth fiscal quarter 
forecast is based on a planning assumption of approximately 15% year
-
over
-
year reduction in handset shipments.
 
This planning assumption reflects 
a gradual recovery in September quarter based on the regional trends we 
saw in the June quarter. Consistent with our prior expectations, our forecast 
for the first three quarters of 2020 implies a year
-
over
-
year reduction
 
of 
approximately 10% to the calendar year, total device forecast. However, 
total units in the fourth quarter will depend on the speed of the economic 
recovery.
 
Lastly, we are maintaining our forecast of 175 million to 225 million units for 
calendar 2020 5
G devices. In the June quarter, we estimate that the sell
-
in 
of 5G devices increased to greater than 50 million units. This data point is a 
strong leading indicator of our confidence in the 5G handset forecast for the 
year and our bias towards the high end
 
of this range.
 
Turning to our fourth fiscal quarter financial guidance. We estimate fourth 
quarter GAAP revenues to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8.1 billion and 
GAAP EPS of $2.12 to $2.32, which includes the revenue related to the 
settlement with H
uawei. We expect fourth quarter non
-
GAAP revenues of 
$5.5 billion to $6.3 billion and EPS of $1.05 to $1.25. This guidance includes 
an impact of greater than $0.25 due to the reduction in handset shipments 
due to COVID
-
19, including a partial impact from t
he delay of our 5G 
flagship phone launch.
 
In QTL, we estimate fourth quarter revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion 
and EBT margins of 67% to 71%. At the midpoint, this guidance implies 
year
-
over
-
year revenue growth of 12% driven by the addition of royal
ty 
revenues from Huawei, partially offset by our planning assumption of a 15% 
reduction in handset shipments.
 
In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of 145 million to 165 million units, 
revenues of $4.3 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBT margins of 17% to 19%. 
Thes
e guidance midpoints imply year
-
over
-
year growth of 27% in revenue 
and 66% in EBT, reflecting the strong execution of our strategy in a 
challenging economic environment.
 
As we have previously outlined, RF front
-
end is one of the key drivers of our 
revenue 
growth. Our fourth quarter forecast includes revenues of 
approximately $750 million for 4G, 5G sub
-
6 and 5G millimeter wave 
content. We anticipate fourth quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses to be up approximately 5% sequentially, reflecting nor
mal 
seasonality in 5G investments.
 
In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and suppliers for their 
commitment and partnership during these extraordinary circumstances. 
Looking forward, we are excited to have a strong foundation of growth 
acros
s our product and licensing businesses.

Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you
. Our first question comes 
from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with 
your question.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results in a 
tough environment and the Huawei settlement. My q
uestion is just helping 
us understand your revenue per MSM trends going forward. You highlighted 
in 2021, you expect to be the revenue leader in RF, obviously, that could 
take up the revenue per MSM and then you should have a much greater mix 
of 5G phones 
over time. So, as we look out in the future quarters, how 
should we think about the pluses and minuses on a revenue per MSM 
calculation? Thank you very much.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, hi Mike, this is Akash. If you look at our trend over the last couple of 
qua
rters, on a revenue per MSM perspective, we were just over $31 in the 
second fiscal quarter. And then we reported a little over $28 in the June 

September quarter. The premise behind the gr
owth in the revenue per MSM 
is still consistent with what we had said before, which is as we transition 
from 4G to 5G, we expect our revenue opportunity to grow by 1.5 times. 

thin
king about the trend on revenue per MSM long
-
term. And I think these 
quarters where we have delivered the results with higher numbers kind of 
bear out the math behind it.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Right. And maybe just a quick follow
-
up, is there any seasonality to tho
se 
type numbers based on mix of premier smartphones that we should think 
about in modeling kind of those trend lines?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, sure. There will be a little bit of a seasonality based on when our 
premium tier chipset launches and which is typic
ally we go heavy on volume 
on the premium tier in the March quarter. So there will always be some 
seasonality, but I think overall the trend that the last few quarters suggest is 
a reasonable way of thinking about it.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hey, Mike, this is Cris
tiano. I just want to add one thing maybe to help you 
understand it. We may have seen over the short period of time as we look at 
where the market is given the pandemic, we feel good about 5G units. But 
when you think about trends, thinking about the 1.5 m
etric, the more the 5G 
penetrates into the handset base, I think more that helps our trend of 
increasing the revenue per MSM. And I think we still have a lot of 4G units 
out there. We like that accelerated transition to 5G.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next que
stion comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess just maybe first off if I could try 
and understand the MSM unit guidance here and the improvement. It would 
help
 




 
I know you mentioned the delay in the 
product launch, but what are you assumi
ng in terms of the product launch in 
that sequential improvement that you have of roughly kind of 15 million at 
the low end and 35 million at the high end. So how much of that is a market 
recovery and how much of that is the product launch?
 
Akash Palkhiwal
a
 


around the midpoint. There are really two drivers for the increase. The first 
one is, we 
saw some weakness in the low
-
tier units in the June quarter 
because of the impact of COVID on emerging markets. So, we are seeing 

our customers, so that drives growth on a quarter
-
ov
er
-
quarter basis.
 
And then second, we talked about partial impact from a delay of our 5G 
flagship phone launch. If you think about a large flagship phone launch, 
typically for a QCT perspective, our customers end up buying chipsets that 
facilitate the laun
ch in the couple of months before the launch. So what 


guidance and another portion would get pushed out to t
he December 

answering your direct question, the increase from 130 million to 155 million 
is really two drivers, increase in units especially at a low
-
tier and then 
benefit from the new la
unch.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Okay, got it. And then if I can just follow
-
up on the restrictions in place here 
to Huawei right now, is there an impact on the MSM unit guidance from 
that? And then with the licensing agreement that you now have, does this 
potential
ly open up an opportunity to even kind of ramp up your chip 
shipments to them in the future if in the absence of high silicon being able to 
kind of provide them the chipsets that are required for their 5G handsets?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 

the first part of the question. At this point, we really 


other OEMs that we would be shipping to.
 
Stev
e Mollenkopf
 
Yes, this is Steve. On the second 

 
the second part of the question, I think 

every OEM including Huawei, but really nothing to report as of yet.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. 
Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Chris Caso
 

we go into September with Huawei coming in the global handset decline, 
e

metrics about what the normalized QTL revenue run rate would be. Is that 
something you could provide us now if I normalize for all of those 
exceptional events that are happening no
w, once I put Huawei in? And 
maybe you can give us some indication because of those changes this 
quarter, how much Huawei contributes to QTL in the September quarter?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. Hi, Chris. This is Akash. Let me try to give you a few data points 
that I 


number of $1.1 billion is a reasonable range and then for the December 
quarter somewhere in the $1.

before two key factors. First factor is really the impact of COVID on our 
guidance. So in the June quarter, we came in a little over $1 billion in 
revenue in QTL, with a market that was 20% lower on the handset 
side from 
a year
-
over
-
year perspective. So 20% reduction year
-
over
-
year. And we 
came in a little over $1 billion against a normalized run rate of $1.1 billion.
 

really there are two 
factors, right, Huawei coming in and increasing that 
number and a little bit of a decline based on a 15% market weakness that 

triangulate what a normalized run rate is. The key thing 
for us is just not 
having insight into COVID going forward and how the recovery happens. So 

to give guidance into the normalized run rate.
 
Chris Caso
 

k you. As a follow
-
up to that, with regard to 



s this a 
reasonable margin run rate at least for the first three quarters of the year, I 
suppose it would go higher as you went to the seasonally stronger December 
quarter.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 

the bottom 

the Analyst Day last year, we provided our view on kind of longer
-
term 
sustainable margins for QTL, where we said a midpoint of 70% and with 
Huawei it would be slightly
 

change to that point of view. I think we still think those are good reasonable 
numbers to use to model our business going forward.
 
Chris Caso
 
Got it. Very helpful, thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche 
Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi, guys, thank you so much. So, let me ask the question and congrats on 
the Huawei settlement. Akash, you mentioned earlier in the call about the 
gross ma
rgin within QCT performing well. Can you go in a little bit deeper 

great correlation between the revenue per MSM and the gross margin in the 
QCT side of things. And given that
 
that revenue per MSM line could be 
moving all over the place in the next couple of quarters, given some of these 
flagship launches, I want to understand the relationship between those two 
dynamics better.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Sure, Ross. So let me 

 
let me ki
nd of maybe quickly talk through what 
happened in the June quarter. What we saw was versus our guidance of 
mid
-
point of 135 million units for the MSM, we saw some weakness at the 
low
-
tier. And what I referred to in my script was because of the fewer low
-
ti
er units that was driven by COVID impact on emerging markets, we saw 
higher revenue per MSM and a higher gross margin as a result of it. So, they 
both moved in concert at the same time and in same direction.
 
As we look forward to the September quarter, wha
t we are implying in terms 
of guidance for our gross margin is more in line with what we had guided for 
the June quarter, because we expect the lower
-
end units to come back into 

w

 
Cristiano Amon
 


 
this is Cristiano, consistent with, I think, the 
conversation we had before about revenue per MSM, as some of those low 
4G units starts to get 
replaced by 5G units and we go into the future 

a good driver for gross margin improvement in QCT.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Thank you very much, guys and congrats on the Huawei deal from myself as 
well. A couple of questions, Akash. The first one is on opEx. You talked about 
it being up with 5G investments and other things. Maybe, you cou
ld give us 
a little bit of context as to whether the September quarter number is a 
realistic run rate going forward as I know opEx had 

 
cost controls have 
been top of mind given COVID and given some of the QTL things that have 
happened in the last few yea

the settlement 

 
the back payments from the settlement, there is a big sort 
of cash payment coming in to you guys from Huawei, any thoughts of use of 
that cash. Thank you.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. Hi, Matt. So,
 

increase in OpEx quarter
-
over
-
quarter. If you look at our historical trend, 

saw an increase of 4% when you adjust the June qu
arter for the variable 

consistent with our historical trend. There is a little bit of an increase and 
extra 1% increase just because of timing of 5G investments.
 
When you pull back an
d kind of look at the whole year, we will end up total 
opEx of $6.8 billion, very consistent with what we told you at the Analyst 
Day and our forecast for the year. So, we really think of opEx as consistent 

rtant for us to continue 
to manage opEx well and deliver operating leverage as we grow revenues.
 
And then on the second question, on the $1.8 billion, what we have is 

 

combination of
 

through the end of 2019 and add to it the first six months of 2020 through 
June. The combined total of that is $1.8 billion. And so that some 

 


 
one
-
year period with the first 
payment due in the September quarter.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Got it. Thank you. Just a quick follow
-
up for Cristiano or I guess for Steve as 
well. You guys talked about being the view of 2020 5G units now being 
maybe, at the upper end 
of the range. And if you put that against a major 
global launch that might be pushed slightly. Was all of that maybe, 
incremental confidence in upside in 5G units in China or are there other 
markets that we should be thinking about that are now ramping 5G 
units 
with some 

 
with some visibility? Thank you.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi, Matt. this is Cristiano. Well, look, there is an overall I think confidence in 
5G. If you look at the comment made by Akash in the quarter, I think we 
saw a better mix than we originally
 
expected, which is offsetting weakness in 
the emerging markets and mostly 4G low
-
tier units. What we saw is better 
units on developed markets, which is just a result of 5G. Traction 5G 
continues to be high. We now have over 80 commercial networks in 35 
co
untries. We have a large number of operators now 380, 120 of which are 
working on millimeter wave and our design to traction jumped to 660 

us confidence on the estimate we made for the 
year.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Tal Liani
 

-
up on the previous answer. When you 
look at the U.S. and Europe and other places, c
an you give us a sense of 
how much of the launches are planned to be with millimeter wave? And then 
when it 

 
do you have an estimate of your market share within millimeter 
wave, kind of, if you look at the global 

 
at the globe, how much do you 

re capturing of this market initially? Thanks.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
All right, Tal. this is Cristiano. Thanks for the question. So, let me just start 



 
traction of millimete
r wave technology is moving kind 
of as we expected. I think the current scorecard I can give it to you, United 
States continue to ramp, Japan recently launched, we still forecast Korea to 
launch within the year. Europe and Russia are targeting commercial 
l
aunches before the end of the year with millimeter wave. And then 
spectrum auctions had occurred in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore 
and Finland for commercialization in 2021.
 
I think worth noting is there is still expectation that China will have al
so 


 

significant technology leadership in millimeter wave and have been showing 
into some of the expansi
on of our designs. And I think specifically, within the 
United States, which is the largest millimeter wave market, we have now for 
example Verizon with 35 cities now live with ultra wideband. AT&T continued 
to expand, as well as T
-
Mobile and remains a req
uirement for all of the 
flagship devices across the three operators.
 
Tal Liani
 
Got it. So that means all devices in the U.S. will have millimeter wave, all 
devices that are being launched in the U.S. will have millimeter wave to 
support it?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
No. you have a combination of millimeter wave in sub
-
6 and I think as you 

combination of both. Millimeter wave today is a requirement for all flagship 
devices and we expect that technology 
to penetrate down the lower tiers as 
well over time.
 
Tal Liani
 
Got it. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with 
Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. thanks for 
taking my questions. For the first one, I wanted to see if 
you could give us some feeling for how that $1.8 billion splits up. I know you 
gave a little bit of color on kind of 2019 and before and then the first half of 
2020. But do we think about that $1.8
 
billion broadly applying to like every 

2017 on top of the $450 million that they paid you already.
 
And I guess for my follow
-

obviously up 50%. I
f I look where that revenue per MSM number ran 
especially when you add Apple in the mix back in the day, or it was about 
$20, so 1.5 on that would be $30, is that kind of like the new sort of normal 

hould be thinking 
about revenue per MSM?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 


 
again, there 
are two components to that 

 
to that amount. One is the settlement of our 
previous agreement and it really captures the 
period since the entire dispute 
period that we had with them. And second component is the first six months 
of calendar 2020. So that total adds up to the $1.8 billion. It is additive to 
the two previous shorter
-
term agreements that we had with them.
 
The to
tal amount of those agreements was approximately $1.2 billion. So, 



 

September quarter. And really,
 
as I said in my prepared remarks, we 

 
these terms are very consistent with the overall framework of our licensing 

licensing program terms.
 
And then revenue per MSM, I think your math is
 
a reasonable way of 

framework we use to think about it as well. The one thing I would maybe, 

take so
me time to get there and so there will be a curve into it.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman 
Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ashwin Gupta
 
Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Ashwin on behalf
 
of Rod. Akash 
maybe, this is for you. You mentioned about 5G flagship phone delay and its 
impact on your QCT, but I was wondering if you could help us understand 

Samsung got delayed,
 
it had an impact not just on Samsung, but overall 
handset market. So, just wondering if you could give us some color there. 
And sort of related 

 
well, not exactly related, but my second question is on 
the June quarter. Units were better and 

 
QTL units w
ere better and you 
self
-
tied that to the improvement in China, but I was wondering if you could 
talk about trends outside China and where you potentially saw some 
strength in the overall market?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 

uestion. In the June quarter, 
what we saw is strength across China and developed markets. So, it was 
kind of broad
-
based across the developed market landscape in addition to 

numbers. And w
hat it was offset by weakness in certain emerging markets. 

-
off 

 
trade
-
off that we saw between the various 
markets.
 
On your first question on 5G flagship phone launch delay and how that 
impacts QTL, the specific scenario that we
 
are talking about the launch is 

within the September quarter guidance. And we think of it as captured in our 
total market weakness guidance as a part of COVID. But again, I think
 

much bigger factor for QCT than it is for QTL, because the chipset purchases 
typically happen in large quantities in advance of a launch.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with 
UBS. Please proceed with your
 
question.
 
Pradeep Ramani
 
Hi. This is Pradeep Ramani standing in for Tim. I guess my first question was 
around your 

 
the QCT adjacencies, autos, IoT and so on. Did they do better 
than last quarter and are they sort of approaching now roughly $1 billion in
 
the quarterly run rate. Can you just provide some color on that? And then I 
have a follow
-
up.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 

pretty happy with it actually. There are certain markets that we are i
n that 
definitely benefit from COVID and the work
-
from
-
home environment. We 
have the mobile broadband market, the 5G and 4G CPE and Dongles market, 

and clearly with demand for i
mproved connectivity within the home as 
people work
-
from
-
home. That has been a pretty strong spot for us as well.
 
And then overall, IoT is also continuing to see strong traction. So, when you 
look at all those markets, which make up kind of the broader IoT
 
category 
for us, a lot of strength across the board. Auto obviously, got impacted as a 
part of just what the industry is going through. But really within auto, a lot 
of our products are forward leaning, which is focusing on new launches and 
the demand for
 


impact than a lot of other peers are seeing in the industry as well. So, those 

 

 
Pradeep Ramani
 
Okay. And as my follow
-
up, when we think about your 5G opportunity, 
especially on the RF front, are you sort of gaining share, is your share gain 
largely driven by millimeter wave or 

 
or are you sort of gaining share 
across the board. And 
can you maybe sort of speak to just your broad 5G 
share versus 4G share, I mean beyond just the 50% increase in ASP?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi. This is Cristiano Amon. Yes, we 

 
on the RF front
-
end especially as this is 
a growth market for us as a new entrant. We 
are seeing share gains and we 
have been very clear, our strategy to really scale in RF front
-


getting designs across sub
-
6, across millimeter wave and started to get
 
some traction within 4G RF front
-
end content as well. And we expect that to 
continue to be a positive trend of attached to our baseband, because of our 
modem
-
to
-
antenna differentiation at the system level.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
And this is Akash, just to add a
 
couple of quick points. As I said in my 
prepared remarks for the September quarter, we are expecting RF front
-
end 
revenue of approximately $750 million. So very happy about getting to that 
milestone. And really as we outlined previously, our target is to 
grow to 
approximately 20% share of the RF front
-
end market. And so between that 
data point and really, the forward traction that Cristiano talked about, we 
feel very comfortable in being able to hit that target.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next 
question comes from Brett Simpson with Arete 
Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brett Simpson
 
Yes, thanks very much. Two questions. Maybe, just first on Huawei, the 
settlement. Can you talk about how much of the $1.8 billion is going to be 
cashed
 
in the September quarter? And then if I look at the licensing with 
Huawei before the dispute, I think with the SAP licensee, maybe you can 

SAP licensee or are they taking a full pl
atform license? And what sort of 
licensing PD is the agreement going to cover? And then second question 
maybe for Cristiano, on automotive. I think it was a year ago when you last 
spoke about your backlog at about $5.5 billion. Can you give us an update 
on
 
the backlog for QCT and how we should think about the ramp up here 


going to be a big push for V2X and 5G is goin
g to be a big licensing 

automakers on 5G specifically. So, how should we think about that going 
forward? Thank you.
 
Alex Rogers
 
This is Alex. In terms of the Huawei deal, obviously the terms 
are 
confidential. And Akash has already talked about the financials to the extent 

-
upon payment schedule with respect to amounts that relate to the prior 
license period. This is a long
-
t
erm deal and a broad agreement with the 


automotive licensing business in the 3G, 4G space for a decade or so
. And so 


revenue.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi. So Brett, this is Cristiano. Let me answer your question on automot
ive 

for the design wins, I will talk about some of those trends. I think we 
continue to see that increasing for us, especially as the automotive industry, 

 

to see even higher interest in moving the programs of bringing more 
electronics and a digital cockpit transformation within the car. So, we 
continue to gain traction, continue to get incremental design awards
 
and 

 
So, within regards to the content, we have been now really focused on the 
Telematics unit for the connected car, the digital cockpit transformation that 
includes content for the in
fotainment, the rear seat entertainment, 
dashboard and smart mirrors and connectivity across our WiFi and 

silicon content is really within the digital cockpit transformation.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sri
ni Pajjuri with SMBC 
Nikko Securities. Please proceed with your question.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Thank you. I have a couple of questions, first on the ASP. Obviously, nice 

next couple of quar

trying to understand how that might impact your ASPs as well as margins? 
And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 

and
 

go back to the broader framework and broader discussion we had on the 
ASP trend. I think that still holds true even with your question. And then 

 
and I think margin trends also the 

talk about a specific socket at the broader 

 


 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Okay, fair enough. And then maybe, for Cristiano, just trying 
to get a better 
handle on the competitive landscape, Cristiano. So obviously, with the 

forward. Just curious, if you could look 

 
if you could kind of talk about the 
modem compet
ition between you and MediaTek and others, kind of compare 
that and contrast with at this stage in 4G cycle, what are some of the 

forward.
 
And then that also relates to my margin quest
ion longer
-
term and this is a 

of any other semi company at this scale running at below 20% margin. So, 


 
longer
-
term 
mar
gin potential for this business is? And how the competitive landscape is 
shaping up in 5G? Thank you.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi. This is Cristiano, thank you for your question. All right, let me just start 
with the competitive landscape. We always said in the smar
tphone mobile 

segments within semi. And we feel very good right now especially, given the 
complexity on 5G, given the opportunity for us to move faster to different 
releases of this
 
technology as it go beyond smartphones into other industrial 
use cases and the ability to have RF front
-

showing now when we think about our design traction.
 
We started being first
-
to
-
market with 5G. Of our 660 designs 
right now, 570 
of those designs are based on our second
-
generation. And then our third 
generation, I think [indiscernible] product we kind of indicated over 165 

other including with 

that.
 
We expect that more as many of our customers especially in China, 
companies like Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi continue to grow outside China; I 
think more demand for global solution like Qualcomm, will 
increase our 

we feel much better about the differentiation of our 5G solution, compared 
to 4G. And as far as margins, I think we have been consistent. 5G provides 
significant 
growth for us in expansion of earnings and we are approaching 
our long
-

that.

answer session. Mr. 
Mollenkopf, do you have anything further
 
to add before adjourning the call?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes. just thank you for the 

 
to the employees for their hard work and 
obviously, there has been unusual circumstances. And so I appreciate very 

see the strategy 
we laid out result in such a positive traction for the business. Thank you to

Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. This sudden and 
dramatic change in how we are living today has impacted nearly every 
citizen on the planet. On behalf of the 37,000 people in the Qualcomm 
family, I would
 
like to extend our best wishes around the world, as we 
collectively manage through this unprecedented time.
 
The global stay
-
at
-
home orders highlight the critical role that broadband has 
played in facilitating remote workforce, distance learning, entertain
ment, 
telemedicine, communications and many other things. With billions of people 
around the world using Qualcomm technology, our mission to invent and 
commercialize breakthrough wireless technologies like 5G has been 
reinforced and amplified.
 
Over the las
t three months I have seen countless examples of our resilient 
and strong culture, working together to solve the daily challenges we face. 
Our response to the pandemic has been evident in the exceptional execution 
of our team on all fronts. In Q2, we trans
itioned to a totally different working 
environment with the safety of our employees as our highest priority.
 
As a result of the many operational changes we have made over the last 
several years, we were able to respond quickly when the work
-
from
-
home 
order
s began in mid
-
March with minimal disruption to our operations. 
Importantly, we were able to limit our on
-
site essential workforce to a very 
small number and remain on schedule with our product commitments.
 
From an engineering and operations perspective we
 
have maintained very 
high levels of productivity. We continue to advance the 5G road map and 
support customers while meeting a very complex set of R&D and supply 
chain requirements.
 
We have also implemented remote access to labs, transition to cloud
-
based
 
collaboration and enabled remote device testing without the need for 
physical access. We were also able to mitigate the COVID
-
19 impact to our 
global supply chain.
 
Despite the challenging environment, where in Q2, we estimate the overall 
handset market wa
s down approximately 21%, our Q2 non
-
GAAP earnings 
of $0.88 per share was at the midpoint of our guidance range we gave in 
early February in the early stages of the pandemic.
 
Our QCT growth drivers of 5G design wins along with higher share of dollar 
conten
t are very much intact as you can see in our revenue per MSM and as 
virtually all our 5G design wins continue to be powered by our RF front end 
solutions.
 
In our licensing business, we have now signed more than 85 5G license 
agreements, up from 80 license 
agreements last quarter. As expected, we 
recently entered into new long
-
term global patent license agreements with 
two leading Chinese handset suppliers OPPO and Vivo to cover 5G multi
-
mode mobile devices.
 
Turning to the handset market. Fiscal Q2 China dem
and saw a sharp 
decrease coinciding with COVID
-
19 restrictions followed by month
-
over
-
month growth as restrictions subsided. This provides a basis to model rest of 
world handset demand trends.
 
As I mentioned earlier, the overall handset market was down app
roximately 
21% in the March quarter, principally from the China impact. In the June 
quarter, we estimate the overall handset market to be down approximately 
30%, driven by the impact of shutdowns in the rest of the world while 
benefiting from the rebound w
e are seeing in China. Total demand will 
depend on the speed of the economic recovery. However, we see no change 
in our calendar year 2020 5G smartphone forecast.
 
As we look to the second half of calendar 2020, while there are a few 
regions with minor dela
ys in 5G network deployments. Overall, 5G is 
progressing as planned and we continue to be well positioned to drive the 
rapid adoption of 5G globally.
 
In closing, Qualcomm is in a strong position and on track with our industry
-
leading product road map. We c
ontinue to add people in key areas and we 
are executing well with a strong balance sheet.
 
I would like to turn the call over to Akash, where he will provide more detail 
in his prepared remarks.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Thank you, Steve and good afternoon everyone.
 
Prior to addressing our 
second fiscal quarter results I want to echo Steve's thoughts and thank our 
employees' customers and suppliers for their commitment and partnership 
during these extraordinary circumstances. Our second fiscal quarter results 
demonst
rated strong performance in both QCT and QTL despite the 
challenging economic environment. We delivered total revenues of $5.2 
billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.88, which was at the midpoint 
of the guidance range we provided in February. QTL de
livered revenues of 
$1.1 billion and EBT margin of 63%, both consistent with the midpoint of our 
guidance.
 
We have now entered into new long
-
term global patent license agreements 
with OPPO and Vivo. Our ability to finalize these 5G multimode agreements 
in 
a challenging environment reiterates the strength of our IP portfolio and 
the relationship with these customers. In the second fiscal quarter, due to 
the spread of COVID
-
19, we saw a reduction in 3G, 4G, 5G handset 
shipments of approximately 21% compared t
o our prior expectations and on 
a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
This decline was based on two factors. First, pronounced weakness in China 
in late January and February, followed by a substantial recovery exiting the 
quarter. And second a decline in demand in many 
other regions globally 
starting in March. This negative impact on QTL was partially offset by a 
benefit related to updates to previous royalty estimates and favorable mix.
 
In QCT, we delivered revenues of $4.1 billion, MSM shipments of 129 million 
units and EBT margin of 16%, which was at the midpoint of our guidance. 
QCT revenues and EBT increased by 13% and 39% sequentially. This 
reflects the benefit of the first wave of 5G flagship launches, increased 
content from our RF front end chipset solutio
ns and improved gross margins. 
In addition, we saw strength in our IoT and networking products due to 
increased demand for connectivity in this work
-
from
-
home environment.
 
Consistent with our expectations, our results included a greater than 50% 
increase i
n RF front end revenues on both a sequential and a year
-
over
-
year 
basis. Our total non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses of $1.7 billion 
was below the low end of our guidance range including savings in marketing 
and travel expenses.
 
With that, I'd like t
o turn to Global 3G, 4G, 5G device forecast. Given the 
continued uncertainty around the timing and the pace of the resolution of 
COVID
-
19, our third fiscal quarter forecast is based on a planning 
assumption of approximately 30% reduction in handset shipmen
ts relative to 
our prior expectations. This planning assumption is based on two drivers. 
First, China sales for the quarter gradually improves from the exit rate of the 
March quarter; and second, other regions see a recovery starting in June, 
which is mode
led based on the trends we are seeing in China. Our forecast 
for the first half of 2020 implies a reduction of approximately 10% to the 
calendar 2020 total device forecast. However, total devices in the second 
half of 2020 will depend on the speed of the e
conomic recovery.
 
Turning to 5G device forecast. Launches across all regions remain on track. 
While we expect some minor changes to the launch timing and sell
-
through 
of certain devices, our calendar 2020 estimates remain unchanged at 175 
million to 225 mi
llion units.
 
Now, let me walk you through our third fiscal quarter financial guidance. We 
currently estimate revenues of $4.4 billion to $5.2 billion and non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.80. This guidance includes a greater than 
$0.30 adverse imp
act attributable to the reduction in handset shipments due 
to COVID
-
19.
 
Given the uncertainty around the time and the scale of the economic 
recovery, we are providing a wider
-
than
-
normal EPS range for the quarter. 
In QTL, we estimate third fiscal quarter r
evenues of $750 million to $950 
million and EBT margin of 50% to 56%. This guidance reflects a normalized 
run rate of $1 billion to $1.2 billion adjusted for the impact of lower handset 
shipments due to COVID
-
19.
 
As a reminder, our third fiscal quarter for
ecast for QTL does not include 
revenues from Huawei. In QCT, we estimate revenues of $3.6 billion to $4.2 
billion, MSM shipments of 125 million to 145 million units and EBT margins 
of 14% to 16%. Our guidance reflects the latest demand signals from our 
cus
tomers as they contemplate the global impact on device sales and 
reconcile their supply chains to the lower sell
-
through. We expect revenue 
per MSM to decrease sequentially, reflecting the normal seasonal mix shift, 
following the 5G flagship handset launch
es in our second fiscal quarter.
 
We anticipate third fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses to be approximately flat on a sequential basis. We returned 
approximately $2.3 billion to stockholders during the second fiscal quarter, 
including $
705 million in dividends and $1.6 billion in stock repurchases. 
Additionally, we announced a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.65 
per share.
 
Given the current economic landscape, we have performed scenario planning 
with a focus on liquidity and w
e will continue to evaluate our cash flow and 
capital policy as the situation evolves. In these challenging times, we are 
glad to have a strong balance sheet, liquidity position and debt rating.
 
Looking forward, our top priority is the health and safety of
 
our employees, 
and the communities in which we operate. Our business strategy remains 
unchanged. We remain confident in the long
-
term growth opportunities, 
including 5G adoption, RF front
-
end content capture, and the expansion of 
our technologies and adja
cent platforms. Thank you.
 
And I'll now turn the call back to Mauricio.

Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are ready for questions.
 
Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mik
e 
Walkley with Canaccord. Please proceed.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Great. Thank you and congratulations on the strong results in a tough 
environment. Question's more just big picture. Back in February, before 
COVID
-
19 was seen as expanding more around the globe manage
ment 
indicated they expected two inflection points based on timing of 5G 
launches. Just given your ongoing discussions with customers, do you still 
see a second inflection point for 5G later this year? Or is it more pushed 
maybe exiting the year and into c
alendar 2021? Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Mike, its Steve and thank you. The 

 
in terms of overall timing of handset 
launches, I would say in general, we're seeing people keep the same slots 
that they've talked about, been a lot of intensity to maintain th
ose 
schedules. My guess is you'll see things move around a little bit, because of 
just people dealing with the environment they're dealing with. But in 
general, I don't think you're going to see big changes in that. Certainly, for 
us to reiterate our 5G un
it call for the year. I think hopefully that helps you 
get a sense for how we feel about the second inflection point.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Great. Thanks, Steve. Just for my follow
-
on question then. With your Q2 
guidance certainly appears based on your 30% cut on t
he macro that you're 
gaining share in terms of MSM shipments strong in terms of that base. Are 
you seeing maybe what the strength of your portfolio and execution 
opportunity to gain share as the year plays out? Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yeah. I think the
re's a couple of things. I think share picture is pretty good. 
Assuming 

 
if you use the market assumption that we have my guess is 
you'll probably come to 

 
you'll probably be surprised on the upside in terms 
of, how we look in terms of the financials. On
e key component, I think gross 
margins continues to be a good story and would be sequentially as well for 
us. So I think in general with the exception of a big dip in the market, we 
still like those factors that we're looking at.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our ne
xt question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with 
JPMorgan. Please proceed with you question.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi, good morning 

 
good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So it's 
good to see you reiterating the 5G volume outlook. Just wonderin
g, with the 
weaker macro that everyone's expecting are you 

 
what are you seeing in 
terms of pricing for handsets from the OEMs themselves particularly in China 
as that market is recovering. If you focus on 5G handsets are you seeing 
them become more aggre
ssive in terms of pricing? And what implications 
can that have on the supply chain?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Hi, Samik its Akash. Yeah, it's clearly true. The OEMs are being very 
aggressive. We had a set of launches planned before COVID and the OEMs 
were able to 
execute on all those launches in this environment. And if you 
look at some key metrics that came out of China in the month of March 30% 
of the devices that were sold into the channel were 5G devices. So that's 
really much stronger than even we had expected
. And so we're seeing 
tremendous traction across tiers, across OEMs and looking forward to it.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Samik, this is Cristiano. I just want to 

 
also there's another data point, 
which is worth reiterating. 71% of all models launched in China is 5G.
 
That 
shows that the market is really preparing for 5G broad penetration across all 
tiers.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Got it. And if I can just follow
-
up on the MSM shipment outlook that you 
have, which is roughly flat quarter
-
on
-
quarter, just wanted to understand 
t
hat would generally imply that you're seeing order trends remain fairly 
stable start to improve as you exit 

 
enter into 2Q. So just wanted to 
understand, if that's fair just given that even with the kind of drop
-
off in 
volumes in terms of sell
-
through you
're kind of guiding to flat quarter
-
on
-
quarter shipment volumes?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
That's right. We 

 
there's a little bit of a seasonality. We typically see a 
slight bump between the quarters. So we're seeing that as well. But even in 
this environment, we 
continue to see the strong order pipeline is very good 
for us too.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with 
Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Chris Caso
 
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, the first 
question is about, how 
your view has changed versus 90 days ago. You mentioned in your prepared 
remarks, the 30% reduction. Could you walk us through that bit of about 
how you got to that assumption? It sounds like there's a different 
assumption between Ch
ina and the rest of the world. And as we go into the 
second half, do you 
--
 
are you 
--
 
to the extent you have forecast right now 
expecting some improvement on that as economies start to open up?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. Hi, Chris, it's Akash. So the way we lo
oked at the third fiscal quarter for 
us is we kind of focused on the 
--
 
what we saw in the second fiscal quarter, 
which was we saw weakness in China earlier in the quarter really starting 
from late January all the way through February, but a strong recover
y 
exiting the quarter. And then outside China, we saw weakness exiting the 
quarter.
 
And so we use that as the starting point. And our framework for how to 
model the June quarter was to use the exit rates and apply the China 
recovery model to the rest of th
e world. So as you think about the June 
quarter the 30% decline that we're expecting in handsets it's a combination 
of China being not as weak given that they've already gone through a 
substantial recovery and then the rest of the world seeing more weaknes
s.
 
As you look beyond the third fiscal quarter, it's really kind of 
--
 
it's uncertain 
at this point as to how and when the recovery happens, but if you look at 
the 5G number, which is a leading indicator for our business feel very 
comfortable with the full
 
year guidance. And so we are reiterating the 
guidance of 175 to 225 and 225 million units for the calendar year.
 
Chris Caso
 
Okay. Understood. Second question is on revenue per MSM. And it seemed 
like that was consistent with what you said previously that 
seasonally the 
mix comes down as you go into the June quarter. What about as you go into 
the second half of the year? You've got some new flagship ramps as you go 
to the second half of the year and I'd imagine that 5G penetrates some new 
price points there
. What do you expect the trend to be in revenue for MSM 
as you go to the second half of the calendar year?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So fundamentally nothing has changed versus the guidance we have 
previously given you. As we go from 4G to 5G, we feel like the
re's an 
opportunity for us on the core chipset ASP side, which you've now seen the 
evidence of. And then on top of that also on the RF front end attach, which 
adds to the ASP.
 
In addition to that what we've now seen in the March quarter results and in 
our 
June quarter guidance as well has implied a very strong gross margin 
performance. So combined the ASP increase with the gross margin strength 
really kind of delivers for us on the bottom line. And so from a framework 
perspective, as we look at the rest of 
the year and the other OEMs that 
framework should still hold.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with 
Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I'm conf
used here. I'm just 
curious you're taking a 30% haircut. And I thought when you're explaining 
QTL; you said the market would be down 30%. So if you could just clarify 
that that would be helpful.
 
And then I guess the second part of the question, you signed 
these two new 
agreements. I think you noted in your filing you've seen a headwind with the 
royalty rates in terms of customers just taking the essential patents. I'm just 
curious if that's what these deals are. And if you can just comment on the 
body of yo
ur patent portfolio the ones that are just taking essential patents 
versus all your patents?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yeah. Hi, Blayne. From a forecast perspective, the way we forecasted QTL 
for the June quarter is with the market reduction of 30%, we 
--
 
if you th
ink 
about a normal run rate for the QTL business, it would be in the $1 billion to 
$1.2 billion range midpoint of $1.1 billion. We applied the handset market 
reduction of 30% to that to get to a range of 
--
 
range with the midpoint of 
$850 million for QTL. 
So it's pretty straightforward methodology really 
reflecting the weakness in market on the revenue guidance.
 
Alex Rogers
 
And Blayne, this is Alex. Look QTL is in a really good position. We expected 
to get the OPPO and the Vivo license agreements negotiated and signed and 
we did. So those are long
-
term worldwide SEP agreements covering 
multimode products. Those agreements are
 
consistent with the $1 billion to 
$1.2 billion run rate absent COVID
-
19. And so we basically got all of the top 
OEMs, but Huawei. Any major OEM is fully signed up. And so for the next 
number of years we don't have any renewals that 
--
 
so it's a ways out.
 
So I don't see the SEP agreements that we've signed as being subject to 
headwinds. I actually kind of see it the opposite way around. We launched 
the 5G licensing program back in 2017 and we have executed really well on 
it. And come to a position where we'
re really in a good position with one 
negotiation with Huawei still ongoing.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of 
America. Please proceed with your question.
 
Tal Liani
 
Hi, guys. I 
have two questions. Now the first one is pricing 
--
 
MSM pricing, it 
was $23 two quarters ago, then went up to $32. And now you're guiding 
implied for $29. So the question is what are the puts and takes here? What 
are the factors that are driving it up so m
uch from only two quarters ago?
 
And then the second question is, just if you can give some color on your 
assumptions next quarter. You said, that unit 

 
for QTL you said that unit 
shipments you're assuming, it's 30% below your previous guidance. What 
does 
it mean? What kind of assumptions do you have for the environment 
next quarter? Thanks.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Hi, Tal. On the revenue per MSM trend, going from our fiscal first quarter, 
the December quarter to fiscal second quarter, as we had outlined 
previousl
y, the key drivers there were three factors. First is, the transition 
from 4G to 5G helping us on the chipset pricing side, the core chipset. 
Second is RF front end design traction on top of that, along with the 5G 
launches. And then third is a typical sea
sonal mix shift that works in our 
favor when you go from the December to the March quarter, because that's 
when our new premium and high
-
tier chips come out and several of our 
OEMs launch their new phones.
 
When you go from 
--
 
so we outlined these assumptio
ns and we delivered on 
those results. I'm extremely happy that we were able to do that along with 
expanding our gross margin percentage. When you look forward to the June 
quarter, one of those three factors that I outlined for the March quarter 
changes, wh
ich is the mix shift towards premium and high
-
tier devices.
 
So you kind of have a change in that which reduces your revenue per MSM a 
bit, but it's more a function of which chips are being sold in that quarter 
rather than a fundamental change in the busine
ss. We're still continuing to 
see extremely high revenue per MSM, given our historical trends and strong 
gross margins on top of it.
 
Tal Liani
 
And is this 29 
--
 
is the high 20s the new environment we need to get used to 
going forward, going from kind of lo
w
-
20s to high
-
20s?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
So we're not really kind of guiding this number going forward. But if you go 
back to the framework that we've given, which is, we expect with 5G to see 
an increase of 1.5x from where we've been in the past, that would le
ad to a 
framework very similar to yours.
 
Tal Liani
 
Got it.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
And then on your second question on QTL, the forecast really is 
--
 
we're 
looking at the midpoint of our normal revenue guidance range of $1.1 billion 
and the 30% is what we're seei
ng in terms of reduction of handsets. And so, 
we're applying that to the overall forecast that we had prior to it, which kind 
of reflected or was reflected in the annual guidance of 1.8 billion units that 
we'd given, which was roughly flat for the calendar
 
year. So you should think 
of it as that's reflective of a market that was similar to last year and we are 
taking a reduction off of that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche 
Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I want to start out on the 
QCT side. Akash, you did a great job in QTL of kind of saying what the 
moving parts were in the quarter for June guidance, especially relative to the 
30% reduction in u
nits. If I take that $0.30 hit to EPS that you guys said 
COVID impact, is that just on the QTL side? Or are there some puts and 
takes you could walk us through on the QCT side as far as the general 
market weakness might be applying to Qualcomm as well?
 
Aka
sh Palkhiwala
 
Sure, sure. So, Ross, we outlined an impact of greater than $0.30 and it's a 
combination of QCT and QTL. So I think you've got the math on QTL. It's 
really taking the $1.1 billion midpoint and comparing it to our guidance 
midpoint of $850 mil
lion. The delta of $250 million is a part of that $0.30 
calculation.
 
On the QCT side, we looked at a couple of data points. One is, kind of, how 
have the signal's changed bottoms
-
up from the OEMs that we've been 
receiving over the last three or four 
weeks, which kind of reflects the 
weakness they're seeing in the sell
-
through. We also looked at our OEMs and 
what their sell
-
through has been in certain regions where we have higher 
share. And it's a combination of those factors that we use to estimate th
e 
impact on QCT.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Got you. And I guess, as my follow
-
up, just going to the QTL side, one 
housekeeping item and then a kind of a bigger picture question on this. How 
is it relatively in line with your $1 billion to $1.2 billion estimate if the 
m
arket was 20% weaker in the March quarter? And then any sort of updates 
on the Huawei negotiations, now that you successfully got the OPPO and 
Vivo side done? And then finally anything on the FTC.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So on the QTL side for the March quar
ter, there are a couple of things 
that went in our favor. First is the weakness that we saw, the 21% on the 
handsets. If we look at the mix of the regions on that weakness it was more 
--
 
much more so in China and less in other regions. The impact in other 
regions came later in the quarter. And so, in terms of how that translates 
into a mix impact from a dollar perspective is a combination of which tier 
devices got impacted and then which with OEMs. So that's kind of one key 
factor.
 
The second factor, as I s
aid in my prepared remarks, was we also had some 
updates to previous royalty estimates, which kind of is part of our normal 
licensing program. You see some changes based on updated reporting we 
received from OEMs. So we had a little bit of that in the quar
ter that helped 
as well.
 
Alex Rogers
 
So, this is Alex. Let me handle the last two parts of the question. So the 
Huawei discussions are ongoing and we're still working on trying to negotiate 
a deal. And as we've discussed previously, both parties have 
the right to 
seek a binding arbitration to set new terms for a new deal going forward, but 
neither party has decided to do that yet. We're still engaged in the 
negotiation process. With respect to the FTC, look I think the first thing is, 
we have a lot of 
confidence in the merits of the appeal. But I think it's also 
important to go back to a basic touch point and that is the district court 
decision did not invalidate existing agreements. And so before during and 
after, we signed up essentially every major O
EM and many, many other 
OEMs in this context. And these agreements are not going to 
--
 
the notion 
that these agreements are going away actually is not a factor, because it 
never was an issue with this court opinion the way that came out. And the 
licensees 
continue to honor their agreements. So again, I think however the 
FTC matter turns out that aspect of the decision is not going to change.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Matt Rams
ay
 
Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Cristiano, I want to follow
-
up on 
I think a couple of data points you mentioned earlier just to make sure I got 
them right. You said 30% of units in China 5G at this point and something 
like 70% of device launch
es. And if I have those right maybe you could talk 
a little bit about the 5G carrier subsidies and promotional environment, and 
how aggressive the carriers may be in China? And how you think about that 
kind of aggressive 5G promotion sort of cascading thro
ugh the rest of the 
world markets as the rest of the world turns on 5G? Thanks.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Thank you, Matt for your question. So let me address the first one. So the 
data point is what we saw is 5G sell
-
in penetration reached 30% in the 
month of March.
 
That is up from 19% in demand for December. So you can 
see that the market continued to transition the devices towards 5G. And the 
other data point which is in the month of March of all the phone models 
launched in China 71% was 5G, which shows actually 5
G getting to all the 
different price points. So if you remember last quarter, we saw that with 
some of our platform, which is Snapdragon 700, we saw price points at $285 
for 5G devices. And I think that further validate the total 5G units for the 
year and 
I think China is going to be driving a lot of the volume. And our 
position with China remains very strong.
 
Now to your other questions about the 5G rollout. What we 
--
 
it's an 
interesting question. I think while we've seen some delays in places for 
example
 
like Europe where auctions have not yet been completed in all the 
countries. What we have seen is acceleration in some other places. For 
example, in the United States, some carriers are actually ahead of 
scheduling the build
-
out, taking advantage of proba
bly less traffic. And 
important to note that Japan had launched both 5G sub
-
6 and millimeter 
wave within the quarter and Korea Telecom announced millimeter wave in 
Korea before the end of 2020. So you may have some puts and takes. But in 
general, I think t
he 5G story remain intact. And if anything this current 
environment probably underscored the importance of connectivity in 
telecom. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein 
Research. Please proceed with your quest
ion.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to revisit QTL in the 
quarter. So I know you mentioned it was 
--
 
you had some mix benefits as 
well as catch ups. But I mean if units for the market were down 21% year
-
over
-
year. I know Chi
na units were down relative to I don't know 35% year
-
over
-
year give or take, 50% sequential. I mean your Q2 revenues were only 
down $50 million year
-
over
-
year. It was like 4%. I mean, the catch
-
up or 
adjustment must have been very sizable. Can you give us 
an idea of how 
much that adjustment or catch
-
up payment
-
wise and what was the driver of 
it? Was any of it coming from OPPO and Vivo? Like what would the QTL have 
been in the quarter without that catch
-
up?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yeah, hi, Stacy, it's Akash. So ma
ybe just to kind of quickly address the 
catch
-
up comments. The way the QTL model works and I think you're very 
familiar with this. We 
--
 
as we get reports from licensees in the past, 
sometimes we get updates from them in the future, as they kind of finish 
up 
their accounting of the units and the ASPs. So that usually results in a catch
-
up. The second is that if there are audit settlements that would give us 
catch
-
ups as well. And then really if we end up finalizing licenses, that would 
be a factor also. So 
there are several factors that cause it. And as you know, 
we've had a couple of these in our history consistently. Usually, the number 
is smaller. So we don't specifically talk about it. And there is a run rate in 
each quarter of these factors. Clearly, we
 
had a larger impact this time. But 
we 

 
Stacy Rasgon
 
[Indiscernible].
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
We are not disclosing the specific number at this point, but it is a significant 
impact and that's why we clearly highlighted it and outlined it. The other 
factor that 
I think I mentioned clearly was the fact that they were China 
units and there were 
--
 
significant portion of it was at the lower end had an 
impact as well. Also this is a handset decline. If you look at non
-
handsets, 
we saw 
--
 
we estimate somewhere in the 
5% to 7% range on impact of total 
units. So the weighted average impact across the market was smaller than 
the 21%.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Got it. And I guess does that reverse next quarter then, because you're 
guiding the market 30% below your expectations, but you
're only guiding 
your QTL revenues like 23% below normal expectations. So is that what's 
driving that boost? Is it the 5G mix? Is it because 
--
 
like what's going on 
there that's actually helping the revenues relative to the unit shortfall in Q3. 
Is that it
?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yeah, that's right Stacy. So there is a factor of that that is the impact to 
non
-
handset devices versus handset devices that's benefiting and that's why 
it's not down the full 30% in the third fiscal quarter.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
It's not one 
--
any one
-
timers or anything?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
We are not expecting that. I mean, as we kind of finish the quarter, we 
might see some benefits but that really happens as we get updated 
reporting from licensees and not something we forecast.
 
Operator
 
Thank 
you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mitch Steves
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm going to combine two into one 
because they're kind of related. So it's good to hear that C
hina's coming 
back online. I just had a couple of questions related to that. So number one 
is, how do we know that China is not really trying to stockpile a little bit of 
inventories ahead of a potential additional U.S.
-
China relationship getting 
worse?
 
An
d then secondly just any, sort of, like eyeball or any sort of rough metric 
to think about 2021? I think the majority of investors are looking out to next 
year in terms of what the impact is going to be. I mean, is there any 
granularity you can give in ter
ms of what you guys think the recovery is 
going to look like even if it's not quantitative? Thank you.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Well, I mean, we obviously spend a lot of time looking at the sell
-
in of 
chipsets versus the device sales and matching them and getting 
a sense of 
how the inventory profile is shaping out in China. Typically you would see a 
decline in inventory following Chinese New Year in the March quarter. And 
we've actually seen it play out consistent with our expectations and there's 
been a slight dec
line in inventory through the process.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And Mitch this is Steve. With respect to fiscal year 2021, I would say the 
general view within the company is that we need to be prepared for the 
opportunity that we think lays ahead. I mean, if you l
ook at fiscal 2021, we 
think we're in a much better position in terms of the economic situation.
 
And then the other thing that we've 
--
 
we're definitely getting from the 
market is just this desire to launch 5G and connectivity. I mean the 
--
 
I 
think there'
ll be some desire to increase infrastructure and some of the 
telemedicine tele 
--
 
the educate
-
from
-
home, work
-
from
-
home will be served 
through 5G here in the near
-
term and we need to be prepared for it. That's 
really how we're thinking about 2021 at this p
oint.
 
Mitch Steves
 
So no comment just in terms of it being like more of a You
-
shape or any sort 
of like shape of recovery for the smartphone side?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yeah. We haven't been trying to give a shape other than what we've talked 
about in terms of 
our market at this point. And as we've talked about 
internally in terms of the company, we're really trying to make sure that we 
are prepared to take advantage of any shape, recovery that appears. And so 
that's really how we're positioning the company, and
 
then trying to 
communicate the best we can in terms of how the market looks at least over 
the next quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Yeah, good afternoon, thank 
you for taking the question. I guess, first 
question, I was hoping you could perhaps speak to what you're hearing from 
your customers in China as they recover. What they're seeing, what 
customers' preference are in terms of mix price points and perhaps I g
uess 
what signals you're taking there. And then bringing to the rest of the world 
that underpins your overall recovery view?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Thanks C.J. for your question. This is Cristiano. Look, we have had a lot of 
engagement I think very frequent, I thi
nk with our customers right now not 
only China across the globe. But what we're seeing, it's phones are 
continuing to launch. And as Akash outlined we've kind of be tracking not 
only sell
-
in, but sell
-
out in the market and we see the market started to 
reco
ver. That's why we believe China, it can be a very good model of what 
we expect to see in other markets since their shift in time.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Okay. That's helpful. And then based on the attach rate on the front
-
end 
side and what you do know in terms of flag
ship launch coming in the back 
half of the year. Does that 1.5 times content in the move to 5G include what 
you're seeing both from 5G and RF front
-
end? Or is there upside there based 
on what you're seeing on the attach rate side?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Okay. So a couple of updates. We have been tracking a total number of 5G 
designs. In the quarter that now went up, we have now 375 5G devices 
announcing. And we repeat, continue to repeat for the absolute majority of 
those virtually all of them continue to
 
have our modem
-
to
-
antenna solution 
with RF front
-
end attach. And I think it got reflected in this quarter that this 
business is starting to have an inflection for QCT. It started to be 
meaningful. We're very happy with the results so far in the front end 
and we 
expect that to continue.
 
To your question about the 1.5 metric that holds remain true for us. And 
that 
--
 
even as the market scale down from flagship to the lower tiers like
-
for
-
like in the 700 tier or 600 tier or even 400 tiers we'll see that metri
c of 
1.5.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Hi, I guess I had 2. First on Huawei, they're really kind of an outlier now 
because we have OPPO, Vivo and Apple have all 
signed. And I guess at the 
same time obviously the U.S. is sort of turning up the heat on Huawei. So 
why would they sign now, if you're sort of one of the more obvious leverage 
points that China has in all of this. So the question there is how long do you 
let this go on with them? And sort of when do you decide to just arbitrate 
with them?
 
Alex Rogers
 
So, this is Alex. Look there are a number of environmental factors some that 
are 
--
 
maybe you can view as in one direction. Others can view in another 
directi
on. For example the Phase one outcome is good 
--
 
a good 
environment for moving toward a negotiated resolution here.
 
Look we're still in this negotiation. And so, we still are looking at this as 
something that we want to drive to a conclusion. The question 
of whether or 
not we have to trigger arbitration is still some months out. And so, we're 
going to keep moving with this and see if we can get this thing resolved. So 
I don't have an answer for you other than that.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Okay. I guess 
--
 
and then t
he second question is on OPPO and Vivo. I know 
there was a prior question on this but my question is around June. Because 
in the footnotes it sounds like there are some catch
-
up payments in June 
from these two licensees. Can you just help us quantify Akash
 
what the 
catch
-
ups are in June specifically? The footnote says near term. So I assume 
that all of the true
-
up for those two licensees will be in June? Thanks.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So this is really the accounts receivables that's outstanding that they're
 
going to pay going forward. And so as a part of our license agreement 
there's an alignment with them on kind of remaining payments that are 
outstanding and a very near
-
term schedule for them to finish those 
payments.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question 
comes from Christopher Rolland with 
Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
 
Christopher Rolland
 
Hi guys, tying into perhaps a earlier question. Can you talk about your 
adjacencies business? How big it is now and perhaps changes we've seen in 
the si
ze of that business since the TDK acquisition and then growth in 2019 
and any expectation for 2020 in that adjacency business as well?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, hi Chris. So at our Analyst Day we had kind of sized the total scale of 
those businesses when 
--
 
fo
r the fiscal year 2019. And then we gave an 
assumption forecast on how fast the market is going to grow approximately 
8% and with our target of matching or beating the market growth. And so 
that's the framework for forecasting those businesses and we're st
ill kind of 
on track along those lines.
 
In this environment one of the things we have seen is several of our 
businesses including IoT and networking they benefit from the work
-
from
-
home environment and we've seen a lot of strength in those areas.
 
Christoph
er Rolland
 
Excellent and then just tying into the RF more specifically. Are there any 
conditions? Or is it even technically possible for a situation which you would 
break up the various parts within your antenna module and sell them 
individually? For examp
le, could you sell just the transceiver? Or is this an 
all or nothing deal for you guys for millimeter wave or even sub
-
6? How are 
you thinking about that?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hey Chris, it's Cristiano. Thanks for the question. Look we have been very 
clear abou
t the technical advantages of the modem to antenna. But having 
said that, we have seen opportunities that we're starting to sell silicon in 
some of our competitors' baseband as well. And there is a number of 
different open interfaces.
 
So I think you will s
ee flexibility from Qualcomm, but we still feel strongly 
that you'll probably get the best performance when you actually have an 
integrated modem to antenna solution.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Simpson with Arete 
Research. Pleas
e proceed with your question.
 
Brett Simpson
 
Yes, thanks very much. A question for Akash. Can you maybe just help us 
with the split in the MSMs in the March quarter between 5G and 4G? And 
then just looking into June, which you've guided 125 million to 
145 million 
MSMs, again how would that look between 5G and 4G particularly now that 
the 765G starts to ramp up?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Hi, Brett. Yes. So we've so far not disclosed a breakdown of our MSM units. I 
mean it's clearly an important metric for us in t
erms of 5G penetration. The 
way you should think about it is, if you look at kind of the key launches in 
the premium and the high tier, we pretty much 

 
premium tier every launch 
that has happened has used our premium tier chip outside of Huawei. And 
so it
's really a mix of premium tier launches and volume in different regions 
and that could be one way to kind of back into a number for us for 5G 
versus 4G.
 
We will keep 

 
as we go forward we'll look at how we can get additional 
disclosures so that it gives u
s a sense 

 
it gives you guys a sense of the 
traction we have in 5G. Overall very strong design win pipeline across all 
customers. And we're seeing demand not just at premium tier but across 
high and mid
-
tiers as well for our 5G solutions.
 
Brett Simpson
 
Ok
ay. Thanks. Thanks, Akash. And maybe my follow
-
up for Cristiano. On 
millimeter wave, I just wanted to get your perspective given all the changes 
in the market in the last 90 days. I think in the past you talked about there's 
a mandatory 

 
millimeter wave i
s a mandatory feature for flagship 
smartphones in the U.S. for many U.S. operators. And we would see a 
Japanese and a Korean launch for millimeter wave. Is that still on track? And 
then how should we think about millimeter wave in the grand scheme of 
your 
overall 5G volumes this year? Thanks very much.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Brett, thanks for the question. Yes it remains a reality. And as we have 
probably mentioned earlier in some cases the current environment had 
accelerated the build
-
out of the new millimeter wav
e market. So it continues 
to be a requirement for flagships in the United States market.
 
We expect to see millimeter wave coming down to the high
-
tier as we're 
bringing the capability across our chipsets. We saw that IGA [ph] launch in 
Japan as expected. K
orea announced that they will provide millimeter wave 
service 

 
Korea Telecom announced within the calendar year. And we expect 
that to continue 2021, you'll start seeing this going to other markets as well.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. That concludes 
today's question
-
and
-
answer session. Mr. 
Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes. Thank you. First of all I just wanted to say thank you to the employees 
of Qualcomm. We obviously had a very unusual 
quarter with respect to the 
work environment. And even with that a very strong execution and I want to 
thank everyone for their hard work. I also want to remind everyone that I 
think the technologies we're all working on have probably never been more 
impor
tant than they are today. So thank you very much for your hard work 
and we look forward to taking advantage of everything that we're putting 
together. So thank you everybody. See you next quarter.

Mollenkopf.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone.
 
We delivered strong results this quarter with revenues at the high end of our 
guidance range and earnings per share well above the high end of our 
guidance range on strong operating performance and progress in licensing.
 
Our strong fiscal third quarter results reflect good execution across our 
businesses as we position the company f
or a return to growth. We are 
investing to expand our technology roadmap and lead in 5G, are pursuing 
new opportunities in fast growing areas that build on our core technologies 
and are committed to operational excellence.
 
In QTL, we are pleased to report 
that we made good progress on the 
outstanding license negotiations this quarter and receive reports for a 
significant amount of prior period sales. This is a good indication of the 
progress we are making and we expect that momentum to continue into our 
fou
rth fiscal quarter. We now have more than 110 companies that have 
signed licenses consistent with the terms of the NDRC resolution.
 
In QCT, the favorable demand trends for our new chipsets across the mid 
and high
-
end smartphone tier, especially with the to
p 10 vendors in China 
are helping to deliver improved financial performance. We are also seeing 
incremental demand for our lower tier chipsets in China versus our prior 
expectations driven in part by our differentiated all mode and modem 
leadership. In the
 
premium tier, our Snapdragon 820 now has more than 
150 premium smartphone and tablet designs and we have just announced 
the Snapdragon 821 which offers further performance enhancements and 
will help set a new bar for flagship smartphones increasingly popu
lar mobile 
VR head mounted displays and other new devices.
 
Our updated Snapdragon 600 and 400 product families are becoming the 
preferred choice for OEMs driving growth in the high and mid
-
tiers as users 
seek more performance and features in these segments
.
 
We continue to expand our presence in adjacent opportunities including 
automotive, networking, mobile compute and IOT. These industries are 
rapidly adopting smartphone technologies. Our leadership across 3G, 4G, 
5G, WiFi, multimedia, graphics, processor 
and RF front
-
end technologies 
positions us well for these new growth areas. Collectively, the addressable 
opportunity for these adjacent areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18% 
over the next five years from $12 billion to $29 billion according to a 
comb
ination of third
-
party and internal estimates.
 
In automotive, the pace of innovation is accelerating and we are seeing a 
strong alignment between the industry needs and Qualcomm's technologies. 
We continue to build momentum and strengthen our position thro
ugh 
significant design wins at global automakers. This includes telematics where 
our modem leadership is well
-
recognized, infotainment with our Snapdragon 
automobile processors and in connectivity with our WiFi Bluetooth and 
location products.
 
Our momentum
 
in IOT continues as customers turn to our broad offering of 
IOT development platforms to accelerate their product innovation. At 
CompuTech, we introduced the Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 1100 
processor for the fast growing targeted purpose wearable segments
 
such as 
watches, fitness trackers, smart headsets and wearable accessories.
 
Our Snapdragon flight platform as helped OEMs quickly commercialize new 
smaller, lighter drones leveraging Qualcomm's integrated SOC connectivity, 
GPS and drone software solutions
.
 
We are also extending our proven leadership in modem solutions into the 
Internet of Things with over 100 design from more than 60 manufacturers 
using our low power LTE IOT modems. In networking, we continue to drive 
the transition to the new Wave 2 11ac 
standard for WiFi networks and now 
have over 350 home and enterprise products either in production or design 
across mainstream and premium segments.
 
We are on track to close our TDK JV by early calendar 2017 and to deliver 
our next generation Gallium arsen
ide and CMOS PAs in 2017. This will 
enable us to provide a comprehensive set of technologies and module 
capability for the RF front
-
end positioning us well for key industry trends, 
complexity increases within smartphones, the proliferation of radio bands i
n 
4G and 5G and the growth of cellular in IOT.
 
We are on track to deliver operating margins of 16% or better in QCT in the 
fourth fiscal quarter and it is important to note that our planning 
assumptions incorporates second sourcing at our large modem custo
mer.
 
Looking forward, our global scale technology leadership and differentiated 
chipset roadmap across multiple tiers and regions and dozens of spectrum 
bands continues to position us well for the future.
 
Our modem expertise continues to lead the industry 
and as we did in both 
3G and 4G, we are leading the world to 5G. 5G will make wireless broadband 
indistinguishable from wireline requiring devices with ultra high
-
speed, ultra 
low
-
latency and ultra reliable connectivity. The technology roadmap required 
for
 
5G will drive significant advancements in modem and front
-
end features, 
the technologies in which Qualcomm excels.
 
Let me take a moment to review a few of our core strengths that will 
underscore our continued wireless broadband leadership. Our gigabit LTE
 
leadership with the Snapdragon X16 modem will pave the way to 5G. Many 
of the technologies enabling gigabit LTE will be common to 5G, use of more 
antennas, use of multiple types of spectrum simultaneously, more 
sophisticated signal processing et cetera. A
nd the mastery of these features 
in 4G will be essential to leadership in 5G. Many of these features are 
already being trialed or commercially deployed in phones using our 
Snapdragon 820 processor X12 LTE.
 
Qualcomm also pioneered 802.11ad operating at 60 g
igahertz, which is 
shipping into access points and computing devices today. The design and 
commercialization of this technology into smartphones is enabling the 
company to build leadership and expertise in the high
-
band known as 
millimeter wave to be deplo
yed broadly in 5G.
 
We are also designing a new OFDM based 5G air interface that will not only 
enhance mobile broadband services but also enable connectivity and 
management for the Internet of Things and new types of mission critical 
services. Our 5G design
 
is intended to get the most out of the wide array of 
spectrum available across regulatory paradigms in bands from low bands 
below 1
-
gigahertz to mid bands from 1
-
gigahertz to 6
-
gigahertz to 
millimeter wave. 5G devices will bring the next level of converge
nce with the 
ability to work on licensed and shared spectrum concurrently. We are very 
pleased that regulators around the world are beginning to allocate spectrum 
for 5G consistent with our 5G design and development efforts.
 
Recent spectrum regulatory deci
sions and movement in the U.S. and Europe 
combined with progress on the spectrum regulatory front in China, Japan 
and Korea are good indications that the world is preparing for 5G.
 
We recently announced our new 5G prototype system and trial platform 
operat
ing in spectrum band below 6
-
gigahertz and showcasing multi gigabit 
throughput at low latency. We demonstrated a prototype system at Mobile 
World Congress Shanghai in collaboration with China Mobile. The new 
prototype adds to our existing 5G millimeter wav
e prototype system 
operating at the 28
-
gigahertz millimeter wave band and is capable of robust 
mobile broadband communications in non
-
line
-
of
-
sight environments.
 
We are utilizing these prototype systems to test and demonstrate our 
innovative 5G designs to 
drive 3GPP, 5G, new radio standardization and 
enable timely 5G NR trials in anticipation of future commercial network 
launches.
 
To summarize, fiscal 2016 has been a transition year for Qualcomm, which 
has played out largely as expected. Our strong results 
this quarter reflect a 
good progress, we have made positioning the company for improved 
financial performance and continued technology leadership in mobile and the 
many exciting new industries and product enabled by our smartphone 
technologies.
 
We are cont
inuing to make progress in our licensing business and expect 
that momentum to continue positioning us well for the future.
 
I will now turn the call over to Derek Aberle.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone.
 
As Steve noted, we 
made significant progress in the licensing business this 
quarter both in terms of new agreement signed and catch up amounts 
reported. As a result, QTL had a very strong fiscal third quarter with total 
reported device sales of approximately $62.6 billion an
d revenues of $2 
billion driven primarily by the catch
-
up reporting of certain prior period sales 
and revenue as well as stronger than expected 3G, 4G device ASPs.
 
As a reminder, as a result of the resolution of our dispute with LG in April, in 
the fiscal 
third quarter we recognized over $200 million in revenue for sales 
reported during the prior two fiscal quarters and resumed to recognizing 
quarterly LG revenues for sales reported in the third quarter consistent with 
our prior guidance.
 
We continued to ma
ke steady progress in China executing new license 
agreements. In addition, we are still actively negotiating with a small 
number of the key remaining Chinese OEMs and making progress in those 
discussions. Based on the progress we are making, those licensee
s agreed to 
report and pay a portion of the sales and royalties they have been 
withholding while we continued to negotiate their new agreements. These 
amounts plus additional catch
-
up payments we received from other licensees 
during the quarter resulted in
 
more than $200 million in revenues in QTL for 
the third fiscal quarter related to prior period activity.
 
QTL revenue for the quarter therefore included a total of more than $400 
million in revenue related to prior period activity as a result of the LG 
res
olution and these catch
-
up payments.
 
As we have said in the past, we are prepared to take action against OEMs 
that are not negotiating in good faith to conclude license agreements or 
underreporting to royalties they owe us. Consistent with that approach in
 
June, we filed complaints against Meizu in the Intellectual Property Courts in 
both Beijing and Shanghai, China. Regrettably, we have had to turn to 
litigation against Meizu in order to protect our rights and importantly to 
maintain fairness in a level pl
aying field for the companies that are 
respectful of intellectual property rights and have entered into license 
agreements in accordance with the resolution reached by Qualcomm and the 
NDRC.
 
We are also continuing to work hard on a number of fronts to impr
ove 
compliance. We are actively implementing our compliance plans and expect 
them to deliver a meaningful improvements over time.
 
Looking ahead, we continue to estimate calendar 2016 global 3G, 4G device 
shipments of 1.625 to 1.725 billion devices with yea
r
-
over
-
year unit growth 
of approximately 8% at the mid
-
point. We continue to see a strong 4G ramp 
in China as each of the operators pursues aggressive subscribe growth 
targets with their 4G plus service offerings and design momentum continues 
to move rapid
ly towards all mode devices across China.
 
Other emerging regions continue to be negatively impacted by 
macroeconomic headwinds. Outside of handsets, growth in automotive 
telematics is offsetting weaker tablet volumes.
 
We continue to expect low single
-
digit
 
growth in global 3G, 4G device sales 
in fiscal 2016 consistent with our prior guidance reflecting strong unit growth 
partially offset by ASP declines that are consistent with our prior 
expectations. We continue to expect that the rate at which handset ASP
s will 
decline during the fiscal 2016 will be about 50% of the rate of decline 
experienced in fiscal 2015.
 
In terms of the outlook for QTL for the fiscal year, we now expect revenue to 
be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We have narrowed the range to
 
align with our current view of expected progress in China for the remainder 
of the fiscal year including increased confidence that we will conclude 
additional agreements with some other remaining key OEMs within the fiscal 
year.
 
Although, we expect to con
tinue to see quarterly fluctuations in the 
externally implied royalty rate for the reasons we have previously explained, 
we expect the rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 2.9%.
 
With respect to the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation of our 
li
censing practices, we have now submitted an extensive response to the 
case teams report and have entered the hearing phase with the 
commissioners. During this phase, the commission will conduct a series of 
hearings over the next few months during which we 
expect to have the 
opportunity to further present our response. The first hearing was held 
earlier today in Korea in contrary to the recent press reports, the 
commission has not reached a decision in our case.
 
In conclusion, we continue to make good progre
ss in China. We are keenly 
focused on concluding agreements with the remaining OEMs as well as 
improving compliance and are working towards continued progress in the 
fourth fiscal quarter.
 
That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to Ge
orge.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon everyone.
 
We are pleased to report a very strong fiscal third quarter. Revenues were 
$6 billion up 4% year
-
over
-
year and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were 
$1.16 up 17% year
-
over
-
year. We ended the quar
ter with cash and 
marketable securities of $31 billion reflecting strong operating cash flow of 
approximately 30% of revenue in the quarter and the acceleration of our 
share repurchase activity into the first half of the year.
 
Through our fiscal third quar
ter, we have returned approximately 120% of 
free cash flow or more than $5.9 billion to stockholders this fiscal year 
including the completion of the remainder of our 10 billion stock repurchase 
commitments. And we are on track to achieve our targeted 75% 
return to 
cash flow in fiscal 2016.
 
Our third quarter results reflect both our commitment to operational 
efficiency and the strong performance of our operating businesses. 
Performance above the high
-
end of our guidance range primarily came from 
continued p
rogress in our licensing business in China.
 
In QCT, MSM shipments were $201 million approximately 9% above the 
mid
-
point of our prior guidance range reflecting greater than expected 
demand in the low
-
tier particularly in China.
 
QCT operating margin had 9.5
% was inline with our prior expectations on 
higher volume and cost reductions with increased low
-
tier demand impacting 
our product mix and revenue per MSM versus expectations.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses overall were lower than 
forecast decreas
ing 2% sequentially reflecting continued cost initiatives. Our 
non
-
GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 19% up modestly against 
expectations as a result of a higher mix of licensing revenues in the quarter. 
We continued to expect our non
-
GAAP tax rate to b
e approximately 18% for 
fiscal 2016.
 
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range 
of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion up approximately 6% year
-
over
-
year at the mid
-
point. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in
 
our 
fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $1.05 to $1.15 per share up 
approximately 21% year
-
over
-
year at the mid
-
point.
 
We expect fiscal fourth quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses will be down approximately 2% to 4% sequentially reflectin
g 
further strategic realignment plan cost actions particularly in QCT.
 
In QTL, as Derek mentioned our fiscal year revenue outlook is $7.4 billion to 
$7.8 billion and we believe our recent licensing progress will continue 
throughout the remainder of the yea
r. Aligned with that view, our revenue 
guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter assumes some additional progress in 
China. However, our fourth quarter guidance does not include the full 
potential benefit from the completion of all license agreements under 
ne
gotiation and is consistent with the low
-
end of the QTL range for the full 
fiscal year.
 
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate total reported device sales of 
between $57 billion and $65 billion. Our TRDS forecast reflects our estimate 
that global devic
e sales will be lower year
-
over
-
year reflecting a decline in 
the premium tier at a large OEM partially offset by the impact of closing new 
licensing agreements and the resulting catch
-
up we expect to receive.
 
Like our revenue guidance, this 
forecast includes the impact of closing some 
but not all of the remaining agreements in China.
 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 215 
million units and operating margin to improve sequentially to 16% or better 
consistent wi
th our prior operating margin target.
 
Our QCT operating margin forecast reflects the strength of our new product 
cycle, our cost actions throughout the year as well as strong demand from 
mid and high
-
tier devices.
 
Now, turning to fiscal 2016. We remain on 
track to meet the $1.4 billion 
reduction in spending under our strategic realignment plan and we continue 
to expect more than $700 million of savings in fiscal 2016 relative to the 
SRP baseline, ahead of our original $600 million target.
 
A summary of the s
avings program is included in the Investor presentation 
for this call on our Web site. We continue to expect fiscal 2015 non
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down approximately 2% to 4% 
year
-
over
-
year, which includes the full year impact of acquis
ition related 
increases of approximately 5%. Adjusting for M&A, estimated spending in 
these areas will be down 7% to 9% year
-
over
-
year.
 
We are committed to maintaining a strong discipline of cost management, 
while remaining extremely focused on the importa
nt role Qualcomm will play 
as the leading innovator in mobile technology solutions.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.

Question

and

Answer Session
 
Op
erator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of 
Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Hi. Thank you for breaking out the benefit to QTL from the China catch
-
up 
royalties. Would you be ab
le to also breakout the contribution to units and 
the level of ASPs for that catch up? And then, is there much left in terms of 
the already signed agreements that is yet to be recognized?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Simona, hey, it's Derek. Yes, I think we are not in a p
osition today to 
breakout the split of TRDS kind of units in ASP that came in through the 
catch
-
up payments in Q3. I think, if you look at it, you sort of look at it for 
the year, you will be able to see that we are sort of making progress and 
closing the 
gap and if we continue to make progress and close these key 
remaining agreements. We talked at the Analyst Day of being in a position 
to capture about 75% of the global sales from the Chinese OEMs. I think 
we'll actually sort of on an exit rate basis, if w
e can close these remaining 
deals, it will be better than that.
 
So I think it's just a continued story of progress and you are starting to see 
the results were all through this quarter.
 
George Davis
 
Simona in terms of the upside to guidance as we indicated
 
our Q4 guidance 
is really set at the low
-
end of the full year range for QTL. So the upside 
would be the agreements in addition to the ones that we expect to sign that 
we put into the guidance. There is still $400 million of revenue upside that is 
possible
 
for the quarter and not in our guidance.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord 
Genuity. Please go ahead.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Hi. Thank you. Derek just another question on QTL, with the progress in 
China certainly encourag
ing and as you continue to make progress with a 
few of these other large Chinese OEMs, how should we maybe think about 
the exit rate basis in terms of maybe units you believe are being 
underreported entering fiscal 2017, do you think it's still more than m
aybe 
10% of the market under reporting or are you getting close to those levels?
 
And then, just overall high level how is this progress as you exit the year 
relative to your expectations towards your longer term $10 billion in QTL 
revenue by 2020? Thank yo
u.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Mike, this is Derek. So I think the way to think about it is sort of if I bridge 
back to the answer I was just giving to Simona's question we continue to 
believe that if we can close these remaining agreements that the exit rate 
actually on
 
the China portion of the global sales 
--
 
Chinese OEM portion will 
now be north of 75%. And I think, if you look that also in terms of then the 
global sales, it would be less than 10% on a run rate basis going forward. 
And what we have seen actually is, so
me of these key Chinese OEMs have 
actually been gaining share. And so we will get an even larger benefit on a 
run rate basis, if we can close out the remaining couple of agreements we 
have here.
 
Warren Kneeshaw
 
The second question.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Oh, 
yes. And I would say, basically we are 
--
 
I think the progress we are 
making in China and the view in the market we see is consistent with what 
we talked about in terms of the $10 billion target.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Tim long 
with BMO Capital 
Markets. Please go ahead.
 
Tim Long
 
Thank you. Just sticking on the same topic, it's hard to beat it too much. It 
looks like Derek, the markets units were only down about 4% sequential, so 
I'm assuming that's some prior period catch
-
up. So,
 
if we were to normalize 
the full year 8% growth, would that be lower because of those aren't in 
there and maybe if you could just give us a sense, I don't know if that's 
breaking out those numbers too much?
 
And then, just on the chip side, I think I just 
wanted to hit on the gross 
margin. I guess, was it mix that caused it to be down even though the ASPs 
were up in the quarter and what's kind of the outlook for the next few 
quarters on the gross margin line for QCT? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hi, Tim. It's De
rek. So on the first question, yes, the units in Q3 would have 
included some amount of catch up which rolled into the catch up number 
that we talked about. If we look back, you will see we have effectively held 
our unit call for calendar 2016, which is abo
ut as you said about an 8% 
year
-
over
-
year growth, obviously that has quarterly fluctuation given 
seasonality and other variability. I would say largely from a market 
standpoint things are tracking in line with what we would have expected last 
quarter. We t
alked about China being stronger, some softness in the 
premium tier and a little bit of weakness in some of the emerging markets 
but the net
-
net still giving us confidence that the 8% forecast was good. You 
may have seen China reported numbers out recently
 
probably stronger than 
most people had expected and largely in line with what we thought would 
happen there.
 
George Davis
 
Hi, Tim. It's George. I think we don't break out the gross margin, but I think 
your point is on revenue per MSM. And yes, it was a li
ttle soft during the 
quarter than we had expected on mix. Obviously, the unit story was quite 
good and in particular we saw a lot of strength in the low
-
tier. Gross margin 
is going to be a good story for us as you look into the end of the year, you 
are goi
ng to see the impact of not only a very strong set of new products 
starting to get the lift in the marketplace in Q4. But, the adjacent business 
continues to do well, our adjacent businesses are continuing to do well. And 
of course, we reiterated the 16% o
p margin for QCT and that being said, it 
will also benefit from the OpEx actions that we are taking in the quarter as 
well. So, good story overall for QCT.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahe
ad.
 
James Faucette
 
Thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow
-
up question as it relates to the 
collection that you guys are doing or the payments et cetera. Derek maybe 
you can just talk a little bit about how we should think both timing, but also 
what maybe th
e long
-
term implications are. I guess just a little more color 
on anything that you can say as to why the negotiations with [indiscernible] 
the outstanding licensees are still there? And at what point do you feel like 
you end up having to do something alon
g the lines of filings through with 
Meizu? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yes, James. It's Derek. So I think the way to look at it is, we have this small 
group of licensees that were withholding their reports and payments while 
they continue to negotiate. And tha
t was inconsistent with what a lot of the 
other companies did. And I think the way to look at that is, given the 
progress that we have made within the last quarter with those companies 
towards closing agreements which aren't yet closed, but we are making 
p
rogress towards that and sort of put them in a position to feel the right 
thing to do was to go ahead and report a portion of the prior period sales 
which is what roll through in the quarter.
 
Taking that up a level, as I said, for the year at the Analyst D
ay we talked 
about, if we could close these key deals, we would basically be sort of on an 
run rate basis collecting on about 75% of the total sales by the Chinese 
OEMs, and then, there would be additional compliance work we would need 
to do to kind of clo
se the gap on the remainder.
 
I would say now as we look at that picture, if we accomplish the same goal 
this year meaning that closing the agreements, the exit rate will actually be 
north of that 75%. And then, of course, we are already actively moving on 
a 
number of fronts to improve the compliance in other areas.
 
So, I think that's largely tracking in line with our plans and as you can see if 
there are companies that we believe we are not making progress with and 
we won't conclude agreements with because 
they are not negotiating in 
good faith we will take action against them and that's what we did against 
Meizu. We don't feel like at the moment with other companies, but of course 
that could change in the future. Our current view though is we are making 
pro
gress and we have higher confidence now than we did a quarter ago that 
we will be able to close those deals within the year.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit 
Suisse. Please go ahead.
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
Thanks. J
ust a couple of quick ones. Derek for you, just a clarification on the 
licensing side. You said that it was $400 million worth of catch
-
up payments 
from Samsung and from the Chinese OEMs. There is going to be some catch
-
up payments already included in your
 
Q4 guidance and [indiscernible] for 
QTL, I assume and eventually those catch
-
up payments tail
-
off to zero 
because it's an ongoing run rate. I just want to clarify if that's the way it 
works.
 
And the second part of the QTL, is that, this move from 75% comp
liance to 
move towards the 700% is it, as you exit this year, is that more about 
getting your existing licensees are reporting to 100% comply under all of 
their units or is it signing are still further you made your vendors? Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Kulbinder,
 
it's Derek here. On the 
--
 
we basically said the combined catch
-
up 
amounts across is actually LG not Samsung. LG and the companies that then 
reported some prior period activity was in the quarter north of $400 million. 
If you think about Q4 as George ment
ioned, the way we looked at that kind 
of throughout the year we had a little bit of a difference in the way we 
treated guidance meaning the QTL full year revenue guidance as always 
included revenues associated with closing new deals. But that, when we 
were
 
just guiding one quarter out, we have been cautious and not including 
the benefit of what would be required to close those deals within the 
quarter.
 
Now, as we get towards the end of the year with just Q4 remaining and we 
look at the progress we are 
making, we have effectively narrowed the range 
brought up the low
-
end of the range. And as George said, while we have 
included some amount of benefit from closing new deals but not the full 
benefit. So what's rolling through our Q4 guidance is really consi
stent with 
the low
-
end of the full year QTL revenue guidance. And then, there is 
incremental revenue that would come from closing additional deals in the 
quarter which we 
--
 
we believe is possible which is why we have continued 
to have a higher range for t
he full year on QTL.
 
Going forward, I think the way to think about the run rate is, again, if we get 
that done, we will be north of probably 75% of the Chinese OEM sales on a 
run rate basis, which would mean sort of the under reporting percentage of 
total 
global sales would be less than 10%. And then, to really close the gap 
on that is going to be a combination of 
--
 
I would say signing up some of the 
smaller players as well as obviously we have the dispute with Meizu. And 
then, driving higher compliance fr
om some of the companies that are 
already licensed and just not reporting their full sales. So it will be a kind of 
a combination of a few different elements there.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go 
ahead.
 
Rod Hall
 
Yes, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to come back to 
QTL in the mid
-
point. Your mid
-
point guidance in QTL is down $0.5 billion 
and so I get all the commentary around the puts and takes. But, I'm just 
trying to understand what 
caused that shift down in the mid
-
point, is it 
demand, is it ASPs, is it the catch
-
up payments for quite as much as you 
thought? And then, can you help me understand what's going on there? And 
then, I have one follow
-
up on that was well.
 
George Davis
 
Hi, R
od. It's George. So, yes, the mid
-
point, if you do the 73 to the 28 
versus 740, yes, it's down a 500. I wouldn't read anything into it. There is a 
number of agreements that were put within that space. We have tired to 
every quarter give an update on where 
we think the range is going. And 
even last quarter we said it looks because of the market and some other 
issues, the range is probably had a little more downside, but we held the 
low
-
end of the range based on progress.
 
So, we are constantly adjusting to ma
ke sure that we reflect what's possible. 
You've also seen us take some litigation action which actually puts things 
outside the 
--
 
potentially outside the window for the year. But, there is a 
number of factors that went into the range. And so, I wouldn't o
ver read a 
$50 million change. And again, we are guiding to the low
-
end of the range, 
which means we have significant upside to that, if we are able to sign more 
agreements.
 
Rod Hall
 
Okay. And then, I just also wanted to ask you the 16% exit rate, you said
 
that's now 
--
 
it sounds like a minimum and I just wonder how conservative it 
is that margin exit rate now that you know more about market share 
changes et cetera in the back end of this year. Can you just comment a little 
bit about, do you feel that's a v
ery conservative number now or is it as 
conservative as when you started out with that 16% exit rate, just give us 
some idea there.
 
George Davis
 
We are pleased with what we have seen in the marketplace. As you know, 
the year probably overall has been a lit
tle softer in the premium tier than we 
would have thought. So, but we have also made good progress on both 
market share and on the 
--
 
our cost efforts relative to expectations going in. 
So, I think overall, we feel comfortable reiterating but I really don'
t want to 
characterize it beyond that.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & 
Company. Please go ahead.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Thank you. I had two questions. I guess the first one, Derek, I'm still trying 
to maybe get at wh
at some people are asking about the pro forma royalty 
rate. So maybe can you 
--
 
maybe pro forma out for us, what the royalty rate 
was net off all the catch
-
up payments in June? And then, maybe what the 
pro forma royalty rate would be for September as well?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yes, Tim. This is Derek. I think the way to think about it is, we 
--
 
on my 
script we included a statement for the full fiscal year that we believe for the 
full year will be around the 2.9% level. I think if you try to kind of normalize 
Q3 to 
adjust for the prior period activity things like the LG resolution which 
pushed the rate up. I think it would be in that range as well for the quarter.
 
Q4, we believe will be down sequentially but it's really hard to give you a 
forecast on that just becaus
e it will be fairly dependent on 
--
 
how many of 
the deals we get resolved within the quarter and how much catch
-
up comes 
in as you might remember some of the guys that were still negotiating with 
were larger 
--
 
historically larger three
-
mode players and th
e rate on three
-
mode devices is lower than on other devices. And so that could have within 
the quarter when that catch
-
up comes in could have a dilutive effect.
 
But, we are still comfortable with the longer term view on the rate that we 
talked about in Feb
ruary and also for the year that I mentioned today.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess just my follow
-
up is really for Steve and 
the team. Can you talk a little more about 5G and you guys were talking 
more about this every call. So, I guess t
he question is really about timing 
and your position in the standards and sort of when that will be finalized and 
what's your IP position will be for 5G relative to what it has been for 3G, 4G? 
Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure. Time, its Steve. In general, we
 
are obviously trying to drive 5G as 
quickly as we can. It's an area which we think to be a strong player in 5G, 
you have to be a strong player in 4G, 3G and WiFi and consequentially we 
think that we will maintain a very strong IP position moving forward. 
The 
standards bodies are working on that right now. So, I think we have a lot of 
visibility into the strength of our submissions as well as to how the industry 
is unfolding.
 
I think in general, if you'd have asked me that question, a year ago, I would 
have
 
said that it would have happened closer to 2020. Certainly over the last 
year and accelerating here over the last quarter there has been a real pull to 
push that in or to pull that in closer to 2018/2019 timeframe depending on 
what the deployment is. And 
of course, we are going to support that with 
our products and with our standards submissions and all the R&D that we 
are doing. And as you would expect we are accelerating as well as protecting 
that R&D as we are repositioning the company for growth. And I
 
think it will 
be a good story for Qualcomm here over the next decade.

Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. 
Please go ahead.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on QCT, you 
talked 
about outside from the China market, it's been a lot of concerns about 
maybe some overbuilds, you have the best perspective knowing what you 
shift in versus what selling through. Just your perspective on China maybe 
seasonality as you get into Decem
ber. And then, you said, you factored in 
some second sourcing out of marquee phone, do you think that share that 
you will have ultimately on this generation is sustainable?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Okay. This is Cristiano. Thank you for your question. First, maybe 
a
ddressing China, I think as we said in addition to seeing stronger demand 
for high and mid and even low tier units and then it also give us a higher 
unit in the quarter. I think we are seeing significant traction within our new 
product family not only the 
Snapdragon 800 but more important the 600 and 
400 tiers. And we see that market in China is moving up, we spoke earlier in 
other calls about things such as all mode and care aggregation. We see that 
is materializing all
-
mode is becoming the preferred confi
guration which is a 
multi
-
mode solution across all the carriers in China and I think here, China 
exactly moving faster to higher speeds. So we see that exactly a positive 
trend for Qualcomm in particular as the market in China moving up.
 
With regards to ho
w we view about second sourcing and one large customer, 
I think we said very, very clear that's our planning assumption and we 
stayed within 
--
 
driving towards to meet our commitments in 2016 and I 
think that has no impact in our 16% projection of operatin
g margin for QCT.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein 
Research. Please go ahead.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering if you could 
give us an indication of where you saw a 
revenue per MSM trending in Q4? 
And secondly, I wanted to get your thoughts on operating margins as we go 
into next year, do you think 15% in Q4 will be the trough for operating 
margins as we go through 2017, they should never drop below that?
 
George Davis
 
Hey, Stacy. It's George. Again, we would expect to see strong revenue per 
MSM again in the fourth quarter and so not giving a specific guide. But, if 
you look at the product mix and you look at where we are seeing an up tick 
and the positioning of our new
 
products, it's all consistent with improved 
revenue per MSM, also of course the adjacent businesses contribute to that 
as well as they did in the third quarter.
 
We are not going to guide 2017 at this time and but we are pleased with the 
progress that we a
re making on the cost program and we think that will 
certainly carry into 2017 but we are not going to forecast margin at this 
time.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Amit Shah with Nomura. Please 
go ahead.
 
Amit Shah
 
Yes. Thank you. Just o
n the second sourcing with the key customer, just 
wondering if you guys can give us some feel for whether you were able to 
obtain majority share and looking into next year, you talked a little bit about 
gigabit LTE that you are going to have with the X16 S
napdragon. Is that an 
important factor as you all think about design wins in 2017, I think the 
feedback from some of the competition is that while it's ahead, 1
-
gigabit 
download this will be fairly rare in practice and not really a variable when it 
comes t
o design wins.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hey, Amit. Thanks for your question. This is Cristiano. So I will try to 
--
 
it's 
very difficult for us to comment specifically about our customer plans with 
regards to volume and share. I think what I can say as 
--
 
we 
always had 
second sourcing in our business in QCT throughout the year. And I think, we 
have always rely and to strengthen our product roadmap and technology 
transitions to drive value and volume from our solutions.
 
That I think that leads into your second 
question. I believe the gigabit LTE 
transition, it is going to get a lot of traction across all the developed 
markets. And also, you are going to see that as pre
-
deployment ahead of 
5G. I think the ability to drive gigabit LTE technology with 4G using adva
nce 
or other techniques is going to be key to drive a transition of 5G. And I think 
in addition to that we see both the WiFi and the LTE evolving at the same 
time across license in a licensed spectrum.
 
As in a licensed spectrum with 3GPP is standard, it's 
called LAA and license 
spectrum becomes available that's going to give many operators worldwide 
the ability to get to gigabit speeds. And we are very confident about the 
ability to build that with a roadmap.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And this is Steve. The only thi
ng I would add is, I think betting against 
feature leadership at the modem level has never been a good way to build a 
sustainable business. We think it continues to be a defensible franchise. And 
in fact, if you look at the strength that we are seeing in t
he business today 
in China, I think its good proof that that you do not want to be on a wrong 
side of modem feature leadership and we think that becomes continues to 
be important and becomes even more important as the industry transitions 
to 5G. So we feel
 
like we are on a good support to maintain position on the 
modem franchise.

Your next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. 
Please go ahead.
 
Tal Liani
 
Hi, guys. Is there any impact on pricing of the competition with Intel
? And 
second about QCT, when should we see the bulk of the 820 RAM hitting the 
numbers? I'm trying to model this properly since the ASP so much higher 
than the average and I don't know if you expect 
--
 
you expect it to hit the 
certain time or more moderate
 
growth kind of across many quarters. 
Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Tal, obviously, we can't specifically talk about anyone customers pricing. But 
I can tell you or reiterate what I said about going Q3 to Q4, part of how we 
are going to be getting the operating
 
margin to 16% is a strength that both 
the gross margin level and across our product suite. So I think we feel very 
good about the positioning of our products and the ASP implications to that.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi. I think Tal and to comment on the 820 
RAM, I think we will continue to 
see 820 launches throughout the year. I think you have the normal 
seasonality of the holiday season. But also, you have now different 
seasonality in China as well. So, I think, we will continue to see 820 
launches throughou
t the year and when we get into 2017, you are going to 
start to see launches regarding the next generation platform.

Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Please

CJ Muse
 
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking
 
my questions. I guess two quick ones. 
First one, can you share what the dollar value of catch
-
up payment is 
embedded in your September Q revenue guide? And then, secondly, if I look 
at your EPS guide and your QCT operating margin guide, it seems to sugges
t 
that PBT margin for QTL closer to 74% versus 86% last Q. Curious, if you 
could walk through what's driving that down tech? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So for QTL, we would expect obviously, we are coming down quarter
-
over
-
quarter relative to the 
--
 
because o
f the amount of 
--
 
kind of out of period 
items that were in Q3, spending, staying flat will impact operating margin 
not as much as certainly what you are forecasting. We haven't guided the 
amount of licensing that we anticipate assigning but, it's not a ma
terial 
amount, but there is some 
--
 
included in our guidance forecast.

Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond 
James. Please go ahead.
 
Tavis McCourt
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Derek, I wonder you gave us
 
the 
catch
-
up payments for the fiscal third quarter embedded in the $7.4 billion 
to $7.8 billion guidance for QTL, can you give us the full year estimate or if 
it's a range of catch up payments?
 
And then, secondly, Steve on the gigabit LTE, I missed it bef
ore, was that in 
the roadmap for next year's modem, have you said that specifically? And if 
so, what level of carrier aggregation would be needed for that? Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Tavis, its Derek. So, we are not going to break out specifically what's in the 
-
-
 
how much catch
-
up was in the sort of in the range. The way to think about 
it though is, sort of the two of the larger companies that we have been 
negotiating with have been withholding payments. This quarter reported and 
we recognized more than $200 mil
lion of catch
-
up payments related to 
them. That's not the entirety of the catch
-
up amount, but it's obviously a 
significant portion.
 
And then, as you think about what catch
-
up means, there is obviously some 
2015 activity but now we are half way 
--
 
essentia
lly half
-
way through 2016, 
so there will be additional catch
-
up. So you have in
-
quarter activity plus 
catch
-
up payments related to those agreements when they get signed and if 
that happens in the fourth quarter that would roll through there. But, pretty 
ha
rd for us to give more color than that just given the timing and 
uncertainty of when they will get done and how much we will roll through in

Hi, Tavis. This is Cristiano. To your question on gigabit LTE; gigabit LTE I 
think we a
lready sampled some of the first products of gigabit LTE, you are 
going to see this in product throughout next calendar year, maybe some of 
the early products could come as early as this calendar year. And you need a 
three or four carrier aggregation to be
 
able to do this. One important thing 
is, you have a lot of carriers today doing three carrier aggregation today. I 
think that plus four carrier aggregation, you can get to gigabit speeds.

Your next question comes from the line of Brett Simpson wi
th Arete. Please 
go ahead.
 
Brett Simpson
 
Yes. Thanks very much. First question for Derek on QTL, so just looking at 
the China license agreement that you are signing off late, my understanding 
is, they don't include implementation patents anymore and you ha
ve an 
outlook for $10 billion of QTL revenue by 2020. Can you talk about how you 
might monetize your non
-
standard essential patents, your implementation 
patents in the future? Should we expect Qualcomm to consider separating 
implementation patents, are the
re separate license agreement with your 
customers as you move towards let's say 5G?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hey, Brett. This is Derek. You are correct as it relates to China. So as part of 
the NDRC resolution, we committed to offer licenses to 
--
 
actually not even 
th
e entirety of our essential patent portfolio. But, the 3G, 4G standard 
essential patents in China. And so, in a sense that has resulted in us doing 
something different in China than we have done historically which is a 
disaggregation of the portfolio.
 
And 
as I said in the past, we do believe there is an opportunity to monetize 
the remainder of the portfolio. Our focus has been really sort of a sequenced 
approach meaning try to get through the all of the key deals covering the 
3G/4G portfolio and I think we 
are getting towards the finish line on that. 
And then, once we do that, I think there is a number of different 
opportunities and ways that we are thinking through monetizing the 
remainder of the portfolio.
 
And as you may recall that we mentioned that wasn'
t built in even to the 
$10 billion number that we have talked about in February. So, we do think 
there is an opportunity there over time.

Your next question comes from the line of Ed Snyder with Charter Equity 
Research. Please go ahead.
 
Ed 
Snyder
 
Thanks a lot. Steve, you mentioned that to be strong in 5G, you really have 
to be strong in 4G given the legacy standard, isn't that also the case to 
some extent with 4G that you had to be fairly strong in 3G, and how does 
that impacted the second s
ourcing and some of your larger customers. Is 
this one of the things that's keep you in majority share and you think you 
are just going to play out that way for the rest of the 4G and then into 5G 
to. It's been the case, lot of folks have been in the modem
 
business with 
great plans and almost all of them falling away, there seems to be most of it 
done because they are on the legacy software to do all the hand
-
off in the 
corner case if Qualcomm does?
 
So just trying to figure out, how that applies to some of 
the marquee phones 
are playing out now, and then into 5G, you see that being a big factor, we're 
going to go so far through reservation like IOT and all that legacy stuff is 
going to be as big of a deal? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Ed, you know, I actually ag
ree with the way that you characterized it. It's 
been very difficult to build, I would say a high
-
quality modem business 
without having the ability to handle all the modes they come up. This 
becomes increasingly important when you are looking to get into S
KUs that 
are sold, let's say worldwide because essentially you get the entire world 
feature set come into your product. And so what you tend to see is, people 
might split their products and go with one region with a particular solution, 
but it's difficult 
to get the lion share and certainly difficult I think over time 
to protect that those design wins. So we have seen that over a number of 
generations and I would say one of the reasons that we were successful in 
4G besides just being ahead on 4G was the abi
lity to make it very easy for 
multi
-
mode to occur at the chipset. Really, all the multi
-
mode work tends to 
be abstracted to the user by the chipset. That continues to be important and 
I would add in Wi
-
Fi and many different brands when you go to 5G.
 
So we 
think that's going to continue to be an important component of our 
business moving forward. And one of the reasons why we think it's 
important to invest not only in the modem but in the RF and all of the 
technologies that make that very easy to occur.
 
With
 
IOT it even becomes more important in my opinion because the SKU 
that goes into these industrial applications, you're really trying to make it 
easy for someone to go and access cellular without having to learn about all 
of the complications that cellular 
provide. So, we think that's not only a 
defensible strategy for cellular products but also for the Internet of Things 
and the franchise moving forward.

Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. 
Please go ahead.
 
David W
ong
 
Thanks very much. I had a question and a follow
-
up. The first one is that if 
you look at your royalty business, what is your license business China, what 
is your attitude to capturing all of the license business, will you in every case 
you can't come t
o an agreement seek a legal remedy or will there be many 
cases in which it's not worth the cost?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
The business in China obviously is pretty diverse. And I think we've 
approached it in the right way which is 
--
 
we have kind of a stage plan, 
the 
first is to get the key agreements done, I think we are making good progress 
as you've seen on that front. There is a number of in
-
country in China 
compliance initiatives, we have ongoing with existing licensees including 
active audit and other efforts
 
to make sure we really have a clear 
understanding of the market landscape and who is doing what.
 
There will be I think a piece of the market that is sort of the long
-
tale piece 
that tends to be, lower ASP, low cost, lower featured devices. They might be 
a
 
little bit harder to get after than some of the other pieces. But, we are 
seeing consolidation across the OEMs both in terms of share and also even 
some early M&A activity. So the number of players we believe will reduce 
over time. Beyond that, so obvious
ly, legal proceedings will be an element of 
our compliance efforts and you have seen that with Meizu. But, there are 
many, many other things we are doing as well both in China and I talked 
about some of these at some length at our Analyst Day in February. 
But, 
there is a lot of activity we are also doing outside of China and a lot of the 
other regions in the world that we think have the ability to impact and 
change behavior for some of the players that have been less compliant in 
the past.
 
So litigation wil
l be one tool, but it's not going to be the only tool. And there 
is other things that are less costly that we think we can do to drive higher 
compliance over time and big area focus obviously for the business right 
now.
 
David Wong
 
Okay, great. And for lead
ing edge chip manufacturing technology in the 
future, do you plan to use a single foundry for any given advance mode or 
might you split your business between foundries, when do you expect to 
tape
-
out 10
-
nanometers and have the sampling?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
We
ll, I think in general, we tend to have a multi
-
sourcing strategy and that 
includes the leading node. We have already taped out 10
-
nanometer and 
sampled it to customer. So, our focus tends to be on the leading node even 
beyond 10 nanometers and because our
 
business is so diverse we tend to 
use everything from the leading node all the down to analog processes. So 
it's a multi
-
sourcing tends to be one of the tenants of how we operate the 
business.

Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions 
and answers. Mr. 
Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you. I just wanted to thank everyone for attending the call today. We 
had a stronger than expected quarter and are executing well on our pla
ns to 
position the company for the next phase and profitable growth. We continue 
to make good progress in the licensing business in China and have favorable 
new product momentum in QCT. Lastly, I want to thank all of the Qualcomm 
employees for their hard w
ork, for the strong quarter and we look forward to 
the many exciting opportunities ahead. Thank you.

another strong quarter, with record revenues, up 24% versus a year ago, 
driven by broad based demand for smartphones and strong semiconductor 
volumes.
 
In recognition of our strong 
financial position and the continued growth in 
our business, we recently announced a 40% increase in our dividend and a 
new $5 billion share repurchase authorization.
 
In QCT, we continue to drive technology and product leadership. We saw the

sixth last year and ninth the year before, according to IHS.
 
Turning to QTL, total reported device sales came
 
in towards the high end of 
our prior guidance range, reflecting continued global adoption of 
smartphone, particularly in emerging regions. This marks another record 
quarter of total reported device sales and QTL revenues.
 
We also continue to growth rate o

230 CDMA licensees and more than 50 single mode OFDMA licensees. 
Looking forward, we believe our long term growth drivers remain intact and 
are increasing our calendar year 2013 3G/4G device forecast in line with this
 
view.
 
Smartphone adoption continues at a rapid pace. Gartner estimates that 
approximately 700 million smartphones were sold in calendar 2012, up 44% 
year over year. Further, they estimate that in 2017 more than 1.7 billion 
smartphones will be sold, repres

Steven 
Mollenkopf
 
Thank you Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business had 
another excellent quarter, with revenues and earnings before tax increasing 
28% and 14% year over year respectively. We shipped 173 million MSM 
chipsets, up 14% year over year, a
nd at the high end of our prior guidance 
range, reflecting strong demand across our portfolio, including our 
Qualcomm reference design solutions.
 
Looking forward, we are expecting another record year for QCT, growing 
revenue and earnings before tax on a st
rong double digit basis year over 
year. This growth is in excess of the rate of growth of estimated industry 
3G/4G device unit shipments and the year over year percentage increase of 
our expected operating expenses.
 
Further, the year is unfolding better th
an we initially expected, and we are 
successfully increasing our share and our share of content in devices. This 
strategy is delivering strong revenue and per
-
unit dollar margin growth year 
over year, albeit with downward pressure on the QCT gross margin o
n a 
percentage basis, as expected.
 
In total, we are pleased to be raising the company guidance, in large part 
due to the strength of our chip business. Flagship devices announced this 
quarter that contain our chipsets include the Samsung Galaxy S IV, the H
TC 
One, the LG Optimus G Pro, the Blackberry Z10, and the Sony Xperia Z 
smartphone and tablet.
 
Our strategy of pursuing a diversified customer base, including all the major 
OEMs and across all major operating systems, uniquely positions us within 
the indus
try. We also continue to grow devices targeted at mass market 
pricing in emerging regions. Our Qualcomm reference design program 
continues to build momentum with OEMs now shipping handsets based on 
our MSM 8x25Q Quad Core chipset and a developing pipeline 
for our LTE 
chipsets, which will support the anticipated rollout of LTE in China.
 
In total, there are now more than 850 Snapdragon enabled devices launched 
or announced, including approximately 200 devices based on our Qualcomm 
reference designs. The pipel
ine of future Snapdragon enabled devices also 
continues to grow, and there are more than 475 additional Snapdragon 
enabled designs in development. Devices based on the Snapdragon 600 
chipsets are launching now, and we expect commercial devices based on the
 
Snapdragon 800 chipset to launch on schedule in the middle of this year.
 
Carrier requirements that support the demand for growing network capacity 
will increase the complexity and requirements for modem and connectivity 
technology and represent a sizable 
opportunity that aligns with our key 
strengths. Our family of 3G/4G multimode chipsets leads the competition in 
mode and band support as well as the integration of the latest wifi 802.11 
AC.
 
We are already on our third generation of LTE modems, and 
with the MDM 
9X25 and Snapdragon 800 chipsets, while others are still working on their 
first generation. This quarter we announced our new Qualcomm RF360 
product, which addresses the next challenge with global LTE: OEMs SKU 
proliferation coming from RF com
plexity and LTE brand fragmentation.
 
We continue to execute on the strategy which we outlined for you in the 
past. We innovate across multiple technology vectors, CPU, graphics, 
modem, and connectivity, optimize the design point for the unique 
requirements
 
of mobile, integrate these technologies into a tiered chipset 
roadmap, and deliver these chipsets at scale across multiple customers and 
OSs.
 
These technology investments enable superior performance, lower power 
consumption, faster time to market, and con
tinually raise the bar for 
competition. The success of this strategy is reflected in our growing share 
and the many OEM flagship devices already announced based on the 
Snapdragon 600 chipset and the increasing device pipeline of more than 200 
Snapdragon 60
0 and 800 chipset enabled devices. We believe it continues to 
position us well in the smartphone space, but also in the growing 
opportunities of mobile computing, the internet of everything, and the 
connected home.
 
That concludes my remarks. I will now tur
n the call over to George Davis.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. I am delighted to have 
joined the Qualcomm team, and look forward to working closely with the 
investor and analyst community in my new role. We are pleased to be 
r
eporting strong financial results today, and to be increasing our financial 
outlook for fiscal 2013.
 
Fiscal second quarter revenues were a record $6.1 billion, up 24% year over 
year and 2% sequentially. Non
-
GAAP operating income of $2.2 billion was up 
18% 
year over year, and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $1.17 was up 16% 
year over year. Sequentially, non
-
GAAP earnings per share were down 
$0.09, reflecting seasonally lower QCT shipments and higher operating 
expenses, partially offset by 17% revenue growth i
n QTL.
 
As a reminder, this quarter reflects two very different seasonal periods for 
our main business segments. For QCT, our March quarter is a period of 
seasonally lower demand following the retail intensive December quarter.
 
Because QTL records royalty o
n subscriber device sales on a quarter lag, our 
fiscal second quarter results for QTL reflect the strong demand period of the 
December quarter. QTL reported strong growth in 3G/4G device shipments 
by its licensees, driven particularly by smartphones in bot
h developed and 
emerging regions.
 
Total reported device sales rose to a record $61.1 billion, up 15% 
sequentially and 18% year over year. Devices shipped by our licensees in 
the December quarter were estimated at 279 to 283 million units, with an 
estimated
 
average selling price of $214 to $220.
 
QCT shipped 173 million MSM chips, at the high end of our prior guidance 
range, driven by strong demand across our portfolio, including QRD chipsets 
for emerging accounts. Revenue per MSM was relatively flat sequenti
ally and 
QCT operating margin was in line with expectations at approximately 17%.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 14% sequentially, 
exceeding the high end of expectations due to increased patent, legal, and 
employee related expenses in the qua
rter. Operating cash flow was strong at 
$2.2 billion, up 17% year over year and 36% of revenues. During the 
quarter, we returned $431 million of cash dividends to stockholders.
 
Let me now spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fiscal year and our 
fisca
l third quarter. We are raising our guidance for fiscal 2013. We now 
estimate our fiscal 2013 revenues will be approximately $24 billion to $25 
billion, up 28% year over year at the midpoint and up $600 million from our 
previous guidance.
 
We estimate our f
iscal 2013 non
-
GAAP earnings per share will be between 
$4.40 and $4.55, up approximately 21% year over year at the midpoint, and 
up $0.13 relative to the midpoint of our previous guidance. Our fiscal 2013 
operating margin percentage estimates for QCT and Q
TL are unchanged.
 
We expect combined non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for fiscal 2013 to 
grow approximately 21% to 23% year over year. This is a modest increase 
over our prior estimate, primarily due to increased patent and legal 
expenses and variable employ
ee costs.
 
Let me spend a moment on calendar year 3G/4G device estimates and fiscal 
year device ASPs. As a baseline, we have updated our estimate of 3G/4G 
devices shipped in calendar year 2012 upward to a range of 928 million to 
945 million devices. This re
presents an increase of approximately 18% year 
over year at the midpoint. This is somewhat higher than our prior estimate, 
led by emerging region demand and provides a strong base for the growth 
we expect in calendar 2013.
 
For calendar year 2013 3G/4G devi
ce shipments we now estimate between 
1.015 million and 1.085 billion devices will be shipped by our licensees, 
driven by strong global smartphone demand. At the midpoints of our 
calendar 2013 guidance and the revised calendar 2012 range, we estimate 
3G/4G 
device growth will be 12% year over year.
 
We estimate that the average selling price of 3G/4G devices for fiscal 2013 
will be between $216 and $224, consistent with the midpoint of our prior 
forecast. We estimate our non
-
GAAP annual tax rate to be approxim
ately 
17
-
18% for fiscal 2013, consistent with our prior expectations.
 
Now, turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we estimate revenues will 
be in the range of approximately $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion, up 
approximately 31% year over year at the midp
oint. We estimate non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter to be between $0.97 and 
$1.05, up approximately 19% year over year at the midpoint.
 
We anticipate that fiscal third quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses will increase seq
uentially approximately 2
-
4%. In QTL, we 
estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device sales 
of approximately $51 billion to $56 billion in the June quarter, for shipments 
made in the March quarter. At the midpoint of that range,
 
we expect total 
reported device sales to be up approximately 12% year over year and down 
approximately 12% sequentially, reflecting post
-
holiday seasonality.
 
In QCT, we expect to ship between 163 million and 173 million MSM chipsets 
during the June quarte
r. We expect a stronger mix of chipsets targeted for 
high tier smartphones to drive revenue per MSM higher, resulting in 
sequential QCT revenue growth of more than 5%, despite the reduction in 
expected volumes. We expect QCT operating margin percentage to 
be 
relatively flat quarter over quarter at approximately 17%.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.

I was wondering if you could discuss the ASP trends for the total device 
market. It seems there was a lack of high end product 
introductions during 

the market during the June quarter. Could we expect QTL ASPs maybe to 
increase exiting the fiscal year relative to your guidance? And am I 
calculating it ri
ght that your guidance also implies an uptick in ASPs for the 
June quarter?
 
Derek Aberle
 

Q2, although that was in line with what we expected. As we look back 
historically the la


look out at the back half of the year, we are expecting kind of a rebound in 

cluding offsetting effect from 
FX. So I do think both in the March and the June quarter, we should see 
some improvement in the ASP compared to Q2.
 
Warren Kneeshaw
 

bit, but it s
till has a midpoint at 220.
 
T. Michael Walkley

Canaccord Genuity
 
And then Derek, just on the FX, was there any impact to FX in the short 
term, or any impact from the yen in particular. And then just longer term, 
with the stronger mix from low end markets
, do you see the ASP trends as 
still kind of single digit annual decline is a good way to think about it?
 
George Davis
 

on the longer term impact. Actually, we did experience some impa
ct from 
the yen in the second quarter, and really for the full year. But in both Q2 
and Q3, the net effect has been minimal in Q2 in particular, because of the 
favorable impact from other currencies. So for the full year, we see FX being 
about $1 impact on
 
ASPs. So not much of an impact and virtually no impact 
in Q2.
 
Derek Aberle
 

seeing and that we highlighted back at the analyst day in November. Two 
quarters in are really holding, a
nd we see them remaining intact. In 
particular, in the emerging regions, the ASPs have continued to increase and 
in fact when we talked about sort of the tiers, the interesting thing is 
although the volume is continuing to grow there, the percentage of the
 
units 
coming from the mid and high tier has kind of been holding. And so I think 
both of those trends are consistent with what we expected at the beginning 
of the year and will continue. But as you said, over the long term as more 
volume shifts to emergin

baked in assumptions that there will be single digit declines in ASPs over the 
longer term.

I just wanted to go a little further into the detail on the QCT gross margin. 
Steve, you mentioned it down as expected. I just want to put that together 
with a few things. First, last quarter Bill had mentioned a positive 
contribution to gross margin from
 
QCT, so I think it went up two or three 
points, doing the math, looking like it went down about six points or so this 
quarter, into March. So it seems like a little bit of a reversal there, and 

 
And w
hat do we think about from the market drivers for this change in gross 
margin, meaning is it QRD and media tech competition? Is it new LTE 
devices from competitors finally starting to hit the market? And at some 
point, do we start to see a floor in this gr
oss margin number for QCT?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
In Q2, from Q1, a couple of things happened. One, if you get the normal 
calendar year price reset, which hits in this quarter, we also had a bit of a 
weaker mix from the perspective of more units coming in from 
emerging 
markets versus developed markets. The December quarter tends to be 
pretty heavy in terms of buildup in the developed world. So you probably 
saw a little regional mix move away from the developed world.
 
We also mentioned on the last call that we al
so think about how we do our 
pricing strategy, which I think comprehends not just short term but also long 
term views of the competitive landscape. One thing that I should mention, 
we really are not seeing significant competitive threat in the LTE area, as

Steven Mollenkopf
 
You probably saw a little bit less mix from the high end, and a little bit more 
from the emerging market area versus the quarter before.
 
George Davis
 
I would just add when we look at Q2, even though the
 
volumes of MSMs 
were up relative to our expectations, the mix issue did have an impact of 
kind of neutralizing the benefit of those higher volumes and so the 
outperformance in Q2 was more of a QTL story.

Then on the royalty side, a question there. So your ASPs declined about 4% 

e December quarter 
volumes in North America and other mature markets were actually quite 
strong. And I would have thought that with that being the higher ASP 
region, that would have helped the mix for QTL.
 

also reported by AT&T 
and Verizon and others that North America volumes have really come down 
quite significantly in the March quarter, which is being offset by substantial 
growth in emerging markets around the lunar new year and so forth. And 
that would h
ave suggested to me that the mix actually would get better and 
benefit your ASPs in the royalty segment in the March quarter for you to 
report in June. So could you just kind of dig a little bit more into why that 
logic is not playing out?
 
Derek Aberle
 
As 
I was trying to explain before, we have seen actually more volatility, I 
would say, in the quarterly ASPs with more iconic high end devices and the 

quite a bit. Like if you look las
t year we were slightly down in Q2 but then 
ASPs jumped up by like $15 in Q3. So we are seeing more volatility.
 
I think the December quarter is obviously a very competitive dynamic. A lot 

 
volume 
coming from some of the higher ASP regions like Japan. But as I said, as we 
look out and we have a certain amount of information already from our 
licensees and then based on publicly available data, we do expect ASPs to 
increase in Q3. And then as 
you suggested, there are a number of new 
higher end products launching that should have a positive impact on the Q4 
ASP as well.

A couple of questio
ns. One on the QCT margins. Kind of guiding again at 
17% in the quarter. Can you kind of walk through a little bit of that? I know 

you typically incur in Q1 done. Or are there increment
al expenses, take outs, 
etc.?
 
And then can you also talk about, you mentioned it a couple of times, higher 
legal expenses? Can you talk about has there been a shift in litigation, or is 

r case 

 
And then last question, just around S800. You were talking about launch 
midyear. How is the design traction on that going? And how do you see that 
affecting your overall mix in ASP in QCT?
 
George Davis
 
The QCT ma
rgins, we said for the full year, as you may recall, that we saw 
18.5% to 20.5% margins for QCT throughout the year. We are seeing 
spending increase into the last half of the year so 17% at Q3 is still going to 
be consistent with that outlook. And in fact,
 
we recommitted to the margin 
outlook.
 

seeing strength in ASPs for QCT in the second half of the year. That will 

 
Steven Mol
lenkopf
 

in the second half. And the second half does look quite a bit better than 
what we would have thought in the January timeframe. A lot of that is this 
higher mix produ


to the business as a result of those higher end products coming in. And I 

uidance movement.
 
George Davis
 
And just back to your second question, on legal expenses and other items. 
That really was to explain the delta from our forecast of up 10
-
12
-
14, to the 
14% growth that we saw in Q2. Litigation and patent are both up in the 
quarter. Some on settlements, some of the patents.
 
Obviously there was the adoption of
 
the first to file rule and so there was a 

more of an increase. Obviously the big increases 
year over year and also on 
an absolute basis, the increase in spending is still coming out of the core 
business.

is about your vertical license, the significant

Let me just give some perspective on the full year on the margin. Because I 

performance for QCT [unintelligible] loaded in the second half of the year 
and 


operating margin up and our expectation in Q3.
 
But if you just step back and look year over year, QCT revenue w
ill be up

And to the extent there was any gross margin declin
e in the business, how 
does that make sense to help us get our arms around it given that the 
shipment ASP was flat? So maybe there was no gross margin decline and it 
was all opex. Just want to understand that. And going back to the previous 
question, if it
 

year? But just to understand that mix.
 
And then on the QCT ASP, itself, I think you had mentioned that it was flat 
because of the mix, offsetting the higher end chips that we know you 
shipped l

kept it in step. I think in the last conference call Bill had mentioned that he

Obviously trying to estimate ASPs is a difficult process, although we get

know our feeling is that the range
 
that we have set out is an appropriate 
range, and when we think about the fiscal year ASP we usually start out at

range, and then as we go through the year and get closer to the end

point, you took it up about $160 million on a pro forma basis versus where 
you were last quarter. It sounded from your descrip
tion that a lot of it is not 

idea of how much of a split of this opex increase is actually coming from the

those increases on the legal front and patents and everything else as more

On the legal side, as George said earlier, one of those is a settlement, which

as George accurately 
described before, as you know, with the new America Invents Act, which was 
the modification to our patent laws, there was a first to file modification put 
in. And some companies took advantage of making sure that they filed a lot 
of ap
plications in a timely way due to certain timing issues associated with 
that. We did a very good job, as always, of filing patents so that we could

I wanted to go back to the question on licensing in China. T
here had been 
mention of faster growth in the market there and some of the other 

as far as where we feel like the coverage is on collecting royalties from 
producers in that region in 

potential upside in growth as you improve the coverage there and add more 
licensees.
 
The second question is for Steve. As we look over the medium to long term, 

some mix that has impacted 
margins, but yet the ASP has been relatively stable. How should we think 
about the ASP development on the chipsets over the long run, particularly as 
you start to roll in some RF component, etc.? Can we remain stable, or 
should w
e expect those chipset ASPs to decline at about the same rate that 
the handset ASPs are anticipated to?
 
Derek Aberle
 
On China licensing, I think I can probably break it into two parts. I think 

o add licensees 
to the base and grow the number of licensees in China. I feel very good 
about the compliance efforts we have there. So I think we are confident 

 

tood, I think, is we have had 
some struggles with local Chinese companies necessarily paying all the 
royalties they owe on TDS CDMA units. And although we have a large 
number of company [unintelligible] for TDS CDMA given the political 
sensitivities there,
 
that continues to be an issue for us.
 

TDS CDMA volumes grow at China Mobile, there will be a gap, to some 

 

situation.
 
Having said that, I think there are some trends that should help reduce the 
size of the issue. One of them is we do believe that the higher end of the 
portfolio is goin
g to have a combination of UMTS and LTE or at least UMTS 
for global roaming in other regions. So as to products that include those 


 
So agai
n, this has shifted over time, I think, where the volumes are quite a 
bit smaller historically, and the mix of the supply base in China has also 
shifted over time to probably favor more of the local Chinese companies that 
have been a bit of a struggle. But
 

see what we can do to solve it.

It also, I think, provides the springboard to go into some additional markets

in in a great 
way, primarily because the OS that we put our biggest bet on has yet to sort 
of develop. But we think it will.

Derek, just a clarification. Much, much longer term, if we go into the world

And also, on tablets, is that something tha
t we revisit in terms of the royalty 
rates as they stand today? Anything that you can proactively do to take it 
out including the attachment rates there?
 
Derek Aberle
 
The first question on sort of longer term impacts on single mode LTE, 

een a certain amount of chatter around the industry about 
the timing of some of the early launches of single mode LTE devices and I 

terms of meaningful volume, is shifted out a 
ways.
 
You may recall that we made a public statement several years ago at the 
time, based on sort of our current patent position, which frankly I think has 
improved over time, that we expected to charge about 3.25% for single 
mode LTE, just for the essenti
al patent portfolio. And as you know, we 
generally license generally our whole portfolio, not just the essential 
portfolio. So that 3.25% was just for the essential patents.
 

as w

to engage with a nontraditional customer.
 
Nontraditional in this sense means a customer that nee

also need to expand, in the region, the sales activity. So for us in China, 



serviced. And it takes a while to build that alternative channel. We also 
think, over time, that our IP roadmap from 
the top tier tends to be 
meaningful in the low tier as well.
 
And you can see that in customers that try to differentiate from their low tier 
competitors by producing a high tier phone and trying to offset their brand. 
You see that, and that tiered roadmap 
we think is important long term.
 

quarters, is as China transitions to multimode 4G, that you get a real 
turnover in the modem feature set, which we think plays toward our 
traditional s

want to give you my comments before passing it on to the team. We are 
pleased with our strong results this quarter with revenues up 35% and non
-
GAAP EPS up 21% versus a year 
ago. Licensing revenues were driven by 
strong smartphone sales in the March quarter and our Snapdragon and Gobi 
products were featured in an extensive set of flagship devices. The 
tremendous success of the business puts us in a strong position to return 
ca
pital to stockholders.
 
During the third fiscal quarter and up through today, we returned 
approximately $2.2 billion. This includes dividends paid and approximately 
$1.5 billion in stock repurchases made under our previously announced $5 
billion stock repur

and we will continue to return capital to stockholders consistent with this 
deal. I like to focus my comments today on smartphone innovation before 
turning it over to Steve for more comprehensive updat
e on our QCT and QTL 
businesses.
 

smartphone. I can assure that we do not see it here at Qualcomm. The 
breadth of technologies that are being developed and the demand for new 
features and dev
ice capabilities from our customers remains extremely 
strong. Though we have seven major technology areas in which significant 
advances are continuing to be made including the modem, including RF, the 
CPU, the graphics processing unit, digital signal proce
ssing and multi

media, 
connectivity, sensors and displays. Innovation such as LTE Advanced, LTE 
Broadcast, multi

on, HD audio, sensor monitoring, 802.11ac (inaudible), 
indoor position locations, proximity based communication, wireless charging, 
new display technologies, mobile payment capabilities, security features, 
remote device management are some of the many feat
ures that will increase 
the utility of 3G and 4G devices any one of which could provide a catalyst for 
a smartphone user to upgrade.
 

advancements that have driven new innovative devices wh
ich are fueled 
upgrade and replacement cycle. This has continued over the last several 
years as we have seen the introduction of many new technologies, including 
LTE, Dual and Quad Core processors, improved graphics, higher resolution 
displays and more cap
able operating system. In the near future we will see 
the broad adoption of LTE Advanced which doubles the peak data rate and 
provides higher average throughput.
 

at the center o
f technology innovation. New technologies used to be 
commercialized through discreet consumer electronics products. Today we 
see innovations moving rapidly in the smartphones. For example the first 
place most consumers will see high

quality ultra
-
HD video 
recording, is on a 
Snapdragon enabled smartphone.
 
Looking at this now from a regional perspective, there seems to be some 
concern that developed regions are becoming saturated with smartphones. 
The fact is that these reasons have been primarily replacement
 
cycle driven 
for some time as handset penetrations are already quite high. The strategies 
(ph) already been cycling through devices and are used to doing so. Certain 
large carriers routinely provide incentives for subscribers to purchase a new 
phone every
 
two years, and although we may see different programs or 
replacement initiatives in the future. These types of programs are working 
successfully and competitive dynamics stay with their continuance in the 
future. Interestingly there has been some recent p
lans launched by 
operators that could actually accelerate the replacement cycle, so we will 
continue to monitor those. In some our long term plans continue to include a 
very modest decrease in the developed region replacement rate.
 
Turning to emerging regi
ons we view the opportunity is very significant 
when you consider that according to our geographic definition approximately 

youthful demographic, and the GDP in emerging region is e
xpected to grow 
at an annual rate of approximately 6% for the next five years according to 
consensus estimates. And according to Gartner, in these countries at the end 
of 2012 the average penetration rate of smartphones relatively the install 
base and the 
handsets sits at approximately 18% or only 10% of the total 
population.
 

adoption of mobile technologies and in fact rising average selling prices in 
these locations as a mix shift to
 
smartphone. In these regions there are 
limited, fixed broadband alternatives and users are getting excellent utility 
from their wireless devices. So in summary although we expect to 
experience quarterly growth rate fluctuations for a variety of reasons, 3
G, 
4G mobile computing technology and device are still in an early stage of 
adoption in the majority of the world and have a very long runway of 
attractive growth potential. This adoption is feeling new innovation and 
perpetuating that cycle. Gartner estim
ates that approximately 700 million 
smartphones were sold in calendar 2012 and that number will grow to 1.7 
billion in 2017 representing an approximately 20% compound annual growth 
rate. Building off fiscal year 2012, we believe we will experience a double
-
digit average annual growth in total reported device sales over our five
-
year 
planning period, which included an estimated average low single
-
digit 
percentage decline in average selling prices over this period.
 

l live today, but I am pleased with 
our results and outlook. And Steve and George will now comment on that. 
Thank you very much.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Good afternoon, everyone. I will provide some comments on our QTL and 
QCT businesses, which both 
delivered strong financial results this quarter. In 
QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were up 18% year
-
over
-
year and above our prior expectations, driven by stronger than expected 
average selling prices. Average selling prices were up $13 s
equentially at the 
midpoint despite $3 of foreign exchange unfavorability, reflecting an 
increased mix of mid
-
tier and high
-
tier handsets. The quarter
-
over
-
quarter 
increase was driven by ASP strength in both emerging and developed 
regions.
 
As Paul noted in
 
his comments, although the developed regions have been 
primarily driven by replacements and smartphone penetration is relatively 
high, our calendar year 2013 unit shipment estimates include year
-
over
-
year 
growth of approximately 6% in developed regions we
ll ahead of GDP 
estimates. This quarter we also continue to see an increasing mix of 
handsets at the mid and high tiers, and we expect this distribution to remain 
relatively stable going forward in developed regions.
 
In the emerging regions, we expect to c
ontinue to see strong unit growth 
and increasing average selling prices. We also continued to grow our 
licensee base, and now have over 240 CDMA licensees and more than 65 
single
-
mode OFDMA licensees. Our patent portfolio continues to be the most 
widely li
censed in the industry. QCT also had another strong quarter with 
record revenues. Results either met or exceeded each of our prior key 
guidance metrics with revenues and earnings before tax increasing 47% and 
56% year
-
over
-
year respectively.
 
MSM shipments 
were up 22% year
-
over
-
year and at the high end of our 
prior guidance range. Implied revenue per MSM was higher sequentially as 
we increased our share of content in devices. Versus expectations, we had a 
greater mix of shipments of mid, low
-
tier products, a
nd to Chinese emerging 
accounts offsetting a bit of softness we saw from some Tier 1 OEMs. Our 
scale and broad diversified customer base are key strengths to our business 
and allows us to deliver strong results, despite quarterly fluctuations in mix 
or OEM
 
share.
 
Looking to the fourth fiscal quarter, we had a similar product mix shift 
versus prior expectations. We expect MSM shipments to be slightly higher 
sequentially driven by anticipated new device launches and a seasonality 
associated with this quarter.
 
Similar to what we have seen in the last couple 
of years, it is important to note that our MSM volumes for each of the next 
two quarters are depended on timing and success of OEM product launches 
for the holiday selling seasons. We are encouraged by a str
ong pipeline of 
Snapdragon 800 and Snapdragon 200 products launching over the next two 
quarters, along with shipments for the China Mobile LTE trial beginning in 
September and ramping into the December quarter.
 
Our design traction remained strong. We have 
just crossed a new milestone 
with more than 1,000 designs announced or shipping with Snapdragon 
processors and have over 500 designs in the pipeline. We are also seeing 
increased momentum in tablets as OEMs leveraged phone designs for tablets 
with over 40 
design wins in the pipeline, including the recently announced 
new Nexus 7 by Google. Our latest Snapdragon 800 processor has again 


-
mo
de LTE modems.
 
Designs are in process and with many major OEMs for a very broad set of 
opportunities worldwide. Flagship devices announced with the Snapdragon 
800, include the next generation LGG smartphone, Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE 
advanced, and the Sony Xpe
ria Z Ultra. We remain confident in our LTE 
leadership position moving forward. Though LTE competition exist today and 
new suppliers are hoping to enter, the complexity of a multi
-
mode LTE 
modem feature set and the integration of a high
-
performance applica
tion 
processor into the same solutions is proving to be a technically challenging 
for many. The modem roadmap of the industry remains robust as carriers 
move to LTE advanced and utilize complicated spectrum allocations to meet 
the increasing data demands o

building (inaudible) in China and our emerging account shipments were up 
35% sequentially in the June quarter. We continue to add new design wins. 
We expect competition for low cost solutions to remain strong; ho
wever we 
believe the expected launch of LTE in China will be a differentiator for us and 
enable us to gain broader access including into China Mobile.
 
Further many of the leading emerging account OEMs hope to expand their 
businesses internally which also a
ligns well with our tiered roadmap. We won 
30 new designs in the China Mobile large scale LTE trial and including 
increasing share of new designs in the second way of the LTE Device 
Awards. Our connectivity and networking products continue to do well with 
record revenue and unit shipments in the June quarter. Connectivity design 
traction continues to be strong across the mobile networking and consumer 
electronics segment.
 

the WCN3680 wh
ich was the first 11ac mobile solution in the industry to 
achieve WiFi certification and it's also featured in the Samsung Galaxy Mega. 
Our RF360 Front End Solution is an opportunity for us to solve further 
complexity at the chipset level and grow our cont
ent in the device.
 
The first product in this family of product is on

track and currently sampling 
to a major Tier 1 OEM. Though still early in the life cycle this new solution

devices expected this holiday season. That concludes my remarks and I will 
now turn the call over to George.

repo
rting another quarter of strong financial results, reflecting significant 
year
-
over
-
year growth in both QCT and QTL. This performance also provides 
the basis for an increase in our financial outlook for fiscal 2013. Fiscal third 
quarter revenues were a rec
ord $6.2 billion up 35% year
-
over
-
year and 2%.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating income of $2 billion was up 18% year
-
over
-
year and 
non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $1.03 was up 21% year
-
over
-
year and 
down 12% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. These results included a 158 million 
impa
irment charge or $0.06 per share related to QMT assets.
 
Without this impairment non
-
GAAP earnings per share would have been 
$1.09 well above the high end of our prior guidance range. Our major 
businesses performed quite well in the quarter on strong device
 
ASPs and 
demand from emerging regions into QTL while higher implied revenue per 
MSM and strong volumes led to solid results for QCT.
 
In QTL total reported device sales by our licensees were $56.5 billion above 
the high end of our prior guidance range. We 
estimate that 244 million to 
248 million 3G, 4G based devices were shipped by our licensees in the March 
quarter at an average selling price of $227 to $233 up approximately $13 
sequentially at the midpoint. QCT had record revenues in the quarter, and 
MSM 
shipments were 172 million units towards the high end of our prior 
guidance range implied revenue per MSM was $24.55 which was higher 
sequentially as expected.
 
Fiscal third quarter QCT operating margin was 17% in line with our prior 
expectations, non
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew 1% 
sequentially, slightly below our prior expectations. As Paul mentioned during 
the third fiscal quarter in the first few weeks of this current quarter, we 
returned approximately $2.15 billion to stockholders including 
$600 million 
of dividends paid and $1.55 billion in stock repurchases. We now have just 
under $3.5 billion two remaining on $5 billion authorization as a result of 
these activities.
 
Cash flow from operations was strong at 33% of revenues and we ended the 
q
uarter with cash and marketable securities of $30.4 billion. In other balance 

in our partnership with Bharti in India. Consistent with our previous plans, 
Bharti funded repayment o
f $492 million in debt that QUALCOMM had 
previously guaranteed. The remaining $484 million in debt guaranteed by 
QUALCOMM was deconsolidated due to a change in control of the joint 
venture, which included Bharti subscribing to additional shares. We expect 
the remaining guarantee to be released prior to the end of this fiscal year.
 
Now, turning to our guidance, we are raising our financial outlook for fiscal 
2013. We estimate fiscal 2013 revenues to be in the range of approximately 
$24.3 billion to $25 billi
on, up approximately 29% year

over

year at the 
midpoint. We expect fiscal 2013 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the 
range of $4.48 to $4.56, up approximately 22% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint. We are increasing our forecast for this fiscal 2013 QTL av
erage 
selling price to approximately $223 to $229, which is $6 above our prior 
$220 midpoint estimate reflecting higher handset prices in multiple regions. 
For calendar 2013 global 3G/4G based device shipments, we continue to 
estimate that between 1.015 an
d 1.085 billion devices will be shipped by our 
licensees, up approximately 12% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. While our 
calendar year range is unchanged, we are more upwardly biased in our 
outlook than we were previously. Consistent with our prior expecta
tions, we 
estimate fiscal 2013 QTL operating margins to be 85.5% to 87.5% and QCT 
operating margins to be 18.5% to 20.5%. We expect combined non
-
GAAP 
R&D and SG&A expense to grow approximately 22% to 23% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Now, turning to the fourth 
fiscal quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the 
range of approximately $5.9 billion to $6.6 billion, up approximately 28% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. Our estimates reflect continued strength in 
QTL and QCT balanced by higher operating expenses and so
me uncertainty 
around the timing and success of product launches. As Steve mentioned, we 
are very confident in our positioning in these leading edge devices, it is more 
a matter of timing. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our fourth 
fiscal quarte
r to be approximately $1.02 to $1.10 per share, up 
approximately 19% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We anticipate fourth 
fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will increase 
sequentially approximately 4% to 6% reflecting increased patent e
xpense in 
QTL and R&D expense in QCT.
 
In QTL, we estimate that total reported device sales of $55 billion to $60 
billion will be reported by our licensees in the September quarter for 
shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 24% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 
171 million to 181 million units during the September quarter and QCT 
operating margin to be approximately 16% to 17%. We expect implied 
revenue per MSM to be flat to slightly down 
of a strong third quarter. 
Consistent with our prior view, we estimate that the 3G/4G channel 
inventory will decline further in the September quarter as OEMs and 
operators prepare for new product launches for the holiday season though 
we continue to expect
 
it to remain within the normal 11 to 16 week range. 
That concludes my comment.
 
I will now turn the call back to Warren.

ur first question comes from the line of Simona

George I wanted to ask you a question first on your capital allocation 
strategy that was one of the highlight

and obviously the buyback is quite significantly here. Is your strategy here 
to basically continue to buy opportunistically especially when there is pull
-
back in the stock like we have seen recently or is there any thou
ghts, the 
borrowed level or in your office about something that is a little bit more 
structured and more significant and perhaps including leveling the balance 
sheet and then a question for Steve on chipset margins, seems like we 
continue to be in the high
-
teens there even though you're gaining quite 
significant content share and also volumes are coming up nicely in the next 

seeing that move higher? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
I think what yo

the quarter and actually for the full year as you may have seen we have 
returned $3.3 million in buyback and dividends. We just feel at the levels of 
the stock today and the strength of the b
alance sheet and quite frankly the 
strength of the businesses that it's a good time to be buying. You can see 
that we continue to buy through the end of the quarter up about $500 
million on top of the 1 billion that we did in the quarter. We have about $3.
5 

position at this point to make any broader statement about a change in 

shareholders and we have had a bias, and we 
will continue to have a bias to 
step up more heavily when the markets provide a good opportunity.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
On your second question I think it was really, if you think about the mix it 
was a little bit, look at the June quarter probably a little wea
ker on the 
premium tier and it was offset by some strengths at the emerging accounts 
tier. We have forecasted a similar trend going into September, which is 
essential a little bit less premium. Of course it's always definitely is a weird 
quarter to predict
 
sometimes because of the importance of flagship 
launches.
 

we see flagships devices launch. Now we do have a fair bit of investment in 
the businesses as George mentioned, we c
ontinue to invest quite heavily 
actually in the modem and in those areas of innovation as Paul mentioned in 

-
positioned at the 
premium tier moving forward and we consider ourselves to be really 
differe

think it will pay off long term.

Matt Hoffman from Cowen. Please go ahead with your questions.

Cowen & Company
 
Strong ASPs were certainly one of the positives h
ere in the quarter since the 
company highlighted the Snapdragon 800 in the release, can we assume 

was up 8% sequentially in the June quarter and also if you can just 
comment on
 
mix moving forward. Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure with the chip ASPs really the 800 is really haven't launched yet 


rted launching 
yet. What we saw in the June quarter was really more of a mix toward 
relative to our expectation, it's a little bit less premium, little bit more 
emerging markets and we did have some improvements in gross margin 
primarily in the cost area.
 
Matt Hoffman

Cowen & Company
 
Okay, so as you start to bring your mix back toward more than modems are 
some of the high
-
end smartphone guys bringing their shipments back up in 
the back half of the calendar year. Do ASPs, continue to move up?
 
Steve Mollenk
opf
 
Well I think we forecasted, as George mentioned that to be flat and really 
what you see in our product line because they're such a big mix, different 
there is a big difference in ASP between the premium devices and the mid
-
tier and low
-
tier devices. Th
at can change a lot actually based on the mix 
now looking forward. Now in the holiday season as I think is behind your 
question, you tend to be more flagship launches and you tend to see more 
premium devices launch as well. Same thing following Mobile Worl
d 
Congress in the first half of the calendar year as well. So we will see how 

-

just a question of what happens.
 
Operator
 
Tavis McCourt from Raymond James, please go ahead with y
our question.
 
Tavis McCourt

Raymond James
 
Couple of questions. First on the license ASP reported the quarter of roughly 

talking about a March quarter here, which I would think 
would have a lower 
mix of flagship smartphones relative to December quarter and yet the ASP 
was up quite a bit. Is it just at the China low end or emerging market, low 
end market was so strong in that December quarter that it cause your ASPs 
to come down t
hat $10 or so when you report at March?
 
Derek Aberle
 
So, I think, this is Derek, I think we highlighted during the last call that we 
are starting to see a little more volatility in the quarter
-
over
-
quarter ASP 
changes. And we indicated our belief was that 
we were going to see an 
upward movement in the ASP this quarter which is in line with what 
happened is actually a little stronger than what we expected, but really that 
came from a strength in both developed and emerging regions as Steve 
noted in his remar
ks. In developed, I think we started to see an increasing 
mix this quarter of devices at the mid and high
-
tier while at the same time, 
the prices within those tiers remaining relatively stable and there were 
actually some new launches within the quarter, a
t the March quarter. And 

meaning we have an increasing percentage of devices going into the mid 
and high
-
tier, but also I think acceleration more so than we expected of 
feature phon
es moving over to smartphones. And as we pointed out in the 
past, the ASP uplift when moving from feature phones even to the lower tier 
smartphones is quite meaningful. So, we are continuing to see upward 
movement in emerging region ASP. So, really, all of
 
those things came 
together to get us where we ended up this quarter.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long from BMO Capital. Please 
go ahead with your question.
 
Tim Long

BMO Capital
 
Two related ones on chips here. First, I think Ste
ve you mentioned that the 
gross margin was up a little in the June quarter due to some cost savings 

see some pretty aggressive competition in Asia given that gross margins for 
this business have come down meaningfully in the last two years. Do we 
think we are bumping along a level where we are not likely to see gross 
margins any lower? And then Steve the second one, just maybe you could 
just talk a little bit about there is a lo
t out there lately on benchmarking of 
different chips that has been pretty controversial topic. So, we just love your 
take on how we should look at kind of comparing a lot of these new chips 

 
how 
companies will be successful? Thanks.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Okay, Tim. So, on the pricing side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we saw 
some I think some sequential strength in the emerging accounts. And we are 
probably up 35% quarter
-
over
-
quarter there. Tho
se products for us really 
could fall into two buckets. So, we do quite well from a margin as well as the 


om if 
not a lot of the OEMs there are turning to build both the brand as well as 
volume. Now, in the very low tier, it is a very, very aggressive time period. 

continuing to price 
aggressively there.
 

working to improve that. We hope that, that will improve over time. But we 
are pleased, because we think although our units are growing they still have 
further to
 
go. And my guess is that our revenue share is probably pretty 
strong certainly stronger than our unit share in that area. Remember too, 

carrier in the region, largest carrier in th
e world. So, we look at that and we 
say there is an opportunity there for us to grow the business and we look 

 
With respect to benchmarks, good question, actually I am glad you asked,
 

know the right word, basically I think it's a little bit dubious the way that 
some of these benchmarks have led to certain conclusions and then other 
conclusions, but at the en
d when we look at the results we conclude that 

our position at the OEM base and in the near
-
term, or even the midterm 

own from the 
fact that we think we have the best technology across all of the vectors that 
matter, but most importantly we have it together. We have the ability to put 
multiple things into one SoC and I think that has served us quite well and we 
expect tha
t to serve us quite well moving forward. So we have a tough time 
understanding all the anxiety that people have regarding the conclusions 

customer base.

Canaccord Genuity
 
Just want to go back to the margins and clearly there is some high end 


ve grown content share with those, 

they have tended to be lower margins also. Can you just share with us kind 
of an intermediate
-
term how should we think about the margins as an 
investo
r, more content share opportunities versus mid
-
year longer term 
operating expenses margins plan you want to execute against.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure maybe I can provide a little bit of color than George I think probably 
you could also jump in here as well. W
e look at our business right now and 
we definitely don't subscribe to the view that the high tier is going away in 

asked to cycle through chipsets I would argue that it's actually a
ccelerating 

competitive strength for us, we also believe that moving forward over the 
next couple of years that will be really the thing that determines profitability 
as driving that ti
er and we think we have the ability to do that.
 


than it's traditional in our business and complexity of doin
g that is actually 
increased and but we think that scale is actually a differentiator for us. So 

We hope that it makes it easier for us from a business perspective, but 
maybe Ge
orge can comment a little bit on the other question.
 
George Davis
 
The outlook for the margin is for the full
-
year obviously is right in line with 
where we started, the year overall. So a concern about something having 
changed in the marketplace that is dri
ving a change in our outlook is I think 

here in terms of margin, so we will update the longer
-
term outlook at the 
November meeting, and again I think concerns about further erosio
n in 
margin are really overplayed.

Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Brian Modoff

Deutsche Bank
 
So Steve couple of questions one just if you can elaborate a little bit on what 
you think your share is in the Chi
na market, when you see the impact. So 
you have TD
-
LTE in your devices for a little bit of time so when you start 
seeing the impact from that and then can you talk a little bit about your 
mid
-
range LTE chips coming into the market, you know the timing of i
t and 
how you see kind of a more of a mid
-
range line up of LTE devices impacting 
overall LTE volumes as we move into next year and particularly some of your 
competitors try to bring competing products to the market, albeit later than 
they may have thought.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Okay Brian on the share side of the China market it's interesting, when we 
look at where we really compete we really compete, we don't support an 
EDGE product, we don't support a low
-
tiered TD
-
SCDMA product. We think 
that by the time that
 
we would have that out that market will transition to 
LTE and really intersect with the rest of our product line. So if you just look 

been able to develop what is essentially a new c
hannel for us. All of the units 
that I mentioned that were sequentially strong those are new customers, 


premium
 


pleased from a revenue dollars perspective, but I think what that we are 
excited about is that when that business, wh
en the China market starts to 
go toward LTE, which we think will start at the second half of this calendar 
year when they started the trial will be positioned even better, because that 
will really intercept our tiered roadmap from the 800 all the way down 
to 

on in that tier. So, we look at that as a disruptor for us.
 
The other aspect, which we think will be a good thing for us. We got a lot of 
the big OEM that has started to build their
 
name through the transition to 
smartphones. In China, domestic OEMs are looking to go international. And 
we have we think a good on
-
ramp with them to drive their international 
business. So, as you may know, if you look at our product lines, one of the 
big
 
advantages we have is that we have all of the band support, and that 
enables you to design a product in China and use that other places in the 

to intercept a number of the other 

heretofore.

Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley, you may go ahead with your question.
 
Ehud Gelblum

Morgan Stanley
 

you 
correctly at the end there that the QCT up margin guiding to 16% to 
17% to down in the fiscal fourth quarter, I just want to make sure just 
clarification that I heard that right?
 
George Davis
 

 
Ehud Gelblum

Morgan Stanley
 
Okay. And I guess 
that has to do with mix.
 
George Davis
 
Correct.
 
Ehud Gelblum

And the low before flagship the way Steve talked about it, okay.
 
George Davis
 
Exactly.
 
Ehud Gelblum

Morgan Stanley
 
Steve, and maybe this is actually combination between the two 
of you, 

call it a natural shipment and the time the phone ends up in a stores, so if I 
say a phone is going to I walk into a store and that phone shows up there 
for the first time tomorr
ow, when did you actually ship that chip, I am just 
trying to get a sense as to the timing with respect to the difference from 
there? And then I ask this every quarter, but is there any way that you can 
give us a sense as to the chips that you ship into ph
ones that are LTE 
phones used as LTE phones versus ones that are non
-
LTE phones, if you can 
take 172 million chips, give us a sense of that? What percent of the modems 
on those 172 are used for LTE, although probably more of them are capable 
with LTE, but 
how many that are actually in the LTE phones versus not and 
the same thing for Snapdragon versus thin modem and give us a sense of 
the ASP differential between those two? So, we can kind of go ahead, kind of 
model out what we think may happen with MSM reve
nue per 

 
ASP per MSM 
chip?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 


but with some customers, they have the ability to mo
ve very, very rapidly 
other customers through their manufacturing, they may have a more 
complicated manufacturing process, other subcontractors what have you, 

long that would take f
or them to have sell
-
through some of my other 

that mix right now. I think we could probably provide some color in New 
York about that. I would say, directionally we are doing quite wel

Hi, guys. Thanks for my taking my questions. I have two quick ones. Firstly 
around your guidance for next quarter, you said that there was uncertainty 
around the
 
timing of the flagship devices in that. Can you give us some 
feeling of what is actually baked into the guidance in terms of how 
conservative or not you might be on that timing? Second question around 
again the capital allocation and the buybacks, so you 
bought more than $10 
billion in stock back over the last five years, your share count is actually up 
over that time. You said you are waiting for the markets to provide a good 
opportunity. Your valuation right now is lower than it ever has and why is it 
ri
ght now not the best opportunity to do may be a much bigger buyback 
than you have done historically?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 


view of pricing it's 
suggesting the mix is going to be impacted by some of the emerging market 

talking about in terms of conservatism. But if you think about where we 
came in on MSMs
 
in Q3 which was well ahead of our guidance, Q3 and Q4 
together looked actually quite good and Q4 is a very similar overall in terms 
of the business for both QTL and QCT it's really some of the higher spending, 
eroding a little bit of the strong performanc
e that we saw in Q3 but still very 
strong performance overall.
 
On the capital allocation front, we do agree it's a good time to buying stock 

and it's continuing into Q4. As I said we
 
have 3.5 billion outstanding, we 


consistent with that view. So we will stay in contact on that.

Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Kulbinder Garcha

A question for Steve I guess, Steve a lot of things went on (inaudible) QCT 
whether it's flagship high end share gains, your LTE position is definitel
y 
coming your ASPs are, very highly QCT business and there is lots of reasons 


medium
-
term would you say th
is is an acceptable level of margin for that 

year of all years especially with the revenue growth you saw they would 
have been a bit more leverage as seen of this (inaudible) and so c
an you 
speak a little bit about that dynamic and a question for Derek I guess on the 
licensing business it's quite clear in this last quarter especially the MediaTek 
and Spreadtrum and alike have seen very strong sequential and year
-
on
-
year volume increase
s, seven chips to the extreme low end of the 
smartphone market I would say. Is your ability to license in there and if so 
your volume number for the overall addressable market just seems a little 

would reconcile 
that dynamics. Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Quick answer to your question on margin target, we actually would expect 
that business to do better and our plans are to make that happen. I think 
one of the things that when I listen to people 
talk about the competitive 
environment that there probably is a difference between our outlook and 
what other people see is that today it's already very competitive. I mean if 
you look at the market structure we essentially compete in Samsung against 
Samsu

more competitive dynamic than that dynamic and we do I think quite well in 
that environment.
 

really it is our level
 
of spending that I think is probably the easiest level to 
deal with that level of spending we think is creating technology distance 
between what our roadmap is providing and what I think other people get by 
doing their own chipsets and if you just look at
 
over the last several years 

competition both on an integrated scale but also individual technology 
vectors. We think that will play well to our strengths moving forward and 
there will be 

seeing additional markets in most of the I think tablet market in the revenue 
line but that is clearly in the cost line, I think it's too early to make a call on 
that but your outlook on that bus
iness I think also has a big lever in terms of 
what will happen long term.
 
Derek Aberle
 
On your second question I think we have been pretty transparent that you 

another 10 licensees th
is quarter. Most of that growth has continued to 
come from China. So, we feel very confident that where we are collecting 
under our agreements, and that we have the main customers of Mediatek 
and Spectrum and others, as well as even the mid and smaller cus
tomers 
licensed and paying.
 
The one exception that we have discussed a number of times is TD
-
SCDMA 
and I think that maybe driving a little bit of the difference in the numbers 
that you are seeing versus the numbers that we are reporting to you as 
royalty b
earing units. And as you know, we have had some difficulties 
collecting on TD
-
SCDMA in China. This year, in particular, we have seen 
pretty meaningful growth in TD
-
SCDMA units in China. And so as we go 

rowth overall of the 
units reported to us, but as I look ahead, our expectation is though as China 
Mobile launches LTE that a significant portion of that volume will start to 
fairly quickly transition over to including the LTE and/or UMTS and that will 
pro
vide a basis for us to collect royalties on those devices, hopefully without 
the same types of challenges that we have had historically around TD
-
SCDMA. So, that would drive kind of accelerated growth year
-
over
-
year

Thanks. Couple of questions. One for Steve, how big has your connectivity 
business grown to and maybe you could talk a bit 
about the tax rates, the 
MSMs versus how many standalone connectivity solutions you have?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure. Mark, if you look at our business, the connectivity business, I 
mentioned earlier that it was actually a record quarter in June for it. And 
no


diversified than probably what people think. Now, that being said, on the 
phones side, we have been I
 
think done a good job in terms of getting pull
-
through for our connectivity solutions either through integrated or through 
standalone on our mid
-
tier and low
-
tier platforms. I gave some comments 
last year actually about how strong that was in terms of a t
ax rate.
 
What we are starting to see and one of the things we are excited about is 
that now we are starting to see Tier 1s start to use the products. And we 

-
ramp one of the necessary or first steps to getting us into 
the flagship devices
 

of us on that, but we see the first signs of success there. We also believe 
that our integration story, which has served us well with RF, power

Steve, you mentioned that your share of content 
improved in the quarter the 


driving that? And would you expect chipset ASPs to continue to grind higher 
af
ter this period? I just wanted to also ask about LTE competition, Broadcom 
indicated yesterday that their LTE solution will be pushed out to the second 
half of next year. So, your assessment of the competitive landscape and how 
big of a lead do you guys th
ink you have today? And then just finally for 
George, you mentioned on the buyback that you guys are being 

for most of the years, so I am just curious what was it or what are
 
you guys 
seeing here in July that pushed you to be more opportunistic with the share 
buyback? Thank you.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 

probably an accurate view of what we are seeing. If you l
ook at our feedback 

door in the near
-
term door, kind of with the feature set they were already 
delivering. As you know we are on our third
-

continue to mo
ve that forward into next year. So it looks like people are 


to be strong in the LTE space. I would 
point to people to the importance of a 

able to deliver solutions in the developed world. The developed world 
because the spectrum constraints really needs to embrace LTE Advance
d 
next year and should you be able to produce a product like that and 
compete with us on a modem space you will also need to do that in an 
integrated SoC which means that you need to make sure that you have a 
world
-
class application process and connectivit
y and graphics and we think 

together we feel quite strong. On the first question I actually forgot what it 
was, could you remind me please?
 
Share content, yes, thank you. On sha


sometimes that comes at less gross margin percentage than our traditional 
modem business but it comes at more dollars and I think a good growth
 
business for us if you have seen in the year
-
over
-

seeing some of that. We also from time to time are able to collect essentially 
value
-
added software fees for additional functionality that we can sell 
alongside the chip and you s
tart to see that sometimes I move around from 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter.
 
So all in all I think it's a strong story for us although from a dollar 
perspective but not at the traditional gross margin percentages that you saw 
in the traditional model business but a g
ood business for us.
 
George Davis
 
Let me just cover your question on again on share buyback. What I talked 
about when I was using the term opportunistic it was really in response to 
the question, that the company has valued an opportunistic strategy over 
t
ime and I still believe that to be the case. The decision to start purchasing 
in Q3 was clearly coming out of the earnings call, although the stock reacted 
and came down, and we felt it was an extremely attractive time to start 
buying back shares. So it ki
nd of goes beyond opportunistic and really a 
view of valuation and again I think you can see from the Outlook and from 
performance in the quarter that the company is performing strongly, we 
think it's a good time to be buying.

So I wanted to see Steve if you can comment again, I mean a question was 
asked earlier on WiFi, there have been some varied blog reports and so on 
suggesting that you guys have had some
 
pretty good sized WiFi wins for 
standalone chips with the big vendors and I just wonder if you can comment 
on whether there has been anything I think the basic situation has been that 
the underlying driver software favored another large vendor that kind o

do you think that there are more software support that might enable people

I would like to get you guys to comment on is we have got these new

exploit a one of the benefits of our platform 
which essentially is that we have had the 11ac or end solution which is the

somewhat of misunderstood, but we are actually at the lead
 
in terms of 

think quite well at the mid

tier in terms of design win percentages, and I 

-
ramp to convince people that at the flagship tier can 
be used as well

but I think the integration story is quite strong on this technology as it is 

that direction.
 
The other things, remember
 
as well, is that eventually the modem, the 
wireless WAN modem and the wireless LAN modem actually have to 
coordinate to manage interference and manage offload in a very coordinated 
way. That particularly becomes important as networks get more dense. So, 
o
ver time, the good technical reasons of integration are augmented by just

e how 
some of these new programs play out, but I think our view is generally 
positive that they should have a positive impact on replacement cycles. 
There has been some concern about whether operators are going to step 
back a bit from subsidies and given t
he smartphone penetration that is in 
some of the developed regions. And I think we are going to see I believe 

drive replacements. If you look at AT&T, I think they just announced 
results 
and they said 35% of their smartphone users are on LTE, which is still 
relatively low and yet they are seeing higher data usage across the LTE 
subscribers. So, you would think that the operators will continue to be 
motivated even with the smartphon
e penetration where it is to drive 
replacement cycle. So, we will see how these play out, but I think generally 
a positive development.

James Faucette from Pacific Crest, you may go ahead with your question.

One quic
k question and a more elaborate question I guess on China, first 
quick question is that you mentioned and you would expect channel 
inventories to come down during the course of the September quarter even 
though you expect them to remain in their typical ra
nge, can you just talk 
about quickly where you think channel inventories or how big do you think 
channel inventories developed during the June quarter? And then on China, 
you mentioned that you expect to start to ramp into China Mobile for their 
testing la
ter this quarter and to the end of this year, how are you thinking 
about the actual activation of the commercial network for TD LTE and its 
timing? And what about the other carriers and their eventual move to 4G 
and how you think about the chipset share op
portunity on those migrations? 
Thank you very much.

So, on channel inventory, the channel inventory peaked in our second fiscal 
quarter or the first calendar quarter in the 15
-
week to 16
-
week range. We 
saw it come down about a week in our fisc
al third quarter and we think it will 
come down at least another week and a half or so in our fourth fiscal 
quarter. So, pretty continuous decline since the peak of Q2.

With respect to LTE in China, we are being driven quite hard to start
 
supporting what are I think very large scale trials at the end of this year. 
And also as I understand the Spectrum situation, from a government 
perspective, has been a lot more clarity given over the last month or so with 
respect to that. So, we expect th
at to start in the second half of this year. 
And then I would expect the other carriers to follow I think it will start in 
LTE
-

very difficult to predict what happens in China, but w
e are being pushed 
hard in that direction.

1/29/15,Qualcomm,"Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. At the outset of the 
year, we established a plan to extend our technology leadership and drive 
strong growth in our core businesses. That's exactly what we've done.
 
Our revenues grew to a record $15 
billion in fiscal 2011, and we delivered 
record earnings and MSM chipset volumes. Looking forward, we expect 
strong revenue and earnings growth again in fiscal 2012. In the coming 
year, we expect continued healthy growth in CDMA
-
based device shipments 
desp
ite the macroeconomic slowdown. Smartphones will lead the way, along 
with the continued global adoption of 3G and accelerating consumer demand 
for wireless data.
 
We had a number highlights this year. We had strong growth in our 
Licensing business, deliveri
ng both record revenues and earnings. We 
successfully resolved 2 licensee disputes and completed the last of the 
WCDMA subscriber unit renewals we highlighted some years ago. We now 
have over 200 royalty
-
bearing 3G licenses and 13 single
-
mode OFDM 
licensee
s around the world.
 
During fiscal 2011, we also continued to expand our licensee base in China, 
adding more than 20 new Chinese licensees. Through our licensing program, 
we continue to foster innovation and support the ecosystem that benefits 
wireless cons
umers worldwide.
 
And QCT continued to execute well. We believe our Snapdragon family of 
chipsets has established the industry standard in mobile, allowing us to 
expand our partnerships with several new customers. We've sampled the 
industry's first integrat
ed application processor and multimode LTE platform 
for handsets. The breadth and depth of our product portfolio is unparalleled, 
and we believe that our WCDMA chipset volumes are growing faster than the 
competition.
 
We completed our largest acquisition to
 
date with the addition of Atheros. 
The integration process has gone very well, and we're starting to see good 
progress on our combined road map and expanded channel opportunities.
 
In India, we worked hard to ensure LTE TDD was adopted, and we're 
pleased t
o see the initial build out contracts being awarded. And according to 
GSA, there are 2 commercial LTE TDD networks in Saudi Arabia, with an 
additional 27 operators making LTE TDD network investments around the 
world. We've collaborated with several OEMs on
 
the launch of multimode 3G 
LTE TDD devices, demonstrating the ecosystem's readiness for deployment.
 
QIS successfully launched the QChat push
-
to
-
talk platform with both Sprint 
and Nextel International with handsets provided by multiple OEM partners. 
With r
espect to mirasol, we continue to work with partners on low
-
volume 
projects as we await the completion of our new fab.
 
And as planned, we have executed on our restructuring plan for FLO TV and 
have agreed to sell the related spectrum to AT&T. And we believ
e that 
regulatory approval should be granted as expeditiously as possible as our 
proposed spectrum sale furthers many of the key policy goals that the SEC is 
actively promoting.
 
Specifically, the deal will ensure that our unpaired spectrum is put to its 
hi
ghest and best use as soon as possible, putting up much needed spectrum 
for mobile broadband just as the SEC is striving to address the spectrum 
crunch that we're all facing. And it will result in the world's first deployment 
of supplemental downlink techn
ology, thereby promoting mobile innovation. 
Furthermore, there is going to be significant tax revenue generated for the 
government once that transaction closes.
 
So overall, we delivered very strong earnings and operating cash flow 
growth in fiscal 2011. We
 
increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive 
year and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and 
cash dividends. We ended the year well positioned with a strong balance 
sheet, including approximately $21 billion in cash and mar
ketable securities.
 
Turning to calendar 2012. We expect CDMA
-
based device shipments to grow 
approximately 16% year
-
over
-
year based on the 900 million
-
unit midpoint 
of our forecast. And when we look at our business, we see 5 key drivers for 
growth.
 
First is
 
the continued mass adoption of smartphones. According to Gartner, 
global smartphone shipments reached 108 million units in the second 
quarter of 2011, representing a 74% year
-
over
-
year increase and are 
expected to surpass 1 billion units annually by 2015.
 
Second is the growth of 3G in emerging regions. According to Wireless 
Intelligence, approximately 67 million 3G connections were added in 
emerging regions this past quarter, representing a 38% year
-
over
-
year 
increase, and greater than 1.5 billion new 3G c
onnections are expected to be 
added in these regions through the end of 2015.
 
A third catalyst is the opportunity for mobile computing and the expansion of 
3G connectivity into device types beyond the handset. Microsoft's 
demonstration of Windows 8 on Snap
dragon at their recent developer 
conference underscores this shift in the computing landscape. Further, as an 
indication of this trend, AT&T recently reported that nearly half their third 
quarter net wireless additions came from devices other than handsets
.
 
The fourth key driver is the continued deployment of advanced network 
technologies to handle the accelerating demand for data. According to the 
GSA, there are now 152 HSPA+ and 35 LTE commercial networks 
throughout the globe. According to CDG, there are 
also 129 EV
-
DO Rev. A 
and 10 Rev. B networks.
 
And finally, we see the expansion of connectivity as a growth driver for our 
business. We believe in an Internet of everything where we'll be surrounded 
by an increasing number of connected devices, and the com
bination of 
Atheros with QCT positions us well for that opportunity. We'll explore these 
key drivers in more detail during our upcoming New York Analyst Day, and I 
look forward to seeing many of you there.
 
To wrap up, we've completed another outstanding ye
ar at Qualcomm, and 
I'd once again like to thank all of our employees and partners for their 
ingenuity, effort and support. Looking forward, I'm pleased with our outlook 
for continued strong revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2012.
 
That concludes my rem
arks, and I'll now turn the call over to Qualcomm's 
President and COO
-
elect, Steve Mollenkopf.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business delivered 
strong results again this year, reflecting increased demand 
across our broad 
product portfolio, particularly for smartphone chipsets.
 
We had another record year, shipping approximately 483 million MSMs, up 
21% year
-
over
-
year. We just completed our highest
-
volume quarter in 
history with approximately 127 million MSM
s shipped. We are extremely 
pleased to have completed the Atheros acquisition and are off to strong start 
in providing our customers best
-
in
-
class connectivity and networking 
solutions, expanding our business beyond mobile into consumer electronics, 
comput
ing and networking.
 
We also made a number of other targeted acquisitions that added to our 
technology portfolio to enable new opportunities. Our integration strategy 
continues to win in mobile wireless and is a clear driver of our strong results. 
Shipments
 
of our integrated Snapdragon chipsets grew more than 4x this 
year. The cost, size and performance advantages of our integrated approach 
position us to grow faster than our competitors. We expect the demand for 
integrated chipsets to increase at both high 
end and mass market 
smartphone sales growth, particularly in developing regions.
 
We have worked hard to extend our customer footprint, and you can see the 
results in the marketplace. Nokia just launched their first Windows Phone 7 
devices based on our sili
con. The BlackBerry 7 base launches use our 
products globally, and we have grown and diversified our OEM partnerships 
in China. Our extensive tier chipset products are clearly aligned with the 
needs of device OEMs, and we are now providing solutions to all
 
the leading 
device manufacturers in our industry.
 
There are now more than 300 Snapdragon
-
based devices announced and 
more than 350 additional devices in development. New Snapdragon
-
based 
devices launched this quarter include the HTC Jetstream LTE tablet f
or AT&T, 
the BlackBerry Torch 9850, and the Samsung GALAXY S II for T
-
Mobile USA 
and the Samsung GALAXY Tab 10.1 LTE for NTT DOCOMO. We have made 
tremendous progress with the move to 28
-
nanometer, and the Snapdragon 
MSM8960 is seeing very strong design act
ivity across our customer base.
 
LTE is increasingly becoming a design requirement, and our time
-
to
-
market 
advantage with integrated LTE multimode in the MSM8960 is valued by our 
customers. In addition to global connectivity in the 8960, we continue to 
lead
 
in computing and graphics with our new Krait CPU micro
-
architecture 
and next
-
generation Adreno graphics system. The Qualcomm Atheros team 
is also executing well with quarter
-
over
-
quarter growth across all channels 
and geographic regions as wireless attach
 
rates continue to increase in 
consumer electronics and QCA's comprehensive networking platforms, 
consisting of WiFi, PLC and ethernet, drive greater value.
 
We continue to invest in the Windows computing platform and associated 
ecosystem to address new dev
ice categories beyond traditional cellular. 
Microsoft recently demonstrated Windows 8 running on Snapdragon at their 
BUILD conference and highlighted how our mobile architecture enables a 
feature called connected standby. This feature enables a Windows 8 P
C to 
run on low
-
power mode and remain connected to the network and always up 
to the date, much like smartphones do today. This underscores the 
advantages our mobile architecture does in bringing the computing realm 
and demonstrates the natural advantages o
f a Snapdragon
-
based solution. 
We expect Windows 8 to be a significant opportunity for us beyond this fiscal 
year.
 
As we move forward, we continue to expect our operating margins to reflect 
the growing mix of mass
-
market smartphones, continued investment i
n 
mobile computing and the full year effect of the acquisitions we made this 
year. Even with this, we are expecting fiscal 2012 revenue and operating 
income to grow at a rate in excess of CDMA device growth. Further, we are 
expecting to get off to a strong
 
start with MSM shipments estimated to be 
between 146 and 154 million units in the first fiscal quarter.
 
In closing, we believe the QCT team executed very well in fiscal 2011 and 
continued to drive our technology and integration leadership position in 
the 
industry. We believe we are in a strong competitive position to continue to 
grow and to lead the transition to smartphones across all tiers and regions, 
as well as the growth of mobile computing.
 
That concludes my remarks. I look forward to seeing many
 
of you in New 
York at our upcoming analyst event. I will now turn the call over to Bill 
Keitel.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We have strong financial 
results to report to you again today. Fiscal fourth quarter revenues
 
were a 
record $4.1 billion, up 39% year
-
over
-
year, and non
-
GAAP operating income 
grew 44% year
-
over
-
year. Non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $0.80, up 
18% year
-
over
-
year.
 
QCT fiscal fourth quarter revenues reached a new record, growing 39% 
year
-
over
-
year on
 
the strength of record MSM shipments, reflecting strong 
demand for our integrated Snapdragon chipsets for the growing smartphone 
segment, as well as a full quarter of Atheros revenues.
 
QTL revenues grew 48% year
-
over
-
year, and total reported device sales 
by 
our licensees were approximately $39.1 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter, 
up 38% year
-
over
-
year driven by strength in both emerging and developed 
regions.
 
We estimate that approximately 187 million to 191 million subscriber units 
were shipped by our
 
licensees in the June quarter at an average selling price 
of approximately $204 to $210. We continue to see handset ASP strength 
across both emerging and developed regions, as well as increasing breadth 
of connected devices.
 
We paid $361 million in cash d
ividends this quarter. And in response to the 
volatility and declining global stock markets, we engaged in $827 million of 
activity related to our stock repurchase program. During the fourth fiscal 
quarter of 2011 and to date through fiscal 2012, we have r
epurchased $241 
million of our common stock and sold 3 put options that will expire at 
different times in the latter half of fiscal 2012 when we expect to have 
higher domestic cash balances. If these puts are exercised, we will 
repurchase approximately $51
1 million of our common stock, net of option 
premiums, at an average net price of $43.30 per share. Whether or not the 
puts are exercised, we will retain $75 million of cash premiums and 
therefore believe our stockholders will benefit in either case.
 
Turni
ng to our results for the full fiscal 2011 year. Revenues were a record 
$15 billion, up 36% year
-
over
-
year, reflecting strong execution by our QTL 
and QCT businesses and continued smartphone adoption and 2G to 3G 
migration. GAAP earnings were a record $2.5
2 per share, up 29% year
-
over
-
year. Record non
-
GAAP operating income was more than $6 billion, up 41% 
year
-
over
-
year, and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were a record $3.20, up 
30% year
-
over
-
year.
 
QCT's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record and grew 32% year
-
ove
r
-
year 
with an operating margin of 23%, consistent with our original guidance 
range at the outset of the fiscal year. QCT's operating income grew 21% 
year
-
over
-
year.
 
QTL's fiscal 2011 revenues were a record, up 48% year
-
over
-
year, and the 
operating margin 
improved to 88% of revenue. We estimate that the fiscal 
2011 device average selling price, as reported by our licensees, was 
approximately $203 to $209 above our initial expectations at the outset of 
this year, reflecting strong adoption of smartphones aro
und the globe. We 
are reaffirming our 775 million
-
unit midpoint estimate for calendar 2011 
CDMA
-
based device shipments up approximately 18% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Now turning to next year. We've incorporated in our forecast the most 
recent consensus worldwide eco
nomic forecast, which takes into account the 
serious concerns for Europe and very low GDP growth in the U.S. We 
estimate calendar 2012 CDMA
-
based device shipments will grow 
approximately 12% to 21% year
-
over
-
year. We anticipate fiscal 2012 
revenues to be i
n the range of approximately $18 billion to $19 billion, up 
approximately 24% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect our non
-
GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $6.7 billion to 
$7.2 billion, an increase of approximately 14% at the 
midpoint. We expect 
fiscal 2012 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.42 to 
$3.62, an increase of approximately 10% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We expect that the acquisitions that Steve just mentioned will be modestly 
dilutive to fiscal
 
2012 non
-
GAAP earnings per share, and this has been 
included in our guidance. As a reminder, we do not include estimates for 
realized investment gains or losses on our cash and marketable securities 
portfolio unless such gains or losses are reasonably cer
tain, which, in turn, 
impacts the year
-
over
-
year earnings per share growth comparison.
 
We expect QTL operating margins to be in the range of 86% to 88% for 
fiscal 2012. For the QCT segment, as Steve mentioned, we expect strong 
year
-
over
-
year growth in reve
nue and operating income, leveraging the 
fiscal 2011 strategy, which we think has been successfully executed. We 
expect QCT operating margins to be approximately 20% to 22% for fiscal 
2012. We estimate that the fiscal 2012 device ASP reported to us by our 
licensees for the QTL business will be approximately $197 to $209, reflecting 
continued adoption of smartphones at multiple tiers around the globe and a 
greater percentage of total device volume coming from lower
-
priced regions 
such as China and India.
 
We 
anticipate that non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses will grow 
approximately 15% year
-
over
-
year, plus or minus a couple of points, and 
driven primarily by growth in R&D expense and a full year of Atheros. We 
expect our non
-
GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2012 
to be approximately 18% to 
19% and our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%.
 
Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We estimate revenues to be 
approximately $4.35 billion to $4.75 billion, an increase of 36% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect
 
fiscal first quarter non
-
GAAP operating 
income to be approximately $1.67 billion to $1.8 billion, an increase of 23% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We anticipate that non
-
GAAP earnings per 
share will be approximately $0.86 to $0.92, an increase of 9% yea
r
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. This estimate includes shipments of approximately 146 
million to 154 million MSM chipsets during the December quarter, reflecting 
strong sequential growth and successful execution on QCT's strategy.
 
We expect total reported dev
ice sales of approximately $37.5 billion to $41.5 
billion by our licensees for shipments in the September quarter, up 16% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint, reflecting strong handset volume growth 
expected in emerging and developed regions, as well as increas
ed non
-
handset device shipments.
 
We expect a small build in the CDMA channel inventory in the December 
quarter, as is typical for the holiday season, and we estimate that CDMA 
inventory channel will remain at the low end of the historic 15
-
 
to 20
-
week 
band
 
throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012. We expect a modest 
sequential increase in non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A combined expenses, and we 
expect our non
-
GAAP tax rate for the first fiscal quarter to be approximately 
18% to 19%.
 
We look forward to seeing you in N
ew York for our Analyst Day meeting on 
November 16 where we will share additional data points regarding our fiscal 
2012 guidance. In the meantime, the Qualcomm Investor Relations website 
includes a thorough slide presentation on the data points included on
 
today's 
call.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren 
Kneeshaw.

part, if I could, on the unit growth assumptions. Sticking 
--
 
Bill, sticking 
to the 775, I know you're not giving the September number, but the royalty 
revenue looks kind of flat, sequential. So it looks to me like t
hat's implying a 
much 
--
 
low double
-
digit sequential growth in the fourth quarter. So what is 
the reason for a little less
-
than
-
seasonal Q4 compared to historic? And does 
that have any impact on your model for next year that the 16% growth is 
also below wh
at we've done in the last few years? Is it more cautious for you 
in Q4? Does that carryover seasonality
-
wise to the calendar '12 number?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure, Tim. Yes, we are reaffirming the 775 number. And for next year, the 
midpoint growth 
estimate of about 16% is a little lower than we've seen in 
recent years. But likewise, we think the global economy is looking weaker as 
well. So we've triangulated that CDMA
-
based unit shipment forecast for next 
year to a rather low global GDP growth estim
ate, again particularly for 
Europe but also for the U.S. The strength we're seeing, if anywhere, on 
global GDP would be in the emerging markets. Specific to our fiscal Q1 
guidance relative to the fiscal Q4, if you'll recall, the QTL revenues are 
recorded o
ne quarter in arrears. And so what we'll report in our fiscal Q1 will 
be shipments for fiscal Q4. Fiscal Q4 we don't think had a significant growth 
over fiscal Q3 in the market, whereas for the market as a whole, we are 
seeing strong growth in the 
--
 
in th
is first fiscal quarter, which QTL, we 
expect, will reflect next quarter.

Steve, just want to get some more color on the 8960. As you move to 28
-
nanomet
er, it seems like a turnkey product for your road map in 2012. This 
product brand, how should we think about it as it impacts your ASP? Should 
we kind of have our normal seasonal price decline in March, but then, as 
8960 ramps, your ASPs could kind of go u
p embedded in your guidance? 
Just trying to get some color on ASP. And then, if you can just give any color 
on 8960 in general, that'd be very helpful.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
A couple of things. One is it's progressing pretty much the way that we had 
hoped. 
So it's on track for the dates that we talked about last call. We'll see 
that build volume through really the mid
-
calendar year of '12 and 
--
 
as 
we've said before. So quite happy with how that's looking both from a 
designing perspective as well as from the
 
engineering side. We will 
--
 
that 
will build throughout the year. We're also taking the 28
-
nanometer process 
and we're actually going to create a tier of products, which I think we've 
talked a little bit about before. On a high
-
end, more of a tablet
-
speci
fic part 
as well as a mass market LTE product. So if you look at 28
-
nanometer in 
total through next year, or through this year, fiscal year '12, you'll see it 
build on the 8960, which I would consider to be a premium part, and then 
transition to a tiered r
oad map pretty consistent with what we've done with 
other technology transitions as well.

I have 2 related questions, and then just one clarification. Further 
clarif
ication is about Forex. How do you look at foreign exchange and the 
fluctuations we have seen last quarter? And kind of what 
--
 
your 
assumptions for next year when you give out the guidance. My question is 
about the semiconductor business about 
--
 
first, s
hare prospects in China 
and India given the recent ramp of MediaTek and spectrum. And also, given 
all the puts and takes that there are in QCT, what are your ASP assumptions 
for next year? And I'm not referring to perhaps a number but just to 
understand th
e thinking process behind it.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Tal, I'll take your first one here on the FX. For the near term here, it's pretty 
minor really. For the quarter we just reported, there is a couple of dollar 
impact, and we see an offsetting couple of dollar 
impact in the first quarter. 
A little positive for the fourth quarter, a little negative for the first quarter. 
For the full year at this point, our 
--
 
we're not forecasting much of an FX 
impact at all. On the ASPs, the second one, we are expecting a conti
nued 
strong acceleration of smartphones. I think that's probably our single biggest 
driver on the smartphones. They've grown substantially this year. The 
penetration rate has come up nicely. We expect continued strong growth 
there in fiscal '12. On top of 
that, we are forecasting stronger growth in the 
emerging markets relative to developed markets. So that would be, I think, 
the second most significant variable. The first one, the smartphone growth, 
is putting upward pressure on the ASPs. Stronger emerging
 
market growth 
relative to developed market growth is putting some downward pressure on 
them.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
And this is Steve. I can maybe just say a few things about share. So we feel 
that we're pretty well positioned actually in the emerging marke
ts. In fact, 
it's been an area of strength for us for some time. And the initial products 
that we've had 
--
 
we've been launching here in the last couple of years have 
actually been quite successful worldwide. I think our 27 family of products 
just recently
 
throughout the fiscal 2011 actually crossed the 100 million
-
unit 
mark. And we've just upgraded that product line and the 27A [ph], and that 
was actually our fastest product to go from tapeout to products
-
in
-
stores 
ever. So it's 
--
 
we feel that's been a go
od product for us, and we feel pretty 
well positioned. Those markets, though, are new areas for us in terms of 
their transitions to smartphones, and we look at that really as an 
opportunity versus a risk.

A couple of questions. First, I was attending a trade show today, and we had 
2 operators, Verizon and Sprint, talking a lot about multiple devices amongst 
their users, as well as machine
-
to
-
machine. Do you plan 
to break out units 
going into non
-
handheld devices at some point in the future in terms of 
forecasting machine
-
to
-
machine in some of these other opportunities? Could 
you give us an idea of the sizing of those markets? Second question. Steve, 
give us an upd
ate on the timing of when you plan to send that 50% market 
share letter to Irwin?
 
William E. Keitel
 
I'll let Steve take that second one. This is Bill. On the first one, we're having 
that discussion, Brian, of whether we will would breakout more. We haven't
 
made a firm decision for the analyst [indiscernible]. But I would caution our 
leaning is not to do so. Having said that, we 
--
 
to your point about multiple 
devices per user, we are working on a little more color around just that point 
and the kind of pene
tration rates that we're starting to see in different 
regions around the world. And hopefully, that will be both a interesting and 
an informative day that we can bring forward in New York.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
And Brian, I think I won't comment on exactly 
the timing, but he actually 
does that write an email on this topic every once in a while. But I would say 
we've been quite pleased with how the WCDMA business has been 
performing. And I think with the sequential increase in the MSM volume, it's 
been 
--
 
I t
hink the strategy's been paying off, both for the smartphone 
products as well as the modem
-
specific products. We're quite pleased with 
how the business is performing.

Just a couple of quick ones. One, on the 
--
 
Steve, you had mentioned that 
there are 350 Snapdragon devices in development right now. Can you give 
us a sense just how many of those are on the 8960? And I think it's 
interesting you mentioned Samsung, as w
ell, on one of their tablets. If you 
can just give us some color as to what those 350 look like, because again, 
versus the 300 it seems that are out there right now it would sort of pretend 
that the mix 
--
 
in your shipments are going to go well towards the
 
Snapdragon side versus today, when it seems to be overwhelmingly on the 
baseband side. But if you can give us a sense as to what's in those 350. My 
other question for Bill was on the QCT margin, on linearity next year. I think 
you guided to 20% to 22% for
 
the year. It looks like lead
-
in guide fiscal Q1, 
it looks like we're going to start the year somewhat on the hotter side of 
that. I would imagine 22% or higher in fiscal Q1. And with the 8960 coming 
in the back half of the fiscal year, I've always thought
 
that to be a higher
-
operating
-
margin product. So I'm just wondering, how do we get into the 
20% to 22% range? It looks like we're starting at the high end and only 
going higher as the year goes on. If you can just give us a sense as to what 
the linearity 
of the QCT operating margin looks like, Bill, that'd be awesome.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Ehud, this is Steve. So in answer to your first question, the 350, it's a pretty 
broad mix. As you know, we 
--
 
our Snapdragon family is a 
--
 
is really a 
family of 
products, from the mass
-
market smartphones all the way up into 
integrated LTE products. And what we're seeing in terms of forward
-
looking 
mix is, I would say, tremendous growth in the mass
-
market smartphones 
around the world. You're seeing a lot of designi
ng activity in those mass
-
market areas. We're also starting to see, I think, more penetration of LTE 
and the leading AP processor coming together. I think we talked a little bit 
about this throughout the year in 2011, how we thought the second half of 
2011
 
calendar would include products that had both high
-
performing 
application processor coming alongside with the LTE chipset, as well. Again, 
multimode LTE chipset. And we're seeing that play out. It's a good on
-
ramp, 
I think, into the 8960. So it's very, ve
ry mixed, and I think it reflects the 
market outlook, if you look at the mix of Snapdragon products. If you look at 
the market outlook, which I think is really very 
--
 
strong growth up and 
down the tiers. We're seeing that same thing in design and activity
.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Ehud, this is Bill. On your point on the margins, QCT margins. We do think 
we're getting off to a good start here in this first fiscal quarter on a number 
of fronts, including the QCT margin. Beyond that, in terms of how the year 
will p
lay out, we are working on planning to give more color on that in New 
York week after next. In the meantime, what I would just say is that when I 
look at the timing of what I see for this year as compared to prior years 
--
 
maybe put 2009 aside because ther
e was such a sudden change in channel 
inventory in that year. Put 2009 aside. But compared to other years, I don't 
think the revenue profile, or the operating income profile through the year

A couple of quick ones for me. First of all, Bill, on the impact of acquisiti
ons 
on '12, I believe you mentioned it's slightly dilutive. But if I remember 
correctly, Atheros was supposed to be modestly accretive. So maybe I 
missed an update somewhere in the middle. If you can reconcile that. And 
second, with respect to QCT margins 
again, now that the Atheros is in the 
mix and you're going deeper into the meat tier of the market, Steve, as you 
mentioned in your prepared remarks, is your path here again somehow into 
the mid
-
20s? Or is this going to be a very long
-
term kind of margin t
arget 
out there?
 
William E. Keitel
 
Ittai, it's Bill. I'll take your first one on the acquisitions. You are correct. We 
did 
--
 
we mentioned last year that for 2012, we thought Atheros would be 
accretive to non
-
GAAP by a couple of cents, and that is built in
to our 
guidance. The 
--
 
what I mentioned in my comments, introductory 
comments, was that relative to some acquisitions we completed in the fourth 
fiscal quarter, GestureTek being one and an asset acquisition we made being 
another, the combination of those 
2 
--
 
there was a third small one. The 
combination of those 3 will 
--
 
I expect will largely offset the accretion that 
we're looking for, for Atheros.

Just a couple for m
e. One is just back to Atheros. I wonder if you guys could 
comment on what the revenue contribution was in the quarter and what 
you're expecting growth to look like next year, that being the first one. And 
the second one is back to kind of the QCT margin p
oint. I mean, the revenue 
guidance is ahead of what we would have expected and I think what the 
Street would have expected for next year, so that's good news. EPS, though, 
coming in pretty close to inline with what we were thinking. And I guess the 
extra r
evenue looks like, based on your unit guidance for devices or 
handsets, it's coming mostly from QCT. But I think that 
--
 
the EPS suggests 
that the margins really aren't as good there. So I'm just trying to figure out 
how 
--
 
why that's the case because we d
o expect that mix to be shifting up 
towards Snapdragon and would have expected that Snapdragon mix to 
augment those margins.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Rod, this is Bill. I'll contribute some comments to your questions. Maybe 
others would have a few other thought. 
On the Atheros one, we gave a lot of 
detail on Atheros last quarter because we had guided fiscal Q3 without 
Atheros and then, of course, we closed on the acquisition. So we gave extra 
detail on Atheros. We're going to refrain from that for the most part, g
oing 
forward, other than just reiterate Steve's comments that we have seen good 
growth from the Atheros business and we expect strong growth next year as 
well. On the 
--
 
your point on the margin guidance and the EPS, we are 
--
 
yes, I mean, I think we're a 
bit higher. Our EPS midpoint, anyway, is a bit 
higher than where the Street average was. I don't know how much was 
being imputed in for these acquisitions we completed in 
--
 
just completed in 
the fiscal fourth quarter, which degraded that by a bit. But bey
ond that, as I 
did say on my opening comments, we do expect QCT operating margins to 
be in a range of 20% to 22%, which 
--
 
put a little perspective to it. You do 
have a 
--
 
you get a full year Atheros in there, and Atheros operating margin 
operated a few hu
ndred basis points below what we typically operated at. So 
number one. Number two 
--
 
I'm already getting into a bit of what we're 
going to share in New York, but I'll just touch on it. The operating expense 
growth that we expect for fiscal '12 will be heav
ily weighted towards QCT 
again. So that's putting a little pressure on the operating margin as well. But 
other than that, I would just say, I think, as Steve said it, I think if we can 
execute in a 20% to 22% range operating margin for QCT at the kind of 
g
rowth we expect and with the substantial investments that we're making 
for the future, I think we feel pretty good about that.

I wanted to ask a few questions. On
e is on Windows 8. This is probably for 
Steve. If you can give a sense of the timing? And then also, on the timing of 
that, what kind of developments you're seeing in terms of the applications 
porting of regular desktop
-
 
or notebook
-
style apps for ARMs
-
bas
ed Windows 
at 8 and how that's going to roll out. And then the second is for Bill just on 
how much of your cash is offshore versus onshore.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
Mark, this is Steve. I'll talk about the first question. On Windows 8, as I said 
in my remarks,
 
we don't think that will be the big revenue event here in this 
fiscal year. But we continue to invest, I think, upstream of what we think will 
be a very interesting opportunity. So there are multiple chipsets actually 
right now in development in support o
f what we think will be a pretty 
interesting market here in the next several years. The 
--
 
I don't want to talk 
in any great detail about the timing. I think Microsoft alluded to that, or at 
least provided some indication at their recent BUILD conference, 
but I will 
say that the initial products that we will use are already in the lab and 
already are in customer hands. So it's really an active development project 
now for us.

William E. Keitel
 
Jeff, I'll offer some thoughts here. This is Bill. I 
--
 
my first thought is that it 
mirrors much of what we commented earlier on with respect to QTL ASPs, 
that we're 
expecting much faster growth in the emerging world relative to 
the developed world. And the emerging world typically is a bit lower
-
end 
solution than what we see in developed world. But similarly with the 
Licensing business, where we're seeing 
--
 
we think 
we'll continue to see a 
strong acceleration in smartphones penetration. That is playing pretty well, I 
think, into our capabilities and our strategy on the QCT side. But I would say 
it's more developed versus emerging that would be the key theme there.

I'm going to ask another question on the Windows 8 front, this time to Paul. 
With the smartphone share gains really now playing out 
--
 
I think you wou
ld 
have sketched it out a year ago, Paul. I think the most controversial part of 
the story, Qualcomm's story, is the opportunity in Win 8 in PCs and what 
Qualcomm can do there. So the question is what would you consider to be a 
successful entry into the ma
rket as we 
--
 
12 months from now looking back, 
what will you define as success? And then second, market share
-
wise, where 
do you want to be in 2 to 3 years in PCs? Or is there a specific segment 
where you think you'll be most competitive?
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
Ma
tt, that's a nice try, but I'm not going to project market shares. But 
anyways, you know what? I will look back and say that we're successful if 
we see a strong launch and adoption of ARM
-
based devices, a significant 
number of application developers, both 
on new types of applications and 
porting applications, and also that we get strong adoption of mobile 
broadband into those devices. In terms of numbers, you can go 
--
 
you can 
look at the size of shipments of laptops. You won't see us driving into things 
li
ke workstations, high
-
performance computing. There are companies that 
are talking about servers based on ARM. That's not our initial target. So I 
think that you'll see really kind of a market of tablets, clamshells and 
convertible devices, and really focus
ed in on lightweight, long battery life, 
instant on, always on. We've done some really interesting demonstrations 
about how Microsoft's been able to turn off a lot of the parts of the system 
and really drive the power consumption down and yet have it turn 
on real 
quickly. So having all those kinds of functionality come to market, I think 
that will be, really, a good definition of success. And then as time goes on, 
we will see how much of that market we're able to take. And then as time 
goes on even farther,
 
how ARM
-
based devices can push up into those 
higher
-
performance computing classes.

Just on the semiconductor business, you mentioned connectivity as a driver. 
A
s you integrate the Atheros road map into the Snapdragon platform, where 
do you see yourself gaining connectivity share? Is it in the high
-
end LTE 
phones or more low
-
end devices? And then, Bill, a question on seasonality. 
For the March quarter, your fiscal
 
Q2, if I take the 10
-
year average 
excluding the high and the low, revenues are up about 2%. Is that how you 
think about seasonality for the March period?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
It's Steve. I'll take the first part of that. So on connectivity, it's very much
 
an integration story, both at the high end and at the low end. One of the 
things that we've seen, particularly on the 8960 platform where we've 
--
 
where it's for the first time that we've integrated wireless LAN in with the 
baseband. We've been very pleas
ed with the traction that we've been able to 
get. And so it's a very similar story to what we've seen in the past when 
we've integrated products. It's a much, much easier way to deliver the 
product to the OEM, and I think it comes at a better cost and a be
tter 
performance envelope. So we expect the connectivity attachment to increase 
as we move forward consistent with that strategy.
 
William E. Keitel
 
On the seasonality for March. So March quarter, obviously, is post the 
Christmas season's selling period for
 
--
 
which is pretty key for a number of 
markets. We typically see the channel build up a little extra inventory during 
that Christmas time, and then it gets worked off in 
--
 
through the March 
quarter. So that typically shows through in our QCT results. Whe
reas, on the 
QTL side, our 
--
 
the 
--
 
when we report March quarter, obviously that is 
December shipments of our licensees. So you get the Christmas effect in the 
Licensing side in the March quarter. The last couple of years, those 2 things 
have pretty well 
offset, and March has been a very 
--
 
I think, quite 
respectable. We're going to give a little more color on what we see this year 
when we're in New York, and 
--
 
but on average, you expect a little inventory 
work
-
off in the March quarter.

I had just a couple of quick questions for Bill and then one for Steve 
Mollenkopf. First, you mentioned that you'd 
--
 
seemed like you had muted 
your forecast fo
r units for next calendar year due to macro concerns, 
particularly for U.S. and Europe. Can you give us an idea of how that 
affected it? Did it just leave you with a lower low
-
end of your forecast range? 
Or 
--
 
just trying to gauge magnitude there. And seco
ndly, for you, Bill, what 
the drag from mirasol was in fiscal year 2011, and how we should think 
about that for 2012. And then finally for Steve, can you just talk about the 
stand
-
alone app processor market? Obviously, most of your commentary has 
been focu
sed on integration, and that's key differentiator for Qualcomm. But 
you have a stand
-
alone app processor, I believe, right now in the market. 
How should we think about that segment of the business for you?
 
William E. Keitel
 
James, on your first question on
 
the next year market and what effect did it 
have, the macroeconomic concerns on the broader unit shipments we see. 
We've found over the years a pretty good correlation between GDP growth in 
a region and the rate at which new wireless devices are bought by
 
the end 
consumer. So we've successfully used that correlation in our forecasting. 
We're continuing to use that correlation. I expect 
--
 
it is 
--
 
I don't see a 
major reason that would suddenly change. Then what helps Qualcomm is 
this continuing migration f
rom 2G to 3G. So although we see a fairly 
lackluster world economy next year, we expect 3G will do a bit better than 
mobile devices as a whole because of the 2G to 3G transition. And then 
thirdly, the specifics we have seen, how we adjust our forecast. We 
typically 
see in a lower
-
GDP
-
growth environment is that replacement rate. 
Consumers tend to hold on to their devices a little bit longer. So we've 
incorporated a little lower replacement rate forecast than what we otherwise 
would have done. And then also, 
just the new device volume gets impacted 
as well. So that's kind of how we work through our forecast on that macro. 
It really leverages from this correlation we found between total mobile 
devices and GDP growth region by region. On mirasol, we did give an 
indication at the outset of 2011 that we expected 
--
 
I think it was 
--
 
if I 
remember correctly, we said about a $225 million operating loss. I expect 
we'll update that in New York. And at this point 
--
 
but with the business 
progressing, the R&D continuing 
and starting to bring more fab capacity 
online, we have a larger operating loss built into our guidance. So we will 
share more color on that in New York.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf
 
James, this is Steve. With respect to your question on the stand
-
alone apps 
processor. Yes, we do have a stand
-
alone AP product. And we really did that 
because we had customers asking us for it, which I think is a great 
statement about the quality of the product. But by and large, the majority of 
the customer requests have been to
 
have the integrated product. And I think 
there are 2 dynamics which are pulling that through. The first one is at the 
high end, it tends 
--
 
the high
-
end application processor tends to travel with 
the leading
-
edge modem. And we deliver those products toget
her, and I 
think it's a very competitive offering. You see that in the 8960, but you've 
also seen that in our Fusion product line where we have really made it very 
easy for the OEMs to integrate together the LTE product and the dual
-
core 
application proces
sor. Now in the low tier, it tends to be that cost is a big 
driver. So integration tends to rule the day there. And so majority of our 
shipments there tend to be in the integrated fashion. But we'll do whatever 
the market asks us to do in this case.

A question for Bill on just the addressable market growth or the 16% you're 
looking for. Belying the standard statements you made around trying to 
factor in the 
weaker macro environment, I guess, just what surprises me a 
little bit is that compared to previous downturns, handset demand has 
normally got impacted quite quickly. I don't think we've seen in either the 
third quarter results or that most of the handset 
vendors have actually 
reported, all what they're talking about for Q4, in fact, if you aggregate the 
top 7 or 8 vendors. So if it hasn't come through now, what makes you think 
that you may come through later, and that just good old
-
fashioned 
Qualcomm conse
rvatism? And the other thing about the 16% growth, I 
would have thought in there you would have also tablet growth. And the 
tablet market, depending on whose estimates you look at, is very immature. 
It could almost double next year. So that means that the 
underlying handset 
growth rate in your estimates is probably even lower than 16%. And so I'm 
just trying to square all this together in terms of what you see your 
customers in the chipset and licensee side say about demand in the near 
term that makes you f
lirt [ph] this conservatism as well as how you factor 
tablets into that number as well.
 
William E. Keitel
 
Sure, Kulbiner. On the tablet specifically, what we forecast is the 3G
-
enabled. That's what's in our numbers. We are looking for strong growth in 
tablets, but it's a relatively small base relative to 
--
 
when compared to 
handsets. So I think we're as top 
--
 
on top of that forecast as we can be. On 
your point about the overall forecast, I'll just put an overall perspective to it 
to begin with. First o
f all, I mean, for this year, I think the midpoint of our 
estimates all year has been 775 million units, and we'll see. But all data 
points at this point suggest that that's going to be pretty close to the actual. 
Last year, I think our total market estima
te was off low single digit relative 
to what we started our guidance with. The year before, 2009, a very difficult 
environment for anybody to forecast in. I believe we were still single digit 
within our forecast to actual. It was higher single digits but n
onetheless. So I 
--
 
overall, I feel pretty good about the teams that put a lot of effort into the 
forecasting of that. I think we've done pretty good, but obviously we have to 
stay very focused for the 
--
 
going forward. On the 
--
 
now on the market, 
recall 
that not all OEMs report, or report in the same breakout as compared 
to what we get. And the OEM base and licensee base, for that matter, too, 
has grown substantially here, even in this last year, particularly in the last 
couple of years. So there's 
--
 
I t
hink we get a little bit better visibility than 
what many others can get as to what's actually happening, and that, I think, 
helps us on the forward outlook.

I just had a quick one on where you see the trajectory of sort of the blended 
royalty rate going in 2012 versus 2011. Maybe if you take out the impact of 
the $401 million catch

up payment. So you tablet growth, which may push it 
down. You
 
have your licensees, which are now paying, and they want the 
forward [ph] free push. So if you can give us some color on the trajectory of 
that. And then I had one more question just on outlook for mirasol, 
specifically CapEx. I know you're supposed to sp
end $1 billion this year. I 
think Japan pushed some of their CapEx into 2012. Can you give us some

3.4 and 3.5
. And in fact, we're

that should be relatively stable going into fiscal '12.

11/6/14,Qualcomm,"
excellent start in fiscal 2013 and pleased to report a record quarter driven by 
strong year over year growth in both our QCT and QTL businesses. Revenues 
were up 29% and non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share were up 30% compared to a 
year ago. In QCT, we delivered record chipset volumes which included 
eliminating the constraint on 28 nanometer devices as we had expected. In 
addition, QCT continues to drive technology and product leadership a
s we 

featuring ultra
-
high definition video playback and capture and our latest 
generation micro
-
architecture with clock speeds up to 2.3 gigahertz per 
core, the 800 processor is class leading 
and we continue to set the bar for 
the smartphone user experience.
 
Turning to QTL, our licensees reported stronger than expected total reported 
device sales as the broad based adoption of 3G and 3G/4G products 
continues driven by strength in smartphones. W
e continue to invest and 
innovate across a broad set of technologies and believe that our patent 
portfolio applicable to 3G and 4G products is the most widely licensed in the 
industry. In fact, we have now over 225 CDMA licenses and 
-
 
licensees 

 
and 
more 
than 40 royalty bearing single mode OFDMA licensees.
 
And with respect to our display business, we recently announced an 
expansion of our display arrangement with Sharp in order to accelerate the 
commercialization of our Pixtronix MEMS displays utilizing Sh

technology with the goal of driving high performance, lower
-
power displays 
from a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.
 
Our Pixtronix technology uses the MEMS
-
based shutter system to deliver 
color performance similar to OLED wit
h wide angle view ability and lower 
power consumption than LCD or OLED. As we previously indicated, we are 
increasing our focus on licensing our display technologies, including our next 
generation Mirasol display technology while at the same time directly 
commercializing certain current generation Mirasol displays.
 
Looking forward we believe our long
-
term growth drivers remain intact. 
Smartphone demand remains strong. Gartner estimates that approximately 
169 million smartphones were shipped in the third cal
endar quarter of 2012 
representing a 47% year
-
over
-
year growth. In China alone, Gartner 
estimates that approximately 47 million smartphones were shipped in the 
third calendar quarter of 2012 representing greater than 115% year
-
over
-
year growth.
 
In the U.S.
 
both AT&T and Verizon Wireless recently reported a healthy 
fourth quarter 

 
fourth calendar quarter smartphone sales with close to 20 
million units between them. And in emerging markets, Wireless Intelligence 
estimates that there are now more than 1 billi
on 3G 4G connections, 
representing 34% year
-
over
-
year growth. In China in particular Wireless 
Intelligence estimates that there were 325 million 3G connections, including 
[one act] (ph) at the end of 2012 which represents 49% year
-
over
-
year 
growth.
 
Now thi
s brings 3G penetration to 29% in China, so excellent progress and 
still plenty of opportunity ahead. China Mobile recently announced a pre
-
commercial trial for LTE TDD and Qualcomm chipsets were in 14 out of 31 
devices selected for the trial. In addition,
 
I recently attended China 

ecosystem partners and their goal to have 200 million mobile subscribers by 
the end of 2013. And there are currently over 0.5 billion CDMA 2000 
connections g
lobally according to Wireless Intelligence.
 
With the increased penetration of the data centric devices and higher usage, 
we continue to see robust growth in wireless data. In order to address this 
growing demand we remain focused on addressing what we call
 
the 1000x 

1000 times from its current level. We believe that small cells operating and 
license spectrum band and using advanced interference management 
techniques on a dynamic basis w
ill be an important component in meeting 
the challenge. There was positive progress on this initiative in December 
when the SEC proposed to convert the 3.5 GHz band into a dedicated license 
spectrum band for small cells.
 
Additionally, operators continue to
 
use the advanced network technologies, 
such as LTE to help address growing demand for data. Globally the number 
of LTE operators has now reached 145 according to the GSA representing 
greater than 200% year
-
over
-
year growth, and Wireless Intelligence 
estim
ates that global 4G LTE connections which run on multimode 3G, 4G 
devices reached approximately 60 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up 
more than 500% from the prior year.
 
Finally, we continue to see the opportunity for non
-
handset devices as 
positive
 
for our business. In early December at Dell World, Dell highlighted 
upcoming support for multimode 3G, 4G and the XTS 10, their Windows RT 
based tablet as well as across their portfolio of business tablets and 
notebooks. In addition, auto manufacturers ar
e now announcing multimode 
3G, 4G connectivity in new models and together with AT&T we announced a 
plug and play development platform based on Gobi that will enable a wide 

 


pleased to be increasing our fiscal 2013 guidance. We are continuing to 
execute against our strategic priorities and we look forward to addressing 
the growing set of opportunities ahead.
 

now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.

Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business had 
another great quarter, with record MSM shipments, revenues and operating 
profit. Revenue and operating profit were up 34% 
and 45%, respectively, 
versus a year ago.
 
We shipped 182 million MSM chipsets above our prior expectations, 
reflecting strong demand across our portfolio, including China

account shipments, which more than doubled year
-
over

year, and 
multimode 3
G/LTE shipments up more than 90% sequentially.
 
We were pleased to see our chipsets driving many of the flagships 
smartphone models announced this holiday season, including the Google 
Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G, the Nokia Lumia models and Samsung Galaxy S 
II
I and [Xperia S] [ph], the HTC Droid DNA 8X and 8S, the Motorola RAZR M 
and the Sony Xperia T and TL.
 
With our leading technologies broad product roadmap and relationships with 
all the top OEMs in the industry, our design pipeline continues to grow. 
There 
have been more than 600 Snapdragon
-
based devices announced and 
another 170 plus devices announced based on our Qualcomm Reference 
Design solutions.
 
Looking ahead, there are more than 450 Snapdragon
-
based designs in 
development and over 100 plus designs bas
ed on our QRD solutions. As you 
know, our strategy is to set the technology design point for our industry and 
we have succeeded again with our recently announced Snapdragon 600 and 
800 chipsets.
 
Our new Snapdragon 600 processor builds on the momentum of ou
r highly 
successful S4 Pro processor. The 600 includes our new Quad Core Krait 300 
CPU running up to 1.9 GHz and our Adreno 320 GPU.
 
Our new Snapdragon 800 processor includes our new Quad Core Krait 400 
CPU running at up to 2.3 GHz, our new Adreno 330 GPU 
with two times the 
compute performance of our Adreno 320. The third generation of our leading 
LTE modem which adds LTE Advanced and Carrier Aggregation support, as 
well as integrated 802.11ac Wi
-
Fi.
 
In addition, the Snapdragon 800 is the first chip in the 
industry to use 
TSMC's 28
-
nanometer HPM Advanced process technology. We expect 
Snapdragon 600 and 800 chipsets to deliver up to 40% and 75% better 
performance, respectively, than our previous industry
-
leading Snapdragon 
S4 Pro.
 
There are already more than 
90 designs in development using the 60 
--
 
600 
and 800 processors, and we expect commercial devices based on the 600 in 
the second calendar quarter of this year and based on the 800 in the middle 
of this year.
 
We are also continuing to invest and grow our b
usiness in emerging regions, 
and with our differentiated technologies and products we believe we are 
well
-
positioned versus the competition in this segment as subscribers 
migrate from 2G to 3G and multimode 3G/LTE.
 
Last week in China, we held our bi
-
annual
 
QRD event with participation by 
145 OEMs and ODMs. We had multiple emerging accounts including Yulong 
and Tianyu announced handsets based on the Snapdragon 8x25Q, making it 
the first quad
-
core chip for high
-
volume 3G smartphones. There are now 
over 60 8x2
5Q designs in the pipeline from over 25 OEMs.
 
Separately, we have also announced the Reference Design for our 8x30 
chipset which contains Dual Krait CPUs integrated LTE, TDD and TD
-
SCDMA, 
and support for all operators in China.
 
Also of note, the first TD
-
S
CDMA device based on the Snapdragon processor 
was launched by Nokia in the December quarter on time.
 
Our mobile connectivity design traction continues to grow with 400 plus 
devices based on our 28

nanometer S4 and Snapdragon 600/800 products. 
We also annou
nced our first NFC chipset with a new tri

band 802.11ac/ad 
Reference Design and our StreamBoost Technology to intelligently optimize 
home network performance.
 
We're off to a great start in fiscal 2013 with exciting growth opportunities 
ahead, including con
tinued global smartphone and multimode 3G/LTE 
demand. We continue to manage our business for long

term revenue and 
operating profit growth and we continue to see the year unfolding broadly in 
line with our initial expectations.
 
That concludes my 
remarks and I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.
 
Bill Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We had record quarterly 
results and we are pleased to be raising our estimates for fiscal 2013 
revenue and earnings per share. Our record 
first quarter revenues of $6 
billion were up 29% year
-
over
-
year and at the high
-
end of our prior 
guidance.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating income was a record $2.45 billion, up 31% year
-
over
-
year. Non
-
GAAP earnings per share were a record $1.26 per share, up 30% 
year
-
o
ver
-
year and $0.14 above the midpoint of our prior guidance.
 
QTL contributed $0.06 of gross margin improvement driven primarily by 
greater than expected 3G, 4G device shipments. QCT contributed $0.05 of 
gross margin improvement on the strength of higher MS
M shipments and 
favorable product cost. More operating expenses contributed $0.02 and 
higher returns on our cash and marketable securities contributed $0.01.
 

quarter were a record $
53.3 billion above the high
-
end of our prior guidance, 
greater than expected device shipments in both developed and emerging 
regions, particularly China. We estimate that total reported device sales 
were comprised between 233 to 237 million 3G, 4G device s
hipments at an 
average selling price of $224 to $230 per unit.
 

during the quarter, exceeding the high
-
end of our prior guidance and QCT's 
operating margin was 26%.
 
As I mentioned at o
ur Analyst Day in November, we are seeing more 
efficiency in the 3G, 4G inventory channel as the industry continued to move 
toward an open retail channel versus a carrier centric channel, consistent 
with that trend our MSM delivery interval has been shorte
ning, which 
introduces additional volatility in the timing of shipments and therefore 
impacts our ability to accurately forecast quarterly MSM shipment timing.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D/SG&A expenses were lower sequentially, which 
was a bit better than our pri
or expectations. Operating cash flow was a 
healthy $2 billion, up 11% year
-
over
-
year and 33% of revenues.
 
During the first quarter we return $678 million to stockholders, including 
cash dividends of $428 million and $250 million to repurchase 4.3 million 
s
hares. We are increasing our estimate for calendar 2012 3G, 4G device 
shipments to between 915 million to 940 million units, up approximately 
17% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. The increase to our calendar 2012 
estimate is driven by global demand for 3G 4
G devices, particularly in 
emerging regions, including China and Latin America.
 
Turning to our guidance, given continued global macroeconomic 
uncertainties, we are continuing to maintain a cautious outlook for the year 
ahead. We are reaffirming our estimat
e for calendar 2013 3G, 4G device 
shipments of between 1 billion and 1.07 billion units, up approximately 8% 
to 15% year
-
over
-
year. We are raising fiscal 2013 revenue guidance by 
approximately $4 million. And we now expect fiscal 2013 revenues to be 
$23.4 
billion to $24.4 billion, up approximately 25% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint. We are raising our non
-
GAAP earnings per share guidance by 
$0.13. We now anticipate non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $4.25 to $4.45, 
up approximately 17% year over year at the mid
point.
 

we now expect GAAP earnings per share of $3.61 to $3.81, up 
approximately 6% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We are reiterating our 
prior fiscal 2013 guidance estimates for QT
L ASP, QCT and QTL operating 
margin percentages as well as non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense 
growth. We estimate our non
-
GAAP annual tax rate to be approximately 
17% to 18% for fiscal 2013 below our prior estimate reflecting the 
retroactive extension 
of the federal R&D tax credits among other factors. 
The R&D tax credit benefit related to fiscal 2012 will be recorded in our fiscal 
second
-
quarter and consistent with our prior guidance will be excluded from 
non
-
GAAP results.
 
Now turning to the second fis
cal quarter, we estimate revenues of $5.8 
billion to $6.3 billion, up approximately 22% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. 
And we estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.18, up 
approximately 13% year over year at the midpoint. We expect second fis
cal 
quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.06 per share. We expect 
total reported device sales by our licensees to be $57.5 billion to $62.5 
billion, up approximately 16% year
-
over
-
year and up approximately 13% 
sequentially at the midpoint, reflect
ing again strong 3G 4G based device 
shipments in the busy December holiday quarter.
 
We anticipate QCT shipments of 163 million to 173 million MSM chips during 
the March quarter, down sequentially, which is typical coming off the busy 
holiday quarter but up
 
approximately 11% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. 

with our prior expectations remaining within the 11 to 16 week range as we 
discussed at our analyst day.
 
We anticipate second
-
quar
ter non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses f 
combined will increase approximately 10% to 12% sequentially, reflecting 
increased seasonal expenses typical for this time of year, notably employer 
payroll taxes and increased marketing expenses. We estimate our fiscal
 
second
-
quarter non
-
GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16%, lower than 
what we expect for the full year, because it will take count of two quarters of 
the retroactive R&D tax credits approved by Washington.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the ca
ll back to Paul Jacobs.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Thanks Bill. So before we go on to Q&A, I want to let you all know that Bill 
has decided to retire from Qualcomm effective March 11. Bill has been a 
great partner to me and an outstanding leader in this role as CFO for 
Q
ualcomm over the past 11 years. His financial readerships played a critical 
role in establishing Qualcomm as a company known not only for leading
-
edge technology but also for super fiscal performance and rigorous financial 
discipline. And over the years he
lped run QUALCOMM as finance and investor 
relations organization and himself many distinguished award for excellence 
in financial reporting.
 

growth and success particularly through s
ome very challenging economic 
environments. On behalf of the entire executive committee and all our 
employees worldwide, we really like to thank Bill for his strong financial 
leadership, partnership and incredible dedication to Qualcomm.
 
So we wish you all
 

Qualcomm to ensure a smooth transition and will continue throughout the 
year to serve in the advisory role for the company. So thanks again Bill.
 
I am also very pleased to announce that after a careful
 
consideration George 

president and chief financial officer. George currently serves as CFO for 
Applied Materials and will join Qualcomm on March 11. George is a seasoned 
financial exe
cutive and has been the CFO for Applied Materials since 2006. 

closely with them. His financial expertise and leadership will be instrumental 
as we continue to expand our business and s
trive to deliver strong financial 
results.
 
So I like to thank Bill again for his many years of leadership and 
commitment to Qualcomm, and I look forward to introducing all of you to 

ck 
over to Warren Kneeshaw. Thanks Bill.

you and my questions are really for Steve, just on the competitive dynamics. 

end, a lot of talk about quad
-
core competition, and then on the high end, on 
the LTE side, are you seeing any increased competition this year?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Hi Mike, this is Steve. I think there is kind of two dynamics, on the high end, 


ourselves in a pretty good position both on the modem side as well as on the 

of those things I think are benefits that we bring to the table as w

come out with a number of products on the low end. The first one is the 
8X25Q which I think has been received quite well. We also announced that 

of what will become many
 
new low end optimized chipsets, which is the 
8X26. There will be multiple chipsets like that coming out over the years. So 


y biased positively 
now on share. We just feel 

 
we feel the roadmap and the some of the 
investments are starting to pay off.

share, particularly in China, can you talk about how you see that playing out 

d 3G 
share in that market and then overall share in that market?
 
And then another question on yield efficiencies with the foundries and so our 
check indicate TSMC did 95% yield efficiency on 28 nanometer now. How do 
you see that playing out for you with re
gard to your margins for this year? 
Do you see 28 nanometers being perhaps more cost effective than 45 
nanometer this year and what about as you bring other foundries on like 
GlobalFoundries, do you see that giving you some leverage on your margins 
and the
 
QCT side of the business? Thanks.

low 
--
 

that particularly with regard to China, what you see there your market share 
on the low end and then overall in that market thanks?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 


seeing in terms of a dynamic is that there is a conversion of 2G to 3G. At the 

picking up new customers and new geographies because those transitio
ns 
are essentially giving us access to what would be traditionally just 2G 
volume.
 


there has been a push 

where technology will be turning over in the large carriers in the world, in 

3G, 4G technology that we have.
 

probably a reasonable set up for us. The technology 
change has actually always been good for us on the chipset business. Your 

--
 
we've 
actually been quite pleased actually as to how 28 nano
meters ramped in 
terms of yield.
 
I think Bill also mentioned on 
--
 
in his remarks how we had some positive 

starting to bring on multiple fabs with more gusto now. You will see how
ever 
at the end of the year, you will see us transition the portfolio into HPM.
 

different than what Bill would have talked about in terms of the margin 
profile but pretty much according
 
to plan, I think at this point.

Thank you. Congratulations, Bill, on the retirement, well deserved. You will 
be missed. Got a two parter for you on th
e royalty side. First, on the 
calculated rate, I know it does move around but by my numbers it went 
down about 10 basis points sequential. So just curious if there's anything 
abnormal in there other than just mix?
 
And then secondly, I just want to bring yo
u back to something you had 
mentioned at the analyst day where there was the potential for 25% unit 

midpoint of the guidance is a good amount below that. Could you address 
why, 
is that just because the September quarter was maybe more than 
seasonal or was there some other reason why we're looking like mid high 
teens sequential in the fourth quarter when we normally see more? Thank 
you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hey, Tim. This is Derek. Let me
 
take your first question on the rate. I think 



ly the biggest driver is 
the fact that we had record TRDS and in fact that came in higher than we 
expected.
 
And so that given the fixed licensing fees that roll through and the 
infrastructure royalties that grow at a slower pace is going to have, kind of, 

had some other fluctuations including lower audit recoveries and mix in 

 
Bill Keitel
 
Tim, this is Bill. On the 
--
 
take us back to the analyst day and looking for 
upwards of 25% unit growth from the September to December quarter, the 
difference we see now, our midpoint estimate is about 17% growth, third 
quarter, fourth quarter and a bit lo
wer than we were previously expecting. 
But it's the result of a very strong September that came through in our 
licensee reports.

Yeah. Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on retirement, 
Bill. So just 
--
 
first of all, I wanted to revisit 28 nanometre situation. I think 
the numbers suggest that you guys cleared some backlog in fiscal Q1 to 
December maybe 
a good chunk of it. And I just wondered if you could 
comment on, maybe, Steve, you could comment on the backlog status as we 
head into fiscal Q2. Is most of that now cleared or is some of your guidance 
including some backlog clearance, so that would be hel
pful if you could help 
us understand that.
 
And then, Bill, I guess this is my last chance to ask this one but could you 
comment on your underlying GDP growth expectations in your forecast now 
or is it changed since you guys reported last quarter. And Steve
, if you could 



towards the end
 
of the year when those devices would ship into the market. 
Thanks.

Morgan Stanley
 
I appreciate it. Bill, definitely will be missed. Thanks for all the help and time 
over the years. Have fun 
in retirement. Couple of questions, question one 
when I look at your guidance for the TRDS and back it out of your full 
guidance 
--
 

company and then sort of back into a QCT guidance and then look 
at your 
unit shipment guidance for next quarter, you could sort of back into what 


make sure that the 

in chips to go up at least one more quarter, and if so, if you can give some 
color on the variability behind that and what happens going forward.
 
And then Bill, on margins for QCT, at the analyst da
y again I think you had 
guided to somewhere around 18.5% to 20.5% for the full fiscal year, for 
now at 26% for Q1, last year we saw something similar, we saw about 23, 
and we kind of came down through the year but we have that funny thing 
with 28 nanometer
 
that made the operating margin at the end of the fiscal 
year a naturally low. Do you still think you will end up, I mean you made the 

pulling some 13%, 14%, 15% operating margins to get 
us back into that 
range and we start off the year so strong at 26%. I guess I am saying is do 
you still really believe that and if so, why would it get that low at the end of 
the year?
 
Bill Keitel
 
This is Bill. I will take both of those questions. On the M
SM ASP, the 
expectation there we had expected to increase a bit sequentially in the first 
fiscal quarter and we successfully did that. And yes, you're right. We do 
expect another increase sequentially in the second fiscal quarter, somewhat 

re expecting for the full fiscal year for QCT.
 
On the QCT op margins, we are holding to that guidance range that you 
gave. For the second quarter 
--
 


e guidance we gave 
in a plus minus 17% kind of range. So 
--
 
and the decrease there are drivers. 
Number one is the volume, we do expect a decrease in MSM volume in the 
second fiscal quarter. Number two, QCT carries the bulk of the operating 
expense in QUALC
OMM and at this time of year where we start employee 
payroll taxes and market expenses typically tick up in the December and 
January 
--
 

the time of year where we typically do our price res
ets in the QCT business 
and then lastly, the QCT team has a fairly high degree of activity of new 
product work ongoing. And so we expect that to drive up the product costs 
starting with this quarter.

Can you give us a percenta
ge like you do sometimes as to what percent of 
R&Ds kind of go into future looking type of revenue or is that something 

 
Bill Keitel
 

approximately 30% of our 
current R&D going towards projects that we don't 
expect to deliver revenue in fiscal 2013 

 
excuse me 27%, it was 30% to 
year prior, came down to 27% is our current expectation.

Just a couple of questions. One is more on the short term chipset guidance. I 
understand that you are expecting some normal seasonality there. But it 
seems that the decline that you are expecting is perhaps not as conservative 
as I might have
 

got one of your big customers Apple whose implied decline in the March 
quarter is about the same magnitude as the total number that you are 
guiding to. And so I am just wondering if you are accoun
ting for the normal 
seasonality kind of outside of that one customer especially given that there 
may have been some excess inventory in China and also given Q4 or 
calendar Q4 was larger than normal for you because of the shortage 
alleviation, on the other 

in the March quarter, and then I have a longer term question as well.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Okay Simona, on the Q2 chipset guidance 
--
 
fiscal Q2 guidance, we did 
factor in seasonality. The last few years we often
 
see a dip going into the 
March quarter but relative to 5, 6, 7 years ago as not much as we used to 
use back then. So we have taken account of that. We also think that the 

on that 
estimate and therefore may be a bit less dip than what you 
otherwise would see. If you're call from the analyst day, many of our 
customers are relying on us much more for their inventory needs and you'll 
see that when you look at our 

 
get through our fina
ncials our inventories 
grew pretty nicely in the December quarter in line with what we wanted 
them to go.
 

order interval has decreased and so there is more volatility in that MSM 
numb
er. And you had a second question?
 
Simona Jankowski 
-
 
Goldman Sachs
 
Yes, just the second question was an update on the tablet market. Do you 
have a sense for what percent of the tablets are shipping with 3G and 4G 
attached in them right now as opposed to W

seeing where do you think that might be a year from now?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Simona, this is Derek. I think the percentage of total unit sets that have 

bounced around a little bit and maybe come down in the last couple of 
quarters some. But as we explained at the analyst conference, I think Paul 

to change course going forward now
 
that we see a more flexibility on the 
operator side with data plans and hopefully more competition in the tablet 
device base with Windows RT and some of the new Android tablets coming 
in.

Question on the annual guidance, are you taking annual EPS off pretty much 
by less than you just beat, and you have a lower tax rate going forward and 
the OpEx has basically unchanged. I am just wondering why that annual EPS 


sort of lift at all into the back half of the year. If you can, one more question 

customers relying on the need to take mor
e but at the same time you built 
quite a bit of inventory in the quarter, where 
--
 
in front of a quarter where 

actually going on with your own internal inventories, that would be
 
very 
helpful.
 
Bill Keitel
 
Sure Stacy, first on the EPS guidance, correct, relative to our midpoint for 
Q1 we came in $0.14 higher and relative to the full year, relative to the 

we 
are seeing is that although we saw a little nice improvement here in the 


this point for the full fiscal year.
 
I
n terms of the tax item that you mentioned, yes there was a positive on 
--
 
because of the R&D tax credit extension. But if you recall though, what we 
have here on the outlook is better for QTL, pretty close what we previously 
had for QCT. And that imbalanc
e raises our tax rate.
 
And so that was able to 
--
 
with the R&D tax credit extension, we were able 


relati

that are offsetting the benefit, R&D tax credit extension. But from an

A
nd in inventories?
 
Paul Jacobs
 
And on the inventory, yeah, we have increased our inventory. Remember 
now, we are increasing 
--
 

lot of demand for which of course, that aligns with our guidance that we do 
think
 
average revenue per MSM is going to be increasing here into the 
second quarter, in fact into the full fiscal year.
 
So, yeah, our inventory is growing. We have been relatively short on 
inventory given the 28 nanometer production shortfalls relative to dema
nd. 

going to be better positioned now to handle the fluctuations that we typically 
see in customer order demand.

Bill, congrats on a job well done. So, I'll get one last question here for you. 
The largest change in the regional 
forecasts was the uptick in China. Can 
you kind of give us some color on whether TD
-
SCDMA and an uptick there 
really affected your view and the forecast?
 
And this one is maybe for Derek. As TD
-
SCDMA moves up the value chain 
here later this year when we sta
rt to see more of high
-
end offering in c, will 
that have a positive impact on the royalty rate assuming a greater portion of 
the Chinese market has multimode phones and maybe even some export? 
Thanks.
 
Bill Keitel
 
Matt, this is Bill. On the first one on Chi
na, I think it was a pretty broad
-
based. Yeah, we did, we are updating our estimate a bit, improving our 
estimate for TD
-
SCDMA. But the strength across all the three operators is 
quite strong. CDMA2000 is going very strong. Take it back to the remarks 
that
 
Paul gave earlier.
 
And then China Unicom with WCDMA, so I think it's pretty widespread. China 
is going quite strong for 3G, 4G devices and we've seen that trend, and our 
updated estimates here are just improving that trend a bit. Much is the 
same for Lati

attention to. We've seen a lot of strength there and just our most recent 

previously been expecting.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yeah. This 
is Derek. On the TD
-
SCDMA situation in China, we have been 
continuing to collect some amount of royalties TD
-
SCDMA, although as we've 
said, we struggled a bit with some of the local Chinese companies. But I 
agree, we do see an opportunity as the volume hop
efully migrates at the 
high end to multimode with UMTS or even CDMA. And then with the trials 
launching, the inclusion of LTE, that should open up an opportunity for us to 

specifically a
 
rate issue, but certainly an opportunity to grow the revenue 
base.

Tal Liani from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.

Yeah. I have two questions. The 

assumptions about MSM seasonality into our semiconductor seasonality into 
the second half of the year, because you're assuming and I know we spoke 
about it. But you're assuming that EPS is going to be down in s
econd half, 
20%. This is the first half and in last year it was a much worse year. It was 
only down 15%. The previous year was down 13%.
 
So you are assuming that this year is going to be much worse. Seasonality 
wise, much worse second half versus first hal
f. And I'm wondering about the 
MSM assumptions, what drives this number up so low and I know you spoke 
a little bit about. You gave a very detailed answer. So, I want to focus my 
question just about at MSM assumptions for the rest of the year. Thanks.

it. On MSM seasonality, we do expect, obviously we've given your estimates 
our guidance for fiscal Q2. And if you just take the midpoint of that, we are 
expecting a dec
rease. Midpoints about $169 million MSMs compared to $182 
million, we just reported having shipped in Q1.
 
And going into Q3, at this point we are modeling kind of a flattish number 
and an increase going into the fourth fiscal quarter. On the cost, how that
 
correlates this year to our earnings per share as compared to prior years. 
Recall that in the last couple years, QTL earnings strength has been very 
strong at least in proportion to the QCT earnings strength whereas this year, 
although we are looking for 
both business segments to grow at a double
-
digit rate, we are looking for QCT growth to be substantially greater than the 
earnings growth coming from QTL.

your question.

Thanks. And congratulations to Bill, again, on the job well done. On QCT, I 
understand some of the drivers with respect to the margin declined. I guess 
the question I have for Bill and Steve is the level of m
arket share that you 
guys have in LTE, the mix shift that you are seeing on the ASP side is going 
to probably continue, should be positive drivers throughout the year as well. 
So, just the magnitude of the QCT margin pressure seems surprising to me.
 
A reas
on why just the margins are top three higher levels, maybe they do 
drop suddenly 17% or 18% in the coming quarters seems quite extreme. 

are you taking something aggressive on t
he pricing side mean on mean 
whether we think.
 
And then a question for Derek, specifically, on licensing. There is a building 

200 million, maybe 250 million 3G enabled smartphones fro
m the Asian 

and you guys should be able to license those phones.
 
How much of that market have you actually assumed? You can license in this 


license, or if there is a significant amount that are embedded into your 
estimates and how. Any sense around that would be helpful?
 
Bill Keitel
 

s 
for the decrease that is built into our estimates. I'm not going to 

 
we will 
stay away from assigning a value to any one of those four. I will have to 

business. It is a large decrea
se in the operating margin, but it is as we've 

what our three to five
-
year goals are for the QCT business nor our ability 
--
 
our sense of our ability to achieve those goals. So ther
e are a lot of factors 
obviously, but I would just 

 
the pricing that we give is very thoughtful, very 

be looking a few years out.
 
Derek Aberle
 
This is Derek and go ahead and 

really a different base of customers that are buying from Media Tech or 
others. We have now as we talked about I think more than 70 companies 
licensed in China and pretty much all the major suppliers in Taiwan have
 
been licensed for quite some time. And those agreements require them to 


trying to capture the entirety
 
and I feel very confident that maybe with the 
exception of some of the TD
-
CDMA volume that I spoke about a few minutes 

-
positioned to capture the sales of all 3G and 4G 
devices that are going to be supplied irrespective of the chipse

there.

A couple of questions, first touching on the revisions or the lack thereof for 

assu
mption but yet we saw a pretty substantial revisions up for 2012. So 
just wondering if there was anything that made you feel more cautious 
about how that GDP could impact us especially since we are looking at a 
higher base for 2012. And then Derek, I wante
d to follow
-

questions I guess related to licensing, in particular on TD
-
SCDMA could you 
give us an estimate as to what you think your current coverage or collection 
portion is on the TD
-
SCDMA handsets that are being shipped?
 
Bill Keitel
 
James on the first one, we did see a very 

 

to calendar 2012 3G 4G units, and I would just generally say it's fairly 
widespread by geography, but it's largely two main drivers. One is the 
upgrade rate, apparently subscribers
 
upgrading to smartphones or 
upgrading their existing smartphone is one of the major drivers. And then 
secondly, we think we continue to see good progress on migration of 2G to 

pos
itive factors into 2013. It was simply a matter of rolling three months 
into the new fiscal year and we concluded that we have a positive bias in 
that 3G 4G unit forecasts for 2013 but we thought it was just a bit early in 
the year to be raising our estima
tes there. We thought let's wait another 
three months to see where we are at that time.
 

we all have to be cautious given the macro
-

all seeing here. S
o I would just say positive bias but not enough at this point 
to cause us to raise those estimates.
 
Derek Aberle
 
James, this is Derek. Let me take your second question. The information on 
the TD
-
SCDMA volume in China is a bit difficult to get your arms aro
und 


 

percentage today. I will say that as time has gone on and there has been 
shifts in the supplier base, the percentage of total unit is as best that we can 

alties has come down over time. But then as you 
go forward as I said, there are some trends that are going to shift things we 
think back in the other direction, higher percentages of these devices that 
are going to be multimode with either LTE or UMPS. So 

to pin it down.
 
The other thing just to make sure it's clear, when we give our estimates for 
unit shipments for the year, what we include is the percentage of total TD
-
SCDMA that we expect to get reported to us and royalties to paid 
on.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Barclays.

My question, Derek, is for you and I am wondering if you can talk through a 
little bit big picture about where you feel that we are in the migr
ation from 
2G to royalty bearing fill in (ph) and how far along the penetration wave are 
we, now quickly do you think we might move up that penetration over the 
course of the next few years? And I think the idea is we have seen some 
exceptionally impressiv
e growth out of QTL over the course of the last few 
years, as Bill suggested himself that mix seems to be shifting the other way 
at least this year, should that continue, how should we think about the 
growth trajectory in that business?
 
Derek Aberle
 
I thin



QCT is really accelerating. So yo
u got to think about it couple different ways. 
One is if you look at the unit shipments there is still a pretty decent amount 
of 2G volume out there that will be shifted over to 3G. When you think about 
it from a TRDF perspective, meaning the unit times th
e ASP, actually the 
volume out there on 2G looks a bit smaller. But I think the opportunity 


--
 
initially we ha
ve feature phone although those are rapidly going away, or 
more likely a low end smartphones.
 

growth in the business over the five
-

quite a long runw
ay. I think China still has what about 26% penetration as 

America, Eastern Europe, some very large markets that still have quite a 
ways to go through the transition and I think as they go 
that they will go 
through I think at a higher ASP than some of the early transitions for 3G in 
the past.

At the end of the cycle here. But, hey, Bill, your onshore cash grew nicely 
sequential, I believe, I think, what by the $4 billion or so, am I right? And 
maybe you could tell me a little 
--
 
tell us a little bit about, how that 
happened an
d if you feel like, the onshore, offshore cash challenges have 
subsided a bit here? Thanks.
 
Bill Keitel
 
Sure, Mark. Yeah. Total cash grew nicely and more so on the offshore, but 
offshore 
--
 
onshore did increase as well. I think we are clearly in a position
 
where, we are hoping our 10B5
-
1 program that we have in place will trigger 

position on the onshore.
 

ver

prudent thing to do that eventually will deploy that cash. But at least, 

for the shareholder.
 
On the 


let say sufficient cooperation in Washington that is giving me more optimism 
on an effective corporate tax r

clearly the agenda here in the near

with debt ceiling, sequester, gun control and immigration.

I remain hopeful. I think it can be a good driver to further 
impro

end and the value 
segment in smartphone which are continue to grow globally, really excited 
about the new products, the new Snapdragons are gaining lot of traction and 

ocessors, new graphics, all sort 
of things that are getting integrated into those devices, really driving our 
lead and using our skill to advantage in terms of be able to invest R&D and 
invest early and drive that. And obviously the licensing business cont
inues to 
grow strongly.
 
So, tons of opportunities ahead of us, both in the traditional businesses and 
in the non

positioned to seize the opportunities we see for the future.

7/24/14,Qualcomm,"Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to 
report record revenues, earnings per share and MSM chipset shipments in 
this quarter, driven by increased demand for smartphone and data
-
centric 
devices across an expanding number of 
regions and price points.
 
It's been a successful quarter and there really is a lot to be excited about. 
First and foremost is the continued unabated demand for wireless data. 
Gartner expects sales of smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2010 to grow 
15% se
quentially and over 70% year
-
over
-
year. Gartner forecast annual 
smartphone shipments to grow more than 50% year
-
over
-
year in 2011 to 
reach approximately 440 million units. And of course speaking of 
smartphones, we're happy to see the Verizon iPhone announc
ement because 
it's been a subject of intense speculation, but I have to say we have no other 
comments to make on that topic.
 
In addition to smartphones, we're now seeing increasing volumes of new 
3G
-
enabled device types such as tablets and e
-
readers. Our S
napdragon 
family of chipsets, including our dual core products, are well
-
positioned to 
target the range of devices that we expect to be launched this year.
 
To help support the traffic and provide higher data rates to consumers, 
operators are continuing to 
invest in the latest technologies and are 
purchasing additional spectrum. Adoption of advanced wireless technologies 
will continue to be a catalyst for network and device upgrades in the coming 
year. Verizon launched LTE in 38 cities and started offering d
ata modems 
based on QUALCOMM'S multimode solution. AT&T continues to promote its 
HSPA+ service, has announced they will be pulling in their launch plans for 
LTE. And furthermore, we've also demonstrated LTE TDD in India.
 
The evolution of 3G also continues 
to be a bright point for our business with 
the GSA announcing that there are currently 103 commercial HSPA+ 
networks, 13 of these offering 42 megabit per second data rates with Dual
-
Carrier HSPA+. According to CDG, three operators have launched DO Rev. B 
n
etworks while an additional four operators have announced plans to deploy 
the technology.
 
And our leading position in these technologies and multimode chipsets allows 
us to address the complexities these heterogenous networks create, 
positioning us very we
ll for the future.
 
As a further example of how our opportunities are expanding, Microsoft 
announced that the next version of Windows will support Systems on a Chip 
architectures, including ARM
-
based systems for QUALCOMM. We have a 
strong working relationsh
ip with Microsoft. And at CES, they demonstrated 
the next version of Windows running on our Snapdragon platform.
 
We've also announced that we've entered into an agreement to buy Aeros. 
You heard us talk about a vision around the convergence of mobility, 
co
mputing, consumer electronics. As we commented on our recent call, this 
announcement should be viewed as a statement about our commitment to 
provide a complete set of solutions to address this trend. This acquisition will 
allow us to build upon our capabil
ities, add to our suite of best
-
in
-
class 
technology assets, provide new sales channels. We're looking forward to the 
transaction closing and joining with a proven leader.
 
In addition, we announced the agreement to sell substantially all of our 700 
megahert
z Spectrum to AT&T and wind down the FLO TV network. This is a 
win
-
win outcome and we're excited that AT&T intends to use carrier 
aggregation technology to provide supplemental downlink capacity to its 
customers. Our plans include supporting these capabili
ties in our chipsets to 
support AT&T and other operators around the world, looking to take 
advantage of additional unpaired spectrum to support their wireless data 
plans. Overall, the 2G, the 3G migration remain healthy and vibrant as 
increased competition
 
and wider variety of more affordable 3G devices are 
driving the shift to wireless data globally.
 
According to Wireless Intelligence, 3G connections are expected to grow 
more than 25% in 2011 to 1.6 billion. A big part of this growth will come 
from emergin
g regions that have been primarily driven by 2G in the past.
 
Both China Telecom and China Unicom aggressively drove the uptake of 3G 
smartphones in the second half of calendar 2010 through the direct 
purchase and subsidy of these devices. As a result of th
ese and other 
efforts, most operators are reporting significant growth in EV
-
DO and UMTS 
subscribed in the past two quarters. China Telecom reported approximately 
a 68% increase in EV
-
DO subscribers, while China Unicom reported an 
approximately 85% increas
e in WCDMA subscribers for the second half of 
2010. And we see the same trend continuing through 2011 as bold operators 
continue to drive the uptake of mass
-
market smartphones.
 
And in India, Reliance and Tata DOCOMO and now more recently, Airtel, 
have all 
launched 3G services and we expect remaining operators to launch 
services in the coming months.
 
And finally, on the licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have 
resolved one of the disputes that we had previously disclosed.
 
So to wrap up, we ju
st completed the best quarter in the history of 
QUALCOMM, driven by strong demand and excellent execution. Our broad 
licensing program and industry
-
leading chipset roadmap platform condition 
us well to take advantage of the many wireless opportunities ahea
d of us. 
And looking forward, I am pleased to be substantially raising our full year 
forecast for revenue and earnings driven by the many positive trends of the 
industry's shift to 3G and the broad adoption of wireless data for mobile 
phones and new data
-
c
entric devices.
 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Derek Aberle.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As we expected when we 
presented in New York in November, we see favorable trends in the industry 
continuing to develop that will drive further growth in our Licensing 
business. In particular, we are seeing strength in ASPs in both developed 
and emerging regions. September quarter activity also ended up being a bit 
stronger than anticipated, driven by 
smartphone shipment strength in the 
developed regions in particular. This drove record total reported device sales 
and a strong sequential growth in average selling prices. I am also pleased 
to report that we have now resolved one of the two licensee dispu
tes that 
we have been working to bring to a close. This is not Panasonic. It is the 
licensee that has been underpaying its royalties to us.
 
We are pleased that we are able to resolve this dispute in a manner that is 
consistent with the established value of
 
our patent portfolio and without the 
need for litigation or arbitration. The result of this resolution will start to be 
reflected in our fiscal second quarter results including a one
-
time catch
-
up 
for past periods.
 
As I discussed in New York in November, 
due to a variety of factors including 
the fact that certain QTL revenue components such as fixed licensing fees 
and infrastructure royalties are growing at a slower pace than subscriber 
royalties, the increasing diversity of incremental product types with 
non
-
traditional royalty structures contributing to our Licensing revenues, as well 
as the impact of intermittent licensee disputes, the implied royalty rate that 
you calculate based on the information we provide has become a less 
reliable metric for measur
ing the performance of the QTL business.
 
Having said that, the resolution of this licensee dispute increases our 
estimate for what we expect your calculation of the implied royalty rate to 
be for fiscal 2011.
 
We had previously said that we expected your ca
lculation as the implied 
royalty rate based on the midpoint of our prior guidance for fiscal year 2011 
to be approximately 3.3%, excluding amounts for prior periods. While we 
have not yet finalized the accounting for the license agreement that we 
recently 
signed to resolve this dispute, we now expect the implied royalty 
rate you will calculate for fiscal year 2011 to be approximately 3.5%, 
including a one
-
time benefit in the second quarter for periods prior to fiscal 
2011, as well as the first quarter of fi
scal 2011. And that we will exit the 
fiscal year with an implied royalty rate, as you calculated, of approximately 
3.4% to 3.5%.
 
It is important to note that this updated outlook excludes any potential 
upside that may result from the arbitration with Panas
onic. As we mentioned 
during our last call, we are very pleased with the outcome of the first phase 
of that process as the arbitrator issued an interim order, finding that 
QUALCOMM did not breach its license agreement with Panasonic. This 
supports our beli
ef that Panasonic's claims are without merit.
 
In closing, I'm very pleased with the successful resolution we have 
announced today and continue to feel QTL is well
-
positioned for strong 
growth ahead in a very exciting global wireless industry.
 
Thank you, an
d I'll turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business 
delivered another strong quarter. We shipped a record 118 million MSMs and 
delivered both record revenues and record operating
 
profits. We are seeing 
stronger demand for our integrated chipsets compared to our prior forecast 
and are pleased to be raising our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2011.
 
Smartphone
-
driven demand for our solutions, particularly in North America, 
was ve
ry strong again this quarter and contributed to a favorable product 
mix.
 
Our leading roadmap, technology and integration capabilities are aligning 
well with industry trends. Shipments of our 7k and 8k integrated chipsets 
were up more than 40% sequentially 
and more than 150% year
-
over
-
year. 
Our leadership in LTE continues as we began volume shipments of our 
multimode 3G LTE chipsets last quarter. There is a strong design activity in 
the pipeline with over 25 manufacturers developing more than 50 LTE 
devices,
 
including data modems, LTE hotspots, smartphones and tablets.
 
Our support for multiple operating systems across multiple product tiers 
continues to position us well within the growing smartphone segment. We 
saw over 30 new devices announced by our partners including several 
industry firsts. The sharp Galapagos, which
 
is the first 3D mobile phone with 
3D display and 3D capture; the first HSPA+ phones including the T
-
Mobile 
myTouch 4G; and the HTC Thunderbolt, which is the first 4G LTE phone for 
Verizon Wireless. Windows Phone 7 devices began shipping this past 
quarter,
 
all powered by Snapdragon with handsets from HTC, LG, Dell and 
Samsung.
 
We are also pleased to see Microsoft demonstrate a future version of 
Windows running on our Snapdragon platform at CES. We believe our 
architectural advantages deliver high
-
performanc
e computing and graphics 
at low power and will enable new, innovative device types in the computing 
ecosystem just as they have in the mobile ecosystem. This will open up 
significant new opportunities for our chipsets.
 
We continue to demonstrate our abilit
y to execute at scale this quarter, 
which is required to succeed in such a large and expanding industry. We 
currently have more than 150 Snapdragon devices in development, including 
more than 20 tablets.
 
Our new dual
-
core MSM 8660 chipset is already being 
designed into over 60 
devices by our partners. The performance and efficiency of this chipset make 
it well
-
suited to both tables and phones. It delivers console
-
quality graphics 
for rich, on
-
device gaming and high
-
definition video. The chipset also has 
int
egrated support for HDMI output, which means you can plug your phone 
or tablet into a TV to share photos, play games, or even watch high
-
definition 3D video.
 
Snapdragon's large install base, strong graphics capabilities and software 
development tools have 
attracted a sizable community of gaming 
developers. We currently have close to 100 casual and HD games optimized 
for our graphics processing unit, which we believe is 2x to 3x the number 
optimized for any other mobile chipset. And we see this number growin
g 
quickly.
 
Our next
-
generation chipset architecture is on path to raise the bar for the 
industry again. This architecture delivers 5x the performance and uses 75% 
of the power of our previous generation, which was already industry
-
leading. 
As we have menti
oned previously, the MSM 8960 will be the first chipset 
with this new architecture and an integrated LTE modem. It is sampling later 
this year.
 
We will also update the Snapdragon line to include this new architecture at 
all tiers. We will share more detail
s of our plans at Mobile World Congress in 
Barcelona.
 
As we mentioned in November, during fiscal 2011, we expect to see an 
increase in a variety and tiering of smartphones. Specifically, a greater mix 
of mass
-
market smartphones. In addition, increased chip
set shipments in 
emerging regions will be driven by the transition of 2G to 3G technology. 
Our integrated solutions are particularly well
-
suited for these mass
-
market 
devices, and we will continue to price in order to grow share in this 
environment.
 
As we 
have commented on in the past, we also prepare to transition our 
product line towards our first 28 nanometer parts and continue to increase 
the focus on cost
-
optimized solutions.
 
In the nearer term, we do expect some seasonality in our fiscal second 
quarte
r, consistent with prior years including the effects of annual pricing 
resets with our customers and MSM shipment levels a bit lower coming off a 
busy holiday quarter.
 
Finally, we are excited about the recently announced agreement to acquire 
Atheros. This 
acquisition significantly expands our opportunities as a 
semiconductor provider. With this incremental set of products, channels and 
customers, we can accelerate the extension of our technologies and 
platforms beyond cellular to computing, consumer electro
nics and 
networking.
 
In closing, the QCT team is executing very well, driving our technology and 
integration
-
leadership position in the industry. We expect another wave of 
exciting devices based on our technology to be announced this quarter. We 
are in a u
nique position to lead the transition to smartphones and always on, 
always connected computing and entertainment devices.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Bill Keitel.
 
William Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyon
e. We have another quarter 
of record results to report today. We are pleased to be substantially raising 
our estimates for fiscal 2011 revenue and earnings per share. The impact 
related to the recent license dispute resolution announced today will be 
recor
ded in our second fiscal quarter and beyond. It is not reflected in our 
first fiscal quarter results.
 
Our fiscal first quarter revenues of $3.35 billion were a record high, up 25% 
year
-
over
-
year and at the high end of our prior guidance. Non
-
GAAP 
earnings 
per share were also a record $0.82 per share, up 32% year
-
over
-
year, significantly exceeding the high end of our prior guidance. We shipped 
a record 118 million MSM chips during the quarter towards the high end of 
our prior guidance and average revenue per
 
MSM increased sequentially 
consistent with our prior guidance. QCT's operating margin was 30%, driven 
by a favorable mix of smartphone chipsets.
 
Total reported device sales by our licensees were a record $34 billion, 
exceeding our prior expectations and d
riven by a greater
-
than
-
expected mix 
of licensee device shipments in developed regions, notably North America, 
Japan and Korea. We estimate that our licensees shipped approximately 165 
million to 169 million new CDMA devices in the September 2010 quarter, 
also a record. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA devices was 
approximately $201 to $207 per unit, up approximately 12% sequentially, 
driven by the greater mix of devices in developed regions, as well as 
approximately $8 of favorable foreign exc
hange.
 
QTL's operating margin was 84% and the implied royalty rate that you 
calculate based on the information we provide was slightly lower 
sequentially, consistent with expectations and driven primarily by fixed 
revenue items and infrastructure royalties
 
within QTL's total revenues.
 
Cash and marketable securities totaled $19 billion at the end of the first 
quarter, including $6 billion onshore and $13 billion offshore. During the first 
fiscal quarter, we paid cash dividends of $309 million or $0.19 per sh
are. 
And on January 14, we announced another cash dividend of $0.19 per share 
payable on March 25, 2011. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate was 19% in the first 
fiscal quarter. We recorded a $32 million tax benefit in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2011 related to fiscal 
2010 as a result of the retroactive reenactment 
of the federal R&D tax credit. To facilitate a better period
-
to
-
period 
comparison, we excluded this tax benefit related to fiscal 2010 from our first 
quarter non
-
GAAP results.
 
Our fiscal first quarter non
-
GAA
P earnings per share were $0.10 higher than 
our initial guidance midpoint of $0.72 at the outset of the quarter. QCT was 
approximately $0.04 higher, QTL was approximately $0.03 higher. The 
remaining $0.03 was a combination of the lower tax rate driven by t
he fiscal 
2011 portion of the federal R&D tax credit and investment gains not included 
in our prior guidance.
 
We estimate that calendar 2010 CDMA device shipments were approximately 
640 million to 660 million new devices. Based on the 650 million midpoint 
of 
our estimate, 2010 CDMA device shipments grew 28% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Now turning to our guidance. We are increasing our estimate for calendar 
2011 CDMA device shipments. We estimate that between 750 million and 
800 million CDMA devices will ship in 2011, a
n increase of approximately 
15% to 23% over the midpoint of our calendar 2010 estimate because I'm 
sure you know that we are substantially raising our financial guidance for the 
fiscal year.
 
Of the $1.2 billion increase to our fiscal 2011 revenue guidance,
 
approximately $650 million is driven by an improved outlook for our Chipset 
business and approximately $550 million is driven by an improved outlook in 
our Licensing business. The approximate $550 million licensing improvement 
is due in part to the licens
e dispute resolution and in part to a material 
increase in the base Licensing business independent of the license 
resolution. The $550 million is also a net increase on top of the amount we 
included in our fiscal 2011 guidance back in November for the pote
ntial 
resolution of one or both of our licensee disputes.
 
The new licensee amendment was just recently signed. Though the 
accounting treatment still needs to be finalized, we expect our fiscal second 
quarter will include revenues from this licensee, for sa
les in the second fiscal 
quarter, as well as for past sales in prior quarters. As Derek pointed out, we 
think that the implied royalty rate as you calculate it has become a less 
reliable metric for modeling the Licensing business. Having said that, we 
esti
mate that the implied rate for the remaining three quarters of fiscal 
2011, excluding the amounts related to periods prior to the second fiscal 
quarter, will be relatively constant in the range of approximately 3.4% to 
3.5%.
 
As Derek noted, although we rem
ain confident in our position, the arbitration 
with Panasonic may not be decided until after our fiscal year end, and we 
therefore are not forecasting any amounts related to any resolution with 
Panasonic in this fiscal year at this time.
 
We expect non
-
GAAP
 
fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of 
approximately$13.6 billion to $14.2 billion as compared to our prior estimate 
of $12.4 billion to $13 billion. We are also raising our fiscal 2011 earnings 
per share guidance by $0.28 per share. We anticipate non
-
GAAP earnings 
per share to be in the range of $2.91 to $3.05, an increase of 18% to 24% 
year
-
over
-
year. We estimate the average selling price of CDMA
-
based 
devices to be approximately $190 to $200 for all of fiscal 2011.
 
In QCT, although the opportunity t
o be in the higher end of this range is now 
a bit better, reflecting stronger volume and mix expectations, we are 
reaffirming our prior estimate that operating margins will be in the range of 
22% to 24% for fiscal 2011.
 
The expected decrease in operating m
argins for the remainder of fiscal 2011 
relative to the last couple of quarters reflects our continued expectation of a 
greater mix of mass
-
market smartphones and our new chipset products to 
service demand.
 
We expect the combination of non
-
GAAP R&D and 
SG&A expense to increase 
approximately 12% year
-
over
-
year, higher than our prior guidance of 
approximately 7%, reflecting variable cost related to our greater expected 
revenues, as well as some foreign exchange impact.
 
Based on the midpoint of our updated 
guidance, R&D expense will improve 
to approximately 17% of revenue, similar to the rate we experienced three 
and four years ago. And SG&A expense will improve to approximately 10% 
of revenue, the lowest rate in the last five years. We estimate our non
-
GAAP
 
annual tax rate to be approximately 21%.
 
Now turning to the second fiscal quarter, we estimate non
-
GAAP revenues to 
be in the range of approximately $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion. And non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.77 to $0.81.
 
Based 
on the midpoints, we expect second quarter revenue and earnings per 
share to increase year
-
over
-
year by 35% and 34% respectively. We expect 
total reported device sales reported by our licensees to be approximately 
$36.5 billion to $38.5 billion, up 35% yea
r
-
over
-
year based on the midpoint.
 
We anticipate QCT shipments of approximately 113 million to 117 million 
MSM chips during the March quarter, down a bit coming off the busy holiday 
quarter but up 24% year
-
over
-
year based on the midpoint. We expect 
revenue
 
per MSM to be down quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by annual pricing 
resets with customers consistent with historical norms. And we expect lower 
operating margin sequentially.
 
Our estimate for CDMA channel inventory is largely consistent with our prior 
expect
ations, remaining at the low end of the historical range through fiscal 
2011. We anticipate second fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A 
expenses combined will increase approximately 11% sequentially, reflecting 
normal increased seasonal expenses primarily 
related to employee payroll 
taxes.
 
Our fiscal second quarter non
-
GAAP earnings per share guidance midpoint is 
$0.03 lower as compared to our first quarter. We expect QTL to be better 
$0.17 sequentially, driven by revenue related to the new license dispute 
resolution and increased device volumes reported by licensees for the busy 
holiday quarter.
 
We estimate that the one
-
time revenue benefit related to periods prior to 
the second fiscal quarter will be approximately $250 million or $0.09 per 
share in the sec
ond fiscal quarter. We expect QCT to be approximately $0.10 
lower, driven by the seasonal lower volumes and pricing resets mentioned 
earlier.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense growth accounts for 
approximately $0.05 and the remaining decrease is drive
n by the dilutive 
impact of increased share count and lower sequential investment income as 
we do not include estimates for uncertain realized investment gains losses in 
our forecast. Net unrealized gains on marketable securities were $968 
million at the e
nd of the first fiscal quarter.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren 
Kneeshaw.

Bill, just want to build on the guidance you just gave us. Can you help us 
maybe think about the cadence of your QCT chipset margins to get to your 
full year guidance? I know you just gave us so
me math we can work 
through, but would they recover more midyear as March the lowest quarter, 
or is it kind of at this lower rate for the rest of the year, stable, to get to 
your guidance? If you can help us think through that and the seasonal 
trends. And 
also just on the royalty side, with this one
-
time payment, is that 
$250 million included in the guidance? Should we use that number in 
calculating our implied royalty rate or is that separate?
 
William Keitel
 
Mike, on your first question, the QCT margins fo
r the rest of this year, we do 
expect, with this Q2 guidance, pretty substantial decline from the first 
quarter into the second quarter. Again, consistent as with what we expected 
at the time we were with you in New York three months ago. From that 
point, 
I would just say that at this early stage, we expect to be going out of 
the year just a bit modestly higher on the margins, but of course that will be 
a function of volume and mix as we go. On the $250 million, I think the key 
there is just to know that wh
en you look at Q2 in terms of comparing it to 
what you want to model for Q3 and forward is that, that was an amount that 
really relates to prior periods. We haven't gotten into, as of this early stage, 
of how much of that might be Q1 versus prior periods. 
The deal was just 
recently signed, so we haven't gotten to that far yet. But I think with the 
information given here on the call, including our expectation of implied 
royalty rate, hopefully, you've got enough to do some decent modeling of 
the business goi
ng forward. Derek, do you want to. . .
 
Derek Aberle
 
Let me just add one thing on the rate. I think we made two points on the 
implied rate that you calculate. One is that for the full fiscal year, taking into 
account the $250 million, that we expected it to
 
be in the range of 3.5%. 
And then we also said exiting 2011, meaning the fourth quarter of 2011, we 
expect it to be between 3.4% and 3.5%.

If I could just follow on the royalty s
ide there, could you just frame for us, 
maybe it sounds like a steady state, you went from 3.3 to 3.45 at the 
midpoint with this deal signed. Should we expect when the other deal is 
signed, a similar magnitude of change? And then also on this topic, could 
you just talk to us, it was a much bigger tablet quarter, so what impact did 
tablets have on the rate? I calculated it at 3.1% or so in the quarter. Was 
there a tablet impact, and is it consistent with the guidance that you give us 
as far as the diluted im
pact of tablets at the Analyst Day a few months ago?
 
Derek Aberle
 
On the first point on the difference between this deal and the other dispute, 
I think we haven't really gotten into trying to characterize one versus the 
other. And I don't think we're prepa
red to do that today. Remember when 
we went out and we gave prior guidance, we had said that there was an 
amount, whether it was probability adjusted or otherwise, but there was an 
amount that was included in our prior guidance related to resolution of 
lic
ensee dispute. And so now there's some increment above that, that's now 
in the guidance as a result of actually concluding the deal, which is making a 
positive move on the implied rate.

Derek, could you just remind 
us, was there a $200 million given a year or 
two ago? What was the sum total of the two at one point that was given?
 
Derek Aberle
 
We said through the end of fiscal 2010, for both disputes, that there was 
approximately a $200 million in revenue not being re
cognized or deferred.
 
Tim Long 
-
 
BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
And then how was it $250 million?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Well, that was as of the end of 2010. And so what we're saying is for the 
prior period, as we've said prior to Q2, it would be amounts for the first 
fi
scal quarter of '11, as well as prior periods to that. So you have yet a 
missing quarter in there. Then on your tablet question, I think the tablets, 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter, were up in terms of both units and the percentage of 
total devices reported to us. A
nd so as we explained in New York in giving 
the capping program we have in place, that's going to have an impact on the 
implied rate, which you're seeing to some extent this quarter.

Looking at the ASP guide of 201 to 207 even backing out the currency effect, 
it was 
still 1.93 to 1.99, up nicely sequentially. How do you see that trend 
through the year as you're seeing increasing amounts of smartphones 
countered with, obviously, some increase in lower
-
end smartphones, but 
which still have decent ASPs, and then also the
 
effects on tablets? That's 
question one. Question two, Steve, looking at the 
--
 
Nvidia made a lot of 
noise at CES around design wins in the sector with the graphics chip and 
with their app processor. How do you see Snapdragon? You made some 
comments aroun
d 60 design wins with the 8960. How do you see your 
design activity in both tablets and smartphones moving through the year? 
How do you see the timing of launches of these products? Should we see 
more from QUALCOMM over the next couple of quarters, I guess
 
is the 
question.
 
William Keitel
 
Brian, it's Bill. On the ASP within that TRDS guidance that we gave, it does 
include a modest decrease in the average ASP through the rest of this year. 
But I would say it's being favorably impacted by both tablets and 
smar
tphones as a whole. But nonetheless, we do see a lot of movement 
towards mass
-
market smartphones that should help grow the market. But as 
a consequence also, lower the average selling price a bit.
 
Derek Aberle
 
And just add one other thing, I think as Bill 
pointed out in his comments and 
as I did as well, I think we're continuing to see positive trends both in 
developed and emerging markets on ASP. I think one thing that pushed the 
ASP up this quarter was just more strength in developed markets. And so I 
thi
nk really going forward, the ASP for the year, the question will really be 
the mix between the developed and the emerging regions.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
And Brian, this is Steve. With regards to the tablet and the smartphone 
traction, as you can tell from my c
omments, we're very comfortable actually 
and confident as to how that design ramp is going. It's probably what 
distinguishes us a little bit from some of the other competitors that you're 
seeing. I think we're engaged with a little bit more broadly 
--
 
or a
 
little bit 
broader customer base. And so I think our time to volume will probably be a 
little bit faster when you consider how many different partners that we're 
engaged with. So we feel very comfortable with that. The other thing to 
remember also is that
 
in addition to a migration to dual core and advanced 
graphics, which we're seeing and we've been supplying in our chipsets, 
you're also seeing a migration to a higher tier modem feature set as well. 
And so as we go through the year, I think you're going t
o start to see more 
and more of these high
-
tier tablets and high
-
tier smartphones be associated 
with LTE as well. Both of those areas of technology, graphics and processors 
on the application side, as well as the LTE modem are areas of strength for 
us, we 
think.

to take your tablet or to take your high

tier smartphone and to 
migrate that 
to other markets. And when they do that, I think there's going to be a 
demand for multimode LTE, multimode being 3G, as well as 4G and coupled 
with that high
-
tier processor. And in addition, if you...

Maybe to follow on that, Steve if you could touch on when you think those 
design wins might begin to ramp for you with that multimode funct
ionality? 
And if you could give a little color on your general perceptions, or maybe, 
Paul, with respect to opportunities broadly this year in China or in India? And 
then lastly Bill, you touched on inventory. Could you just give us some feel 
for where inv
entory is and how you see it trending currently both across the 
channel and for you guys?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Tim, this is Steve. I'll take the first one. I think you'll see our dual
-
core 
designs start to ramp I would say late in the first half, maybe a litt
le bit later 
than what you're hearing for some initial designs from other folks. But you're 
going to start to see that I think across multiple OEMs. We probably didn't 
benefit from being the lead design for the new software coming out of some 
of the softwa
re partners, but we're rapidly adding that capability and across 
multiple OEMs. And as I said, once you couple it with LTE, I think it starts to 
create a 
--
 
some pullback to us, so we're pretty comfortable how that's 
going to ramp.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
With respect
 
to China, I just got back from a trip to China, and I was at a 
conference that China Telecom held for I think it was a few thousand of their 
partners and they declared to be the year of the 3G smartphone. So I think 
that's going to do well. And then these
 
launches that we're seeing in India 
really bode well too because once again, we're going to see a very strong 
push for 3G. A lot of competition. And then we're looking forward to getting 
LTE TDD up and going there too.
 
William Keitel
 
And Tim on the channe
l inventory, we gave some specifics on that outlook, 
our forecast back in New York three months ago. And our current estimates 
are pretty tight to that prior forecast. We did expect some inventory build for 
the holiday season. Our best estimates, it wasn't
 
inordinate. And we expect 
a modest work down here over the next two quarters, a little uptick going 
into the final quarter of this fiscal year. But at this point, going out of this 
year, our channel inventory forecasts and QCT's forecast is based on a 
for
ecast that the channel remains quite low.

Just a couple of questions on the royalty rate. First, I just wanted to confirm 
that my calculation basically points to a sl
ight decrease sequentially to 3.1% 
to some 3.25% of the calculated rate. But stripping out the effect of tablets, 
it seems like the underlying rate did not change, so I just wanted to confirm 
that I have that roughly correctly. And then secondly, your comm
ent that 
the royalty rate would exit at about 3.4% to 3.5% is about a 40 basis point 
acceleration of 3.1% that you just reported. But then the settlement only 
adds about 20 basis points to the full year royalty even including the catch
-
up. So to me that im
plies that the rate is actually accelerating from now 
through year end and that's despite the increasing tablet mix. So I just want 
to understand if that thought process is correct. And if so, then what's 
driving the higher royalty rate between now and yea
r end stripping out the 
settlement?
 
William Keitel
 
Simona, it's Bill. The slight decrease in Q1, I think your math is based on the 
numbers we provided, and yes, we did see a slight decrease. It's a mix of 
product, not a change in rates for any licensees. A
nd as you're aware, we 
have been expecting tablets to increase, connected devices to increase. So 
that slight decrease in the Q1 was consistent with our expectation. As for the 
full year, there is an uptick due in part to the resolution. Obviously, there's
 
the implied rate that you calculate based on the information provided. 
There's a fairly significant increase in Q2. But then, we've given you the data 
so that you could pull out of that if you like the amount of that, that would 
be attributable to prior p
eriods. Then for the full year, in addition to the 
license resolution amount, we are expecting some mix shift that does 
slightly favor the implied royalty rate. And then as we said previously, the 
remaining dispute with Panasonic, that's not included in ou
r guidance. So 
that would be further upside if we can successfully conclude it this year.
 
Simona Jankowski 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
 
And I guess, Bill or Derek, that's actually kind of the essence of the question 
is what is driving that increase in the ro
yalty rate? Because for it to increase 
on a net basis despite the deflationary impact of tablets, it would mean that 
some other category that's even higher 
--
 
at a higher royalty rate is actually 
growing faster than tablets. And I guess I'm just kind of cu
rious what that 
other category would be.
 
William Keitel
 
We're not going to get into further disclosure there, but I think I would just 
point lastly to what Derek said. This implied royalty rate, it's an indicator. It 
can be suspect. You have to be careful 
how it's used because it can give 
some wrong signals. But the reason we gave you the data points we did was 
to just help you triangulate through what this license dispute resolution is in 
the context of our year versus just the ongoing business without 
--
 
independent of that resolution.

I just got a couple. One is with regards to the revenue guidance, I just 
wanted to clarify, or make sure I understand, you're raising revenue 
guidance by, at the midpoint, about $1.2 billion. And for the last three 
quarters if you include, you had in Q1, y
ou start to raise of over $1 billion. 
But I just want to make sure that $250 million payment is also in there, is 
that correct? So we should be thinking something over $750 million in terms 
of organic revenue raise for the back end of the year. And I guess
 
that also 
includes some of these royalties coming back. So I just want to make sure 
we understand that correctly. And if you could comment also on how that 
additional revenue, whatever it is, $750 million or maybe it's just a little bit 
more than that, ho
w it comes through in the different business forms, 
particularly QCT and QTL, that would be helpful.
 
William Keitel
 
Rod, I'll try and answer the question here. So yes, we are raising our 
revenue guidance by a total of $1.2 billion. The low end and the high
 
end of 
our guidance increased by a total of $1.2 billion. That does include the 
revenues we expect this year as a result of the license dispute resolution 
that we just announced here today. And then within that license 
--
 
and let 
me further before I do, o
f the $1.2 billion, approximately $650 million is 
attributable to the chipset business QCT and approximately $550 million of 
that is attributable to QTL. And then the only other data point we shared on 
the QTL breakdown was that we expect at this time appr
oximately $250 
million of Q2 revenue that is in that $1.2 billion raise for the full year, we 
expect about $250 million to be attributable to periods prior to the first 
quarter. So that license dispute resolution is first quarter and prior, the prior 
perio
ds. And so that license dispute resolution number is specific only to 
QTL. That does not port directly into QCT.

Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're spending t
he R&D on? 
You mentioned that you're going to raise your R&D run rate for the year. 
What is it that you see a need for? And second, Bill, with regards to your 
annual guide, does it still exclude gains of the portfolio as was your guidance 
earlier in your I
nvestor Day for the year?
 
William Keitel
 
Ittai, on the operating expense raise, we are getting negatively impacted a 
bit by foreign exchange on the Op expense. So that's a piece of it. We have 
not included the Atheros business in our forecast. But nonethel
ess, we have 
incurred fees with advisors that will be paid regardless of whether we close 
that transaction or not, so you have those two elements. And then there is a 
small piece of our total expenses that tend to be variable with revenue. The 
major R&D sp
ends, I would say no major changes from the program that we 
had lined up and the allocation of the R&D dollars lined up across programs 
from just three months ago. As always, we continue to review those 
amounts, debate those amounts. But after we lock in t
he budget, the 
changes tend to be relatively small. So no significant new introductions at 
this point to the R&D program.

And with regards to the gains on the portfolio?
 
William Keitel
 
Then on the investment 
gains, yes, we're staying with our past practice of 
not including a forecast of realized gains. I did point out that as we've had 
now for a few quarters, the net unrealized gains are over $900 million. Now 
the reason we don't include that is because we thi
nk it's just suspect to 
forecast. Historically, there tend to be a bit more gains than what we are 
able to clearly see. But anything that crosses over anything that isn't highly 
certain. If we don't have investments maturing that are going to have a 
gain, 
if we don't have managers that are saying they are going to exit a 
position, or at the time we give guidance, if we already have, our money 
managers have realized gains, we include that. But beyond that, we do not 
include. Hence why on average, over the la
st number of quarters, you see a 
bit more income there reported than what we guide.

One clarification just to make sure we've totally beat the dead horse, but I 
want to make sure I'm 
understanding it correctly, and then a question, and 
that is that this $250 million or $0.09 is completely in the guidance for next 
quarter, so that when the EPS guidance of next quarter of $0.77 to $0.81, 
that includes a $0.09 boost from this?
 
William Kei
tel
 
That's correct.
 
Ehud Gelblum 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
So then, my questions are, if we do a little math on this, your full year EPS 
guidance for the midpoint is not $2.98. And if we take off the $0.82 you just 
did and the $0.79, which is the midpoint of your g
uidance for next quarter, I 
think you get $1.37 left over, which then if you divide by two is about $0.68, 
$0.69. So the back half of the year is going to do roughly $0.68, $0.69, but 
your guidance 
--
 
and then if you look at your guidance for Q2, the $0.79
 
at 
the midpoint of $0.77 to $0.81, take off the $0.09 from $250 million, next 
quarter is basically $0.70. So am I right to assume that your guidance is 
assuming basically on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis, roughly $0.70 flat for the 
next three quarters with no
 
growth as you go through the year, and why 
would that be as opposed to seeing some growth? And then just a quick 
question for Steve, when you're looking at the integrated chipsets that 
you're selling, are you seeing a difference between more 7000s or more
 
8000s? I'd imagine with the developed markets doing better now that you're 
seeing more 8000s selling, but do you expect more 7000s to sell as we get 
into the next few quarters and that's a source of margin pressure?
 
William Keitel
 
Ehud, I'll take the firs
t part of your question. Your math is largely correct. I 
won't comment on whether it's approximately $0.70 per quarter for the next 
three quarters equally. I think I did mention earlier we are expecting a little 
bit better in the fourth fiscal quarter at t
his point, but your math is correct. 
And a couple of key drivers there. In QUALCOMM'S first half of any fiscal 
year, we get the Christmas effect both in QCT and QTL. So over the years, 
the first half of the fiscal year does tend to be greater than the seco
nd half 
of the fiscal year, so that's number one. Number two, as we pointed out, you 
do have this $250 million that does relate to periods prior to the second 
fiscal quarter, and so we won't see that in Q3 or Q4 in the second fiscal half. 
And then thirdly,
 
as we went through in New York and in effect what we're 
reiterating here is that QCT is aggressively going after what we see is a fairly 
substantial smartphone mass
-
market. And we've got new products as well to 
go at that market. And for fiscal 2011, we e
xpect the margin on those 
products to be lower than what we have historically seen with new products. 
And the target is that in fiscal '12, we follow on with replacements product, 
namely the 28
-
nanometer, that brings those margins back to the level that 
we
 
want to see. So I think those are the key drivers. But your math, Ehud, I 
mean it's basically correct, yes.

Bill, if I could check my math also. If I just run through i
t, it looks like your 
chip margins would have to drop to mid to high teens just taking in all the 
color you gave in your EPS guidance for the second quarter. And that's a 
significant drop from the 30% you just had when you compare that to last 
year where y
ou did have a price cut with mix shift. And I understand, I 
guess, the new products that you haven't been aggressive, but there still 
seems to be quite an unusually large drop and maybe conservative. And 
maybe if there's a shift to base band or some sort o
f a base band
-
only 
product, is that the big impact? If you can kind of walk us through that. And 
then separately, if you could just give us a little color on the use of the 
offshore cash for the Atheros deal would be great, how that works?
 
William Keitel
 
Maynard, on the QCT margins, so our estimates for the year is to be in the 
range of 22% to 24% for the full year consistent with what we said three 
months ago. We did note that within that range, we are edging a little bit 
higher than where we were at the 
outset of this fiscal year. But that edging, 
so to speak, is not enough that we felt comfortable raising the 22% to 24% 
range. So obviously, to end up with an average of 22% to 24% after having 
just reported a quarter here of 30%, we expect a substantial d
ecline. We do 
expect that, it is built into our guidance here for the second fiscal quarter. 
And it is just, it's the same drivers that we're seeing today as what we saw 
three months ago. We see a greater volume going forward relative to the 
recent couple 
of quarters of more developing market. And then we do see 
this opportunity to drive a mass market of smartphones and we're targeting 
that with new chipsets we have and those chipsets do have lower margin 
than traditionally we've seen in the past.
 
Steven Mo

And this is Steve, maybe I could add one other comment, which is that we 
do have a calendar year pricing reset, which does hit us in the quarter that 
we're talking about. This year, not unlike other years, similar type of move. 
And then in additio
n, I think there's also some employee payroll
-
type issue 
that hits, as well, that probably impacts a little bit on top of the function or 
the trends that Bill mentioned as well. The other thing to remember is we're 
coming off a very strong quarter where yo
u had significant growth, or 
significant number of units really in the North America space, and in the 
smartphone space, the high tier, and there's probably little bit of seasonality 
in that as well.

Bill, if I substract $250 million from the $1.2 billion of incremental strength, 
is there a way to sort of rank order the new 
positive dynamics that you're 
seeing? Is it regional, is it Apple, is a tablets, is it a faster adoption of LTE, 
just some color there? And then Steve, are all device makers sort of on 
board with this mass
-
market opportunity for smartphones? There's some 
t
hought that dumping down the smartphone may actually limit their broad 
appeal. Just kind of how low is low for you, and your thoughts there?
 
William Keitel
 
Mark, on your first question in terms of rank ordering, I think the drivers 
here are pretty broad. T
he chipset demand on QCT, we're seeing better units 
for the fiscal year than what we saw three months ago. We are seeing a 
pretty good healthy increase across a number of products there. And after 
this first quarter, on balance, we have seen an uptick here
 
in some of the 
demand for the higher end developed market products. But as we said, we 
do expect that trend to be shifting a bit here as the year progresses for QCT. 
So I think that's 
--
 
and then that much traces back into the Licensing 
business as well. 
The other thing I do want to point out is in November we 
said we had an undisclosed amount, but we had an amount in our guidance 
that we thought was prudent, prudent based on our expectations at that 
time of resolving one or both of the licensee disputes. 
And so although 
there's an increment here in our guidance just for the resolution of this 
licensee dispute, the absolute number is greater and the difference being it's 
making up 
--
 
it's covering that prudent amount that we had put in our 
guidance at the o
utset of the fiscal year.

I just want to go back to the question that was asked about the QCT 
margins and also the question that was about use of offshore cash. So on 
QCT margins, ever
y year, you said you have a reset of prices. Now, last year 
I think you priced the HSPA 14.4, the same price of 7.2. And I think that 
was part of the reason that the margin was down. What happens this year? 
Is it just price cuts across the board or is it m
ore specific to your dual core 
that you're trying to penetrate to the market, et cetera, and you're reducing 
the price there? Any color you can give us because if I just do the math, the 
margins for the next three quarters, assuming 
--
 
there's going to be 
one 
quarter below 20% of margin and I just want to understand the dynamics 
there. Second point, in your answer on your offshore cash, you answered it I 
hope it's going to happen. So what happens if it doesn't happen, which 
means what happens if you cannot 
use offshore cash to pay for Atheros 
acquisition?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
On the QCT margin part. This is Steve. Maybe I'll try to also complete the 
answer to the last question, Mark's question. So we do see a strong trend to 
mass

market smartphones. It tends to
 
be correlated to people who are 
engaged with multiple operators worldwide. Those folks who are probably a 
little bit more concentrated in the United States probably don't see it as

driven in some areas by the transition from 2G to 3G, as I said in my 
remarks. That being said, and then maybe tying this to the op margin, for us 
sequentially, you've got a normal calendar year price reset. This year, not 
unlike other years if you go bac
k from our side. And then in addition, you 
have a little bit of a mix shift in terms of sequential mix shift towards the 
mass
-
market smartphones. Those two events combined and you get a 
sequential drop in terms of the op margin. I'm not sure if you're goin
g to see 
a number quite as deep as you may be calculating, but we definitely will see 
a difference in the sequential number.

And then Tal, on your cash question, just to be clear. We're not making any 
change in what we said just a little bit
 
ago when we announced the Atheros 
deal. It's just that we've got a ways to go here on the planning and just 
getting to the point where the acquisition does, in fact, occur. So we've got a 
ways to go on that. If we would not use offshore cash, we have $6 b
illion of 
onshore. And so if we did use onshore, there would be less available for 
stock buybacks. But other than that, I don't see a significant difference.

And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for 
questions and 
answers. Dr. Jacobs, would you like to add anything further 
before adjourning the conference?
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Yes, I'm really glad to be able to report such a record quarter and it's really 
because many of the decisions we made on investments are paying 
off. The 
LTE launches, Snapdragon traction, advanced technologies. And we've got 
great stuff coming up at Mobile World Congress too. So a lot of good things 
are going on. We had a very busy quarter and start of the year, and I can't 
say that every quarter 
is going to have so much excitement in it. But I can 
say that capitalizing on all the opportunities ahead of us are definitely going 
to make for exciting times in the future. And so I want to just say thanks to 
everybody who is a part of it, and thank you 
for your support and for joining 
us today.

of $25 billion up 30% versus last year. Earnings, total reported device sales 
and MSM chipset 
shipments also set records, as our technologies continued 
to underpin the global growth of wireless data and our semiconductor 
solutions are used across the industries flagship smartphones.
 
We increased our dividend for the 11
th
 
consecutive year and 
returned 
approximately $6.7 billion to the stockholders in the form of buybacks and 
cash dividends in fiscal year 2013.
 
Looking at the fourth fiscal quarter, we also delivered record revenues which 
came in near the high
-
end of our guidance due to strength 
in both our 
licensing and semiconductor businesses.
 
Earnings would have been well ahead of guidance if not for a legal charge we 
recorded in the fourth quarter. We are pursuing post trial motions in the 
district court and we will pursue all options on appe
al as necessary and 
remain confident in our positions.
 
We made excellent strategic and operational progress this year. We 
delivered our industry leading third generation 3G/LTE multi
-
mode modem, 
grew our share of semiconductor content in a wide array of de
vices, and 
expanded our licensing program. Further, our strategy to support the LTE 
TDD migration path for the wireless operators in India was successfully 
executed. We just completed the final step in transferring full ownership of 
the Indian BWA entity t
hat holds to the 4G spectrum we won in the 2010 
spectrum auction to Bharti.
 
We also announced the planned divestiture of OmniTRACS. As you know 
OmniTRACS was one of our first businesses and help fund our investment in 
CDMA.
 

 
the employees, suppliers, and customers who 
contributed to the more than 25 year success of the business. We really look 
forward to hearing about your future accomplishments.
 
We expect that transaction to be completed during our first fiscal quarter of 
20

on the sale in either our first fiscal quarter or annual guidance.
 

what we delivered in the last two year
s. This is partially due to the 
exceptionally strong year we just completed which included share gains and 
content share gains in QCT.
 

expect will moderate our QCT growth. In light 
of this, we are taking near
-
term actions company wise to prioritize investments, stay focused on 
growth, but also control expenses in order to deliver operating profit growth 
in excess of revenue growth.
 
Fundamentally, we believe our long term growth drive
rs remain very much 
intact and we are aligning our resources to continue to capture those 
opportunities. We continue to see smartphone adoption grow at a rapid pace 
across the globe.
 
According to Gartner, approximately 225 million smartphones were shipped 
in the second quarter of calendar 2013, representing 47% year
-
over
-
year 
increase. This is especially true in emerging regions where smartphone 
demand is being driven impart by the migration from 2G to 3G. Looking 
forward, Gartner is now expecting 1.8 billi
on smartphones will be shipped in 
2017.
 
In the September quarter, we saw the launch of new devices with expanded 
capabilities based on QUALCOMM products. Some of these new capabilities 
include the launch of ultra HD video, LTE carrier aggregation and suppo
rt for 
additional frequency bands for global roaming.
 
We will continue to focus on expanding our share of content and devices. We 
are making good progress with our WiFi and RF front end solutions. We see 
multimode 3G LTE as a catalyst for growth in network
 
enhancements and 
smartphone demand.
 
According to GSMA Intelligence, approximately 100 million new LTE 
connections are expected to be added in calendar year 2013, representing a 
57% year

net 
new connections. China remains an important opportunity for 
smartphones. With the upcoming launch of LTE, we expect increased 
demand for smartphones across many tiers of the license. It's not just about 
smartphones, impact of mobile on other industries can
not be overstated. 
The mobile ecosystem is driving innovations in healthcare, automotive, 
education and of course computing, which is creating new opportunities for 
QUALCOMM from both a chipset and the licensing perspective.
 
Smartphone experiences are driv
ing tablet designs as evidenced by the 
increased innovation and demand for 7
-
inch including Snapdragon based 
tablets Google and Amazon announced this quarter. In addition, several 
operators have recently introduced new data plans that could be a positive 
c
atalyst for 3G, 4G adoption in tablets and other consumer electronics 
devices.
 
Now all these trends are helping to drive better demand globally. And in 
order to address the growth in data, operators continue to revolve their 3G 
networks, upgrade to LTE, ev
aluate new spectrum opportunities and evolve 
network topologies to include the introduction of small cells. This past June 
we announced our FSM solution that integrates our 3G and 4G technologies 
with advanced 802.1ac in WiFi to enable fully featured low
-
c
ost model smart 
cells that are designed to provide superior performance with greater power 
efficiency.
 
We will discuss the many growth opportunities we see ahead and the 

upcoming New Yo
rk Analyst Event. I look forward to seeing many of you 
there.
 

once again like to thank all of our employees and partners for their 
commitment, innovation and leadership. We have tremen
dous opportunities 
ahead and we are positioning the company to capitalize on these while 
carefully managing our cost structure.
 
And overall QUALCOMM remains well positioned for continued growth. We 
have grown revenues at a compound annual rate of more than
 
30% over the 
last three years and building after this very strong fiscal 2013 days here, 
going forward for the next five years, we expect that revenues and earnings 
per share will grow at double
-
digit compound annual growth rates. We 
expect to return sign
ificant amounts of capital to stockholders consistent 
with this outlook.
 
I will now turn the call over to QUALCOMM'S President and Chief Operating 
Officer Steve Mollenkopf.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thanks Paul and good afternoon everyone. I will provide some comme
nts on 
both QTL and QCT businesses. In fiscal 2013, QTL delivered record revenues 
and earnings up 19% and 18% year
-
over
-
year respectively driven by 
greater than expected 3G, 4G device shipments and increased ASPs reported 
by our license fees. We now have o
ver 250 royalty bearing 3G licenses.
 
Over 90 single
-
mode OFDM licenses and we believe our 3G and 4G portfolios 
are the most widely licensed in the industry. Through our broad licensing 
program we continue to foster innovation and enable a large and growing
 
ecosystem that benefits wireless consumers worldwide.
 
QCT also grew significantly in fiscal 2013 delivering record revenues and 
earnings up 38% and 39% year
-
over
-
year respectively, driven by successful 
share in content gains. During the year we continue t
o lead in LTE with our 
integrated modem solutions and delivered significant product enhancements 
across all key technology vectors including the modem, processor, graphics 
and connectivity with unmatched world
-
class integration.
 
For 2014, we are forecastin
g another year of strong growth in QTL. We 
expect 3G, 4G device shipments by our licensees to grow 15% at the 
midpoint in calendar 2014 and our fiscal 2014 3G, 4G device ASPs are 
estimated to be between $216 and $230 down slightly by $3 or 1% year
-
over
-
yea
r at the midpoint.
 
Turning to QCT, our outlook for fiscal 2014 builds of significant successes of 
fiscal 2013. Our leadership across key technologies required for modems and 

across fl
agship designs and key customers. We expect fiscal 2014 QCT year
-
over
-
year growth to moderate somewhat compared to recent years, 
including the very strong growth we delivered in fiscal 2013.
 
Our position as the high
-

ven by 
modem and application processor leadership and is expected to remain 
strong through 2014. The high
-
tier continues to be increasingly concentrated 
however which impacts our product mix, as well as our revenue and related 
operating margins.
 
We 
also expect strong growth in the low and mid
-
tiers driven by emerging 
regions including the anticipated launch of LTE in China in the second half of 
the fiscal year. We continue to see growth in China across all smartphone 
tiers and what we refer to as our
 
EA or Emerging Accounts exceeded $1 
billion in revenue in fiscal 2013. Our participation in the RMB 1,500 and 
above smartphone tier is strong, enabled by both Chinese and multinational 
OEMs.
 
Fiscal 2014 is shaping up to be another favorable year with Chin
ese OEMs as 
we build on our strength in the high
-
tier, enabling OEMs to drive LTE 
solutions in the mid and low tiers during 2014 in China and other emerging 
regions. We expect the launch of LTE in China to change the dynamics there 
as international OEMs le
verage there worldwide LTE leadership to increase 
their positions and Chinese domestic OEMs move up tier and leverage their 
LTE position in China to export internationally.
 

LTE 
chipsets include both the FDD and the TDD mode. We are currently 
shipping integrated chipsets across multiple tiers to support initial volume 
expected to start around the Chinese New Year.
 
In light of our near
-
term outlook moderating following a strong 201
3, we are 
slowing the growth rate of our spending. We believe we are now operating 
the QCT business at scale and with our expense management initiative this 
year we forecast that we will exit fiscal 2014 at a lower operating expense 
run rate than we exited
 
fiscal 2013.
 
In addition to operating expense initiatives, we have projects underway to 
improve product costs within QCT including driving supply
-
chain efficiencies 
and designing cost optimized solutions for the very price competitive low 
tier.
 
It is impo
rtant to note that we expect 2014 quarterly QCT operating margins 
to trend differently this year as compared to previous years and in particular 
we expect them to strengthen in the second half of fiscal 2014. This reflects 
the quarterly demand profile and 
product mix we expect including the 
growth of LTE in China, as well as the anticipated customer device launches 
throughout the year.
 
In addition, the cumulative effect of the product cost and operating expense 
initiatives we are undertaking improved the ma
rgin profile over time. 
Accordingly, we expect to exit the fiscal year at a high point, above 20% 
operating margin instead of peeking in the first fiscal quarter as in prior 
years.
 
Looking ahead, we believe we continue to be well
-
positioned versus our 
comp
etition. In fiscal year 2013, we delivered our third
-
generation LTE 
solution well ahead of the competition. It features LTE carrier aggregation 
with Category 4, supports all major standards in voice and data mobility 
scenarios and is available on a standal
one or integrated basis.
 
Our LTE solutions now span the high
-
end to the volume tier and are well
-
positioned globally across FDD and TDD opportunities. The LTE feature sets 
required to be successful will continue to evolve at a fast pace, driven by 
competit
ive dynamics in the United States and Asia, compounded by the 
number of RF bands required to deliver the higher data rates and capacity to 
the consumers.
 
We continue to lead in mobile optimized application processors and this 
continues to be an area of inv
estment for us as in the past. We have 
successfully grown our tablet design pipeline including such notable designs 
as the Amazon Kindle HDX, the Google Nexus 7, the LG G Pad, Sony Xperia 
Z and multiple tablets with Samsung and Nokia.
 
We see strong tractio
n and a broad design pipeline for RF360 Front End 
products, which include the envelope tracker and antenna tuner, PA with 
integrated switch and RF POP. The envelope tracker has shipped 
commercially in handsets in September and the remainder of the solution
s 
are scheduled to launch as expected throughout the fiscal year.
 
We also continue to make great progress with our mobile Wi
-
Fi and 
connectivity solutions building off our successful acquisition of Atheros. Our 
802.11ac product continues to have strong des
ign traction with over 150 
smartphone design wins including many with top
-
tier OEMs. Overall, our Wi
-
Fi attach rate on a unit basis is over 50% and we expect it to continue to 
growth throughout fiscal 2014.
 
To conclude, we see significant growth opportunit
ies ahead for our business 
and we are managing our resources to maintain our technology leadership 
and best position ourselves for the future. I look forward to discussing this 
with many of you at the upcoming Analyst Day.
 

o George.
 
George S. Davis
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to be 
reporting strong financial results for both this quarter and the full fiscal year. 
Fiscal fourth quarter revenues were a record, up 32% year
-
over
-
year and 
non
-
GAA
P operating income was up 20% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $1.05 was up 18% year
-
over
-
year. Our 
non
-
GAAP result this quarter included $173 million or $0.10 per share 
litigation expense related to the recent ParkerVision verdict, which was
 
not 
included in our fiscal fourth quarter guidance. Excluding this $0.10 charge 
our non
-
GAAP EPS would have been $1.15 per share or $0.09 above the 
midpoint of our prior guidance range and up 29% year
-
over
-
year.
 
In addition to strong operating results the
 
impact of certain tax items, share 
repurchases and investment portfolio performance accounted for 
approximately $0.06 per share in the quarter.
 
QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $60.2 billion, just 
above the high
-
end of our guidance r
ange with the average selling price in 
line with last quarter consistent with our expectations.
 
QCT had record revenues and MSMs in the quarter and implied revenue per 
MSM was down sequentially, reflecting increased low
-
tier shipments relative 
to expectati
ons. QCT operating margin was 16% at the low end of our 
guidance, also reflecting the low
-
tier product mix. Non
-
GAAP combined R&D 
and SG&A expenses grew 6% sequentially consistent with expectations.
 
During the fourth fiscal quarter we returned approximatel
y $3.9 billion to 
stockholders including approximately $600 million of dividends paid and $3.3 
billion in stock repurchases. As of the end of fiscal 2013 we had used $150 
million of our new $5 billion stock repurchase program announced in 
September.
 
Cash f
low from operations was very strong at 39% of revenues, reflecting 
solid working capital performance, particularly inventory drawdown. We 
ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29.4 billion. Our 
fiscal fourth quarter non
-
GAAP tax rate wa
s 16%.
 
Turning to our results for fiscal year 2013, revenues were a record, up 30% 
from last year on strengthening QCT share at the high
-
tier, strong 3G/4G 
device growth and increasing ASPs in the QTL business. Non
-
GAAP operating 
income was a record $8.66 
billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were a 
record $4.51, both up 22% year
-
over
-
year.
 

-
over
-
year with operating 
margin of 87% towards the high end of our prior guidance range. We 
estimate that the fiscal 201
3 3G/4G device average selling price was $226 at 
the midpoint, up $7 or 3% year
-
over
-
year.
 

-
over
-
year. 
Earnings before tax was up 39% year
-
over
-
year and operating margin was 
19% for QCT, in line wit
h our full
-
year guidance.
 
Fiscal 2013 cash flow from operations was $8.8 billion at 35% of revenues. 
We returned approximately $6.7 billion or 86% of free cash flow to 
stockholders during fiscal 2013, paying $2.1 billion of cash dividends and 
repurchasing 
$4.6 billion of our shares.
 
We are increasing our forecast for 3G/4G device shipments in calendar 2013 
to between 1.075 billion to 1.125 billion units, up 15% to 20% year
-
over
-
year, driven by strength in emerging regions, particularly China.
 
Now turning to
 
our guidance for fiscal 2014, we estimate fiscal 2014 
revenues to be in the range of approximately $26 billion to $27.5 billion, up 
5% to 11% year
-
over
-
year. We expect QTL top and bottom line growth to 
remain strong, driven by continued strength in 3G/4G,
 
device demand, 
stable replacement rates and ASPs in developed regions, 2G to 3G migration 
in emerging regions as well as LTE deployments in China and elsewhere.
 
We are forecasting a modest ASP decline in fiscal 2014, down $3 at the 
midpoint or 1% to $223. We expect QCT to continue to benefit from 
technology leadership and modems and our Snapdragon family of products. 
We expect QCT growth in fiscal 2014 to reflect 
strong end
-
market demand 
somewhat mitigated by the effects of OEM concentration at the high
-
tier.
 
QCT has successfully established strong positions across all of the key top
-
tier OEMs and much of the medium
-
tier smartphone accounts. QCT growth 
in fiscal 20
14 is aligned with the growth trends in these tiers. In addition, we 
are seeing continued high OEM share concentration particularly at the high
-
tier and this impacts our product mix as well as our revenues and related 
operating margin.
 
We are also seeing a
 
tiering of products by these large customers that is 
leading to a higher utilization of previous
-
generation MSM in their overall 

the first half of fiscal 2014.
 
As Steve mentioned, 
we forecast improving trends in the second half of our 
fiscal year versus the first half. We expect higher device ASPs for QTL and a 
better mix of leading parts in QCT, including the impact of LTE in China. We 
also forecast lower operating expenses and pro
duct costs, contributing to a 
stronger second half.
 
We expect fiscal 2014 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 
$4.95 to $5.15, up approximately 12% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. As 
Paul mentioned, we have not included the estimated gain on t
he sale of 
Omnitracs in our guidance, if this gain was included our fiscal 2014 non
-
GAAP earnings per share estimate would be up 17% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint.
 
For calendar 2014 global 3G/4G based device shipments, we estimate that 
between 1.22 billio
n and 1.3 billion devices will be shipped by our licensees, 
up approximately a 11% to 18% year
-
over
-
year, reflecting increased 
shipments around the world, particularly in emerging regions. We estimate 
fiscal 2014 QTL operating margins will be 87% to 89% an
d QCT operating 
margins will be 18% to 20%, both stable year
-
over
-
year. We expect our 
non
-
GAAP tax rate to be 17% to 19% from fiscal 2014.
 
As Paul and Steve noted, we are slowing our level of operating expense 
growth in fiscal 2014. We expect combined non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A 
expense to grow approximately 5% to 7% year
-
over
-
year in contrast to 
more than 20% annual growth over the past three years.
 
We are reducing a number of R&D process expenses in order to operate 
more efficiently and focus more fully on grow
ing our investments in key 
areas including modem technology, low cost chip designs, CPU and VPU, 
RF360, connectivity and integrated SoCs as well as longer term initiatives 
like displays, small cells and enterprise products.
 
This reduced expense growth is w
ell below recent years and aligns with the 
expected top line growth and our requirements to drive the critical elements 
of our roadmap and new technology initiatives.
 
We also expect to continue at an accelerated pace of return of capital to our 
shareholder
s. In fiscal 2014, we currently expect to repurchase a minimum 
of $4 billion of stock and we have included this repurchase activity in our 
guidance. We will provide further details of our capital return metrics at our 
New York Analyst Day in two weeks.
 
For
 
the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we estimate revenues to be in the range 
of approximately $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion, up approximately 10% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our 
first fiscal quarter to be approxi
mately $1.10 to $1.20 per share, down 9% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
Versus the year ago quarter, we are expecting increased shipments of thin 
modems and low and mid
-
tier products in QCT as well as the impact to 
longer term pricing initiatives that wer
e not in place in the first quarter of 
fiscal 2013 and the impact of higher operating expenses.
 
As you will recall, our first quarter results in fiscal 2013 were very strong 
with the resolution of our 28
-
nanometer supply constraints, favorable 
product cost
 
and low relative operating expenses.
 
We anticipate first quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will 
be flat sequentially with modest growth in R&D, offset by lower spending in 
SG&A.
 
In QTL, we estimate that total reported device sales of $57.5 b
illion to $63.5 
billion will be reported by our licensees in the December quarter for 
shipments they made in the September quarter for approximately 14% 
year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate the QTL ASP to be down in our 
first fiscal quarter versus t
he prior quarter consistent with the increased 
quarterly fluctuations we have seen during the last couple of years related to 
regional, OEM and product mix. We expect the ASP for our fiscal second 
quarter to be flat to up quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
In QCT, we a
nticipate MSM shipments of approximately 195 million to 210 
million units during the December quarter, up approximately 11% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect revenue for MSM to be lower quarter
-
over
-
quarter reflecting a greater mix of lower
-
priced 
modems. We expect 
QCT operating margin to be up sequentially and in the range of 17% to 
19%.
 
We see the first fiscal quarter trend is being reflective of the first half of 
fiscal 2014 overall. We expect more favorable top line trends as well as cost

Great, thanks. Steve, just looking into the QCT, I calculate the guidance 
implies may be a 5% to 10% drop for the Q1 in terms of revenue per MSM. 
How sho
uld we think about that both sequentially and then on a full
-
year 
basis, would you expect your revenue per MSM given what sounds like a 
more mid to low end to be down relative to fiscal 2013 levels. Thank you.
 
Steven R. Altman
 
Mike, yes, I don't know if yo
u're going to see a huge difference. It doesn't 
move around all that much actually. We are seeing a weaker mix, I would 
think relative to what you would normally see in a quarter like yes, certainly 
relative to what you would have seen last year. But it st
ill remains I think 
reasonably strong throughout the year.

Hi, thank you. I just had a clarification first, which is, does the 16% 
operating margin in QCT include the litigation charge, and if you back that 
out what would be the margin. And then the question I had was it looks like 
the implied royalty rate decline
d to about 3.1% in the quarter? Can you just 
go over some of the reasons for that and how we should think about that 
going forward?
 
George S. Davis
 
Simona, hi this is George. The 16% did not include the litigation expense, 
which was taken in corporate and 
other. It was shown on the other line in 
OpEx.
 
Derek Aberle
 
This is Derek. So on the implied royalty rate as you know this thing tends to 
bounce around quarterly and there is a number of moving parts in here. 
Probably some of the factors that affected the 
decline from Q3 to Q4 
included OEM mix shifts. Also, we had an increasing TRDS, the market as 
well as lower infrastructure royalties. And so the fixed licensing fee tend to 
be a bit of a drag on the rate when that happens. And we also had, actually 
the ASP
s in the high
-
tier during this quarter increased and so those are the 
types of devices at that point that would be subject to caps.
 
And then finally, we had a couple of kind of one
-
time items including 
overpayment claim that came in the quarter and then so
me timing related to 
cash
-
based revenue recognized licensee payments.

Please go ahead with your question.
 
Brian Modoff 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Yes. A couple of que

saying regarding your mix improvement through the fiscal 2014, especially 

from mix getting better perhaps if you say, with TDD
 
LTE shipments in the 
back half of the year. And how much of this is coming from just simply cost 
savings? And in the comment you made earlier about $1 billion of revenue 
from China in fiscal 2013. Can you give us an idea of what that rate of 
change was fr
om 2012? Thank you.
 
Paul E. Jacobs,
 

it.
 
George S. Davis
 
Sure. Hi, Brian. I would say that the operating expense improvement, it 


 
I woul
d put a little bit more weight on 
the product cost improvement. Certainly, China LTE coming in actually helps 
from a mix standpoint as well, and we also see a little bit less the kind of N 

 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And that issue 

 

some customers right now, I would say, downshifting to a lower tier product, 
although still a high tier product from the perspective of how QTL would see 
it, 
but maybe a smaller, a lower product, still a low, high
-
tier product from 

going into the second half of the year.
 
With respect to the $1 billion in China, the way to think about th
at is, take 
our business in China really in the new channel. So remove Huawei and ZTE 
kind of the international existing business. It just takes the new channel that 
we have been developing and take away some of the higher tier premium 
devices. Just take a
 
look at that new kind of QRD channel and what I would 


I would say, over the year, I have to check, b

 
We are expecting in China the move toward LTE to be a good trend for us. 
So we think that channel is now working and set up hopefully we can move 
it to LTE, which would be better for us even further.

Thank you. Sorry. Just a quick couple of questions f
rom me. First, looking at 
your long
-

-
digit revenue in 

bit about what you see as substantial long
-
term drivers at the longer end of 
that 
period from an end market perspective and how we should think about 
that. And then just a point of clarification, did I understand correctly, George 

 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
Okay. Let me start. So 

and development. So we have spent $5 billion in fiscal 2013. We have 

effort on new technologies, new products. Obviously t
he basic one, a 2G to 

fundamental for our growth.
 
LTE is spreading more particularly China as we say and we are really looking 
forward to that towards the end of the year, tap woods and other
 
kinds of 
computing Steve mentioned the traction that we are getting on design wins 
on the tablet side. We talked a lot about small cells and that opportunity 
going forward more content going into the devices, talking already about RF 
front ends, Wi
-
Fi but
 
also display sensor, integration other kinds of things. 
Clearly wearable, machine
-
to
-
machine these are new growth areas for us. 

their car, in their home, machine to machine so all
 
these kinds of things are 
very significant growth opportunities for us going forward. So we are 

yet talk to you about.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And on the 

 
I think your question, you brok
e up a little bit but the question 
I believe was will we exit the year fiscal 2014 at a lower run rate on OpEx 
than we entered in and that was the point Steve was making, we get 

the 
first half of this year, and we will be exiting the year at a lower run rate 
than we entered.

Thank you
. Just wanted to get back to the chip margins here, I am 
calculating another decline in the gross margins on the QCT side after going 
up a little bit last quarter, just curious I know this is probably a mix effect 
there, but are we starting to see more pre
ssure from some of the larger tier
-
1 vendors impacting that gross margin and related to it from an absolute 

business. Just curious if you think we are bouncing along the bottom of an 
acceptable gross margin for QCT. Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

seeing a mix shift which obviously comes at a different margin. You are 
seeing the effect of concentration in the indus
try where clearly people have 
a stronger buying power the more concentrated the industry is. Kind of 

that those things we expect to be improving over time moving forward both 
from a mi
x perspective but also I mention some work that we are doing to 
improve product cost both at the supplier level as well as at the design level.

Yes, hi, guys thanks for taking my question, I just wanted to getting beat 
into that but I wanted to come back to the QCT chip margins and just trying 
to unde
rstand it feels like the high end shipments here in the end of the 
calendar you think your Q4, Q1 are probably lower than would have been 
anticipated and I just wanted to double check Steve that is in fact the case 


 
what 

 
is it part of the rea
son that the guidance in fiscal Q1 and 
maybe a little weaker than we would have anticipated. And I just wonder the 


orever or are 

issue at all in those chip margins.
 
Paul E. Jacobs
 
First of all, we still think that tier is growing. I think an important point we 

w. Relative to what we would have thought 
a couple of months ago or even more than a quarter ago, it's probably a 
little bit softer in some OEMs relative to what we would have thought. And 
that impacted the mix and I would say the concentration of more thi
n 
modem relative to some larger Snapdragon products or probably you are 
seeing in the mix as well.
 
Moving forward there are couple of things that we mentioned, but I think 
one of the more important ones is that we think the move to LTE in China is 
an impor
tant move for us. And I would say, if you look at our unit guidance 
for the year, our unit plan delivering on all of the operating metrics that we 
talked about, we are not really expecting a massive uptick in terms of unit 
volume. We will continue to have 
strong units, but I think the plan is pretty 
balanced there, I just comment on it.

Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I want to drill into the 

 
I guess the 

really a huge acceleration versus where we are today. And do you have LTE 
starting I guess sometime
 
second half of next year, how much of this is do 
you foresee is current I guess single
-
mode TD
-
SCDMA players who are 
making the migration from single
-
mode TD to multimode TD
-
SCDMA and 

 
you 
expect to see any of that in 2014. Is that more of a 2015 horizon or longer?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Stacy this is Steve. I think that we do consistent really even with prior year 
is, we tend not to take a very aggressive view on the beginning of launches. 
S
o we are assuming that we will see really some international OEMs move 
into the LTE market in China, more consistent with I would say a new up
-
tier 
product. Obviously new for us because we don't really get any volume today 
out of China Mobile even though i
t is the largest in the world. And we expect 
that transition down into the lower tiers at some point. But really our plan 

replacement for the tier that I think you asked about.
 
Now 
I want to be clear we are pushing through our chipset offerings, a 
tiered roadmap into the market, so that could happen. But we have always 
been a little bit cautious in terms of the front
-
end of any technology 
migration, but no, the real work is happening
 
right now. And you're going to 
see from us a multitiered strategy to push products worldwide in this 
technology.

Alex D. Gauna 

 
JMP Sec
urities LLC
 
Thanks very much for taking my question. Steve, I wanted to follow
-
up with 
exactly what can you tell us about plans from China Mobile in terms of the 
readiness of the network, when we will actually start getting deployments. 
And then I want to 

basing your view on mid
-
tier and high
-
tier growth, but you have also 
mentioned some of the entry levels in newer emerging SKUs being 
important. Can you reconcile those two statements as the low end or 
p
enetration to low end upside of your guidance, thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure, Alex, so on the China question it is difficult for me to talk about in the 
plans of any particular carrier 

 
in this case multiple carriers. I will say that 
we are 
engaged actively as our others to help the launch occur as quickly as 
we can. But I think the decision of when really falls upside of our hands. We 
are working with some lead OEMs to support the timing that I mentioned in 
my script, which essentially is th
e Chinese New Year timing. And that does 
seems consistent with the quality of the technical work that we see.
 
With respect to low
-
end and high
-
end I guess the point we want to make is, 
the number one, the high end continues to grow. We are doing well there
. 
We continue to expect that it will continue to grow and we will continue to 
have share position there. Now as a low
-
tier I think we are growing into that 
market as well as improving our cost structure into that market. However, 
the number of dollars per 
device is pretty different, than in the first category 
that I mentioned.
 
And as those mixes change it does impact our profitability and you are 

think we are pleased to consider our
selves to be strong in both areas. In the 
lower tier we tend to be lower in unit but probably higher in terms of gross 
margin dollars per unit than our competitors. And I think we are probably a 
little bit better positioned going into LTE than what we expe
ct to see from 
other people.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit 
Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Kulbinder S. Garcha 

 
Credit Suisse Securities LLC
 
Thanks for the questions. I just want to clarify one
 
thing Steve, sorry a 
couple of things. The first thing is just on the high
-
end of the business. If I 
just want to 

 
is what you are seeing that high
-
end demand in smartphones 
is 

 
the market is still growing unlike some people see it. But some of those 
hi
gh
-
end customers are just buying lower ASP devices so there is a mix shift 
within them. So that hurts your QCT level of profitability in the near term, 
but it doesn't impact Licensing, is that the right way of thinking of it? That's 
my first clarification.
 
Then the second thing is that, if there is this increased buying power in the 
high
-
end which is obvious has been there now for at least a year I would 
argue, what is it that is now causing them to exert this pressure on you and 
why isn't this a multi
-
quar
ter or even multi
-
year issue because frankly I 
don't think those high end vendors are going to lose share any time soon. I 
don't think anybody else thinks that either. So is there risk when we get to 

prove your mix in 
that segment of the business. But you have got this almost consistent 
pressure on QCT, so the day that QCT actually shows any leverage keeps 
getting pushed out. Can you just comment on those two that would be very 
helpful?
 
Steve Mollenkop
f
 

comments on the double
-
digit actually assume continued concentration in 
the industry, and one of the reason why we are comfortable in that beside 
growing the content in the devic
e as Paul mentioned as well as in some of 
the adjacent markets that we talked about. Is that we believe that our 
investments that we made over the last several years and we are going to 
continue to make in key areas are protecting us in this area.
 
Now one 
of things that happened over the last several years that has 

market and growing share. Now we are at a point where I think the business 
is very much at scale. We are continuing to gr
ow at the high
-
tier but now we 
are moderating I think the size of our investments to really show leverage in 
the business.
 
And you will start to see that I think more in the second half of the fiscal 
year as we work through this bubble that George mentione
d in terms of 

licensing. He probably can cover that better than I could.
 
Derek Aberle
 

and expect to see growth in
 
the high
-
tier. The high
-
tier actually has a pretty 
wide spread of selling prices, and so as Steve pointed out, there might be a 
situation where some of our, not the highest tier, but still a high
-
tier part are 
going into devices that still from a licensin
g perspective we would categorize 
as high
-
tier. And although, as the selling prices come down, we have things 
like caps that may cause a muted effect as some of the ASPs come down. So 
probably be some impact on licensing, but I would expect it to be less t
han 

 
George S. Davis
 
Kulbinde, this is George. Just want to add one other point. I think you would 
ask about the dependency on China LTE in the second half and I would just 
say that our actions on operating expenses, our a
ctions on product cost 
improvements, both in the supply chain and internally plus our view of 
where the part mix goes based on the launches, all those are factors that 
are not depended on that that help us in the second half of the year.

Thanks for taking my question, a couple of them. First, specifically on the 
Snapdragon 200, 
which I think was the first purpose built design lower in 
Snapdragon, where are you in terms of shipments related to that and is 
there more coming in terms of low
-
end designs or is that one design that 
could help the margins to flow in?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Su

That was a very successful product for us and continues to do well. I just 


ty pleased actually with the design traction 
in the lower part of the roadmap.
 
Today we have a couple of products, the AX10 and similar family that I think 
is doing a fairly good job in terms of design traction, particularly in 
international OEMs that are 
now looking at the growth in the China market 
as a growth area, particularly when they see the same concentration in 


 
Additionally, 

actually going to be in devices here soon, which is essentially a lower tier 
AP, but also a LTE solution as well. And we expect that to also be an 
important product, not only in China, but also
 
worldwide.
 

-
end versus what 
we have had historically and really refreshing that product line. In addition, 
we are working on an cost optimized architecture for the low

end, which we 
think in additi

structure down there as well.

Hi. Yes. Thank you. Sorry, it was on mute. This question is for Derek. The

that to drop there in September. Could you 
just give us a sense for 
directionally how you see that moving throughout fiscal 2014? Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hey, Mark, I was planning to give probably more color around that in New 

 
of 
the year, we thought our best guess at the outset was we would come in 
maybe a little under the 338 range or so. But we said at the time that that 
was based on our current outlook of the market and as you know the market 
grew significantly faster than 
we expected.
 
And also ASPs went up throughout the year and so couple of things that we 
noted was that, if those things came through, it would likely be bit of a drag 
on the rate, which is kind of where we ended the year, here about 327 
taking into account 
the last quarter. So I'm planning to go through kind of 
what we see in New York in a couple of weeks bearing in mind that there are 
so many factors that impact the rate that it is pretty hard to forecast that far 
out.

Yes. Thanks. Steve, MSM units at the midpoint look like they are up about 
6% in December, which is below the growth rate we saw i
n December of last

inventories? How your biggest customers are managing supply, and I guess 
tagged into that how do we think about seasonality for March?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Okay, I will star
t and maybe some of my colleagues can jump in as well. I 
think particularly comparing to last, last year I think was an exceptionally 
strong year. So I think comparing to last year is difficult to do. I think from 
two perspectives; one, as we were coming o
ff of a supply constrained 
environment. We also had I think some very strong product launches that 
also impacted that last year.
 
This year I think you are seeing a combination of a little bit weaker mix than 
what we typically see and then people trying to 
figure out how to deal with 

that little bit in our orders. The other thing I would caution too is that, these 
things can change now pretty radically in terms of how the smartphone
 
business works. So this is our best estimate right now. We expect to see, I 
think, good unit growth but these dynamics can change pretty rapidly.

the 28 nanometer works

Steve Mollenkopf
 
Hi. The answer is yes. I will say we are in a constant state of deciding which 
products
 
go to the next node and cost optimizing them. Also a lot of work 
even on, particularly in the low tier, how do we change the packaging to 
make it more appropriate for the low tier which is fairly different than what's 
in the high tier. So it is a constant
 
effort for us to do that. As you know we 
have multiple sources of supply and some of this suppliers are a bit more 
focused on the lower cost notes versus the high performance notes, and you 
will see some times CS move supply around consistent with those g

1/30/14,Qualcomm,"Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to 
report another strong quarter with record revenues as the demand for 
smartphones across an array of geographies and tiers continues to grow. 
Our product leadership and expanding set of 
industry partnerships position 
us to benefit from the strong secular trends in wireless. And as a 
consequence, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the 
fiscal year. It's been another very successful quarter for Qualcomm, there's 
a lot to be
 
excited about.
 
At the Mobile World Congress, we announced a variety of new industry
-
leading multi
-
mode modems and a new advanced micro
-
architecture for our 
Snapdragon family of processors, which we believe will continue to extend 
our power in performance 
leadership position in mobile computing. Our new 
architecture supports single
-
, dual
-
 
and quad
-
core processor
-
integrated 
solutions, as well as discrete application processor chipset, which will further 
expand addressable opportunity for our products. And a
s the first chipset 
provider for Windows Phone 7, we are pleased to see the announcement that 
Nokia would be adopting the Windows phone operating system and look 
forward to supporting that new collaboration.
 
Snapdragon family has been designed to help our 
customers efficiently 
support a range of device tiers and to speed time
-
to
-
market with features 
like software and hardware compatibility across chipsets. We're also pleased 
to be working closely with Microsoft on their announced plans to port the 
next vers
ion of Windows to ARM, further evidencing the accelerating 
convergence of mobility and computing.
 
On the Licensing front, I'm also pleased to report that we have resolved our 
dispute with Panasonic. We've now resolved the two disputes which had 
been impact
ing our ability to fully reflect the operational performance of 
QTL, and Derek will talk more about this later.
 
In terms of CDMA
-
based device
-
demand trends, the key drivers remain 
healthy and intact for the continued growth of our business. Demand for 
smar
tphones remains strong across multiple geographies around the world. 
According to Gartner, in the fourth quarter of 2010, sales of smartphones 
exceeded all PC shipments for the first time in history. And looking ahead, 
they're forecasting that sales of sma
rtphones will exceed 1 billion units in 
2015. Driven by an increased demand for smartphones around the world, 
wireless data traffic continues to accelerate.
 
According to Strategy Analytics, mobile data traffic more than doubled in 
2010. They're expected to
 
grow by 10x to 12x through 2015. To address the 
growth in wireless data, operators continue to make network investments in 
the latest radio technologies for both existing and new spectrum. According 
to the GSA, in the past year, commercial HSPA+ deploymen
ts rose 136%, 
and the number of LTE commitments grew to almost 200%, including the 
launch of 18 commercial LTE networks. According to CDG, there are now 13 
operators committed to launching EV
-
DO Rev. B networks. And the 
migration from 2G to 3G continues ar
ound the world with Wireless 
Intelligence reporting that at the end of March, there are approximately 1.3 
billion 3G subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago.
 
In developed regions, we continue to see strong transfer smartphone 
adoption.
 
According to CTIA research, as of the fourth quarter of 2010, the 
number of smartphones reported on North American carriers' network was 
approximately $78 million, representing a 57% increase from the year prior. 
Verizon Wireless recently launched the LTE

technology. And additionally in North America, we're beginning to see the 
influence of affordable smartphones in the prepaid segment as smartphone 
penetration rates ram
ped at Leap and MetroPCS. According to GfK, in key 
Western European countries, smartphones with high

level operating systems 
accounted for 74% of 3G phones sold in December 2010, up from 44% a 
year ago. And in Korea, since the beginning of this year, each 
operator has 
announced plans to introduce 20 or more new smartphone models.
 
With respect to Japan, we're of course saddened by the recent tragic events. 
But despite this disruption, we have received reports that wireless 
technology, combined with social ne
tworking services and an early 
earthquake warning system, played a critical role for communication and 
safety of the people in the affected regions. Preliminary indications are that 
demand has held up fairly well, similar to what we have seen in other past
 
events of this nature. So although there is some uncertainty, we do not 
foresee any significant impact on the overall demand profile for wireless 
devices.
 
Turning to China. China Telecom recently reached 100 million CDMA

And a couple of other items of note. We're pleased to announce the creation 
of the Qualcomm Foundation, the charitable 
organization which will focus on 
education, health services, sustainability and the arts. Qualcomm has a long 
history of philanthropy and service and the foundation is another way that 
we can give back to our communities around the world. And finally, we w
ill 
be hosting our second annual Uplinq conference on June 1 and 2. And as 
many of you know, Uplinq's unique in that it brings together developers, 
device manufacturers, mobile operators and technology providers to help

another great event and I look forward to seeing many of you there.
 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to Derek

Derek Aberle
 
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. We 
continue to see 
favorable industry trends that are driving growth in the Licensing business. 
These trends include solid unit shipments during the December quarter, 
positive handset ASP trends within both developed and emerging regions 
and growth in sales o
f incremental connected devices. These trends help 
drive record unit shipments and total reported device sales during the 
December quarter. Going forward, we expect to continue to see strength in 
handset ASPs in developed and emerging regions, driven by gr
owth in 
smartphones, including greater penetration into mid and lower tiers; a richer 
mix of devices in emerging regions such as China and India; and continued 
growth in tablet volumes.
 
Accordingly, as Bill will discuss, we are raising our fiscal 2011 ASP 
estimate 
range from $190 to $200 to $199 to $209. We also expect the volume and 
breadth of new connected devices to continue to grow. In addition to tablets 
and e
-
readers, we are encouraged to see the emergence of new connected 
device categories such as th
e recently
-
announced 3G
-
enabled Sony NGP 
gaming device.
 
As Paul mentioned, we are pleased to report that we have now resolved our 
dispute with Panasonic. As you may recall, the arbitration had been 
proceeding in phases. In the first phase, which was the on
ly phase that had 
been completed as of the time of the settlement, the arbitrator had rejected 
Panasonic's claims that Qualcomm breached the license agreement. We are 
pleased with the terms of the resolution, which reflect the established value 
of our pate
nt portfolio.
 
Over the last few months, we have now successfully resolved both disputes 
that had been impacting our ability to fully reflect the operating performance 
of QTL. Accordingly, our second fiscal quarter results include the recognition 
of revenue
 
attributable to these resolutions, including approximately $400 
million in revenue related to prior periods.
 
In closing, we are very pleased with the industry trends that are helping to 
drive our Licensing business, as well as the successful resolutions w
e have 
recently achieved. QTL continues to be well positioned for strong growth 
ahead in a very dynamic global wireless industry.
 
Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Steve Mollenkopf.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyo
ne. The QCT business 
executed well and very much in line with our expectations this quarter. We 
shipped approximately 118 million MSMs, just above the high end of our 
prior guidance, driven by strong demand for products across the chipset 
portfolio. As we 
forecasted previously, our results this quarter show a trend 
very similar to last year, with annual customer pricing resets and seasonal 
operating expense increases typical for this time of year. Consistent with this 
trend, both our average revenue per MSM
 
and our operating margins were 
down sequentially. But in absolute terms, our revenue and earnings before 
tax were well above the same period last year, with revenue up 28% and 
earnings up 21%.
 
The trends and requirements for OEMs to succeed in wireless ar
e aligning 
well with the strengths of our business, particularly in the areas where we 
continue to make significant investments. First, our platform approach is a 
strategic advantage for us and our broad chipset roadmap has helped us 
grow across multiple d
evice tiers. Second, the importance of integrated 
chipset solutions for our OEM partners is clearly accelerating due to the 
superior performance, lower power consumption and time
-
to
-
market 
advantages it delivers. Our 7000
-
 
and 8000
-
series chip shipments ar
e up 
70% in the first half of this fiscal year as compared to the last half of fiscal 
2010, growing faster than the Wireless Device segment and demonstrating 
that integration is the leading choice for mass
-
market and high
-
end 
smartphones.
 
The range of Snap
dragon devices continues to grow as well. Our customers 
announced the 100th Snapdragon power device this quarter, and the 
pipeline of devices and design has increased to approximately 200. We 
continued to expand our portfolio in the growing Tablet category
 
as well. 
There are now eight different Snapdragon power tablets announced from 
mobility and computing leaders like HTC, HP, Acer and ASUS with 
approximately 30 additional designs in process. Our LTE solutions lead the 
industry and continue to build moment
um. Our LTE chipsets power the HTC 
Thunderbolt, various USB dongles and newly launched LTE hotspots from 
Samsung and NovAtel, which also incorporate our wireless LAN products. 
We're also seeing many devices and design that are pairing our application 
proce
ssors and LTE technologies together, demonstrating that OEMs value a 
complete solution for processing and connectivity.
 
At Mobile World Congress, we announced eight new chipsets as we continue 
to quickly drive technology across our modems, application proc
essors, 
graphics and connectivity solutions. We expanded our overall leadership in 
3G and LTE multi
-
mode modems announcing several new chipsets that 
redefine performance at the high end and take the latest 3G and LTE 
technology to mass
-
market price points.
 
We also announced our next
-
generation mobile application processor architecture for the Snapdragon 
family, which will again redefine performance for the industry by delivering 
150% higher overall performance as well as 65% lower power than currently 
avail
able ARM
-
based CPU cores. This chipset architecture is based on 28
-
nanometer technology, which enables us to cost
-
effectively integrate LTE, 
3G, wireless LAN, Bluetooth, FM and GPS in single
-
, dual
-
 
or quad
-
core 
designs for smartphones and next
-
generation 
computing devices.
 
The first chipset in this next
-
generation Snapdragon architecture is our 
industry
-
leading multi
-
mode 3G, LTE, MSM8960 chipset, which is on track to 
sample this quarter. Our leadership in graphics and the strength of our 
gaming ecosystem 
continues to grow this quarter. We announced an 
agreement with SRS Labs, which allows us to bring HD and 3D audio to 
movies and games, as well as a strategic relationship with Gameloft to 
deliver an enhanced mobile gaming experience on Snapdragon devices f
or 
the top game titles. We now have over 100 HD and casual games optimized 
for our GPU and expect this number to continue to grow.
 
The year is progressing much as expected. As we commented on in the past 
two quarters, we expect to see an increase in the va
riety and tiering of 
smartphones, specifically a greater mix of mass
-
market smartphones. Our 
integrated solutions are well suited for these devices, and we continue to 
price in order to grow share in this environment.
 
With respect to our semiconductor supp
ly chain, we do not foresee any 
significant impact in our ability to supply product to our customers as a 
result of the recent events in Japan. Our scale and broad set of OEM 
customers provides us a unique perspective on industry trends and enables 
us to b
etter address short
-
term fluctuations in demand.
 
Finally, with respect to the Atheros acquisition, we met key milestones this 
quarter, including approval of the transaction by Atheros to shareholders, as 
well as the successful completion of Hart
-
Scott
-
Rodi
no review. We continue 
to expect the transaction to close this quarter subject to receiving one 
remaining foreign regulatory approval.
 
In summary, QCT executed well this quarter. Our solutions approach and 
focus on integration across the broad 
roadmap of chipset products has 
enabled us to grow across multiple product categories and price points, as 
well as expand our pipeline of design wins. These wins are across an 
increasing variety of device segments, OEM customers and regions, 
positioning us
 
to continue to grow share in this dynamic environment.
 
That concludes my comments. I will turn the call over to Bill Keitel.
 
William Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported record 
revenues of $3.9 billion and non
-
GAAP ear
nings per share of $0.86 for our 
fiscal second quarter. We are also pleased to be raising our revenue and 
earnings guidance for the fiscal year. Our better
-
than
-
expected results were 
driven by a number of positive items. Most importantly, our core licensin
g 
and chip businesses contributed strong results. 3G device sales grew 
significantly with total reported device sales up 18% sequentially and with 
an average selling price per device of approximately $200 to $206. QCT's 
118 million MSM chipset shipments we
re above the high end of our prior 
guidance.
 
During the second quarter, we resolved outstanding license disputes with 
Panasonic and another licensee, which we discussed during last quarter's 
earnings call. Since our non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 was
 
significantly higher than the $0.79 midpoint of our previous guidance, I 
thought it would be helpful to provide an earnings walk of the $0.07 increase 
in non
-
GAAP earnings per share. First, stronger non
-
GAAP earnings per 
share were not entirely driven by 
the dispute resolutions, although they did 
contribute approximately $0.06 and were driven primarily by the Panasonic 
license dispute resolution. Recall that our prior guidance took into account 
resolution of the other license dispute.
 
Second, we achieved a
 
further $0.06 of earnings improvement from our core 
operations, driven primarily by the strong demand for 3G devices and 
increased demand for our chipsets, as well as a bit stronger investment 
income.
 
Third, we restructured our Firethorn business during t
he second quarter and 
significantly reduced the run rate of its operating expenses. As a result of 
the restructuring and the reappraisal of the Firethorn business, we recorded 
impairment charges of approximately $120 million.
 
Fourth, we established a new Q
ualcomm charitable foundation, to which we 
made an initial $50 million contribution. The combination of the Firethorn 
impairment and charitable
-
giving decreased earnings per share by 
approximately $0.05.
 
Investors can find this earnings walk on our Investo
r Relations website. You 
can also find on the website an earnings walk from the year
-
ago quarter, 
and that earnings walk distinguishes the approximately $400 million in QTL 
revenues related to the prior periods that were recognized this quarter due 
to the 
resolution of licensee disputes.
 
Now turning to our updated financial guidance. We estimate that 
approximately 646 million to 663 million CDMA
-
based devices shipped 
during calendar 2010, an increase of approximately 29% year
-
over
-
year at 
the midpoint. We c
ontinue to see healthy growth in global 3G sales. And as 
you would expect, we are monitoring the events in Japan very closely. As 
you heard from Paul, we do not, at this time, see an impact on end 
consumer demand for CDMA
-
based wireless devices. It is wort
h noting that 
if not for the uncertainty of component supply from Japan for 3G device 
manufacturers, we would have an even greater upward bias in our calendar 
2011 CDMA
-
based device estimates, given improving trends on consumers 
upgrading their 3G devices.
 
As such, we are reaffirming our estimate of between 750 million and 800 
million CDMA
-
based device shipments in calendar 2011. Using the midpoint 
of our guidance, we estimate that in 2011, the number of CDMA
-
based 
devices will increase approximately 18% ye
ar
-
over
-
year. We now estimate 
the average selling price of CDMA
-
based devices for fiscal 2011 will be 
approximately $199 to $209. The $204 midpoint is above our prior year 
$195 midpoint estimate, driven by the trends that Derek mentioned earlier 
and a coup
le of dollars of favorable foreign exchange impact.
 
We now expect fiscal 2011 revenues to be in the range of approximately 
$14.1 billion to $14.7 billion, up approximately 31% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint. Of the approximate $500 million increase in our 
fiscal 2011 
revenue guidance range midpoint, approximately $200 million reflects 
additional QTL revenues attributable to our recently settled licensee 
disputes. Improved outlooks for QCT and QTL drove the remaining $300 
million increase. We anticipate non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the 
range of $3.05 to $3.13, up 26% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
In QCT, our operating margin estimate is consistent with our previous 
guidance for the range of 22% to 24% expected for fiscal 2011. We expect 
the combinat
ion of non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow 
approximately 15% to 16% year
-
over
-
year. Specific to the third quarter of 
fiscal 2011, we estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $3.35 
billion to $3.65 billion, up approximately 30% year
-
over
-
year
 
at the 
midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share for the third fiscal 
quarter to be approximately $0.68 to $0.72, up approximately 23% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device 
sale
s of approximately $35.5 billion to $38.5 billion in the June quarter for 
shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially, reflecting 
postholiday seasonality typical for this time of year. We anticipate shipments 
of approximately 115 million to
 
119 million MSM units during the June 
quarter, with revenue per MSM up a bit sequentially. And then we expect a 
greater mix of chipsets targeted for mass
-
market smartphones consistent 
with our prior expectations. We believe our visibility on fiscal third 
quarter 
chipsets, both supply and demand, is relatively quite good.
 
We estimate the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal year at the low 
end of the historical 15
-
 
to 20
-
week range consistent with our prior 
estimates. Our forecast anticipates a small
 
breed of channel inventory in the 
short term, which we expect to be replenished prior to the end of our fiscal 
year. We anticipate third fiscal quarter of non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A 
expenses combined will decrease sequentially approximately 7%.
 
That concludes 
my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren 
Kneeshaw.

And second question is on the application processor market share. While 
you're approaching 50% of the WCDMA market for baseband, what do you 
think your market share is in that processors and what do you think it's 
going to be six months to 
a year from now?
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Brian, we didn't hear the first question. Could you repeat that one please?
 
Brian Modoff

Deutsche Bank AG
 
Yes, the first question, sorry about that, was around Japan. Have any of 
your customers implied any 
--
 
it is difficult 
to procure parts out of Japan. 
Obviously, you guys don't have an issue, but have you heard anything from 
any of your customers.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure. This is Steve. Typical with these type of events, we have been 
communicated with from the 
customer. And some of them had indicated that 
they don't have the ability to ship, I think pretty consistent with what Bill 
said also on his view of the market. And I think we've reflected that in our 
guidance and our unit guidance as well. We are, of cour
se, building to a 
number that's larger than that, anticipating that they may be able to resolve 
those disputes, or the disputes with those supply chain constraints, as we 
would in this type of situation. I don't think it's a huge situation right now 
compar
ed to what people think about in terms of Japan. Your second 
question was about application processor share and other segments, I'm 
sorry, I didn't get all of it.
 
Brian Modoff 
-
 
Deutsche Bank AG
 
Yes, potentially you have about 50% of share or you're approa
ching 50% 
share of WCDMA baseband. What do you think your share of application 
processors is now and what do you think it will be in six months to a year?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Well, Brian it's pretty difficult to go with exact number just because they're 
so 
-
-
 
there are very different ways that people cut up the market share 
calculation. I would say this, we're very pleased with the trajectory of how 
things have gone particularly in the Application Processor business. If you 
look at where we were, let's say, i
n the 2007 timeframe, when we really 
started to start to ship our first 7000
-
based devices to where we are now, 
we've grown quite strong in terms of using that technology. As you are 
aware, we have been investing both in additional application processor 
ha
rdware designs but also into different software platforms, and that's really 
to enable us to continue to add new customers actually. So as things 
progress throughout the years, we are positive in terms of how things look 
for share in those areas. And I thi
nk that's really consistent with our view 
that the integrated approach is the one that will win long
-
term, particularly 
as a lot of the growth starts to happen in the more mass
-
market or the 
feature phone replacement tiers.

Steve, just following up on some of Brian's questions, could you update us 
on the competitive landscape that you're seeing on future modem 
technology such as HSPA+ and LTE? And as it relates to your relationship
 
with Nokia, how soon do you think one of your competitors could support 
Nokia's transition to Windows Phone 7? And then maybe just for Paul, given 
Qualcomm's early leadership position in LTE, how do you see the competitive 
environment? Do you think it wil
l be consolidation among your competitors 
and is that something you would look at also?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Mike, this is Steve. I'll take the first half of that. So as we have been saying, 
we really have thought of LTE, and really all of the modem transitio
ns, has 
been important to have a multi
-
mode solution, and that has been the case in 
our view with the transition into LTE. And as you're aware, we've been 
shipping LTE solutions, not only in the United States but also worldwide into 
Japan and across multip
le customers. We are seeing, I think, some strong 
traction not just in the data
-
centric devices now but forward
-
looking in our 
product portfolio that combines both our application processor and our 
modem solution. Just like with WCDMA, during the initial d
ays, there were a 
number of folks who worked on initial designs. But it was, I think, difficult to 
stay with the investment required in order to maintain really the feature 
roadmap that's required, I think, to deliver high
-
end modems. So we think 
that it'l
l probably play out in a similar way with this transition as well.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
In terms of consolidation, I'll echo what Steve was saying, we see different 
people coming at it, right? You have the in
-
house solution. We've seen some 
of those already not gai
n traction and people come to us to get support. You 
see some of the companies that started out, for example, WiMAX trying to 
make their way into LTE and some acquisitions and consolidation happened 
because of that. And obviously, it's not just LTE that's 
causing it, it's just the 
pace of operator rollout of new technology, whether it's HSPA+ or LTE or as 
we drive forward on the new technologies, supplemental downlink we've 
talked about, LTE Advanced. We're going to try and keep the pressure on 
keeping inve
stments going in those areas to make sure that we have a 
leadership position and just continue to force the competition to keep up and 
I do think that will create a more difficult dynamic for them and which will 
certainly can lead to consolidation or those
 
people sort of dropping out of the 
business.

Just two if I could. First, I just want to follow up on the $40 billion reported 
for the December quarter. I think the guidance was $
36.5 billion to $38.5 
billion. So should we take to mean that the underestimation by you was in 
ASPs and maybe related to that, tell us how we should think about, you said 
good visibility into chips, how we feel about visibility into the $35.5 billion to 
$
38.5 billion? And then, Bill, just a quick on, if you could just update us on 
what Panasonic means to that, the royalty rate numbers that you said we'd 
be at 3.4% to 3.5%, how much do that change that?
 
William Keitel
 
I'll take the TRDS, your first question
 
there, the $40 billion number. The 
ASPs did come in much stronger. Volume was healthy, but the upside, Tim, 
was, we think, was more so driven by stronger ASPs. The upgrade rate on 
the consumer end seems to be very, very strong, which if not for the Japan 
matter would 
--
 
that was a prime driver to what we're seeing behind higher 
consumer demand in that end market. But we thought it best to be cautious 
there given the Japan matter. So upgrades are going strong and that's 
showing through in strong ASPs. I don
't recall the second question.
 
Tim Long

BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
Well, related to that, the visibility into the $35.5 billion to $38.5 billion, and 
then just a quick one, the royalty rate?
 
William Keitel
 
Sorry Tim, what was your specific question on the 
royalty rate?
 
Tim Long

BMO Capital Markets U.S.
 
You had guided I think 3.4% to 3.5%. I'm wondering how the changes now 
that Panasonic is fully being recorded?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Yes. Again, I think we've cautioned a bit about the reliance upon the implied
 
rate, although we did talk a bit about it on the last call. The two data points, 
I think, we gave last call was with the resolution of the first licensee dispute, 
we expected the full year fiscal year to be in the range of 3.5%. And then we 
said exiting t
he year, we were expecting something in the range of 3.4% to 
3.5%. And I think now with the resolution of Panasonic, we would expect the 
full year implied rate to be a bit higher than the 3.5%. And I think although 
you have to remember that there's fluctua
tions quarter
-
over
-
quarter and a 
lot of moving pieces here, we're still comfortable sort of what the exit range 
of 3.4% to 3.5%.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Tim on your confidence question, our guidance for TRDS for fiscal Q3, our 
tier confidence is quite high. 
Obviously, the ASPs have trended higher, we've 
incorporated that into our estimates. Our licensees 
--
 
a lot of our licensees 
share their forecast with us, and so we're well aligned with them. Yes, we 
typically do see a seasonal decline at this time of the 
year, but other than 
that, I'd say our confidence is fairly high.

Steve, looking forward for the year for your business, after a strong quarter 
this quarter, you're guiding kind of fl
attish for June. How do you see the 
shape of the year developing as you move through the year? And how have 
you seen or expecting to see the broad ASP development? And if I might, 
also for Bill just to clarify from your guidance, of the $401 million of 
inc
remental revenue for the settlement, how much was included in the prior 
guidance for the quarter, if any, of that $401 million?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Tim, this is Steve. On the first question, we really see the year unfolding 
pretty much the way that we had sa
id all along since really November. And 
of course, we improved it a bit a couple of times here. But it's really 
unfolding pretty much the way that we have discussed. We think that right 
now, you'll continue to see the mix of mass
-
market smartphones probabl
y a 
bit stronger than the high tier devices that really dominated in the first half 
or the first quarter of the year. We will continue to, as you know, invest in 
the business because we believe this is a very, very important time in terms 
of where we can p
osition the business down the road. And Paul mentioned a 
number of very exciting things that are happening from new customer 
acquisition as well as the migration of, I think, the mainline computing to 
OSs that will enable us to really grow our market up in
to the computing 
space. So we'll continue to make those investments into the portfolio, and I 
think you'll see that continuing the results this year. But we still feel very 
good about how the year's unfolding and pretty much in line with as we 
discussed.
 
W
illiam Keitel
 
Tim, on the $400 million revenue question, again, those are revenues that 
we booked in the second quarter related to resolution of the licensee 
disputes. It's revenues specifically that apply to prior periods. Last quarter, 
at this time, when
 
we had just resolved one of the disputes, we had guided 
an expectation of about $250 million that we will report this quarter related 
to prior periods. So obviously, there's about $151 million increment now, 
now that we have the second licensee dispute re
solved. I would say, though, 
that although the $250 million estimate was reasonably accurate, it was not 
exact. And so it's not a pure split that you can take 
--
 
you can't just take 
$151 million assign it that to the new dispute and $250 million to the pri
or, 
but our prior guidance was in the range.

A couple of things as fast as I could. The guidance of shipments being 
relatively flattish, 118 million this quarter, and kind of as the o
ther guidance, 
115 million to 119 million for next quarter, sequentially. Historically, that's 
been up quarter in June and I know there are a lot of other extenuating 
circumstances going on right now. But can you just, Steve, kind of give a 
little backgrou
nd as to why you wouldn't expect to see shipments possibly 
going up from the March quarter into the June quarter? Could it be several 
--
 
I mean, are you looking at several one or more devices that you were 
shipping into that possibly may have been pushed o
ut a little bit, giving a 
little bit of caution in terms of what the shipment number is or just 
understanding that? And then on QTL operating margin, if you do normalize 
for the $400 million, for Derek and for Bill, you still got a QTL operating 
margin of 
87%, not the 90% posted but 87%, which is still the strongest, I 
calculated, you had in over two years. Should we be looking for as revenue 
continues to pile on top of QTL that we could be looking for higher operating 
margin just from pure leverage perspec
tive at this point? Or you think 87% 
is the right number or you think it kind of comes down from there?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Ehud, on the sequential shipments, I would say you probably answered it in 
your question to some degree. It is a little bit unusual ye
ar because of the 
events. Also, you should remember too that there's a pretty big transition 
happening in the industry as we move to smartphones and LTE and things, 
and those technology transitions also come along with some OEM juggling as 
well. And so it'
s probably a little bit less seasonal in terms of the March to 
the June quarter probably than what you've seen in the more established 
pattern. We probably saw a little bit, also, at the end of this quarter, where 
some customers were looking to get parts b
ecause of the events in Japan. 
That probably had a very small impact in terms of the audit of the numbers. 
I don't think it really had a great impact in terms of the financials, though.

So if we are to look at what this means 
for the following quarter, it sounds 
like it's more to do with the OEMs that you're selling into than the markets, 
then we shouldn't necessarily look at the market being flat in the June 
quarter that goes into your September revenues corresponding your chi
ps. It 
sounded like more of the particular OEMs that you're going into is more flat, 
not the market? You see I'm saying...
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
I'm sorry, what I was trying to say there is, there's really some transitions 
going on in the industry with LTE and
 
the smartphone transition happening 
in some of the other markets. So I'm not sure we're really trying to make a 
commentary on the broader market, outside of what Bill mentioned.
 
Ehud Gelblum

And QTL operating margin?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yes, thi
s is Derek. I'll take that one. I think as you said, if you normalize Q2 
for the past amounts, we're about 87% operating margin as compared 
around 84% from Q1. I think we do expect that the margin will be higher 
than the 84% run rate we had before. Whether
 
it will be probably the 87%, 
we'll have to see. You've got to remember the December quarter is 
historically a high quarter, because of the December sales drive a big 
number. So if revenue comes down a bit in Q3 and Q4, you would expect 
that to affect the 
margin a bit.

Just a couple of questions. The first one is on ASPs. Obviously, they're very 
strong in the royalty side of the business. For the chipset side, they're 
diverse a little bit and they were down 7% sequentially. So can you just 
comment on why the strength in the broader market is not directly 
transferable into the trends in the Chipset business? And in particular, is that 
a function more of mix versus pricin
g versus any other factor there? And 
then just the second question is on OpEx, which I think came in a little bit 
higher than you had guided, and it seems like that's pretty much flowing into 
the Chipset business. Can you just comment on what drove that ac
celerated 
investment in that area?
 
William Keitel
 
This is Bill. On the ASP, you're right, they have been very strong in the 
market, reflecting upgrades in the smartphones as we all know. It does 
diverge a bit in the chipset, and I think this is 
consistent with our strategy 
where we're pricing pretty aggressively this year to open up the broader 
market of smartphones to the mass market. And so yes, I think that 
divergence, we recognize it. I think it's conscious on our part to be driving 
some of t
hat divergence. On the OpEx side, we did come in a bit higher. If 
you put aside the starting of the charitable foundation, it did come in a bit 
higher. We're expecting it a bit higher for the year putting that aside as well. 
With the increased revenues, th
ere is a small amount of our operating 
expenses that tend to be variable with the revenues, but nothing I would 
regard as a significant change.

A couple of questions from me. Fir
st, Steve, for you, on QCT margins, you've 
kept the margin target for the year unchanged 22% to 24%. If you just take 
a look at the first two quarters, that implies that for the next two remaining 
in the fiscal year, you're looking at essentially flat marg
ins. Can you give us 
a little bit more of the dynamics why is that the case, why margins shouldn't 
improve at least somewhat sequentially into the next two quarters, which, I 
don't know, it just seems a little bit unreasonable. And second, for Bill, your 
p
rofits from your portfolio, it looks like $100 million, about $100 million this 
quarter. Can you give us an estimate at this point of what is the balance of 
your unrealized gains in your portfolio at this point and sort of what is the 
pace by which you thi
nk we'll see them flowing through your P&L going 
forward?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Ittai, it's Steve. Yes, we did not change the guidance in terms of operating 
margin for QCT for the year. There's been some change, but I don't think 
enough to really bump us into 
another range. Pretty much the same as 
we've said consistently the entire year. We really expect that the mix of 
more mass
-
market smartphones tend to be the dominant shipments here 
throughout the year as some of these migrations occur. And really, the 
feat
ure phone gets converted into the smartphone, which we think really 
plays into our advantages in terms of integration. We want to take 
advantage of that. That enables us, I think, to really grow our position in 
some of these new accounts, and both up and d
own. When some of the 
things that we talked about in terms of these new customers and LTE and 
some of the higher tier products tend to become a little bit more as a higher 
percentage of a mix, we think that will change, but I just don't think that's 
going 
to happen in the existing fiscal year.
 
William Keitel
 
Ittai, on the investment portfolio, there's about a 5% net unrealized gain on 
the portfolio. So just a little more of $1 billion unrealized net gain. Looking 
forward on that, the bulk of that gain resid
es in fixed income instruments 
managed by select people that we utilize. And it's really 
--
 
it's going to be a 
function of what they see their opportunities to either capture or transition 
their fixed income investments. So it's pretty much in their hands.
 
Other 
than that, I think as you know, on a forward
-
guidance basis, we only include 
a forecast of realized gains to the extent we're highly confident that they're 
going to happen. For this quarter, we did include 
--
 
in our guidance, there is 
an amount of t
hat. That going forward, it's kind of just we'll have to see how 
it goes as to what might the incremental above that.

I just want to put a couple of things together that have been asked befor
e 
with regards to the QCT business. So The unit volumes that you're 
forecasting are pretty flat for Q3. And yet, you guys have taken this big hit 
on margins. I think the strategy was to try to reduce margins in order to 
pump up the unit volume and get acce
ss to this rapidly growing market, 
particularly the lower
-
priced smartphones. But it doesn't 
--
 
if we just take 
the data you presented us with, it doesn't feel like that strategy is working. 
So I guess one of two think are going to happen, either Q4 we're 
going to 
see a very rapid ramp of unit volumes on QCT, which will make up for the 
difference or this pricing strategy is not working, maybe pricing is more 
aggressive out there from competitors than you guys had expected or 
something else is going on? So I
 
just wonder if you guys could just talk 
through what is going on with chip pricing out there? Are people more 
aggressive than you expected? Or do you think that everything's on track 
and we ought to see some payback for the reduced margins the next couple
 
of quarters?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure, Rod, this is Steve. So in general, I'd say, really, the year and the 
pricing environment and, really, the mix in the market is playing out pretty 
much the way that we had thought. And if you look at, I think, what's 
ha
ppening for us, we really feel like the strategy is working. It's enabling us 
to maintain or grow share through the market as the 
--
 
as really there's 
been a pretty big mix in terms of which OEMs are shipping and then across 
different tiers. And we really 
consider the game now has moved from 
providing one or two chipsets to providing a portfolio of chipsets on the 
smartphone side. And in some quarters, I think you'll see a bigger mix of 
emerging market or mass
-
market smartphones. In some quarters, you'll 
st
art to see more developed market or higher
-
end smartphones depending 
on what happens in a particular area. And you've seen both of those type of 
quarters, I think, in our results. And I think if you just look at it over a 
longer period of time, not just on
e quarter, I would hope that you would 
come to the same conclusion. But we definitely feel pretty good about how 
the strategy is playing out. It's also enabling us to acquire new customers, 
which we think also will pay dividends down the road as well.

environment pretty much in line with what we

First question, this is for you, Steve. One of your competitors or your 
potential competitor is very a
ggressive on lead [indiscernible] transition. So 
one thing, what your plans are there now that you are shipping 
--
 
I mean, 
sampling 28
-
nanometer. And are you guys working on any 22
-
nanometer 
products? And the second question is for Derek, any interesting N
ortel LTE 
portfolio? And lastly, any update on mirasol?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure, I'll take the first question. You got broken up a little bit, but I think the 
question was about our technology or node transition. And so we feel 
actually very confident in wh
at we're getting from our fabless suppliers in 
terms of technology at the transistor level. As I'm sure you are aware, we 
actually feel that we're in the front in terms of the 28
-
nanometer transition. 
I should make sure everyone's aware, though, that we ha
ve the option to 
select, even today and in the past, a more higher performing transistor if we 
need to. But we actually don't because we think that our combination of our 
mobile platforms or our mobile
-
centric solutions require a particular type of 
transis
tor that is a little bit different match between performance and power. 
And so we actually have the ability, even within the nodes that we're in 
today, to select a more powerful transistor and we don't, because we think 
we have the right trade
-
off. So we f
eel very comfortable on that. Now, of 
course, we are pushing very hard to continue to keep the fabless 
semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers moving along the node 
transition. And I would say over the last two years, the environment, with 
the addition o
f Samsung and Global Foundries to the fabless world, really 
created I think much more investment in that area. And we feel probably 
more comfortable about where we sit today than where we sat two years 
ago because of that addition. So we're getting good se
rvice, we think, from 
our fabless foundry partners and we continue to move forward with the 
system approach.
 
Derek Aberle
 
This is Derek. I think you had a question about the Nortel portfolio. As you 
know, I think we believe we have an extremely strong and 
valuable LTE 
portfolio and obviously WCDMA portfolio of our own, which has been 
validated through the agreements we've already signed. And, we really just 
don't see the need for sort of the increment that with something like the 
Nortel portfolio. And we ha
ve taken a look at it and I think certainly at the 
price points, that it looks like it's going to sell forward, it's really not of 
interest to us at this point.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
In terms of mirasol, this is Paul, we're in the process of building the fab 
shell 
in Taiwan right now and have first phase of tools on order. There is some 
impact of the situation in Japan on the ability of the tool suppliers to supply. 
That pushed out some of the investment that we thought would fall into this 
fiscal year into th
e next fiscal year. In terms of the displays and sales, we're 
continuing to work with customers on launch devices. The key for us is to 
ensure that we and our customers bring out a very solid e
-
reader device to 
market when we launched that. And as we've sa
id before, the volumes are 
going to be quite small until the new fab gets online. So really, the first 
products are in some sense almost a beta for us to get the manufacturing 
processes going. And then we'd expect to see that ramp up significantly with 
the
 
new fab.

play out in the market, how that will be received

up, since you have now worked with so many

ing that there's less customization required, 
so it becomes more an easy plug

and

play as you work with more and more

Steven Mollenkopf
 
It's a good question. I think every OEM is unique in terms of what they go 
after and what they value. So it's h
ard to say. They all have different 
strategies and require, in some cases, different approaches. But in all cases, 
I think they value a scale that we can bring to the business, and that seems 
to be one of the things that the execution that we've been able 
to build 
together across multiple years has been beneficial. But I don't expect it to be 
any different here with this account. You should know too that we have been

Just wanted to ask a couple of clarifying questions. First, for you, Steve, 
you 
indicated that part of the reason why we're seeing flat sequential chipset 
shipment forecast for the June quarter was due to a little bit different 
seasonality of your customers and basically development of the global 
market. But you also seem to indic
ate that there was maybe some of your 
customers weren't able to take as many chips as they maybe would like 
right now because of supply
-
chain issues that they're having outside of your 
own. And so I'm just trying to understand maybe what the individual 
con
tribution of those two elements are if I'm understanding this correctly? 
And then maybe for you, Bill, in terms of the better ASP forecast for fiscal 
2011, or I'm sorry, for calendar 2011, how much of that is due to better
-
than
-
expected upgrade activity, s
ay, in developed markets versus the 
pricing environment and what consumers are willing to pay in the developing 
markets where you're seeing 3G handset buys for the first time?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
James, on the first question, it's pretty hard to break apart 
the different 
items. I think what I was trying to say in my comments is that you should 
--
 
this year is a little bit different than I think other years just due to a number 
of different changes that are happening as everyone is trying to migrate 
their busi
nesses through the feature phone, the smartphone transition. Then 
on top of that, you have transition to LTE depending on what their product 
strategy. Then you have the events in Japan. So it's not inconsistent with 
that to see some units move around from 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter. And so we 
don't 
--
 
I think it will be difficult for me to break them out. I think the one 
trend, though, that does tie them together to some degree is that we are 
seeing that broad demand across the portfolio and across different OEMs. 
It's just a barrier there. I think if you play it back for several years, it's hard 
to find a pattern.
 
William Keitel
 
And James on the ASP increase we're expecting for this year, it's very broad 
across all the geographies we track, both developing regions 
and developed. 
In fact, in the developing area, the percentage increase that we're seeing in 
the ASP is much more significant relative to developed world because you 
might imagine that you're coming off of a somewhat a voice
-
centric low 
data
-
centric focus 
now into a smartphone and say a DO
-
Rev. A and HSDPA 
or UPA capability. And so the percentage increase on the ASP is pretty 
substantial in the developing markets. But I think the key point is that we're 
seeing it broadly across all the regions we track.

Can you just explain why you're better positioned on the Microsoft platform 
than competitors and what some of those barriers to those competitors 
being able to supply int
o the Microsoft platform are so we understand your 
competitor dynamics?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure, I think there are really two key elements. This is Steve. The first one 
is, obviously, first mover advantage, which is we've been working with 
Microsoft for some time. They have, as I'm sure you're aware, really limited 
the number of silicon partners
 
that they worked on with Windows Phone 7 in 
order to make sure that they had a very consistent and well
-
tailored 
software experience to the hardware that we could provide. So you have 
that number one. The second part that I think we're probably better 
pos
itioned than other folks is we have a bit of a broader technology portfolio, 
and that means really two things to the OEM. The first thing is it means that 
they can deliver products across multiple tiers or different price points with 
the same or at least a
 
very leveraged investment. The other thing that we 
have I think that's a bit unique is the ability to support CDMA, LTE and 
WCDMA ecosystems, either separately or in the same device. And so that 
those advantages really open up multiple markets with one in
vestment, and 
it's really 
--
 
it's a statement of scale. So we think that, in this account, is a 
very key thing. And by the way, that's something that we use in many 
different accounts in order to grow our place there. So we think we're pretty 
well position
ed there. But as I always tell the team internally, you have to 
earn it every day, so we have to go through the launches and make sure 
that we keep ourselves and our customers in the lead.

And then just a quick foll
ow
-
up. Can you remind us about your sort of new 
commitment to the merchant ship suppliers, some of these non
-
cellular 
markets? And as you think abut integrating Atheros, sort of maybe what end 
markets or products might be most interesting for you to pursue
 
besides the 
obvious Atheros businesses?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure. So as we said some on earlier calls, as the market moves and the 2G 
to 3G migration happens in some of the other geographies that are served in 
markets where the operator may not be as strong
, as typically is the case, 
whether there's not an OEM or a strong OEM channel, it requires us to 
evolve our business model a bit and to line up more partners who can help 
us deliver chipsets into those geographies. So we have evolved our product 
portfolio
 
to provide a bit more of a reference design through partners. So 
that's continuing to progress well. We are I think timing the entry into those 
markets the same time the 2G, 3G transition is occurring, as well as the 
migration of the mass
-
market smartphon
es. But it's not a big portion of the 
business yet, that particular delivery of solutions.
 
Paul Jacobs
 
Let me just add. This is Paul. The Atheros acquisition really lays the 
groundwork for us as we look forward to machine
-
to
-
machine world, which 
people cal
l a thousand radios per person or the Internet of things were all 
these ideas. But fundamentally, the idea is that wireless is going to be an 
enabling technology into a lot of industries, into a lot of devices, whether its 
Smart Grid, and radios embedded i
nto lighting and HVAC and thermostats 
and these kinds of things or healthcare or obviously the consumer 
electronics businesses, the network businesses that Atheros is in right now. 
But this is early days for machine
-
to
-
machine. It's got a lot of hype aroun
d 
it. We're well positioned because, in fact, Qualcomm started out as a 
machine
-
to
-
machine company with our OmniTracks business way back 
when. But we just 
--
 
we see this as a trend going forward. We see it as a 
significant growth opportunity going forward 
and we wanted to make sure 
that we were well positioned from the very start of this opportunity.

with growth and good mix and new customers, QTL with growth al
so. And 
getting some of these disputes behind us certainly makes us feel good. The 
world's clearly coming our direction. The investments that we've made in the 
past, I think, are paying off well with smartphones and significant data 
demand, changes in mobi
le computing. And we talked about a number of 
growth drivers at the meeting we had in New York, 2G to 3G continuing to 
go strong. Obviously, smartphones, we've talked about. Emerging markets, 
we're very, very happy with what we're seeing in terms of new te
chnologies 
going into the emerging markets, allowing those markets to bridge the 
digital divide and really leapfrog. Lots of excitement around new devices. 
Obviously, tablets are the ones that capture the most attention but we 
talked abut a number of other
s. And then just as data demand driving the 
advanced technologies out there, so making our leadership position with the 
R&D that we do and the expertise we have on the radio side, be that much 
more valuable. And of course, we're now becoming experts in a l
ot of other 
areas because the phone is getting so much capability built into it. So we 
continue to see significant opportunities to innovate and lead and be a great 
partner to new customers and, of course, a great partner to our existing 
customers. So than
ks very much for joining us.

11/7/13,Qualcomm,"Thanks, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm happy to report that 
Qualcomm delivered very strong results again this quarter in addition to 
successfully completing the acquisition of Atheros. Our business performed 
well across all key guidance 
metrics. We're off to a strong start with Atheros.
 
During this quarter, we sampled our Snapdragon MSM 8960 chipset based 
on 28
-
nanometer process technology. The MSM 8960 is a dual
-
core solution 
which uses our next
-
generation micro
-
architecture called Krait
 
with 
integrated multimode modem technology, including EV
-
DO, Dual
-
Carrier 
HSPA+ and both the TDD and FDD variances LTE.
 
As we've said in the past, only one of our licensees WCDMA subscriber unit 
royalty obligations would expire, if not extended, prior to 
late 2017. I'm 
pleased to report that we have now successfully completed this remaining 
renewal. The Licensing business continues to be well positioned for strong 
growth ahead and this latest renewal again demonstrates the established 
value to the industry
 
of Qualcomm's patented inventions.
 
In June, we hosted our second annual Uplinq conference here in San Diego. 
The event was a success as it brought together industry leaders from across 
the ecosystem, including application developers, operators and device 
manufacturers. Our support of multiple operating systems is highlighted by 
keynote presentations delivered by HP, HTC and Nokia. The convergence of 
the mobile and computing ecosystem is accelerating as smartphones and 
tablets are becoming full
-
blown comput
ing devices. Traditional computing 
device manufacturers are working on mobile devices, and developers are 
increasing their emphasis on mobile. According to Strategy Analytics, by 
2012, the installed base of smartphones is estimated to exceed the installed 
base of PCs. Our collaboration with Microsoft to enable Windows 8 to run on 
our Snapdragon family of chipsets, including MSM 8960, further underscores 
a shift in computing.
 
The migration from 2G to 3G continues as well, with Wireless Intelligence 
reporting
 
that at the end of June, there were approximately 1.4 billion 3G 
subscriptions globally, up approximately 30% from a year ago. And Wireless 
Intelligence predicts that by the fourth quarter of this year, 3G will be 
contributing greater than 50% of net subs
criber addition.
 
Driven by the increased demand for 3G and data
-
capable devices, wireless 
data traffic continues to accelerate. Operators continue to make network 
investments in the latest radio technologies for both existing and new 
spectrum. According to
 
the GSA, the number of operators that have 
commercially launched HSPA+ now totals 136. 39 of these operators have 
commercially launched Dual
-
Carrier HSPA+, a 70% increase in the last 3 
months. Additionally, there are now 218 operators that are investing i
n LTE, 
including 24 networks which have commercially launched.
 
According to the CDG, there are currently 7 commercial EV
-
DO Rev. B 
networks with an additional 11 operators planning to launch or trial the 
technology. CDMA device trends are healthy and deman
d for smartphones 
remain strong across multiple geographies around the world. According to 
Gartner, global smartphone sales exceeded 100 million devices in the first 
quarter of 2011, representing 85% year
-
over
-
year growth. Also, Google 
recently announced t
hat more than 550,000 Android devices are activated 
every day, up from 100,000 activations per day in May of last year.
 
In developed regions, we continue to see strong trends for smartphone 
adoption. According to Gartner, sales of smartphones in North Amer
ica are 
expected to increase by approximately 41% from 2010 to 2011 and 
smartphone sales are expected to exceed 50% of the total handsets sold this 
year. In Europe, smartphones continue to expand into more affordable price 
tiers. Recently in the U.K., the 
Vodafone smart and the LG ego feature 
phone were both operated 
--
 
both offered at GBP 75 as pay
-
as
-
you
-
go 
devices, further blurring the lines between the pricing of smart and feature 
phones.
 
Additionally, operators such as SFR, Orange and Mobistar in Belgi
um have 
each launched bundled data plans in which a second device can be added to 
an existing data plan as a means of increasing their wireless data subscriber 
base. We see positive trends in developing regions as well. I attended a 
CDMA industry summit an
d handset fair hosted by China Telecom in 
Guangzhou last month that attracted more than 11,000 attendees. 
According to press reports from the event, more than 50 EV
-
DO phones 
were announced by 20
-
plus manufacturers. It was also reported that China 
Telecom 
highlighted that 3G EV
-
DO handset sales are expected to reach 29 
million units this year, increasing by 190% over 2010.
 
In May, China Unicom launched 21 megabit per second HSPA+ service 56 
major cities. And in June, according to Sino MR [ph] data, the ZTE 
Blade, 
based on our 7,000 series chipset, set a daily sales record by a Chinese OEM 
and has become the second
-
highest selling 3G smartphone on Unicom's 
network. Earlier this week, I attended a China Unicom partner event in 
which China Unicom announced 15 n
ew 3G devices, of which 13 were based 
on our chipset.
 
In India, 3G networks have now been live more than 6 months and 
operators are making plans to increase 3G coverage from over 100 cities 
today to over 1,000 towns by the end of the year. 3G devices in In
dia is also 
expected to meet new levels of affordability with HSPA+ devices, such as the 
Spice G
-
6550 being offered at under $90. At the higher end, 21 
smartphones have been launched to date based on Snapdragon, including 
the HTC sensation based on our dua
l
-
core solution, so is the first 
Snapdragon
-
based tablet in India, the HTC Flyer.
 
So to conclude, while we've continued to execute on our strategic priorities, 
we've seen our opportunities expand at an even greater rate than we have 
previously expected. An
d accordingly, we're pleased to be raising our 
revenue and non
-
GAAP earnings guidance for the fiscal year driven by 
strong global smartphone adoption, as well as the addition of Atheros.
 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call over to Steve 
M
ollenkopf
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Our QCT business executed 
very well again this quarter. We shipped a record 120 million MSMs above 
our prior guidance range, reflecting strong demand for our integrated 7xxx 
and 
8xxx series chipsets which were up 32% over last quarter. Our supply 
chain responded very well to the events in Japan, fulfilling all customer 
orders during the quarter, including a small amount of unexpected buffer 
demand, which we forecast will be worked
 
off in the September quarter.
 
We also completed our acquisition of Atheros and the integration into QCT is 
progressing well. The team is executing according to its roadmap having 
already announced 3 new connectivity products and we are excited to 
welcome 
Craig and the entire Atheros team to Qualcomm.
 
Our average revenue per MSM in the third fiscal quarter was higher 
sequentially as expected, reflecting a richer mix of integrated smartphone 
chipsets, as well as approximately 5 weeks of Atheros revenues post
 
acquisition close. QCT operating margins were in line with expectations. We 
continue to make significant investments in modem technology, application 
processing, connectivity, graphics and software.
 
Our leadership position in combining these technologies 
into a platform of 
integrated tiered chipset solutions is unmatched in our industry and aligns 
with both industry trends and the business priorities and device 
requirements of our OEM partners.
 
We also continue to expand our support of multiple operating s
ystems with 
the launch of the latest version of webOS, as well as BlackBerry 7. Customer 
traction for our first dual
-
core Snapdragon chipsets, the MSM8660 dual
-
core 
platform, continues to grow, and there are now more than 100 designs in 
development based o
n that platform in addition to 6 smartphones and 4 
tablets previously announced or commercially available.
 
Dual
-
core devices this quarter include the HTC Sensation, the HTC EVO 3D, 
Pantech Vega Racer, T
-
Mobile myTouch 4G and HP TouchPad. Including both 
sin
gle core and dual
-
core chipsets, our partners have now announced a total 
of 10 different Snapdragon
-
powered tablets and there are another 40 tablet 
designs in process. Our multimode 3G LTE solutions continue to lead the 
industry with several USB dongles an
d mobile router data devices based on 
our multimode 3G LTE chipsets launching this quarter. The complexity of 
supporting 2G, 3G and 4G standards across the proliferation of over 40 RF 
bands also plays well with our system
-
level approach to integration and 
we 
are unique in our ability to support all these requirements.
 
As Paul mentioned, we sampled the Snapdragon MSM 8960 ahead of 
schedule this quarter, which is the industry's first multimode 3G LTE dual 
core chipset for handsets. This is the first of multip
le 28
-
nanometer chipsets 
on our roadmap and it is designed to integrate seamlessly with our new 
connectivity solution, the WCN3660, which supports dual band WiFi, 
Bluetooth and FM and is optimized for smartphone and tablet devices. As we 
announced at Compu
tex, the MSM 8960 will be the first processor in the 
Snapdragon family to power devices using Windows 8.
 
The MSM 8960 and a broad platform of multimode 3G LTE chipsets on our 
roadmap will greatly expand the reach of LTE and take our high
-
performance 
high
-
e
fficiency designs to the next wave of smartphones, tablets and 
upcoming generations of Windows computing devices.
 
Demonstrating our potential expanded opportunities that the Atheros 
acquisition provides, since the deal closed in May, we have launched the 
i
ndustry's first FTC
-
certified WiFi system and package for microcontroller
-
based designs to enable machine
-
to
-
machine communications and 
introduced the industry's lowest EPON solutions for broadband over fiber 
networks and the power grid.
 
We continue to lev
erage the strong distribution channels and product 
portfolio that Atheros developed over the past decade. Specific to wireless 
LAN, the adoption of 11n and across all channels continues with 11n now 
making up over 70% of this revenue.
 
Sales to our PC OEMs 
increased significantly due to a strong adoption of our 
combination wireless LAN and Bluetooth products. Overall, we are excited 
about the platform and the business opportunities in front of us.
 
This year continues to progress much as we expected back in N
ovember. We 
are modestly increasing our R&D investments in the fiscal fourth quarter to 
support new process technologies, the commercialization of our expanding 
multi
-
core and LTE product offerings and to support multiple new customer 
opportunities. Our st
rategic focus on integrated system solutions, leveraging 
our modem application processor connectivity graphics and software 
leadership is working well, and we expect to see strong volume growth in 
the coming quarters.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now
 
turn the call over to Bill Keitel.
 
William Keitel
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported strong 
financial results for our third fiscal quarter, and we are pleased to be raising 
our fiscal 2011 revenue and non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share guidance.
 
Given the size of the Atheros transaction and consistent with prevailing tech 
industry practice, we modified our non
-
GAAP reporting methodology. 
Starting with acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we 
are s
upplementing our non
-
GAAP reporting by excluding the step
-
up of 
inventories to fair value and amortization of certain intangible assets.
 
Fiscal third quarter revenues were $3.6 billion, which was at the high
-
end of 
our prior guidance range. Atheros contrib
uted less than $100 million, 
reflecting approximately 5 weeks activity since the acquisition closed in late 
May. Non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $0.73 for the quarter including 
approximately $0.50 attributable to Atheros exceeding the high end of our 
prio
r guidance range. Our fiscal third quarter non
-
GAAP earnings per share 
were $0.03 better than the $0.70 midpoint of our prior guidance. Both QTL 
and QCT each added approximately $0.01 per share and investment income 
in Atheros each contributed approximatel
y $0.50 per share.
 
We estimate that approximately 170 million to 174 million CDMA
-
based 
devices were shipped by our licensees in the March quarter at an average 
selling price of $209 to $215, up approximately $9 sequentially, primarily 
due to increasing sa
les of smartphones. We are seeing handset strength, 
handset ASP strength across both emerging and developed markets as well 
as increasing breadth of other connected devices such as tablets and e
-
readers. Our total cash position remains strong at approximat
ely $20 billion 
despite using $3.1 billion of net cash to acquire Atheros.
 
Now turning to our guidance. We are reaffirming our estimate of between 
$750 million and $800 million CDMA
-
based device shipments in calendar 
2011, up approximately 18% year
-
over
-
ye
ar at the midpoint. We now 
estimate that the average selling price of CDMA
-
based devices for fiscal 
2011 will be approximately $204 to $210 per unit. The $207 midpoint is $3 
above our prior $204 midpoint estimate, primarily driven by greater 
adoption of hi
gher
-
priced devices such as smartphones around the world.
 
We are raising our fiscal 2011 revenue and non
-
GAAP earnings per share 
guidance, reflecting higher average selling prices for CDMA
-
based devices 
and the addition of the Atheros business. We expect f
iscal 2011 revenues to 
be in the range of approximately $14.7 billion to $15 billion, up 
approximately 35% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint, which includes 
approximately $350 million from Atheros.
 
We anticipate fiscal 2011 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be i
n the range of 
$3.15 to $3.20, up 29% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. Of the approximate 
$0.09 non
-
GAAP earnings per share increase over our prior fiscal 2011 
guidance range midpoint, approximately $0.06 reflects an improved outlook 
for QTL. Approximately 
$0.02 is related to Atheros and approximately $0.01 
is the net benefit from greater investment income and modestly greater R&D 
expense.
 
We expect the combination of non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to grow 
approximately 20% to 21% year
-
over
-
year. As Steve Mol
lenkopf mentioned, 
we expect a modest increase in QCT R&D investment primarily related to 
new chipset and customer opportunities.
 
In QCT, operating margins are largely consistent with our prior expectations. 
Excluding Atheros, we expect operating margins t
o be in line with our prior 
guidance range of 22% to 24% for fiscal 2011. Including Atheros, we expect 
operating margins to be towards the low end of that range for the fiscal 
year.
 
Specific to the fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues including Athe
ros 
to be in the range of approximately $3.86 billion to $4.16 billion, up 
approximately 36% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share to be approximately $0.75 to $0.80, up approximately 
14% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We
 
estimate that our subscriber licensees will report total reported device 
sales of approximately $38 billion to $41 billion in the September quarter for 
shipments they made in the June quarter, up approximately 9% sequentially 
and approximately 40% year
-
ov
er
-
year at the midpoint. We anticipate 
shipments of approximately 120 million to 125 million MSM units during the 
September quarter with revenue per MSM up sequentially driven by the 
inclusion of a full quarter of Atheros revenue and the particular mix of 
chipset products we expect to ship.
 
We estimate that the CDMA inventory channel declined a bit in the June 
quarter, consistent with our prior expectations. For the September quarter, 
our forecast anticipates an additional small bleed of channel inventory a
nd 
we continue to estimate that the CDMA inventory channel will exit the fiscal 
year at or slightly below the low end of the historical 15
-
 
to 20
-
week range.
 
We anticipate fourth fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses 
combined will increase sequenti
ally, approximately 9%, reflecting Atheros 
and the increased QCT R&D investments we've previously mentioned.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren 
Kneeshaw.

Bill, just want to follow up on your updated guidance. Could you walk us 
through t
he QTL change again? I understand the better ASPs due to 
increasing smartphone mix. But with the units a little light this quarter, 
maybe you can walk us through where you see strength in the out
-
quarters 
to keep your full year unit guidance?
 
William Keite
l
 
Mike, I'll give you a little bit more color first on the ASP. We are anticipating 
that $9 sequential average increase, we think about $6 of that is largely 
greater Asia and North America, higher average selling price and about $3 of 
foreign exchange. On 
the unit side, we are anticipating a fairly significant 
uptick going out of this fiscal year and into the first quarter of the calendar 
year. We held our estimates for the year constant at that 750 to 800 million 
units for the calendar year. Specifically, 
I mean we actually had a debate on 
whether we should raise it a bit. But given some of the economic malaise in 
the world, we thought best to hold it steady there. But we are seeing some 
good strength in a number of markets. So we feel pretty good about tha
t 
forecast and do expect an uptick going into the first part of the fiscal year, 
the new fiscal year.

Tal Liani from Bank of America, please go ahead with your question.
 
Unknown Analyst

This is Er Ginai [ph] for Tal. Just a question. If you do t
he math on any small 
number of butts [ph] based on your MSM chipsets and your MSM ASPs, you 
get to $2.196 billion. Just curious how do you include Atheros in there. 
Similarly for the guidance, you said $300 million, $350 million for the full 
year implying 
somewhere in the neighborhood of $270 million to $280 
million for those. Just give a sense on how do we include or exclude that 
from the QCT number.
 
William Keitel
 
Sure. I wouldn't exclude it. We're giving a little bit more color on the Atheros 
this 
quarter for a couple of reasons. One, the guidance we gave at the 
outset of the quarter didn't include Atheros, so we thought it was 
appropriate to give more detail this quarter. Likewise, our prior guidance for 
the fiscal year had not included Atheros. So
 
we're giving a little more detail 
this quarter. We won't to continue this going forward because our guidance 
from hereon will include Atheros. Specific to Atheros, for this fiscal year, 
again, you got to about 5 weeks from the June quarter and a full quar
ter 
into September. That will add approximately $350 million of revenue to this 
fiscal year, of which a little less than $100 million was from the June 
quarter. So that's included as you would calculate revenue per MSM. 
Obviously, revenue per MSM includes 
a wide variety of different products 
from QCT already, and so you've got any number of different chipsets. So 
you could see a little variability in that average. It's an indicator, but it's one 
people should be cautious on to taking too directly and imputi
ng what that 
might mean, that being revenue per MSM.

And then a question for Steve. You said that yourself had to use 28

nanometer device. Realistically, how much of your overall mix do you think 
28
-
nanometer should be in, let's say, 2 qu
arters from now?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Sure, 28
-
nanometer, our first 28
-
nanometer device will really go commercial 
at the end of this calendar year so it really won't show up until the next 
calendar year. We, however, are very optimistic about that device. We'
ve 
had great success with it so far in terms of how it's looking in the lab. I 
mentioned that we sampled that early, which is pretty rare for us and 
actually probably an indicator of how much priority is on that now as a 
company. I mentioned that we've add
ed some additional OpEx in order to 
really 
--
 
I think we're pretty optimistic about that chip. We want to measure 
that we de
-
risk it as best as we can, but we expect that to be something 
really more in the middle of next fiscal year.

question.
 
Matthew Hoffman

Cowen and Company, LLC
 
Paul, you made a point of highlighting the TDD and FDD modes in the 
upcoming LTE chips. First question here, what's your outlook for TD
-
LTE 
versus FDD gl
obally? Will TDD grow meaningfully outside of China and East 
Asia? And then second, strategically, how much of an advantage is it to 
support both modes and offer backward compatibility with CDMA and 
HSPA+?
 
Paul Jacobs
 
So we're watching governments allocate
 
spectrum around the world, and 
there's clearly a number of places where unpaired spectrum was going to get 
allocated. In some cases, it will be used for things like supplemental 
downlinks so that you use it in conjunction with other FDD systems. But 
there
's pretty clearly going to be a strong demand for TDD capabilities. 
Obviously, what's going on in China right now, we're still waiting to see and I 
think we'll wait for some time to see exactly when the government will 
provide the licenses. But there is wo
rk underway, trials going on underway. 
And obviously, in India, things are going quite well on the LTE TDD side. So I 
do think that'll be strong. What the mix will be 
--
 
it's really going to be 
driven, I think, mostly by how spectrum allocations get done. 
For us, we 
don't really care, actually. We're happy to support both and we have them in 
the chips. And your question about having multimode support, I think it's 
going to be very important because most operators are looking to roll out 
LTE as a supplementa
l data capacity in urban areas or in hotspots. And then 
over time, it will roll out more broadly. The other issue is that there's quite a 
large number of frequency bands that are being spec
-
ed for LTE, reflecting 
the fact that it's difficult to find spectr
um for governments around the world. 
So then, you want to have the backwards compatibility to make sure that 
you have the global room and capability. We will, I think, see some single 
mode LTE rollout but I think the vast, vast majority of devices are goin
g to 
be multimode. And therefore having all that capability and there in the single 
chips going to be very, very important.

Bill, on the settlement you got, was there any impact on the numbe
rs from 
the settlement? Did you get an out payment in the quarter or is that coming 
in the next quarter? And if it is, can you quantify it? And then Steve, just on 
the market share on the application processor aside of the business. Can you 
talk a little b
it about how you see Snapdragon market share shaping up over 
the next few quarters particularly as you get the 8960 into the market?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Brian, this is Derek. Why don't I take your first question? Just to clarify, the 
renewal that we just announce
d is just the kind of the final remaining 
WCDMA subscriber extension. That wasn't a situation where we had a 
dispute, and so there's not a disputed amount in the past where you'll see a 
catch up. It's really just a renewal of an existing deal.
 
Steven Molle
nkopf
 
Brian, your question about AT market share, we're very pleased with that 
actually. As I mentioned in my comments, we saw from quarter
-
to
-
quarter, 
we saw 32% rise actually in our integrated AP chipsets. That's really across 
tiers so we're quite happy 
with how that's looking. Looking forward, as you 
mentioned, the 28
-
nanometer devices do include integrated LTE as well as 
all the other modes and Wireless LAN. And I think what's going to happen 
here in next year is at the top end of the portfolio, it's go
ing to be very, very 
important to have these high
-
end modems and connectivity integrated in 
very tightly with the apps process. We're seeing significant amount of 
customer traction on this device, and that's one of the reasons why we really 
kind of put the
 
gas on it here in the fourth fiscal quarter.

Either Bill or Derek, if I could just follow up the $38 billion to $41 billion total 
device revenue guidance for June. Obviously, som

quarter have struggled pretty badly and you're guiding that number up 5% 
to 10% or so, a little more than that sequentially. Could you talk a little bit

I know you mentioned ASPs, but could you talk specifically about maybe 
the
 
impact of some new Asian OEMs and maybe just give us an update on 
how much contribution now we're seeing from broadband wireless, whether 
it's the modems and dongles or tablets or however you want to couch that?
 
William Keitel
 
I think, Tim, we'll stay awa
y from any specifics on how one licensee or 
another is doing. Let me try and give you a little more color around your 
question. For this year, this calendar year, if you look on our website, you'll 
see a little more detail of what we're seeing by region. W
e called up a 
category that we've been identifying for WCDMA Asia, called up pretty 
substantially. We're seeing really good strength in China and then across 
Southeast Asia, Middle East Africa. China, the strength is with 3G, and 
Southeast Asia, Middle Eas
t Africa, we're seeing a GSM migration to 3G pick 
up pace. Although we're seeing that uplift there, we soften a bit our forecast 
for WCDMA Europe, I think the economic troubles there are holding back the 
consumer a bit. And then, it's similar for India. We
 
softened that a bit. But in 
total, we're holding that. So it gives you a little bit more color maybe by 
region of what we're seeing happening. On the modules and data devices, 
that continues at a strong pace. We're seeing embedded being a little bit 
stron
ger than the dongles themselves. So but overall 
--
 
e
-
books as well 
coming on strong. So overall, we think the market there is pretty strong. 
There are a number of 
--
 
a pretty wide number of product launches that are 
scheduled for later this quarter, early 
in what would be our first fiscal 
quarter. So we're looking for that to drive some further uptick in the market.

I just wanted to ask you a question for 
chipset next quarter and I guess this 
is probably is for Steve. But just as far as, Steve, you're looking at only 
about the 0 to 5 million unit increase sequentially. That's a little bit lower 
than the street was looking for and I think some of us had basi
cally been 
expecting a couple of the customers you referred to such as whether it's 
BlackBerry 7 or Nokia in there as well as some other large customers in 
there as well. And I know you commented in your prepared remarks about 
some buffer build in the June
 
quarter that might get worked down in 
September. So can you just quantify for us the magnitude of that buffer 
build and hopefully just help explain to us why you were not seeing more of 
the sequential lift?
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Yes, this is Steve. Maybe your
 
first part of the question, obviously, I'm going 
to try to shy away from talking about any particular launch for an OEM, but I 
think it's important or it's pretty difficult I think sometimes to get the timing 
of launches. However, that being said, we are 
quite bullish in terms of how 
our forward
-
looking share 
--
 
the trajectory on it from what we've seen so 
far. So we are quite positive. And then, as I mentioned in my remarks that 
we are ramping our, essentially the resources that it takes in order to 
suppo
rt customers. So that's for the first part. The second part about the 
buffer build, as I mentioned, I think there was a certain 
--
 
certain OEMs had 
a reaction to the Japan crisis, which was to make sure that they had product 
on hand. It's not a large numbe
r, but we are working through some of that 
with some of the OEMs to work through. Obviously, as I'm sure is well 
known, that crises or that supply chain event in terms of disruption is really 
behind us now, which is a good thing.

A couple of questions around 
--
 
Steve, first of all, the QCT operating margin, 
the EBIT margin of 19.6%, declined a little bit from last quarter. You said it 
was in line wit
h your expectations. Did Atheros have an impact on that at 
all? And if it did, can you take that out so we can see what it would have 
been on an apples
-
to
-
apples basis? And then, how should we be looking at 
that for next quarter? Does it go back up again? 
You've been talking 
previously that when you get in the 28
-
nanometer at the end of the year 
going to next year, sort of now there were 8960 that we see that bounce 
back up again. So I want to make sure that we're still 
--
 
or just understand 
that the trajec
tory of that is going forward. And then you also were talking 
about spending some extra R&D and OpEx at the end of this quarter going 
into next for some opportunity that you see happening. I'm wondering that 
120 to 125 MSMs next quarter. If those opportuni
ties you're talking about 
come through, would we see that impact next quarter? So could that 120 to 
125 be significantly higher and give us a sense as to what the odds are 
around for the standard deviation around that number is if some of those 
projects th
at you seemed to be eagerly working on the R&D side comes 
through?
 
William Keitel
 
This is Bill. I'll take the first part of your question on the QCT op margin. For 
fiscal Q3, the Atheros was about a 
--
 
it's about 500 basis points impact to 
our operating ma
rgin. That number should decrease a bit going into the next 
quarter but just modestly. For the quarter, look for operating margins in 
QCT to be in that similar range as Q3. As we commented, we're not, at this 
point, seeing a significant increase in the MSM
 
volume. And as Steve noted, 
he's stepping up his R&D because of some opportunities that we see here in 
the near term.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Maybe I can add a little bit more color. This is Steve. On the R&D 
investment, it's really a combination of things. The
 
majority of it is things 
that I would consider to be more onetime events in the sense that they are 
increases in terms of integration platforms that we use internally to develop 
the devices or tape
-
outs or things that you would do that accelerate the 
prog
ram because you're confident in it or you have more confidence in it. 
We also, as we announced in the quarter, we announced a small acquisition, 
which closed in the September quarter that's also now in the results or in 
the OpEx forecast as well. So very m
uch on track in terms of how we guided 
you in terms of OpEx, op margin trajectory and what we expect. And then 
looking into next year, we tend to invest into units a little bit ahead of 
--
 
more than one quarter ahead, I think, in terms of the volume ramp. 
So it's 
really the products that we're going to ramp in fiscal year '12.

Just a couple. I quick one on the inventory. I think, Bill, you said you expect 
CD
MA inventory to decline a little bit again in fiscal Q4 down towards 15 
weeks. I'm just wondering, do you think that 15
-
 
to 20
-
week range is 
normal going forward? Or do you think we should be expecting normal 
inventory levels more down towards the 15
-
week 
level? And I guess that 
leads on into another question, which is, are you guys thinking vendors are 
going to be running into the end of the year season pretty light on inventory 
generally speaking? Have you seen them cutting back on inventory levels, 
maybe
 
anticipating a little weaker demand?
 
William Keitel
 
Sure, Rod. Yes, we are expecting 
--
 
we think we've seen a little bit of 
inventory consumption in the June quarter and we're expecting a bit more in 
the September quarter. We think going out of the fiscal
 
year, we'll just be a 
nod below that average 15
-
 
to 20
-
week channel inventory level that we've 
seen for several years. I think it's best to assume that, that channel holds it 
down at a relatively low level. This has been in line with our forecast all year
 
that the global economy is a bit stronger but it's not certainly not that robust 
level that I think a lot of vendors are going to want to step up too much on 
inventory. Frankly, I hope it holds at this level. I hope maybe overall, the 
channels maybe just 
got a little more efficient since the 2008, 2009 crisis. 
But for the time being, I would 
--
 
I think it's best to assume that it stays at 
that lower level. We'll share our updates what we see for fiscal '12 when 
we're in New York in November.

I was wondering if you might comment a bit on opportunities in the China 
region for vendors, how you feel about your position in the China market in 
general a
nd then with the domestic vendors overall. That would be helpful.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. I'll talk about it from the perspective of the chipsets that 
you're asking. We have, really for some time, had a strong relationship with 
Chinese domestic ma
nufacturers. I think for some time, we've been 
supporting their export businesses. I think it's a big portion of our business 
and I think recently here and then with the launch of 3G over the last 
several years, it's become more of a domestic
-
produced, dom
estic
-
consumed type of product for us, which is very good. We also, over the last 
year, augmented our product to support I think a different class of 
customer, a customer that has less R&D in China primarily for the emerging 
markets as well as China. And w
e've seen a fair amount of traction in those 
customer channels primarily coinciding with the advent of mass market 
smartphone happening with the rollout of 3G in some of these regions. So 
it's been 
--
 
I think it's been a real strong success for us over the
 
last several 
years and over different types of products and we were pretty bullish about 
it moving forward.

this is Paul. As I just said in my prepared remarks, I just 
got back from a couple of carrier events where they were 
bringing their 
suppliers in to sort of rally the ecosystem and I gave the lead keynote 
address on both of those events and I think it really just shows the kind of 
influence that Qualcomm has in the market that operators want to make 
sure that we're there 
to give the technical roadmap to their suppliers and to 
make sure that everyone knows sort of where the industry's going to head, 
where they're going to drive new services from and the relationships that we 
have both on the manufacturing and the operator s
ide in China are 
extremely strong right now.

And congrats on a good quarter guys and gals. Couple of questions here for 
Bill. Just 
housekeeping, interest income and investment income is a big 
swing factor. What do you have envisioned for your guidance here in the 
September outlook? And then also, Bill, if you could tell us how much 
onshore cash is remaining following your Atheros acqu
isition? And then I 
have a quick question for Derek after that.
 
William Keitel
 
Sure, Mark. On the investment income side, what we have been doing now 
for some time is including in our guidance obviously dividend and interest 
income. But what we've been doi
ng for some time now is reaching out and 
including investment gains that we think we're highly confident will be 
realized, net investment gains for the quarter. So that's included in the 
guidance we shared with you. From here on out, it's kind of 
--
 
it's u
p to our 
investment managers as to whether they see opportunities that there's 
about $1 billion unrealized, net unrealized gain on the total portfolio. So as 
they see opportunities to move there, it's primarily fixed income that they 
would realize further 
gains. On the onshore
-
offshore, the onshore today and 
towards the end of this quarter should be in the $6 billion to $6.5 billion 
range and so you've got 13 to 14 offshore.

Great. And then Derek you mentioned

I wanted to
 
understand on these 
licensees. It sounds like you took care of one that was the next due. Can 
you lay out for us what kind of milestones or other events that we could see 
with licensees on that front? Or how long is it clear sailing? Or maybe give 
me a li
ttle some of the bigger legal events coming up.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So I think we've talked about this quite a bit historically that we've had 4 
companies for several years back that we needed to extend their WCDMA 
subscriber royalty obligation by between now and
 
the end of 2017. And so 
with this last renewal, we haven't really gotten more specific about what 
happens after 2017. But I think what you can take from today's 
announcement is that we have all the extensions done that we needed to get 
done within that ti
meframe. And I think as we've said we generally have 
very long
-
term agreements with our licensees and I think we all feel very 
well
-
positioned today, following this final renewal.

First of 
all, you said you have $0.01 worth of EPS upside in QTL. How did 
you get that when your QTL results came in below the midpoint of your 
guidance? Can you also 
--
 
was it higher royalty rates or what? I was also 
--
 
one more question on Krait. So you're sample
d and now shipping sometime 
next year beginning next year. You said it's going to support one of the 
--
 
I 
guess the integrated connectivity solutions from Atheros. My understanding 
was the Krait chips in general were going to have connectivity integrated 
d
irectly on the dye. Can you verify do the MSM, the chipsets coming there, 
does it have connectivity capability that's integrated on the dye? Doesn't 
sound like it. And if it doesn't, can you give us some feel for what your 
connectivity integration roadmap 
actually looks like going through, I guess, 
going into 2012 as you roll those products out?
 
William Keitel
 
Stacy, it's Bill. On your EPS question, it has to do with the mix of licensees. 
So the TRDS [ph] was pretty spot on with what we expected and we saw 
some favorability because of the mix of licensees.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. I'll take the first part of the Krait question. Maybe ask Craig if 
he can handle the second part, probably better answers than I can give. But 
the 8960 device has, in addit
ion to the application process of the GPU, all 
the modems, multi
-
mode modem functionality in GPS. It does have 
integrated wireless LAN. It is part of a digital dye, but the radio is actually 
outside of the device. We have, I think, a little bit different a
pproach to 
integration than some of our competitors. And maybe, Craig, if you could 
provide a perspective on that would be great.
 
Craig Barratt
 
Sure, this is Craig. Obviously, from my Atheros background, we've been on 
both sides of this debate. But one of 
the key things is the attach rate of Wi
-
Fi is really going up to very high levels pretty much in all smartphone and 
tablet platforms and there's substantial benefits to integrating a significant 
part of the connectivity functions not just WiFi but also Blu
etooth, FM. And 
as you know, GPS was being integrated actually for a long time. We can 
deliver much higher performance. There's benefits in terms of reducing 
overall system
-
level power. The solution ends up contributing a much 
smaller increase in PCB size.
 
So the solution area is smaller and that's 
critical for more compact devices. And of course, I think there are benefits 
around cost as well. And so this is a trend that will fan out, I think, across 
many of the future MSM chips and other similar platforms
 
in the future

for Bill. Bill, you said you expect significant uptake on CDMA device volumes

driving that view? And then Steve, for you, on Snapdragon, there seems to 
be a lot of design activity ongoing as there has been for some time. Looking

the tablet market? And maybe just give us your thoughts on how you see 
the tablet market x Apple evolving?
 
William Keitel
 
Kulbinder, this is Bill. I may have been a little confusing. Let me clarify. 
We're expecti
ng an uptick in the fourth calendar quarter, which would be our 
first fiscal quarter of 2012. And as we mentioned, we're seeing a lot of new 
devices being prepared for launch that we think OEMs, carriers and 
consumers are going to be taking advantage of.
 
S
teven Mollenkopf
 
And this is Steve. Perspectives on chipsets for tablets and phones. In some 
cases, the same device will be used for high
-
end phones that will be used for 
tablets. You've seen that in the market. And then in other cases, you may 
have a more
 
specialized device. We have recently added both of those tiers 
into our roadmap. The difference between them may be a small amount of 
performance delta but also different interfaces that are required in a tablet, 
perhaps, than a phone depending on the cla
ss of tablet. In terms of the 
overall market, our perspective is quite bullish over the long term. If you 
look at mobile computing, we think that will really grow up and take a fairly 
significant share of the traditional laptop space really driven by the s
oftware 
that's being driven on phones. That software is getting better every day and 
I think, as that happens, you'll see I think a little bit more diversity in terms 
of supply base for suppliers into that market as well as the market itself 
growing. Both 
of those things being good things for Qualcomm and the 
industry.

Steve, since we can't predict the exact timing of new handset launches, 
perhaps you can give us your 
qualitative thoughts on share gains at 
strategic OEMs. And are we at a point where there's more at stake at 
particular customers as opposed to the past when it's typically a dual source 
opportunity? And Bill, the uplift in ASPs is there is some concern tha
t it may 
be short
-
lived. I have seen sharp ASP declines in smartphones 
--
 
smartphone prices from the Asian vendors and the worry is that today's 
smartphones will be tomorrows feature phones.
 
Steven Mollenkopf
 
Mark, this is Steve. In terms of how the share 
picture looks to us, it really 
doesn't look that different than what it has historically for us. A number of 
our traditional customers have had second sourcing programs for some time. 
We've been able to, I think, really drive technology and maintain the mo
st 
profitable segments of their business. And then also, just in terms of the 
dynamics, over the last 10 years or so, there's always been 1 or 2 OEMs that 
we haven't been able to get into for one reason or another. Historically, it's 
been Nokia, for exampl
e, if you go back many years. And now today, the 
market really looks much more accessible than it probably was 5 years ago 
in terms of overall upside. Still, the business though looks very similar. It's a 
technology velocity business. You have to drive tec
hnology as fast as 
possible and we think that that environment is existing now in the 
marketplace.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Mark, this is Derek. Let me answer your question on ASPs. I think as we see 
that penetration of smartphones into the mid
-
 
and lower tiers, it's 
actually 
--
 
we do a very good thing for our business. I think longer
-
term, you are going 
to see declines in overall ASP that we report to you just given the mix of 
volume from the developed markets into emerging markets and also maybe 
from the top tier dow
n into the mid and lower tier smartphones. But what 
we expect to see with that, is very strong growth in volume and what will 
lead sort of to the combination of those two things that's continued strong 
growth and the total reported device sales that is the
 
base of the royalty 
business. So I think all those trends are happening, but they will come 
together in a positive way for us over the long term.

and Steve, you guys, kind of suss [ph] that out as you will. First, given 
pretty good detail as to how you expect operating margins in QCT to develop 
in the near term. Can you talk a little bi
t about your long
-
term targets, 
stated long
-
term targets of getting that business up into the mid
-
 
to high 
20s range and kind of how you would perceive that happening either from a 
timing standpoint as well as what conditions you would expect to come 
toget
her to get margins to that level? And then secondly, I wanted to kind of 
follow up on the last question as it relates to competition. Can you give 
maybe a little more insight as to where you're 
--
 
what you're thinking in 
terms of pricing trends and where y
ou feel like 
--
 
what segments where you 
may see more competition versus less going forward and how we should 
think about the potential for shared momentum in the different segments?
 
William Keitel
 
On the op margin 
--
 
James, it's Bill. I'll give you some th
oughts and Steve 
can jump in if he wants to add anything to it. But historically, if you look 
back at Qualcomm on the chip side, we've enjoyed north of 25% operating 
margins for extended period of time. The environment 
--
 
I think we went 
through this in so
me detail in New York last year, the environment and how 
we think we can open up a smartphone mass market. The combination of 
those has led us to a lower op margin than what we've historically seen. As 
we said in New York back in November, we are targeting
 
to improve that 
operating margin in the out years. We'll give a refresher on that at New 
York, but I don't think you're going to see much of a different outlook going 
forward that we do expect in the out years to be improving that operating 
margin for QCT

Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first thing I wanted to dig into is

And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
William Keitel
 
Yes, obviously, we're seeing some good strength here. Derek, I think, gave 
some good color on that. The only thing I would add to 
what Derek said was 
that 
--
 
which aligns with what Steve Mollenkopf just said on smartphones, 
we're seeing ASPs on average increase in any number of emerging markets 
now and we really think it's this mass
-
market smartphone getting into the 
areas of the wor
ld that a lot of us don't track otherwise that closely. So the 
ASP strength that we saw in our fiscal Q3 that we're seeing in our fiscal Q4 
that Derek talked about is 
--
 
a good part of that is just emerging markets 
where we're seeing ASPs, the average ASPs
 
actually increase. So how long 
that holds? We'll see, but the appetite for smartphones across the world is 
quite strong and it's got a ways to go in terms of penetration.

with this sampling of the 8960. It's probably one of the most exciting chips 
we've ever launched

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, John, good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report 
better
-
than
-
expected results in our fourth fiscal quarter, completing a year 
where we saw strong performance across our chip businesses, healthy global
 
demand growth for 3G/4G devices, and we expanded on Qualcomm's 
fundamental leadership in 5G technologies.
 
I am particularly pleased with the actions our teams have taken this year to 
advance the strategic objectives we set for the company. Almost two year
s 
ago, we set an ambitious target to significantly grow our serviceable 
available market by 2020. This past year saw substantial progress in the 
most critical new opportunities for the company.
 
First, the announced acquisition of NXP provides important cap
abilities to 
grow our footprint in automotive, IoT and security. Second, we closed the RF 
front
-
end joint venture providing us with the remaining products and 
capabilities to fully compete in this growing area. Third, we announced the 
partnership with Micr
osoft to bring the advantages of low
-
power, high
-
performance computing to the mobile PC market.
 
In QCT, product demand and mix trends continue to be favorable and 
profitability improved again this quarter; now six quarters in a row of year
-
over
-
year growth
 
in EBT and EBT margin expansion. For fiscal 2017, QCT 
EBT dollars grew more than 50% year
-
over
-
year driven by our strong 
product portfolio, favorable product mix, and growth in China and adjacent 
areas.
 
QCT revenues outside smartphones in adjacent areas w
ere more than $3 
billion in fiscal 2017, up more than 25% year
-
over
-
year driven by better
-
than
-
expected growth in auto, networking and IoT, as we continue to 
successfully execute on our strategy to extend our mobile technologies into 
these new growth areas
.
 
We continue to see good trends in our business in China. We increased our 
share in fiscal 2017 with approximately 25% year
-
over
-
year growth in both 
QCT revenues and MSM chip shipments to Chinese OEMs. And looking 
ahead, we are pleased to see 5G momentum 
there, including our 5G NR trial 
with China Mobile.
 
In QTL, the second half of fiscal 2017 results were impacted by disputes with 
Apple and its contract manufacturers, as well as one other licensee. And we 
remain focused on defending our business and the v
alue of our patented 
inventions for the long
-
term.
 
3G/4G trends around the world are very positive. We are pleased to see that 
global shipments of 3G/4G devices remain strong, and we continue to 
forecast calendar 2017 device shipments to grow 6% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint.
 
Looking ahead to calendar 2018, we forecast stronger growth with 3G/4G 
device shipments expected to grow approximately 8% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint, reflecting continued handset shipment growth, as well as stronger 
year
-
over
-
year
 
growth in non
-
handsets.
 
In addition, estimated global 3G/4G device ASPs are trending better
-
than
-
expected with ASPs in fiscal 2017 flat versus fiscal 2016. The favorable end 
market trends for 3G/4G, the accelerating commercial timing for 5G, as well 
as th
e adoption of wireless technologies into new industries continues to be 
very positive for us. And our global scale, combined with our technology and 
product road map, are leading the industry.
 
We are very excited about the increased momentum in 5G around t
he world. 
We are leading the industry and are accelerating the commercial launch of 
5G across millimeter wave and sub
-
6 gigahertz in early 2019. We recently 
announced the world's first 5G data connection achieved on the Snapdragon 
X50 modem chip set, and o
ur leading 5G 3GPP standards development, 
ongoing prototype efforts and are supporting global 5G new radio trials.
 
In September, we announced our 5G new radio millimeter wave prototype 
that will be used for interoperability testing with our infrastructure 
vendor 
partners along with our previously announced sub
-
6 gigahertz prototype. 
With 5G commercial devices shipping in 2019, we expect to further expand 
our product and technology leadership position in modems.
 
Gigabit LTE is the first step in network opera
tor's transition to 5G, and there 
are now 41 operators in 24 countries supporting Gigabit LTE. We have 
demonstrated download speeds of greater than 1 gigabits using our X20 LTE 
modem in the U.S. with both Ericsson and Verizon, as well as Nokia and T
-
Mobile
. Most leading device
-
makers are rapidly adopting Gigabit LTE into 
their device portfolios.
 
In the premium tier, our gigabit
-
enabled Snapdragon 835 now has more 
than 120 designs launched and in development, including recent flagship 
devices like the Samsun
g Galaxy Note 8, Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, LG V30, and 
the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2. We have also introduced new high
-
tier and mid
-
tier 
Snapdragon products to further expand our competitive position in China 
across all tiers.
 
Turning to our pending acquisition of NXP
. We remain focused on the last 
few regulatory approvals. We believe this acquisition will provide us with 
greater scale in automotive, IoT, security and networking, with their highly 
complementary products and world
-
class sales channel, serving a long tai
l of 
customers that are driving growth.
 
Of the nine jurisdictions reviewing, we have approvals from five, including 
here in the U.S. and Taiwan with China and the EU the largest remaining. 
We are constructively working with each remaining regulator. And wh
ile the 
clock is stopped in Europe, there is nothing unexpected or surprising in that 
process for an acquisition of this size.
 
Significant effort was expended throughout the year on integration planning 
with NXP. Along with NXP, we continue to see this as 
an attractive deal for 
both our stockholders and NXP stockholders at $110 per share, as the 
combination brings together a comprehensive set of capabilities to address 
next generation auto and IoT devices. We continue to focus on closing the 
acquisition by 
the end of calendar 2017 with a potential for the close to slip 
into 2018 based on the current status of approvals.
 
On the regulatory matters, we are pursuing appeals and resolutions and are 
confident in the pro
-
competitive nature of our business. We will 
continue to 
appeal the KFTC ruling and look forward to presenting our case in the U.S. 
FTC matter in early 2019.
 
In Taiwan, we strongly disagree with the recently announced decision and 
have significant objections concerning the lack of due process that le
d to the 
decision. We will appeal and seek to stay the decision. The TFTC ruling was 
not by consensus. We understand there was dissent among the 
commissioners resulting in a split decision. We were also pleased to see the 
Taiwanese Ministry of Economic aff
airs publicly question the TFTC process 
and decision.
 
Finally, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and focused 
execution throughout this past year. The team reported strong results in the 
product business validating both our strategy an
d the strength of our 
product portfolio. We will maintain our strong commitment to and focus on 
technology and product leadership as we drive innovation into new 
opportunities and toward the path of 5G.
 
I would now like to turn the call over to George.

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with 
comments on our fiscal fourth quarter and 2017 results, followed by our 
fiscal first quarter of 2018 guidance and some additional perspective on 
2018 overall
.
 
In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered non
-
GAAP revenues of $6 billion 
and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.92. Performance was strong in our 
operating businesses relative to expectations, particularly in QCT. Non
-
GAAP 
EPS results exceeded the high 
end of our prior guidance range by $0.07 with 
the majority of that outperformance coming from QCT with the balance from 
QTL and better
-
than
-
expected performance in our investment portfolio.
 
QCT delivered strong results with revenues of $4.7 billion, reflec
ting MSM 
shipments above the midpoint of expectations. QCT EBT margin was 21%, 
above the high end of expectations on the higher unit volume, improved 
product mix, and product cost initiatives. QCT earnings before tax was up 
42% year
-
over
-
year in the quarte
r.
 
In QTL, revenues were $1.2 billion and EBT margin was 68%, both above 
the midpoint of expectations, driven primarily by better
-
than
-
expected 
3G/4G device ASPs due to a favorable mix of premium tier devices, as well 
as strong ASPs from Chinese OEMs in th
e quarter.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were up 3% sequentially, at 
the high end of expectations on increased 5G investment and litigation 
expenses as we continue to defend our business model on several fronts. 
Investment income in the quarter c
ame in ahead of expectations due to 
market favorability as we nearly completed the liquidation of our RISC 
(11:42) portfolio in advance of the NXP deal close.
 
Our non
-
GAAP tax rate was 18% in the quarter, and our GAAP rate at 61% 
reflected the impact of th
e non deductible TFTC fine.
 
Now, turning to fiscal 2017. Non
-
GAAP revenues for the year were $23.2 
billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $4.28. Non
-
GAAP gross 
margin at 60% of revenues was a good story for the company in 2017 as 
strong gross margin 
performance in QCT nearly offset the impact of the 
licensing disputes.
 
Non
-
GAAP free cash flow was approximately $6.1 billion, down 15% year
-
over
-
year. We returned $4.6 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2017, including 
approximately $3.3 billion of cash di
vidends paid, an increase of 9% year
-
over
-
year; and $1.3 billion in share repurchases.
 
Turning to 3G/4G devices. The trends were strong in fiscal 2017 with 
estimated global 3G/4G device sales growing at a mid
-
single digit 
percentage year
-
over
-
year, consist
ent with prior expectations. Underpinning 
this growth was a flat ASP for global 3G/4G devices versus fiscal 2016 
despite some FX headwinds.
 
For calendar year 2017, we continue to forecast approximately 1.75 billion 
to 1.85 billion 3G/4G device shipments, w
hich projects growth of 
approximately 6% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint, consistent with our prior 
estimates.
 
In QCT, we saw strong performance in fiscal 2017 with 52% year
-
over
-
year 
growth in earnings before tax dollars and EBT margin expansion of 
approxi
mately 500 basis points to 17%. The business delivered these strong 
results despite the full year impact of the second source decision at Apple.
 
Three elements were the key drivers of the strength in QCT. First, we had a 
strong year
-
over
-
year growth in MSM
 
shipments to OEMs based in China. 
Second, QCT revenues from adjacent areas, which includes auto, IoT, 
networking and mobile compute, grew more than 25% year
-
over
-
year and 
now provide revenues of just over $3 billion. Finally, QCT results also 
benefited fr
om seven months of our RF360 joint venture, which closed in 
February; a very strong year overall for QCT.
 
In QTL, results in fiscal 2017 were impacted by the disputes with Apple and 
another licensee, primarily in the second half of the year, as well as by 
the 
increased cost of litigation and spending on brand defense. Absent these 
disputes, we believe revenue would've shown healthy year
-
over
-
year 
growth, in line with the strength of the underlying markets.
 
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the fir
st fiscal quarter of 2018. We 
estimate fiscal first quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately 
$5.5 billion to $6.3 billion, roughly flat sequentially at the midpoint.
 
We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.85 to 
$0.95 per
 
share, down 2% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate first 
quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses to be down 
approximately 1% to 3% sequentially, on both seasonal and operating cost 
savings.
 
In QTL, we expect revenues of $1.1 billion to $1.
3 billion in the fiscal first 
quarter, approximately flat sequentially at the midpoint. We expect fiscal 
first quarter QTL EBT margin to be approximately 68% to 72%, flat to 
slightly up sequentially.
 
In QCT, we expect approximately 220 million to 240 milli
on MSM chip 
shipments for the fiscal first quarter, up 5% sequentially at the midpoint, 
reflecting typical seasonality trend and strength in our product portfolio.
 
There's potential upside to these estimates on indications of a possible build 
ahead on a cu
stomer's flagship launch. We expect QCT's fiscal first quarter 
EBT margin to be approximately 18% to 20%, down slightly sequentially on 
product mix.
 
As a reminder, the fiscal first quarter is the seasonally strong fourth quarter 
for QCT and we expect the f
iscal second quarter to reflect normal seasonal 
trends with lower demand for units impacting margins.
 
We estimate our non
-
GAAP fiscal first quarter 2018 tax rate to be 
approximately 7%, reflecting the lower mix of licensing revenues in our 
business at this
 
time. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately 
$60 million to $75 million in the fiscal first quarter. Net expense is up nearly 
$175 million on the effects of lower realized gains on sales of marketable 
securities and lower investment returns 
now that we have substantially 
completed the liquidation of our longer term investment portfolio and our 
holding assets in short
-
term liquid investments.
 
Turning to 2018. Consistent with last year, we're providing selective 
guidance points for the year. Fo
r calendar year 2018, 3G/4G device 
shipments, we are estimating approximately 1.9 billion to 2 billion units, up 
approximately 8% at the midpoint, reflecting strong growth of 3G/4G 
handsets in India and other emerging regions, as well as above
-
average 
grow
th in 3G/4G non
-
handsets, primarily in IoT.
 
In fiscal 2018, we expect mid
-
single digit percentage growth in global 3G/4G 
device sales year
-
over
-
year, and estimate that the global 3G/4G device ASP 
will decline at a low
-
single digit percentage year
-
over
-
year
, primarily from 
strong unit growth in the non
-
handset category at lower ASPs. This includes 
our estimate that global 3G/4G handset ASPs will be roughly flat year
-
over
-
year with continued ASP growth for Chinese OEMs (18:33) premium tier 
handsets, offset by
 
increasing shipments into lower ASP emerging regions.
 
We estimate our full year non
-
GAAP tax rate to be approximately 7%, lower 
versus fiscal 2016, reflecting a full year assumed impact of lower licensing 
revenues resulting from the licensing disputes wit
h Apple and the other 
licensee.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.

This is Matt Ramsa
y on for the team and Mike. Steve, you might have seen 
there has been some sort of questions about the position of your chipset 
business with premium tier OEMs going forward. And it occurred to us that 
with 5G trials coming online and lots of work being do
ne both with carriers 
and with those premium OEMs as the industry moves toward 5G, you guys 
might be well
-
positioned to retain and maybe even expand some of those 
positions. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive position 
of your QCT bu
siness for 5G and the engagements that you have on the 
OEM and with the carriers as we move forward in those trials? Thank you.

Hi, Mike (sic) [Matt] (20:39), it's Steve. I didn't hear the front part of that. 
And also,
 
it's kind of hard for me to talk about rumors or any particular, let's 
say, media report. I will say that our road map and the positioning of, in 
particular, our modem road map, we feel very good about. Not only the ones 
that are already launched, but if 
you look at the upgrades that are going to 
occur to LTE upstream of 5G and then when you get to 5G, I think we're 
going to be 

 
we feel very good about that positioning. We can go into that 
in some detail. But I would say, the overall sense of the competit
ive 
dynamic, we feel quite good about.

Great. Thank you very much. Wanted t
o ask quickly on the NXPI process. I 
think, Steve indicated that you're making good progress with the regulators 
even though that deal might slip into next year. How are you feeling about 
your part of the process, et cetera, and whether if you feel like yo
u're on the 
same page with regulators as to the things they may need to ask for?
 
And then, my second question is, in the past you've talked about a non

Apple licensee that there were some collection issues with. Can you give us 
an update on any progress th
ere? Thank you.
 
Donald J. Rosenberg

James, this is Don Rosenberg. I'll take the first part of that. On the 
regulators, we are, as we said before, working with the rest of the regulators 
that haven't yet cleared. As you recall, we have five
 
regulators who have 
cleared already. We are deeply engaged with the others and we are making 
progress. It's a little slower than we'd like to make, but that's more the 
process than anything else. And we are feeling good about our engagement 
and that we we
re going to get to the end as quickly as we can with them.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first question, I wanted to 
ask
 
about the licensing results and the guidance. I know last quarter there 
had been some, I think you've characterized it as substantial catch
-
up in the 
quarter and that was the reason for the flat guide on revenues into Q4. Was 
there any catch
-
up or anythin
g unusual or otherwise one
-
time that impacted 
either the Q4 licensing results or the Q1 guidance? And if so, what was it?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes. Stacy, this is George. The Q4 results had a very small amount of, what 
I would call, out
-
of
-
peri
od or catch
-
up dollars in it. So no material effect. 
Really, the improvement was driven by the strength of the market relative to 
our expectations in the guide. If you look at our Q1 guide, I would say we 
probably would be up a little bit more if we had ou
t
-
of
-
period amounts 
similar to what we had in Q4. So it's having a little bit of impact Q4 to Q1, 
but we're still showing the strong guide.
 
Stacy Aaron Rasgon

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Got it. Thank you. For my second question, I wanted to ask a lit
tle bit about 
the linkages or lack thereof between the various disputes. I know, again, on 
the last earnings call, I think, Derek had made some statements that sort of 
essentially dismissed any linkage or contagion worries. Your attorneys in 
court told Jud
ge Curiel the opposite, and I think the injunction was denied 
partially on the basis of that discrepancy.
 
Can you give us a little more color, like which one of those statements is 
more valid in terms of the linkage between Apple and any of the other 
disag
reements that seem to be developing at this point? And how can 
investors kind of get a little more comfort that going forward the disputes 
that exist as they are today don't continue to give rise to more?
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Stacy, I'll ta
ke the first part of it. It's Don. First of all, there is really no 
contradiction to be cleared between our arguments in court and statements 
that, as you indicate, Derek and others made. And I think we'll get into the 
second part of your question in a min
ute.
 
What we argued in court, under the court standard, which as we've said is a 
very strict standard, which is very hard to meet in the context of a contract 
case. We thought we had a pretty strong argument. And, unfortunately, the 
judge didn't 
ultimately agree with that. But the court arguments were not 
inconsistent with what we've said. If you're thinking about the notion of 
irreparable harm versus, as you describe it, kind of linkage to others, it's a 
different concept. And I think we were pre
tty clear in how we argued that 
position.

Thank you. Maybe just two, if I could as well. I guess, it seems like you 
d
idn't give out the standard. You gave the industry view of units and ASP. 
I'm just curious if we can get any color on kind of what was paying it and 
what was paying units ASPs implied royalty rate in the quarter. And is that, 
going forward, going to not be
 
given or is that just because of the disputes?
 
And then, separately, be interested to hear on the chip business. Obviously, 
doing great with the Chinese OEMs and the adjacencies. Just any color you 
can give us on what the mix of those businesses would mea
n to the margin 
profile of that business. Margins seem to be going up with them, so is that a 
trend that we should expect to continue? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hey, Tim. It's George. On the TRDS, we took a look at whether or not once 
we 
had the two disputes, whether the TRDS number that we used to give 
out really had any information in it. And we felt it was actually just confusing 
and we find ourselves reconciling a bunch of numbers. So we went straight 
from Point A to Point B and just g
uided revenue, which we think gives a lot 
of visibility into what we think is happening in the business.
 
We do think the underlying trends are actually quite strong. And you're 
seeing the benefit of that both in growth of the licensable market even if 
we'r
e not fully participating in it. We've seen good growth in device sales 
globally. And it's being driven by strong ASPs, which is also having a positive 
impact in the mix and the performance of the company, where we're very 
well
-
positioned in the markets wh
ere we're seeing the largest impact and, in 
particular, China.
 
So I think we're sensitive to your concern. And if we can find a way to get 
out more information that is actually helpful and gives insight into the 
business on TRDS, we will. But in the meanti
me, we feel like guiding 
revenue is perhaps the best alternative.

Hi, Tim. This is Cristiano. You had a question on China and adjacencies. 
China has been a good story for us. I think China is the world's most 
competitive market, and our product road map has done well for us in China. 
We rem
ain confident in maintaining our position there as a market leader. 
And the trends have been very good. We saw, in China, when we look at 
fiscal 2017, we saw 25% year
-
over
-
year growth in our China business. 
When we think about that market going forward, we
 
saw good transitions on 
modem technologies to 4G+. And I think a lot of the activity towards an 
early 5G in China as well is positive for us.
 
One other comment to note, just a commentary on China. One of the data 
points in 2017 was consistent with the tre
nds we have talked over the year. 
We start to see an increase in exports of the Chinese OEMs as they become 
a larger percent of the global market. And the adjacent business, we saw 
growth across multiple segments, automotive, IoT, networking. And we can 
le
verage mobile technology, so they have been providing a good margin 
story for QCT.

Hi, guys, Thanks for letting me ask a question. The first one is on the Apple 
litigation. It seems like whether it's in press reports mainly or otherwise, 
that it's escalating, not actually getting closer to resolution. So may
be, Don, 
if you could provide us a timeline in the upcoming court cases if we're going 
to come to the conclusion that this probably will be decided in the courts or 
at least have to get a lot closer to these court cases before any resolution 
comes to pass?
 
Donald J. Rosenberg 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes, it's Don. It's important to keep in mind that litigation of this size and 
magnitude takes a while, and you can't focus on any particular event in the 
short
-
term. As you know, there are multiple cases that have bee
n brought 
by Apple and multiple cases that have been brought by us, and we're going 
through a process. There'll be some motion practice; there'll be some 
discovery disputes. But that process is going to proceed under the court's 
schedule.
 
I would say that,
 
as you know, we brought a couple of patent cases against 
Apple in the ITC and district court here in the United States, in Germany, 
and in China. And those tend to move a little faster in the ITC, Germany and 
China, than litigation generally. And so, I wo
uld say that those will be on 
somewhat faster track, including potentially Germany by some time mid to 
end of 2018.
 
And China, too, we expect to be on a fairly fast track. And as you know, the 
ITC action will move forward rather quickly. But until then, I 
don't think 
you're going to see much that's going to be of any particular consequence in 
terms of the ultimate outcome. And it'll play out the way a lot of this kind of 
complex litigation plays out generally.

I think as a quick follow
-
up on that litigation side of things. The unnamed 
dispute that you have, seems like that's been coming up on a year's time. I 
know you're still in negotiations. You're not really going to comment on the 
name of the party, et 
cetera. But is that duration typical for one year? And 
what's the trigger point that changes it from an informal to a formal dispute 
where we can get more information?

This is Alex. So it's a fairly lengthy discussion, but
 
I don't think that that's 
atypical. There are a lot of issues involved to work the way through. I think 
when it changes over to some formal litigation, obviously, that's when we'll 
go ahead and disclose that.

Thanks very much. Following up from the earlier question, we can see 
what's happening between you and Apple publicly in terms of the filings and 
the counter filings. But can you give us
 
any feel as to whether there is direct 
dialogue between you and Apple outside of what we can see publicly?

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Hi, this is Steve. I would echo what Don said earlier. It's very difficult to look 
at any one particular data 
point, whether it's true or not and kind of come to 
a conclusion. I think it's also important for investors to understand, we really 
try to compartmentalize our engagement with Apple. We have a product 
engagement and we have a dispute over, really, the pri
ce of IP. And I think 
if you net that all together, we do have a lot of engagement with the 
company and we do speak and are engaged on a daily basis with them 
across multiple areas that I've mentioned.
 
But we try to compartmentalize those two discussions. 
And as I've said 
many times before, I think there are a lot of levers between the company to 
figure out things. I just think we're not at a point where we're announcing 
anything different, and I think we want to be upfront that this could take 
some time to
 
resolve. But we're working very hard on the product side to 
make sure that we continue to be a good supplier and a good showcase for 
our innovation products.

Hi, guys. Just one thing on NXPI. Do you still expect it to close in the year, 
in 2017?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes. We've said that we're still working to
wards closing in the year. But, 
clearly, we have some activities going on at regulators that are taking a bit 
longer than we thought. So we could see it slip into early 2018, but we're 
confident it's on track to close and are still working to close it in t
he year.
 
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh

Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
 
Got it. And on the second IT litigation, I know you guys haven't given a lot 
of color there. But do you expect it to get resolved at the same time as the 
Apple IP? Or do you think that's more of 
a mutual discussion that you're 
having outside court, and so that should see a faster resolution there? 
Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes. The second licensee, the facts and circumstances around that actually 
started before the other 
dispute and have issues that are unique to that 
licensee. And that will go play at its own pace and will be unrelated to 

 
unless it's coincidentally resolved at the same time as the Apple dispute.

Hey. Thanks, guys. I guess, another question on NXP, why not? So if we get 
through all the approvals, but the tender doesn't go through or is rejected, 
can you talk about what would 
cause you to walk away versus just raise the 
price? What would be the circumstances there?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes. Right now, we're really just focused on the regulatory close. We think 
$110 is a very full price. And I think as you saw on NXP
's earnings release, 
the management team there is also reinforcing that $110 is an attractive 
price for their stockholders as well. So, right now, we'll stay focused on just 
getting this thing to the finish line.

Unknown Speaker
 
Hi. This is Kristen Sharp in (36:53) for Romit. Thanks for taking my 
question. I apologize if this was asked e
arlier in the call, I'm juggling two 
concurrent calls right now. But going to QCT operating margins, I know you 
did very well in this quarter on that. Can you give any directional, I guess, 
guidance as for the trajectory for fiscal 2018 for operating margi
ns in QCT?
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
We are not putting out full year guidance, but we did give an indication of 
Q1, which again continues the strength in margins in QCT. 2017 was a very, 
very strong year. You saw EBT up over 50% and six straight qu
arters of 
margin expansion. So we think that the fundamentals of strong markets, 
strong products, growth in the adjacencies, are all factors that will continue 
into 2018 and help margins.

r question.
 
Brett Simpson

Arete Research Services LLP
 
Yes. Thanks very much. Just a question on the business structure at 
Qualcomm. I mean, when you consider the antitrust that's underway with 
regulators and the litigation with Apple now that's impacting
 
your chip 
market share and the issues with your other licensee, can you perhaps talk 
about the benefits that QTL, being combined with QCT, particularly after you 
close NXP, to become much more diversified chip business. What's the real 
benefit, do you thi
nk, of having the combined businesses there together? 
And is there scope for a fresh review into a potential split between QTL and 
the enlarged QTC?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Brett, hi, it's Steve. I would say it's something that we look at all
 
the time. 
We have, as you know, over the course of the company's history, looked at 
this in I think a formal way a number of times. But it's something that we 
always look at. And, however, I think I would just remind folks that we're 
now sitting here 

 
if
 
you look at what most people are working on in the 
company, we're trying to drive 5G and we're very excited about that. And I 
think that's good for both businesses and it's something that we think is 
going to have a long
-
term payoff for the company.
 
And I
 
think as you could tell from our actions, we really view the ability to 
drive both innovation ahead of the market and have a channel to move that 
into the market is very important. So that continues to be something we 
think contributes to long
-
term growth
, but it's also an area or it's a topic 
that we look at all the time to make sure that we are driving shareholder 
value as best we can. But nothing really to talk about here other than, I 
would say, the primary focus on driving 5G and what that means reall
y to 
our business structure is very important at the moment for us.
 
Brett Simpson

Arete Research Services LLP
 
And maybe just a quick follow
-
up for George. In the QTL business, you 
booked $95 million of additional revenue in non
-
GAAP for QTL for licensing
 
that wasn't in GAAP sales. Can you perhaps just talk about that and give us 
a sense for why QCT margins are falling sequentially at 18% midpoint for 
December quarter? Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
QUALCOMM, Inc.
 
Yes. We had a dispute settlement. And becaus
e the dispute settlement was 
with a customer, it has to be taken as counter revenue. So that was the 
difference between the GAAP and the non
-
GAAP revenue.

Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Steve, 
just on the 5G front, you've been perhaps a little bit more aggressive than 
some others in the ec
osystem talking about timeline. And, clearly, trials are 
coming up and you guys will have to be an integral part of those trials. I'm 
just kind of curious, how do you think about the timeline for 5G to be 
meaningful volume to the chipset business? And, I g
uess, equally important, 
to the extent that that might be 2020 or beyond, what can you do around 
the feature set and/or cost in 4G to kind of keep or maintain or even widen 
perhaps sort of (41:19) your dominant lead there?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
QUALCOMM, 
Inc.
 
Okay. I'll give you my perspective on it, which I think is, we're already in the 
position in the industry where the impact of 5G coming in 2019 is impacting 
the feature set even in 4G. So if you look at 4G, the push to Gigabit LTE 

 
and actually there
's even another update before we get to 5G that you'll see 
roll out into the networks.
 
So I would say, we're already in the early stages where it's very important 
to have that road map, not only to deliver products into 2019, but I think to 
be meaningful i
n the networks that lead up to that 2019 transition.
 
And so, if you're getting the sense that we are more aggressively pushing 
5G and the higher tier feature set of 4G, I think that will be an accurate 
read. I would also say that it's not just us, our OEM 
customers and, in 
particular, I would say leading tier, high tier Android OEMs are taking that 
modem feature set aggressively as well.
 
So we think that's a good strategic position to be in. We are driving it hard. 
And I think we're all going to be pleased 
with the initial ramps and the speed 
by which people are going to go to 5G, and we're certainly going to try to 
make that happen.

Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon everyone.
 
We are pleased to report a strong 
quarter especially in light of the 
challenging headwinds impacting the entire industry. Our fiscal first quarter 
results reflect continued execution by our team on the things within our 
control and influence. Our Q1 non
-
GAAP earnings of $1.20 per share wer
e 
$0.10 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue of $4.8 billion 
was in line with our guidance. Several positive trends enabled us to absorb 
the impact of general market weakness. Notably, number one, QCT's strong 
roadmap and financial performance
 
in the high
-
end; number two, QTL's 
second interim agreement with Huawei; and number three, lower than 
expected operating expenses, which includes the impact of our cost 
reduction initiatives.
 
Our business prospects remain very healthy as 5G begins to ramp
 
through 
the balance of this year and beyond. Our Snapdragon platform continues to 
outperform industry benchmarks and is well
-
positioned to successfully 
enable the low latency, high reliability and security requirements of 5G. We 
continue to extend this ex
pertise with handset OEMs and adjacent industries 
of compute IoT and auto.
 
Our Wi
-
Fi business continues to gain share against longstanding incumbents 
in enterprise. Reliable intelligent and secure Wi
-
Fi will be an important part 
of future 5G networks. And 
we've introduced innovative and differentiated 
solutions as the market transitions to Wi
-
Fi 6. In parallel, we remain focused 
on resolving our Apple and regulatory disputes.
 
Before I turn the call over to George to cover our results in more detail, I 
want 
to provide an update on some important legal milestones and our 
ongoing efforts to defend the value of our intellectual property and drive 
shareholder value. As most of you know, we are one of the main architects 
of the wireless ecosystem and our leading i
nvestments in R&D have 
positioned the company at the forefront of 2G, 3G, 4G and now 5G 
leadership. We have one of the largest patent portfolios in the industry with 
more than 130,000 patents and pending patent applications worldwide. And 
it is critical th
at we protect our IP and ensure that we are appropriately 
compensated for our inventions and investments. Through these various 
legal cases, we are working to ensure this happens.
 
Courts in China and Germany have found Apple to be infringing our patents 
co
nsistent with our prior messaging where the potential of multiple patent 
infringement rulings before the end of 2018. We are pursuing enforcement 
of the injunctions awarded by these courts and believe the decisions will be 
upheld on appeal. These favorable
 
rulings demonstrate Apple's infringement 
across a broad range of our patented technologies that are unrelated to 
modem chips, but are widely used in smartphones. We expect additional 
favorable patent infringement decisions in the coming months in the Unit
ed 
States, China and Germany as more of our cases go to trial.
 
In addition to our patent litigation there are more legal milestones ahead 
including the trial involving Apple and its contract manufacturers starting in 
San Diego in April and a separate case 
in California state court we filed to 
stop Apple's misuse and misappropriation of Qualcomm's trade secrets. We 
continue to believe that over the course of 2019, we will reach a resolution 
on the key outstanding issues in our disputes with Apple through set
tlement 
or litigation and we are prepared for both outcomes.
 
Yesterday, we concluded our arguments in the case with the FTC in the 
Northern District of California. As stated before, we believe that the FTC's 
case is based on a flawed antitrust theory and t
hat it failed to meet its 
burden of proof for its claims. You can access the transcript of our closing 
arguments and the related slide presentation on our Web Site at 
qualcomm.com/news.
 
Over the course of the trial, we made a strong showing that our licens
ing 
practices are consistent with industry norms have not harmed competition 
and in fact the industry is thriving. We have earned or maintained our 
leadership in the mobile wireless industry with superior foresight, investment 
and execution driving superio
r technology solutions compared with our 
competitors and we have never interrupted commercial shipments of modem 
chips to any customer in order to obtain unfair licensing rates.
 
Moreover, the evidence presented at trial proved that our agreements with 
Appl
e which expired over two years ago were run
-
of
-
the
-
mill incentive 
agreements that were actually demanded by Apple in order to win its 
business. The trial reinforce the important role we play in the mobile 
industry. This is especially critical now as we ent
er the early innings of 5G, 
the first mobile generation that is truly shaping industrial policy.
 
In summary, we are hopeful that the law and fact
-
based analysis will prevail 
in our FTC proceedings. In parallel, we continue to look for an opportunity to 
rea
ch a negotiated settlement with the FTC.
 
Let me now spend some time providing you an update on how we are 
driving the transition to 5G. We are extremely pleased with the growing 5G 
momentum around the world. In December, we hosted our annual 
Snapdragon Tec
h Summit and we're joined by leading 5G ecosystem 
partners, infrastructure vendors as well as device manufacturers. This level 
of representation from the mobile ecosystem is a testament to our broad 
industry commitment to 5G, our solutions and our leadersh
ip position. At the 
summit, we announced our new Snapdragon 855 mobile platform, the 
world's first commercial platform supporting multi
-
gigabit 5G and 
demonstrate an end
-
to
-
end 5G consumer experiences with real demos over 
live millimeter wave 5G networks a
nd devices.
 
We also announced that the Snapdragon 855 is gaining significant 
momentum with over 100 design wins in development. Since the summit, 
5G service has begun to roll out in Korea and the United States and as 2019 
progresses we anticipate continued
 
5G network launches in the United 
States, Europe, Japan, Australia and China. We are working with more than 
20 operators toward commercial rollout starting this year and we expect to 
be the 5G modem supplier of choice for the majority of the first wave of
 
5G 
devices.
 
In addition to commercial 5G service, device manufacturers are also ramping 
production of consumer 5G devices. At CES, we announced 30
-
plus 
commercial 5G mobile design wins based on our 5G chipsets. The majority 
of these designs are smartphone
s from global OEM featuring the Snapdragon 
855 mobile platform and the Snapdragon X50 5G modem family, which are 
expected to launch in the first half of 2019.
 
Notably, nearly all of the devices related to these 5G design wins use our RF 
front
-
end solutions
 
and we expect these design wins to have a meaningful 
positive impact to our RF front
-
end product line. Consistent with the past, 
3G and 4G transitions as 5G launches in 2019 across multiple geographies, 
we expect the carriers to play an active role in dri
ving the transition to 5G 
devices.
 
Turning to our adjacent opportunities, in automotive, we announced our 
third generation Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit platforms, which provide a 
multi
-
tier scalable architecture across tiers to expand the addressable 
mark
et for our infotainment solutions. Importantly, to an automotive 
manufacturer a scalable architecture delivers a consistent experience across 
budget to mid
-
tier to premium car lines.
 
We also launched the custom
-
built Snapdragon 8cx Compute Platform which 
r
epresents the largest generational performance increase ever for 
Snapdragon product. We look forward to growing this category with 
Microsoft and expect more announcements throughout the year.
 
In summary, in a challenging market QCT is continuing to execute
 
consistent 
with our expectations at the beginning of the year and we are looking 
forward to our upcoming product launches. Finally, I want to thank our 
employees for their hard work and focused execution. We continue to make 
great progress on our importan
t strategic objectives. We are driving the 
transition to 5G and we are leveraging our core technologies to expand our 
reach into many exciting new industries.
 
I would like to now turn the call over to George.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Steve and good afternoo
n everyone.
 
We are pleased to report solid results in our fiscal first quarter. Our revenues 
were $4.8 billion in the first quarter in line with our prior guidance and non
-
GAAP EPS of $1.20 was $0.05 above the high
-
end of our guidance range. 
Importantly, o
ur Q1 results include a new interim agreement with Huawei, 
which contributed $150 million of revenue in the quarter. As discussed last 
quarter, our Q1 guidance had not included any contribution from Huawei 
because the final payment under the previous inter
im agreement was 
recognized in retained earnings pursuant to our adoption of ASC 606 in Q1.
 
QCT delivered revenues of $3.7 billion and an EBT margin of 16% for the 
quarter above our prior guidance range of 13% to 15%. The operating 
margin reflects improvements in gross margins and lower operating 
expenses driven by our continued focus on driving 
operating efficiencies. 
MSM chip shipments of 186 million units came in modestly above the 
midpoint of our guidance range.
 
QTL generated revenues of $1 billion in the quarter including $150 million 
from the successful negotiation of the Huawei interim agre
ement. This new 
agreement was signed in our first fiscal quarter and runs through the third 
fiscal quarter of 2019.
 
Under the agreement, we will receive $150 million for each of those three 
quarters. Relative to our previous expectations, which had exclude
d any 
revenue from the interim agreement licensing revenues were lower by a 
$150 million to $200 million in the quarter. Given the headwinds facing the 
market broadly, we have reduced our global 3G, 4G device forecasts for the 
calendar year '18 to the low
-
end of our previous guidance range consistent 
with lower royalty units in the December quarter. Emerging regions and 
China were responsible for the largest shortfall in units relative to 
expectations although the lower levels of demand appear to be fairly 
widespread.
 
The weaker global unit market accounted for the majority of the revenue 
impact in the quarter along with some mix effects. Against this backdrop, we 
continued to demonstrate disciplined execution on our cost reduction plan. 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&
D and SG&A expenses were $1.56 billion down 15% 
sequentially and well below the low
-
end of the guidance range. Maintaining 
our focus on our OpEx efficiency remains a top priority and we're on track to 
deliver against our $1 billion cost reduction plan excl
uding excess litigation.
 
Expenses in the first quarter also benefited from lower than expected 
litigation spend due to timing and the effects of a weaker stock market on 
re
-
evaluation of deferred compensation allegation. As a reminder, there is a 
correspon
ding offset on the deferred compensation liabilities in our 
investment income. So there is no net EPS benefit.
 
Our non
-
GAAP tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 40%. This is in line 
with the benefit we included in our guidance for the quarter. Today, 
we have 
executed on $22.2 billion in share repurchases of the $30 billion 
authorization we announced last July. This includes $5.1 billion through a 
Dutch auction and $16 billion under our ongoing ASR programs executed in 
the fall of last year. As of today
 
January 30, the ASRs are approaching 40% 
completion and the average repurchase price to
-
date is approximately $61. 
As a reminder, the ASR settle at the average trading price less a discount 
over the life of the agreements. The ASR agreements are scheduled
 
to end 
in early September 2019.
 
Let's now turn to our financial outlook for the second fiscal quarter of 2019. 
We estimate fiscal second quarter revenues to be in the range of $4.4 billion 
to $5.2 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be approximatel
y $0.65 
to $0.75. We expect QTL revenues to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 
billion including the $150 million under the interim agreement. We expect 
the market factors that we saw in Q1 to persist with continued softness in 
the handset market and we
aker overall mix of devices.
 
We expect fiscal second quarter QTL EBT margin to be approximately 54% 
to 58%. In QCT, we estimate approximately $150 million to $170 million 
MSM chip shipments for the fiscal second quarter down sequentially as a 
result of typ
ical volume seasonality, market weakness particularly in the low 
and mid tiers, timing of OEM product launches and overall competitive 
dynamics. Lower MSM units admit in low tiers is offset by favorable product 
mix due to seasonality and broader adoption o
f our newly launched 
Snapdragon 800 chipset. We expect this mix shift to drive significantly 
higher revenue per MSM in the fiscal second quarter. We expect QCT EBT 
margins to be between 13% and 15%.
 
We anticipate fiscal second quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D
 
and SG&A 
expenses to increase by 6% to 8% sequentially due to higher litigation 
spend and the impact of the counter reset of normal employee tax costs. 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A sequential growth is also being 
impacted by the expected absence of the 
revaluation adjustment for our 
deferred compensation liabilities which benefited OpEx in Q1.
 
We remain on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings from our $7.4 billion 
baseline. At present, we have achieved approximately $850 million of 
savings toward 
our $1 billion target. However, due to excess litigation, we 
are tracking somewhat above the $6.4 billon run rate. Nevertheless, we are 
on track to deliver the $1 billion in operating savings and expect additional 
savings post licensing resolution as litig
ation costs come down.
 
Non
-
GAAP interest expense, net of investment and other income in the fiscal 
second quarter is expected to be approximately $100 million, which is in line 
with our prior guidance and is a reasonable estimate for each of the 
remaining 
quarters in fiscal 2019.
 
Turning to fiscal 2019, we expect our non
-
GAAP annual effective tax rate in 
fiscal 2019 to be approximately 0% and reflects both the run rate impacts of 
tax reform and the fiscal first quarter impacts of our tax restructuring. 
Excl
uding the first quarter benefit, we estimate a non
-
GAAP tax rate of 
approximately 12% for the rest of fiscal '19. We now expect calendar year 
2018 3G, 4G device estimates to be at the low
-
end of our prior guidance 
range. For calendar year 2019, we are revi
sing the device forecast to be in 
the range of 1.85 billion to 1.95 billion units which at the midpoint is a 
reduction of 50 million units from our prior forecast. This reduction is 
entirely attributable to handset market softness. We expect handsets 
shipm
ents to be up 1% percent year
-
over
-
year with non
-
handset devices 
driving overall unit growth up 5% at the midpoint of guidance. Despite this, 
we anticipate improving conditions for our chip business in the second half of 
the year as a result of new product
 
launches including devices with 5G 
chipsets and growth in our adjacent businesses.
 
That includes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mauricio.
 
Mauricio Lopez

Hodoyan
 
Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Se
ssion
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from the 
line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Q 
-
 
Chris Caso
 
Yes. Thank you. Just with regard to the MSM business and the guidance you 
provided, 
it looked like that had been running down about 20% year
-
on
-
year 
in December. I think your guidance reflects down 15% in March. Recognizing 
that that includes a rather large design loss, what would you characterize 
that the continuing business what would t
hat be running on a year
-
on
-
year 
basis is perhaps a better indicator of the underlying business?
 
George Davis
 
This is George. Chris you're correct in citing that the real difference year
-
over
-
year in Q1 was driven by the thin modem business share change at
 
Apple. We're actually seeing strong positioning in our products really 
everywhere else. And if we're seeing any weakness in the guide it's really in 
low tier units, which is partially seasonal and also just I think a reflection of 
the economy in China.
 
Cr
istiano Amon
 
This is Cristiano. We can add one thing. As George said we see that on the 
low end of the units, but we continue to see a favorable product mix towards 
the higher features smartphones and we expect that trend to continue 
especially important a
s we look at the launch of 5G technology towards the 
later part of '19 and 2020.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Walkley with 
Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Great thanks. I'm going t
o follow on to Cristiano's comments there at the 
end. Could you just update us about how we should think about revenue per 
MSM trends? Clearly a stronger mix implied in your guidance, but could you 
talk maybe about the RF attach rate and what this could do
 
to the 
calculation of revenue per MSM or maybe just talk about the RF opportunity 
and how much your RF business could grow as 5G takes off over the next 
couple of years? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Hey, Mike. It's George. Maybe I'll cover off on the 
revenue per MSM. What 
we're seeing is even with a softness in the marketplace our premium tier 
devices continue to be strong and growing both year
-
over
-
year and 
quarterly, which is really a testament to the new products. And we're also 
seeing continued str
ength in the high
-
end mid tier overall. So, revenue per 
MSM and in what is normally seasonally challenging second quarter is going 
to be quite healthy as your back of the envelope calculation is correct. It 
should be a very strong revenue per MSM and quart
er for us.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Mike let me just answer your second part on the RF front
-
end. We see right 
now our RF front
-
end business excluding the impact of Apple. Outside Apple 
continue to see growth continue to see double
-
digit growth rates in their 
busi
ness as we head into 2019. But most important, this trend of moving 
towards higher end devices especially with the transition of 5G is was one 
data point that we like for the absolute majority of the 5G designs we have 
on the recently announced 855 or the 
x50 modem, we have RF front
-
end 
attach and we're very pleased with their metric.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Wong with BMO 
Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Tim Wong
 
Thank you. If I could just ask 
a two parter on China. First, on the chip 
business there was some mention about macro and a challenging end 
markets would love your perspective on the market? And also, George I 
think you've mentioned for the QCT, the MSM sequential down competitive 
dynami
cs as one part of that. So, should we take that to read more low
-
end 
competition, or potential share loss in China?
 
And then, on the flip side, if we just get an update on the QTL business in 
China obviously the Huawei deal is pending, but could you talk a
 
little bit 
about compliance and just how the licensing deals are going with the rest or 
the longer tail of Chinese OEMs? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. So just to answer your question on the competitive dynamics. We 
continue to see pressure at some of the l
ower tier devices. And so, which we 
see down in Q2 some of it is we believe based on share loss and some is 
based on just the size of the market which you would typically see pullback 
seasonally on that. I would say China overall has been probably the 
--
 
w
hile 
it's been extremely good for Qualcomm overall, if we look at '18, compared 
to our expectations going into '18, demand in China has been substantially 
lower than we would have estimated for total demand in China not speaking 
to our share in this case w
hich has led us 
--
 
is one of the factors that led us 
to put the estimates for the calendar year '18 units down to the low
-
end of 
our guidance range from last quarter. I will let 
--
 
were you going to jump 

 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes. I'm was just going to add 
one thing. So, Tim on the chip business, I 
think there is, as George outlined, there's competitive dynamics on the low 
end. But the biggest factor really seasonality of product launches. So many 
of our customers probably have product launches in in the com
ing quarter 
and it's just typical seasonality. We've seen overall China has been a good 
story for us. And again, the most important thing is they move towards the 
higher end devices.
 
Alex Rogers
 
This is Alex stepping in on the QTL question. The story with 
China also is 
good on the QTL outside. Under our new 5G FTC licensing program, we now 
have over 35 new licensees or licensees signed up to the new agreements 
and amendments and a good significant number of those are Chinese OEMs. 
So, the licensing program 
is doing well in China including with respect to 
compliance.
 
Tim Wong
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stacy Rasgon with 
Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taki
ng my question. I wanted to ask about the revisions 
to your market outlook. So, you're taking your global units down I guess to 
the low
-
end of the range a few points versus where you were. But your QTL 
revenues right now excluding the Huawei settlement are
 
running 900 million 
give or take. That's more than 10% lower than your prior outlook which was 
like $1 billion to $1.1 billion. So how do I reconcile that I guess with your 
comments on where you're seeing the weakness in the market which seems 
to be more 
like a low end it seems to imply that ASPs would have to be 
down a lot given the revenue you're blushing since you're down more than 
the unit revision. I guess how do we think about the trends of units in ASPs 
playing out and what effect that's having on y
our QTL revenues right now.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. Really what you're seeing Stacy is the adjustment that comes from the 
change in reported units which is consistent with what we're seeing in the 
numbers that we're now using to revise our guide. I would also sa
y in 
--
 
you 
get some of the dynamics in our outlook that relate to how much in a given 
quarter is reflected by OEMs that are not paying on their licenses and 
reporting and those that are. And so, one of the things that you'll see is, 
we're actually 
--
 
whil
e we're seeing market conditions overall worsen in Q2 
when you adjust for the Huawei payment. We're seeing modest 
improvement in the underlying revenue for QTL. And that really reflects the 
fact of the mix of the parties in there.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Are you seei
ng improvement, I mean, in Q2 of last year actual Huawei 
pavement you did like 965 and you're guiding [indiscernible] Huawei 
payment, this time 900, it is still down pretty, decently isn't it?
 
George Davis
 
You're talking about Q2 in terms of an apples to a
pples comparison factor.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Yes.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. I think again I would say the market if I did apples to apples 
comparison, I would say the market is down basically modestly compared to 
that quarter where we had that very low demand 
quarter out of China that 
we talked about. And I think that's the biggest factor, but it's 
--
 
we do see it 
down somewhat but not as much as you might have expected because of 
dynamics in 
--
 
what was effectively Q3 last year.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
O
perator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Thanks guys. Good afternoon. I guess a couple of things. The first just to 
follow on to Stacy's question. I guess a lot of the d
ata that we're seeing is 
globally not related to your QTL revenues, but just globally out of the 
smartphone market isn't great. And I guess Cristiano talked about launches 
in the second quarter potentially that will help that. But an up 5% unit 
growth for 
the whole industry seems a bit aggressive. And maybe that 
embeds growth in auto and some other areas. So maybe you could talk a 
little bit about what you're seeing in the market that that leads you to think 
the smartphone market is going to grow this year?
 
And then, secondly, George any additional thoughts a lot of investors asking 
me about additional breakouts in QCT to reflect some of the adjacency 
businesses in the revenue versus just one line. Any thoughts that would be 
helpful. Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Yes. This is George. I'm going to take the 
--
 
I'll take a little bit on the device 
forecast. Just to be clear the up 5% includes non
-
handsets as well and that's 
where you're getting the growth 
--
 
the real growth year
-
over
-
year. We've 
said 1% growth in hand
sets over '18. And '18 was down 1% over '17. We're 
still seeing in our forecast we see continued softness we expect the 
developed handset demand to be down. We think that's the replacement 
rates as people start to think about 5G devices coming into the mar
ketplace. 
And then, you're not seeing as big a impact in '19 from China as you saw in 
'18. But you're also not seeing quite the growth in some of the other 
emerging markets including India. So, we see more modest growth out of 
the emerging markets in '19, 
but overall handsets. That puts you at about 
flat to 1%.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
This is Cristiano. Just want to add one important data point. So, you have 
the overall market dynamic, but then you have the chip business, one thing 
that we see happening when we thin
k of our China business and we see that 
accelerating as many of our customers had expended globally outside China 
domestic especially now from Southeast Asia, India and LATAM going into 
Europe, we've seen our customers starting business in U.K., Germany, 
S
pain, Italy, Portugal and France and that's an addition and it's a good trend 
to the chip business. Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
And we'll look to have I think a more robust discussion on the adjacent as 
we get to an analyst meeting which we think is the right 
environment to go 
into that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan 
Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
 
James Faucette
 
Great. Thank you very much. I want to turn back to some of the comments 
that Steve 
made around licensing in asserting Qualcomm's IP portfolio. You 
talked about China [indiscernible] cases there. Can you just update us as to 
what 
--
 
how you're feeling about the need to assert and eventually put in 
place IP licensing over non
-
essential IP 
for the Chinese OEMs. And that is 
the case with Apple have any implications there? This is my first question 
and I guess kind of related to that how are you thinking about or specifically 
as it relates to Huawei and the interim payment they are been making
. Can 
you give us an estimate of what Qualcomm estimates may be do under the 
previous licensing agreements? And help us understand what that delta 
might be. Thank you very much.
 
Donald Rosenberg
 
James. This is Don Rosenberg. I'll start, Alex may want to ch
ime in. So, with 
respect you 
--
 
good point about the value of our NEPs as well as SEPs they 
often seem to get lost in the discussion. You probably know that actually a 
majority of those 130,000 or so patents that Steve 
--
 
applications that Steve 
referred t
o earlier are in fact NEPs. Also, all the lawsuits we brought around 
the world against Apple involve NEPs non
-
essential patents. And as Steve 
has indicated, we've been very successful so far and we've got a number of 
cases that are going to be rolling out 
over the course of this year almost 
every month. There's a significant milestone in terms of either hearings or 
final rulings in Germany and China and in the U.S. and the ITC and district 
courts here.
 
So, the value of our overall portfolio is extraordinari
ly high. And it's certainly 
something we constantly think about when we look at our licensing program. 
And one point that I think people often miss is that we started this licensing 
program what almost three decades ago and there were no standard 
essential
 
patents in our portfolio at the time because we weren't even in the 
standard yet we were licensing that portfolio. We continued to license that 
portfolio essentially at the same terms as our patent portfolio grew with 
standard essential patents and non
-
st
andard essential patents into the 
numbers that Steve was talking about.
 
Alex Rogers
 
This is Alex. James let me just respond to some 
--
 
the first part of your 
question. I think Don is correct that we've demonstrated significant value in 
our non
-
essential pa
tents. But I think again you have to step back and take 
a look at what we've done over the last four years or so. We have really 
done a very good job of establishing an SEP only portfolio licensing program 
both inside of China and now outside of China. But
 
despite the fact that we 
continue to sign up significant numbers of SEP only licensees, we still have a 
very good number 
--
 
a very significant number of licensees that choose to 
keep portfolio wide agreements. And so that's a very significant mix in the 
o
verall licensing program. So, I think that the overall program is heading in 
the right direction. We've got a few issues to deal with in terms of the Apple 
litigation. But right now, I think the focus is on successfully establishing the 
5G program which we
 
have done over the course of the last 12 months.
 
In terms of the Huawei interim agreement that's a minimum non
-
refundable 
agreement. I don't know that I would get into the overall numbers in terms 
of what's at issue. I think we'll just leave it at that.

Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with 
Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi guys. Thanks for let me ask a question. I want to return to the QCT 
side, 
kind of a two
-
part question. First, last quarter when you guided, you cited 
not only the obvious issue sequentially with Apple, but also China inventory 
burns. So I want to see what the update was on that is the weakness you're 
pointing to in MSMs in
 
1Q. Just demand or is there inventory burn and if so 
how much longer will that last?
 
And then, the revenue per MSM side of the equation. obviously, a big pop up 
in your fiscal 2Q guide. How should we think about that continuing through 
the rest of the yea
r? Just the 5G side obviously come in as a tailwind, and 
then, how does China and answer to the first part of the question potentially 
weigh against that. Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Hey, Ross. This is George. Again, I think we've definitely seen sell
-
through 
ahead of sell
-
in continue in China. So, inventory continues to come down 
whether it reflects the new normal yet what we'll have to see, but that 
certainly was part of it. But again, the overwhelming year
-
over
-
year effect 
was just related to the one custome
r.
 
I think on revenue per MSM as we start to see 5G pickup and additional 
premium tier devices increase that's definitely going to be a tailwind for 
revenue per MSM. We haven't forecasted it out yet, but we think that'll 
certainly be a tailwind force both 
not only at the end of this year but as we 
go as we ramp 5G in 2021.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Hi. Thanks. Question for Steve
 
or George. There was a lot of testimony in 
the trial in the past couple of weeks that Apple wanted to buy your modem, 
but you would not sell it to them. That's for the current phones. But now, 
Intel is talking about the XMM 8160, which is going to ship in
 
the back half 
of this year. So obviously there's going to be a performance difference, but 
that's a 5G modem. So, is that enough to get them to the table? Is the 
performance difference enough? And then, I guess as a follow
-
on to that 
what would the deadli
ne be for them to settle, and then, be able to get your 
modem in their phone for the fall? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. I would say 
--
 
we feel very, very comfortable with where our 
roadmap is relative to the competitors. It doesn't mean there ar
en't a lot of 
competitors out there but we feel like we have a very, very strong position 
across the board. And if you look at a feature set, you look at power size 
everything. We feel very strong about it. In terms of when a person would 
need to make a de
cision, it's hard for me to say typically you need to make 
decisions kind of in the first quarter of this year if you're going to impact 
products that are going into next year. That would be my typical side, but I 
couldn't speak for other folks. Some OEMs 
particularly the Asian OEMs move 
a little bit more quickly but that would be my general sense for what the 
timing is.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Okay, Steve. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. 
Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Thanks for taking the question. Actually, maybe just following on that in 
terms of the 5G landscape you mentioned you had the majority that early 
wins here. Just kind of curious your visibility into next year and y
ou just 
comment on the landscape how diverse the 5G landscape would be next 
year in shipping phone?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Thanks. This is Cristiano. One of the things we like about 5G; 5G it's not a 
static target, it's a moving target. There is a multiple variati
ons of 5G 
capabilities. And as soon as we launch we continue to see that increasing 
from sub
-
six to millimeter wave to new cores and care aggregation and we 
have now basically line of sight to a number of devices that will be 
continuously being added to th
e market as we have most developed 
economies launching 5G in the second half of '19. So, we're very optimistic 
about how fiscal '20, how significant 5G will be for us.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
This is Steve. I might add one other thing to that which is 
--
 
don't 
--
 
there 
are a number of different mode changes. If you look at how the network will 
operate and the number of bands that you need to deal with between now 
and really the next 24 months. So 
--
 
and I think if you're not involved in that 
at the beginning you'r
e going to have a very difficult time, I think fielding a 
solution that is competitive at any given time if you show up too late that's 
one of the advantages of being early and one of the reasons why we try to 
make sure that we're there. The other aspect I
 
think that we should also 
acknowledge is that I think there's a lot of concern early on with 5G, as 
would the handsets be at the right size or would they be at a size that that 
people would find attractive particularly given all the RF complication that 
e
xists.
 
And what we have seen from early indications that is not something to be 
worried about. They are very, very attractive ideas. So, I think it's going to 
be really an important part of the industry. The other aspect that I just 
make sure people rememb
er about 5G is the economics to the operator. 
They really have an incentive to push this. And I think you're going to not 
only see that in the handsets, you're going to see that in the people selling 
the devices, the channels that the salespeople will be i
ncentivized to press 
5G. And so, we look forward to having that happen over the next year or so.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
And please stay tuned to this year of Mobile World Congress. I think will be 
very exciting in this area.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess if I could 
squeeze two in. First one, as you think about non
-
handset growt
h driving 
the up 5%. Could you share with us what the implied non
-
handset unit 
growth is and how you think about the implications to both royalties and 
MSM ASP. And then just as a quick follow
-
up question, based this question 
on QTL, I think you're guiding
 
that up 3% at the midpoint. I'm a little 
surprised it's higher Q
-
on
-
Q given the FX headwinds and unit volumes out 
there, are there any sort of catch up payments or things like that we should 
be considering in there. Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Now no real big
 
anomalies in that respect. So, it's really more the mixed 
element that we talked about. In terms of non
-
handset growth again to get 
to 5% overall growth, you've got to see something like 27% growth in the 
non
-
handsets to get to that. That is largely drive
n by growth in IoT. 
Obviously, you still see growth in everything from automotive to compute. 
But, it's really IoT and we're certainly seeing strong growth in industrial IoT 
in our own business there.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question is from the line 
of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Thank you for taking my question. Steve, I want to go back to your 
comment about the FTC litigation. You said you're still negotiating with FTC. 
And given that the closing ar
guments are done, do you think you have 
enough time to reach a potential settlement, and then, how are you feeling 
about it? And then, hypothetically if the ruling were to go against you, what 
are some of the options that you have going forward? And then, 
in the 
interim, I do think 
--
 
do you anticipate any changes to your business model? 
Well if you are appealing or any other options that you're exploring?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Sure. Well, I'll take the first part of that and then maybe ask Don to jump in 
on the
 
second part. With respect to settlement talks with the FTC as you 
might imagine we have been engaged with them for some time. We continue 
to be engaged. And if we think that we can find a resolution we would take 
that to try to remove this risk off the ta
ble not a statement on how we feel 
about our case. But as you might imagine this is an important element and 
we continue to work it. I think the judge gave some direction at the end of 
trial in terms of when she might rule. And I would just point you to th
at in 
terms of timing, but we have the ability to continue to work this and as you 
would expect we are.
 
Donald Rosenberg
 
Yes. This is Don, Srini. With respect to the judge's comments at the end, she 
didn't actually say when she would rule, but she did indi
cate over the last 
couple of hearings that this is a complicated case and she'll probably take 
more time than she might otherwise. We think we've put on an 
extraordinarily strong case here, so we're not obviously going to comment or 
predict outcomes when a
 
case is now before the judge for ruling. But I can 
only tell you that we think that the government failed to prove what we 
thought was an ill
-
conceived theory. They still had a burden. We don't think 
they supported it with any convincing evidence at all. 
Indeed, I think we 
made the case as this industry and these people know 
--
 
you people on this 
call know for a very competitive industry that we have facilitated over the 
years through our licensing program. And so, we are hoping for obviously a 
victory her
e. And that's what we are focused on and we are not going to talk 
about possibilities until we faced them.
 
I would say this, the judge, as she indicated this is the complicated case and 
based on what she has been asked and not asked by the FTC for in terms
 
of 
a ruling. It's going to have to a weight a particular ruling if she would go the 
other way because there are multiple variations of what that ruling might be 
and so we couldn't comment on the possibilities.
 
Srini Pajjuri
 
Fair enough. Thank you.
 
Operato

Thank you. This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. 
Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes. Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining us today. This would be I think 
a very importan
t quarter not only due to legal milestones but also just 
continued innovation from the team and continued milestones for 5G. 
Thanks everybody from Qualcomm for working so hard. And we will talk to 
you again next quarter. Thank you.

Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered a strong 
quarter, achieving record revenues and non
-
GAAP operating income. QCT 
shipped a record number of MSM chipsets and delivered our highest ever 
revenue and earnings before tax. Q
TL operating performance was ahead of 
expectations and I am pleased to report that we have resolved our 
previously disclosed dispute with a large Chinese licensee. We are continuing 
to cooperate with the NDRC, as it conducts its investigation and believe i
t is 
progressing toward a resolution. During the quarter we also returned 
approximately $2.4 billion to stockholders through dividends and buyback 
activity, consistent with our increased capital return targets.
 
Turning to QCT, our first fiscal quarter was 
very strong with revenues in 
MSM chip shipments up 14% and 27% year
-
over
-
year respectively. MSM 
chip shipments were at the high end of our expectations as we saw broad 
strength across multiple OEMs, driven by demand in emerging regions and 
strong device re
placement in the U.S.
 
While our outlook for the first half of the fiscal year is ahead of our prior 
expectations, our QCT forecast for the second half of the fiscal year has been 
reduced due to a number of factors. First, we are currently seeing a shift in
 
share among OEMs at the premium tier, which has reduced the near term 
addressable opportunity for our Snapdragon processors and has skewed our 
product mix towards more modem chipsets in this tier. Second, we now 
expect that our Snapdragon 810 processor wi
ll not be in the upcoming 

both volume and content in that device.
 
And thirdly, although we had a very strong competitive position exiting fiscal 
2014, we are seeing heightened co
mpetition in China at the mid and high 
tiers. We are continuing to gain share year
-
over
-
year with OEMs based in 
China, but not at the pace we had previously expected. This is in part due to 
some product challenges with one of our chips in meeting some of t
he more 
demanding design points of those tiers. This has provided an opening to 
competitors who are being very aggressive in order to establish a position in 
the marketplace, resulting in more pricing pressure than previously 
expected.
 
We have already addr
essed many of the initial product challenges in order to 
support early customer device launches in these tiers and are continuing to 
further enhance the performance of this chip. As a result, we continue to 
expect to see a broad range of devices successful
ly launch and drive volume 
with this chip. We estimate that these factors will impact our QCT revenue 
growth and operating margins through the near term product cycles. 
However despite these near term factors, our view of the long
-
term strategic 
environmen

 
Despite 
--
 
our design momentum for the Snapdragon 810 processor remains 
robust, with more than 60 products in the pipeline, including the recently 
announced LG G Flex2 and the Xiaomi Mi Pro Note. Snapdragon 8
10 is 
performing well and we look forward to a growing number of devices to be 
launched by our customers throughout the year. Snapdragon 810 delivers 
64 bit CPU capability using licensed technology and is fabricated in 20 
nanometer. As you know, the use of
 
internally designed custom CPUs has 
been a core part of our strategy that has worked well for some time. With 
the 810 we made a conscious decision to use licensed cores to accommodate 
the accelerated shift to 64 bit. The competitive landscape has undersco
red 
the importance of differentiation associated with our internal custom designs 
and looking ahead, our next premium processor will use our own 64 bit 
custom CPU architecture as well as the most advanced process node. We 
expect this product to sample in t
he latter half of calendar 2015.
 
In China, the expanded FDD licenses increased competition between 
carriers, and the accelerated pace of LTE device penetration aligns with 

three prim
ary reasons. First, we expect a modem transition driven by LTE 
Advanced, including uplink carrier aggregation will drive a new device design 
cycle beginning later this year, which our roadmap anticipates. Second, we 
will drive our roadmap to advanced perfo
rmance nodes to enable us to 
competitively address the opportunities ahead. And finally we are 
differentiated both in terms of features and scale, which will allow us to help 

related to
 
expanding their businesses outside of China.
 
For Qualcomm overall, our longer
-
term growth drivers remain strong, both 
in smartphones and adjacent areas where our mobile technologies and 
capabilities can bring next generation solutions; areas such as autom
otive, 
Internet of Things, mobile computing, networking, small cells and datacenter 
solutions. As a Consumer Electronics Show, it was clear that many industries 
looking to leverage mobile technologies into their products and businesses 
are looking to the l
eaders in mobile such as Qualcomm for support creating 
an Internet of Everything. We demonstrated a broad set of products and 
equipment that are already shipping with Qualcomm solutions inside, 
including the areas of automotive, smart home, smart city, net
working, 
mobile healthcare and wearables.
 
On a related note, the very strong results of the AWS
-
3 spectrum auction 
here in the U.S. reinforces the need to continue to invest in cutting edge 
modem technologies that provide great user experiences, while help
ing 
operators improve their return on the spectrum asset investments. We are 
very well positioned to enable operators and OEMs to bring new spectrum 
bands online as quickly and as broadly as possible with technologies such as 
advanced carrier aggregation.
 
I would like to now turn the call over to Derek Aberle.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you Steve and good afternoon everyone. QTL delivered a strong 
quarter with revenue and earnings ahead of expectations and total reported 
device sales of $56.4 billion, which was sli
ghtly above the midpoint of our 
prior guidance. I am also pleased to report that we have resolved the 
dispute with major Chinese licensee that we previously disclosed. 
Importantly, we were able to successfully resolve this dispute despite the 
pending NDRC 
investigation. In addition to the licensee agreeing to report 
and pay royalties on past unreported sales, the resolution includes an 
expansion of the existing license agreement to include royalty bearing 
licenses for 4G only products, including 3
-
mode LTE 
smartphones sold for 
use in China.
 
We believe the licensee has fully reported its September quarter shipments 
in our first fiscal quarter and we expect the licensee to report in our second 
fiscal quarter a catch up for units that were sold in periods prior
 
to the 
September quarter, but were not previously reported due to the dispute. We 
continue to believe that some of our Chinese licensees are not reporting all 
of their sales of licensed products. We have increased the number of audits 
that we are conducti
ng of these licensees and are attempting to resolve the 
instances of under reporting.
 
While we always prefer to resolve these types of issues amicably with our 
licensees, we are of course prepared to enforce our rights under our license 
agreements if that 
becomes necessary. Although we continue to sign new 4G 
only and other license agreements, including in China and the recent 
resolution of the licensee dispute gives us even greater confidence that we'll 
be able to collect royalties over time on substantial
ly all LTE device 
shipments, including 3
-
mode devices in China, and other currently 
unlicensed products. OEMs supplying a meaningful portion of 3
-
mode 
devices and lower Tier 3G connected tablets remained unlicensed. We are in 
discussions with many of these
 
OEMs and are making progress, but we 
expect it will take some time to conclude all of the negotiations.
 
As to the NDRC investigation we are continuing to engage and fully 
cooperate with the NDRC as it conducts its investigation. We have discussed 
with the
 
NDRC a number of proposals for addressing its concerns and we 
believe we are making progress towards a potential resolution. Having said 
that, the timing and outcome of any potential resolution remains uncertain 
as does the potential impact on our future 
business in China.
 
Now let me provide an update of our view of global 3G/4G device demand. 

healthy pace and we have increased our calendar global 3G/4G device 
shipment estimate to appr
oximately 1.35 billion units, up approximately 
25% year
-
over
-
year. As a reminder, this includes those devices we expect to 
be reported to us through the first calendar quarter of 2015 as well as our 
estimates of unreported and unlicensed device sales, but 
excludes TD
-
SCDMA devices that do not implement LTE. The broad availability of 
compelling devices at the mid and low price tiers in emerging regions is 

seeing an increase in the replaceme
nt rate of devices in the United States.
 
Looking forward, we are also increasing our estimate for calendar 2015 
global 3G/4G device shipments. We now expect approximately 1.5 billion to 
1.6 billion units to be shipped during 2015, up approximately 11% to 1
9% 
year
-
over
-
year, with a bias towards the high end of the range driven by 
continued positive upgrade trends in the United States and accelerating 
migrations to 3G/4G devices in China, and other emerging regions.
 
As we explained last quarter, several facto
rs primarily related to challenges 
in China are currently causing shipments reported by our licensees to be less 
than the global 3G/4G unit shipments I just explained. For calendar year 
2014 we are increasing our estimate of reported 3G/4G devices to betwe
en 
1.135 billion and 1.175 billion units, which is approximately 200 million units 
below the global 3G/4G device estimate of approximately 1.35 billion units 
at the mid
-
point. This represents our current view of unreported and 
unlicensed activity for calen
dar year 2014, and after adjusting for resolution 
of the dispute, is in line with our prior expectation of the percentage of 
global device shipments that we expect to be unreported or unlicensed.
 
Turning to estimated 3G/4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices r
eported to QTL 
during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 was approximately $197 at the mid
-
point. The sequential decline in the reported ASP was primarily driven by a 
weaker premium tier in the September quarter, ahead of new flagship 
launches, heavier price
 
reductions of certain handset models, additional 
reported units from the Chinese licensee whose dispute we resolved and 
foreign exchange effects.
 
In the second fiscal quarter, we expect both the global and reported ASPs to 
be higher sequentially as the st
rong holiday season at the mid and high
-
tiers 
more than offset some additional foreign exchange headwinds. We expect 
the reported ASP will be significantly impacted by the dilutive effects of catch 
up units sold during several prior periods that we expect 
to be reported in 
the second quarter as a result of resolution of a licensee dispute.
 
We are now forecasting global 3G/4G device ASPs to decline approximately 
12% to 13% year
-
over
-
year in fiscal 2015 instead of our previous estimate 
of 9% to 10%. With the 
delta being driven by stronger than expected unit 
growth in emerging regions, the September quarter pause in the premium 
tier, increased OEM competition and mix shifts and negative effects of 
foreign exchange, which alone contributes approximately $2 of th
e ASP 
decline. Within this overall view we are seeing relative stability in developed 
region ASPs as well as increasing ASPs from Chinese based OEMs.
 
In total we expect global 3G/4G device sales in fiscal 2015 to be up 
approximately 6% to 9% over fiscal 20
14 global 3G/4G device sales, which 
is in line with previous expectations as the growth in volume from an 
increase in the replacement rates in the U.S. and accelerated emerging 
region migration offsets moderately increased ASP declines, including the 
expec
ted impact of foreign exchange headwinds.
 
To conclude, we continue to see strong 3G/4G device demand from both 
higher replacement rates and faster 2G to 3G/4G migration. We are pleased 
to have resolved the previously disclosed dispute with the major Chines
e 
licensee, and we remain focused on resolving our remaining challenges in 
China.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to George Davis.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you Derek and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter results 
came in 
above expectations on better than expected operating performance 
from both QCT and QTL. Fiscal first quarter revenues were a record $7.1 
billion, up 7% year
-
over
-
year and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $1.34, 
up 6% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Non
-
GAAP earnings per s
hare were $0.10 above the $1.24 mid
-
point of our 
prior guidance range. QCT accounted for approximately half of the upside on 
strong MSM demand and lower operating expenses, with the balance coming 
from improved total reported device sales, lower operating 
expenses in QTL 
and other businesses, as well as the restatement of the R&D tax credit. In 
QTL total reported device sales by our licensees were $56.4 billion, slightly 
above the mid
-
point of our guidance range, with an average selling price of 
$197 at the
 
mid
-
point and reported shipments of 286 million 3G/4G based 
devices at the mid
-
point.
 
QCT achieved a number of records in this quarter including shipments of 270 
million MSMs, revenues of $5.2 billion and earnings before tax of $1.1 
billion. Revenue for M
SM was lower sequentially as expected, reflecting a 
greater mix of modems. QCT operating margin was 22% in the fiscal first 
quarter, reflecting strong MSM shipments and lower operating expenses. For 
the Company overall, non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expen
ses were 
lower than our expectations, decreasing 3% sequentially, reflecting timing of 
certain program spending and cost initiatives in the quarter.
 
Turning to capital structure, during the fiscal first quarter, we returned 
approximately $2.4 billion to st
ockholders, or 112% of free cash flow, 
including approximately $700 million of dividends paid and approximately 
$1.7 billion in stock repurchases. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, we 
had approximately $3.6 billion remaining of our stock repurchas
e 
authorization. Additionally, since the end of the fiscal first quarter, we have 
repurchased an additional 6.8 million shares for approximately $500 million.
 
Cash flow from operations was approximately $2.4 billion or 33% of 
revenues and we ended the fisc
al first quarter with cash and marketable 
securities of $31.6 billion. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate was 18% in the fiscal first 
quarter and we now estimate that our fiscal 2015 non
-
GAAP tax rate will be 
approximately 18%, slightly higher than our original estimat
es on business 
mix.
 
Now turning to our guidance for fiscal 2015, our revised financial guidance 
for the fiscal year reflects a reduced outlook for the QCT business in the 
second half of the fiscal year. We now expect 2015 total Qualcomm revenue 
to be in th
e range of $26 billion to $28 billion, up approximately 2% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint and lower than our previous guidance midpoint by 
$800 million. We now expect 2015 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the 
range of $4.75 to $5.05, down approximately
 
7% year
-
over
-
year at the 
midpoint and down 6% from our previous full year guidance midpoint. We 
estimate fiscal 2015 QCT operating margins will now be in the range of 16% 
to 18%, which reflects a reduction of about 200 basis points at the midpoint.
 
Our QT
L forecast for the fiscal year is modestly improved, driven by an 
improved TRDS outlook, partially offset by a modest increase and the impact 
of foreign exchange. We continue to expect that fiscal 2015 QTL operating 
margins will be approximately 85% to 86%
. Combined non
-
GAAP, R&D and 
SG&A expenses are expected to grow approximately 3% to 5% year
-
over
-
year, in line with prior expectations. As a reminder, we continue to expect 
lower investment income in fiscal 2015 as compared to the strong 
investment gains s
upported in fiscal 2014 as we rebalance the risk levels in 
our investment portfolio.
 
Looking to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we estimate 
revenues to be in the range of approximately $6.5 billion to $7.1 billion, up 
approximately 7% y
ear
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share in our second fiscal quarter to be approximately $1.28 to 
$1.40 per share, up approximately 2% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We 
anticipate second fiscal quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D 
and SG&A 
expenses will be up 6% to 8% sequentially, reflecting normal increased 
seasonal expenses primarily related to employee payroll taxes.
 
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $69.5 billion to $75.5 
billion will be reported by our license
es in the March quarter for shipments 
they made in the December quarter, up approximately 9% year
-
over
-
year at 
the midpoint, reflecting the busy holiday season. We also expect to see a 
benefit from previously uncollected royalties for prior period sales re
lated to 
the resolution of a customer dispute in China.
 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 220 million to 240 
million units during the March quarter, down approximately 15% at the 
midpoint sequentially coming off the busy holiday quarter 
and up 
approximately 22% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect revenue per 
MSM to be relatively flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter. We expect QCT operating 
margin to be approximately 16% to 17% in the fiscal second quarter, lower 
sequentially, reflecting the im
pact of lower seasonal volumes.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Warren.
 
Warren Kneeshaw
 
Thank you, George. Brent, we are ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator Instructions) Your first question come
s from the line of James 
Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
 
James Faucette
 
I guess I just want to focus on operating margins for QCT, et cetera. Can 

--
 
for th
e 
year, like how you're having to spend additional funding or spend additional 
money versus just pricing pressure and that kind of thing. And I'm also 
wondering if you can talk through more medium to long run what you think 
your to do list looks like to re
capture the loss share and better reassert 
yourself in the markets where you're feeling the most pressure. Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
This is George. Really the out margin effect in the near
-
term that we're 
talking about is really typical seasonal, coming off
 
of a very strong 
December quarter. For the full year the reduction of the 200 basis points we 
talked about is really a function of the change in outlook for the year, which 

pressur
e. You're also seeing some of the OpEx benefit we saw in the first 
half was really timing of programs, and so that will be in the second half of 
the year, impacting margins as well.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And this is Steve. With respect to the medium tier, long 
tier, or long
-
term I 
think I would view this more as a product cycle issue versus anything else. If 
you look at 
--
 
one of the hardest things for us do is to project what the mix 
is going to be, whether we're going to sell a lot of thin modems or whether 
it

terms of the change of the outlook is really due to the mix of products. As I 
said in my remarks, the 810 is actually doing quite well. Any concerns about 
the 810 in terms of design tr
action really are probably limited to one OEM 
versus anything else.
 
In the low tier in China it's very competitive right now, primarily because 
there are a number of new entrants trying to get share. We think there will 
be a modem transition in the second 
half of this year and we are anticipating 
that. We think that will be a good strategy. I think long
-

think we see a change in the competitive dynamic, or even a change in the 
strategy of particular customers. We think this is more of a 
product issue.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. 
Please go ahead with your question.
 
Brian Modoff
 
Steve, off that last statement you made in terms of modem transition in the 
back half of the year, can 
you give us more color around this? Is this still 20 
nanometer? Is it going to be more of a 16? How is it going to different? And 
then what you're seeing competitively in China? Are you seeing competitors 
coming with something more than a 3
-
mode solution? 
Are you seeing 
something more advanced than that? And then on George, the question, or 
Derek, this licensee that you settled with in China, can you give us an idea 
of what the rates are for that licensee? Is it around your corporate average 
and it does inc
lude single mode LTE as well, and an ability to collect on that 
as well as collect on multimode that includes TD
-
SCDMA.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
So Brian in China, we're not seeing anything different than really 3
-
mode in 
China. We're not seeing much ability for t
he competitors to go outside of 
China. And we have anticipated that carrier aggression would be important 
in China across tiers and we think that that will happen here sometime in the 

ina, but 

really kind of year
-
over
-
year, we're still going to see share move up in China 

exacerbated by t
he pricing pressures as I mentioned. And so we're looking 
forward to see a modem transition. We will follow that up with FinFET 
products. Eventually we are going to transition our existing products to 
move advanced nodes but I'll try to keep some of that p
roprietary for us 
right now.
 
Derek Aberle
 

agreement, including the rates, but I guess I'll just say that we're pleased 
with the resolution of the dispute. As I said we believe 
that in this quarter 
the licensee has now reported sort of the full volume that they were 
supposed to report under their agreement. They will also we expect be 
reporting a catch up amount for prior period sales next quarter. That will 
benefit for us. And t
hen we were able to extend the scope of the agreement 
to your question, to include LTE only licenses. This particular licensee was 
already licensed for 3G, but we've now extended that to include 4G
-
only, 
including the 3
-
mode devices sold on China mobiles n
etwork. So all
-
in
-
all, 
we feel very good about the result.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital 
Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Tim Long
 
Just one follow
-
up and another one if I could. If we could just go
 
back to 
the, maybe George, the $800 million revenue reduction and $0.30 in 
earnings, it seems like pretty large incremental margin implied there. So 
maybe you can just walk us through how there is that big of an impact on 
that type of revenue mix? And the
n I loved the opinion of you guys on this 
Xiaomi
-
Ericsson deal in India, where you guys 
--
 
Xiaomi allowed to ship with 
your products in there. Just curious what do you think that means for the 
chipset business for the Chinese to export, and does it mean an
ything for 
the licensing business and potential discussions with NDRC? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
Hi Tim, this is George. So on the flow through issue, which is essentially 

seeing
 
is the fact that while we describe kind of three themes in terms of 

impact the premium tier that are driving the impact. And so the margin flow 
through impact on that revenue is in
 


place a where we have strong operating margins.
 
Derek Aberle
 

co

Chinese OEMs build their businesses outside the China. That comes 
obviously both from a product perspective, in terms of our scale and ability 
to do that, as well as the cross licen

negotiated agreements over the years and I think you're seeing some of that 
play out now in India.

have at our disposal to deal with companies that are not complying with 

going on in India as just one example of the tools that are available.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord 
Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Just for Steve, going back to the QCT guidance, can you update us on 

r guidance with the 
mix shift? And also just longer term, on a bigger picture view, which 
Qualcomm's long
-
term business model really has been about increasing 
dollar content or revenue per MSM over time. After this product cycle, some 
of the misses do you 
think this metric can return to growth in fiscal 2016? 
Thank you.
 
George Davis
 

effectively what we did say it will be relatively flat quarter

over

quarter. For 
the full year in the se
cond half, again pointing to the premium tier waiting of 

that.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

difference in te
rms of what the market is looking for. In fact I would suggest 
that even though our mix is probably more in modem versus Snapdragon 
based, the overall market appears to be absorbing new technology quite 
rapidly, even to the point where it appears that perh
aps even in certain 
tiers, the replacement rate is improving, because people are upgrading to a 

business both on a licensing side as well as the chip side eventually.
 
I want to be cl
ear. I think 
--
 
the 810, we think is going to be quite strong in 
terms of design traction, and they will be in a lot of devices. As I said, it will 
be over 60 devices. And it will be interesting to see how it sell through. But 

sense that you still have to provide leadership 
technology in order to win.

Ehud Gelblum
 
A couple of questions. Can we just hit at the heart of the 
810 issues, 
obviously been lot of news in the press about overheating and if you can just 
kind of hit on your 
--
 
just want to confirm, is it your opinion or thought 
process that the issues with that flagship device happened on a compatibility 
issue or inco
mpatibility issue between the 810 and that particular device and 
that in any other device those issues are not a concern? If you can just give 
us a little detail on why that might be, to let us get a feeling as to, maybe 
there is nothing particularly wrong
 
with 810 per say, but that it just 
happened to be a matchup with that one device, that would be helpful.
 
George, or Derek, now that you have that licensee signed up, can you give 
us sense as to how large is this catch up going to be next quarter and is th
at 
in guidance, so we can kind of take that out and get a sense as to what the 
pure guidance for next quarter will be without that catch up. And your new 
numbers for the recognized volume for 2014 I believe it was, included just 
20 million higher than it w
as before. So 195 million is the delta between the 
recognized and unrecognized TRDSs whereas now 
--
 
so now it's 195. Last 

million improvement and the difference between the global
 
TRDS and your 
recognized TRDS, is that all due to this one licensee. Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Ehud, this is Steve. On the 810, let me be very clear. The device is working 
the way that we expected it work and we have design traction that 
reflects 
that. If you look at the number of designs, it's over 60. It's essentially won 
all the premium designs across multiple ecosystems in China, Windows 

performing. There is a concern.
 


changed fundamentally between us and that OEM. And of course that OEM 
has a number of different models that we feel well positioned across our 
e
ntire product tiers.
 

that up as I mentioned in my script with a device that returns to our 
internally developed CPU with integrated modem and are going at the latest 
node. So, I d

pleased with that device. We just wish it had won one more design.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Ehud, its Derek. So you might recall that when we gave prior guidance, just 
given the amount of issues that were on th
e table and the uncertainty 
associated with the timing of resolution of each of those, we gave quite a 
wide range and said to get towards the higher end of the range we needed 
to resolve or make progress on several of them. So in essence, the 
resolution of
 
the dispute was already baked into guidance from that 
perspective. The catch
-
up payment is also effectively included within the 
guidance that we provided for Q2.
 
On the math exercise, I actually figured somebody was going to ask this 
question. So let me t
ry to break it down for you. Remember we gave quite a 
wide range of the under
-
reported or unreported amount, because again 
there is uncertainty around exactly what that would be. And everybody kind 
of gravitated towards using the midpoint of 215 as the tal
king point, 

than we do on other parts of the range. And the way you get to the 215 is 
sort of assuming at the low end of the range there is no resolution with this 
particular licensee, 
and at the high end of the range assuming that there 
would be full resolution. So the midpoint is actually something in between.
 

there. But let me just basically tell you, the net
-
ne
t of all this is, there is an 
improvement based on resolution of the dispute. So therefore less units 
being under
-
reported. But also the overall end market we believe, is going 
to grow at a faster pace than we did during the last time we provided 
guidance.
 
And so even though the percentage of units that we believe will be 
unreported is basically staying in line with our prior expectation, the actual 
number of units would have gone up, but for the resolution. So the net
-
net 
of this is it comes down, but it d

Derek, just o

maybe what portion of that is China? And then as a follow up for George, 
just on capital return, the stock is down now sort

the same run rate that you bought back during the entirety of calendar Q4.

Derek Aberle
 
Tim, its Derek. So I think on your first question, really the growth in the 
market is primarily coming from a stronger view on emerging regions, which 
includes China, 

Middle East and Africa and some others are contributing to that as well.
 
George Davis

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. 
Please go ahead with your question.
 
Stacy Rasg
on
 
I have two. First, I want to take a little bit of exception to the 
--
 
your point 
that the unit TAM is going up. It looks like the unit TAM is going up, but for 
the global market. But your global ASPs, you guided them down quite a bit. 
They were down 9 t

took your estimate for the global market value up that all. So all of these 

revenue growth upside versus where you were modeli
ng before. So how 
should we be thinking about I guess the impact of elasticity here in units and 
growth and how do we think about the market growth going forward?
 

--
 
doing your 
best to enable t
he China OEMs to grow outside of China. And maybe you 

Maybe get back to the first one, what does it mean for the long term 
business as the China OEMs gain share outside of China and s
tart to take 
share in potentially developed markets with ASPs that are probably quite a 

 
Derek Aberle
 
Stacy, its Derek. On the market growth, effectively when we think back to 
the discussion we had in New Yor
k, really what we said is about 6% to 9% 
global TRDS growth, and we had a view on what ASPs would do throughout 

really view this fundamentally as an elasticity of demand exercise, and a
s 
ASPs come down, that units would go up. So even if there was an increasing 
pressure or decline on the ASP in the next year or so, that would drive 

are playing out. The growth in
 
the market overall from a TRDS perspective is 

little different mix in terms of units versus ASP.
 
And you might recall we did talk about a number of factors, which we think 
long
-
term cause the ASP declines to moderate. And I think that also applies 
to your comment on the Chinese OEMs. I think a couple of things we expect 
will happen over time. One is that there is going to be consolidation among 
the Chinese OEM base. There's just
 
really too many players to sustain 
themselves long
-
term. And if that happens, as well as they become more 
successful outside of China, invest in building their brand, invest more in 
R&D, that there is no reason that their pricing profile would not become 
more in line with what we're seeing from some of the other OEMs today. And 
actually we commented on that today in the scripts, that we actually are 
starting to see Chinese OEM ASPs increase.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Stacy, its Steve. I think also you should think 
about the Chinese OEMs really 
as being multiple tiers. We see a grouping that in many ways is filling in 
some of the gaps that are being left because some handset manufacturers 
that historically have been in the United States and Northern Europe or even 
in
 
Japan have exited portions of the world, and they've been filled in largely 
by some of the higher tier Chinese OEMs and they have strong ambitions 
and they're really developing the assets to be able to do that. In addition 
there is a lower tier product wh
ich I think is being used really to drive the 
migration from 2G to 3G/4G and both of those trends we think are good for 
our business.

Do you have any sense of your lead against your major competitor there on

It's Steve. I'll try to stay away from ta

our

it was 
important to disclose how it impacted our financials with respect to the 810.
 
On carrier aggression, and I would say LTE feature set broadly, which is 
quite diverse as you probably recall from our trip in November to New York, 
we feel like we're in 
a very strong position, not just in terms of future 
leadership at the high tier, but we have moved carrier aggression down in 
through the tiers. And similar to what we did with the transition to 4G where 
we made a transition to make sure that we were there
 
for that move in 
China, we think there will be feature updates happening in China. We also 
believe that long
-
term you need to offer international markets to the 
Chinese OEMs because of the answer to the previous question. And therefore 
you trip on the req
uirement to add new bands, to support things like VoLTE 
and SRVCC, things that really stress the modem feature set. So we feel like 
we have a strong lead there. We are starting to see 3

cause us to change our view of the strategic environment.

Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
My first question for Steve which
 
is the, with this transition of the major 
OEM, I guess I know you got a lot of 810 design wins. That's reassuring. The 
issue being at the high
-
end of the market, what has become very clear in 
the last three years or four years is its two vendors. One of t

your Snapdragon, which is the one seems to be deemphasizing it frankly. 
And so the issue here being is that, if that condition prevails, you're making 
a better market share in the high
-
end which has proved very hard to track if 
there is som
ehow [ph] change. And what confidence do you have that 
therefore that the 810 will drive an improving mix at some point towards 
three quarters? I'm just trying to understand the dynamic of whether 
confidence coming from it could be a good product for you i
n the QCT 
business, really?
 
And then for Derek, my question is on the resolution you've had of this one 
licensee in China. The lower
-
end of your TDRS range has gone up by only $5 
billion. And so high
-

co
ming through. What I'm trying to get is 
--
 
has the outlook for the licensing 
opportunity in 2015 echo this resolution [indiscernible] ForEx or ASPs or mix 
and that kind of thing? Is that the right way of thinking about it ex this 
resolution.
 
Steve Mollenko
pf
 
Kulbinder, its Steve. So in terms of the long
-
term, I think our view is that it 

broader than just two ecosystems will be successful in the mobile computing 
area. And I 
think even in the near term if you were to look at a market or a 
region such as China and you would look at how the share has changed 

taken share at the premium tier. They tend not to
 
be household names in 
the U.S. or in the developed world yet, but we think there is an opportunity 
for that to occur.
 

--
 

out in terms of how the different ecosystems will play over
 
a multiyear 
period. And I think if you look at the views that we have had over the years 

make a particular bet or a strategy based off of that, and just to shift chairs 
between what

years have really I think reinforced that to be the right place. What we tend 
to do is drive technology. We tend to have an interest in technology and 

e very, very aware that as the 
market opportunity narrows because of a particular thin modem going better 
versus the CAP, we have to watch that in terms of how we spend our 

 
Derek Aberle
 
Kulbinder, this is
 
Derek. On the second question, really if you look at, like 
you said, we kept the high end of the reported TRDS range the same, but 
brought up the bottom into the range by about $5 billion which would 
actually shift the midpoint up. And there is a bunch of
 
puts and takes in that. 
Obviously the resolution of the dispute would push it up but there's also 
some offsetting factors with FX, ASP and unit. So you can necessarily 
triangulate the 5 billion just to the licensee dispute, but the net
-
net of that is 
actu
ally probably a more positive not negative picture and I would say kind 

business in the fiscal year than in November even.

I have questions about your cash position, U.S. cash position. It declined 
year
-
over
-
year substantially from $8.7 billion to $4.1 billion if my numbers 
are right. And that means that you will 
run out of domestic cash in the next 
nine months or so if you burn the amount of cash. So it also declined 
substantially sequentially. What are the puts and takes in the cash burn? Is 
there anything else outside of dividends and buybacks that we need to 
co


whatever it is, what are going to be the uses of cash? Are you going to 
increase the dividend substantially or
 
do you have any agenda on the right 
dividends if you have more access to capital. Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 


u've 
seen. We indicated either on the last call or at the Analyst Meeting, I believe 
it was on the last call, we would actually be in the market raising debt in our 
second fiscal quarter, which we still believe we will do, and again really to 
try and maint
ain a cash balance in the $2 billion to $4 billion range at all 

capital ahead of our minimum commitment of 75%, closer to 100% and 


returning capital more aggressively in the former share repurchase, plus the 
last two dividend increases where 40% and 20%. So significant increase in 
our divided outlays as well, all part of our program that we talked about la

the year and the trajectory of the baseband business, the thin modem 
business. Do you think that you expect to maintain share in the second 
half 
of the year? Do you think that share starts to slip a little bit as new 
competitors come on? Can you just walk us through kind of how you see 
share progressing on that through the year. And then I wanted to return

Our model is now predicting a further

Steve Mollenkopf
 
Rod, this is Steve. So on share, I think what you're really seeing is a change 
in mix versus a fundamental 
share picture in QCT. You tend to see more thin 
modems versus Snapdragon processors. And as everybody is working 
through changing their portfolio to respond I think to a very strong player in 

 
addition I

Derek Aberle
 
Rod, this is

moderate more longer term. And so we hav


see as playing out over the longer term, right now we think a lot of this is 
coming from an accelerated growth of emerging region volume, which
 
we 
think will 
--
 
the relative growth versus developed will moderate over time.
 
We also think there's going to be a replacement cycle over time in the 
developing regions. And then we gave a number of statistics I think back in 
New York around increases and
 
affordability and the amount of disposable 
income that people are willing to spend on their mobile device. And in fact 
there was just a Boston consulting group report that was released last week 
in Davos that really underscored that. I think in India it w
as about 45% of 

China was around that same range, maybe a little lower.
 
So we see a longer term picture where affordability and then people trading 
up as they move into the smartphone 
tiers will help actually stabilize or even 
increase selling prices in emerging regions. And then as we talked about on 
the 
--
 

basically share shift between non

Chinese players to Chinese
 
OEMs in China 

think over the long term that that will stabilize as well as there is 
consolidation and these companies get a stronger position in the market.

Derek, you may have read that Apple and Ericsson are in a licensing dispute, 
with Apple saying that among other things that the royalty should be

the 
rate shoul

other regions. I was hoping you could talk about that. And if you could just 
update us on when there might be some m
ajor contract renewals?
 
Derek Aberle
 

--
 
I'll try very hard not to comment specifically on 

and customers. But let me just kind of take it up a level and t
alk about the 
baseband chip licensing. There have been I would say efforts or arguments 
made for a number of years, both in patent litigation as well as standards 
bodies that the appropriate royalty base should be the chip instead of the 
full device. Those
 
have actually never succeeded anywhere where the 
argument has been made. And even the damage as well in the U.S. is not 
consistent with that when you think about portfolio based licensing.
 

he norm in 
our industry has been very much in line with the way that we have licensed 
historically and we think there's a lot of good reasons that support that long 

been obviously a l
ot of rumors and things in the press. But you even look at 
the Chinese OEMs that have disclosed how they might license their IP 
portfolios and they talk about licensing at the handset level, not the chip 
level, and some of the decisions that have come out 
of China, and the legal 
system has been consistent with that as well. So there certainly will be 
arguments made over the years because there's a lot of incentives to make 

comfortab
le with the way that we've structured our program.

In the early stages of the smartphone market, it was really about getting

the competitive situation, I would really not make that conclusion. Most of

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Thanks, Warren, and thank you all for joining us. Today's call will have a 
different structure than prior calls given the significant announcements we 
made 
today. I will focus my remarks on the strategic realignment plan and 
some brief updates to the business and industry environment. George will 
then spend a few minutes reviewing our third quarter financial results and 
outlook for the remainder of the fiscal
 
year. We will then take your 
questions.
 
Today, we are announcing a broad package of initiatives designed to 
increase stockholder value and position the company for success in an ever
-
changing industry environment. These initiatives are focused on areas wi
thin 
our control, including making sure we have the right cost structure for the 
future, a corporate structure that maximizes value and will best position us 
for the strategic opportunities ahead within a dynamic industry landscape, 
the appropriate capital
 
structure and level of dividends and share 
repurchases, the optimal board composition and management incentives, 
and a capital allocation plan that ensures that our investment dollars are 
spent in areas with the most promising risk
-
adjusted returns.
 
We ar
e also pleased to be adding two new directors today. We intend to add 
a third new director promptly, pursuant to an agreement with JANA Partners. 
I will speak in more detail about our two new directors, Mark McLaughlin and 
Tony Vinciquerra, in a moment.
 
We
 
are committed to driving meaningful change to improve our near
-
term 
performance while preserving our ability to create sustainable value over the 
long term. These steps are being implemented on an accelerated timeline 
and are designed to help us improve e
xecution, enhance financial 
performance, and drive more profitable growth across the company without 
jeopardizing our ability to retain and build upon our technology leadership 
position in both our core and new businesses.
 
Over the last three decades, Qual
comm has thrived as both the company 
and the mobile industry have grown and gone through a number of 
significant transformations. We have demonstrated the ability to successfully 
adapt and change, and that ability will continue to serve as well as we 
imple
ment our strategic realignment plan and continue to examine any and 
all ways to maximize shareholder value.
 
Our strategic realignment plan is designed to enable us to extend our core 
strengths and deliver value for our customers and stockholders in more 
ef
ficient and powerful ways. The plan has six key initiatives: number one, 
aggressively right
-
sizing our cost structure; number two, reviewing financial 
and structural alternatives that are available to us that may create 
stockholder value; number three, rea
ffirming our intent to return significant 
capital to stockholders; number four, adding new directors with 
complementary skill sets while reducing the average tenure of our board; 
number five, further aligning executive compensation with performance and 
sto
ckholder return objectives; and number six, making disciplined 
investments to further our leadership positions and build upon our core 
technologies and capabilities.
 
First, I want to address costs. As you know, we have been working with an 
independent thir
d
-
party consultant to conduct a comprehensive review of 
our cost structure across the company. Based on the results of this review, 
we are taking actions to substantially reduce costs, taking our fiscal 2015 
spending base down by approximately $1.1 billion
 
annually. We expect to be 
operating at this run rate by the end of fiscal 2016.
 
QCT expenses will come down by approximately $800 million annually, and 
we expect our QCT operating margin to be 16% or better by Q4 of fiscal 
2016 without assuming meaningful
 
improvement in the current industry 
environment. For the long term, we are continuing to target a QCT operating 
margin of at least 20%, and our strategic realignment plan provides the 
basis for us to get there. I will go into more detail on our plan to ac
hieve this 
in just a moment.
 
We will also eliminate approximately $300 million annually of spend outside 
of QCT and QTL, and we'll focus our investments there on a smaller number 
of the largest, most profitable opportunities, including data centers, small 
cells, and certain IoE verticals.
 
This plan still allows for significant R&D in the company. We will continue to 
spend over $4 billion annually on R&D, focused on continuing to drive the 
next wave of growth in the mobile industry as well as other opportuni
ties.
 
Implementation of the plan has begun, and we expect to realize at least 
$600 million of the plan's annual gross savings in fiscal 2016 and to achieve 
the full savings run rate by the end of fiscal 2016.
 
Additionally, we are reducing share
-
based compe
nsation grants across the 
company. Annual share
-
based awards will come down by $300 million. To be 
clear, this $300 million reduction in share
-
based awards is in addition to the 
$1.1 billion in other cost reductions. We expect to incur approximately $350 
m
illion to $450 million in restructuring charges associated with these 
actions.
 
We have a dedicated team and a detailed plan to achieve the cost targets I 
just described. We will be updating you on the progress we are making on 
each quarterly earnings call 
until it is completed.
 
First, in QCT, our goal is straightforward, to take down costs without 
sacrificing our technology leadership, customer commitments, or valuable IP 
roadmap. Through the comprehensive cost review, we have identified a 
number of ways to
 
resize and realign our investments so they are directed at 
achieving that goal. Full
-
time head count in QCT will be reduced by 
approximately 15%, which is in alignment with the overall company 
reductions. Our company resources are being realigned to our h
ighest return 
businesses, and we'll also make significant reductions in our temporary work 
force. Our team and organization will be streamlined. We will have fewer 
office locations overall, and we'll shift some of our resources to lower
-
cost 
regions.
 
We ar
e also reducing our QCT R&D spend. Going forward in QCT overall, we 
are committing to focused investments on the most differentiated 
technologies and products that can deliver the highest return on investment. 
We will be managing costs while maintaining te
chnology leadership, a strong 
product roadmap, and investment in the most promising growth 
opportunities.
 
Second, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in new areas 
outside of QTL and QCT. While we are sharply focused on managing costs, 
w
e are not sacrificing the future for the present. We are taking a highly 
disciplined approach to our investments. We will invest in areas where we 
can apply our existing technology, such as small cells, or areas that are 
natural extensions of our capabilit
ies, such as data centers.
 
The third element of our cost reduction program is in SG&A. We are 
increasing SG&A efficiencies across the company. In the near term, we are 
combining corporate functions and reorganizing to gain efficiencies from 
scale. While th
ese specific cost initiatives are expected to be fully 
implemented by the end of fiscal 2016, the company will continue to 
examine its cost structure for additional efficiency opportunities.
 
As you know, we do not provide our outlook for the next fiscal ye
ar until our 
November call, but I do want to share our thinking behind our Q4 fiscal 2016 
QCT targeted operating margin of 16% or better. Simply put, we are 
assuming that industry conditions remain similar to the current environment. 
Our planning assumptio
ns for this target do not factor in more favorable 
industry and customer dynamics, particularly related to the back half of next 
year, that could materialize, nor do they factor in the impact of our pending 
CSR acquisition. George will review this in more 
detail shortly.
 
In light of recent industry developments and other elements of our strategic 
realignment plan, our board and management team are conducting a fresh 
review of our corporate structure and financial alternatives to create 
stockholder value. Th
is review, which is being done with the assistance of 
outside financial advisors, will include a review of possible business 
separation alternatives and the potential strategic and capital structure 
opportunities they may enable as well as additional capit
al return 
opportunities and other potential strategic and financial alternatives that 
may be available to the company to create stockholder value. We expect to 
complete the review before the end of the calendar year, and we do not 
expect to publicly commen
t on this review prior to its completion.
 
A key element of the strategic realignment plan is our continued 
commitment to our significant capital return program. We are reaffirming 
our intention to execute the largest capital return program in the history o
f 
Qualcomm. Our objective is to maintain a balance sheet that supports our 
commitment to stockholder returns while preserving the strategic flexibility 
needed to compete and drive growth in a rapidly evolving industry. We 
remain committed to returning at l
east 75% of free cash flow to 
stockholders through dividends and buybacks. In March, we announced that 
we will repurchase $10 billion of common stock before March 2016. This 
buyback is in addition to our existing commitment to return at least 75% of 
free c
ash flow to stockholders going forward. As of today, we have 
repurchased $6.4 billion of our 12
-
month commitment, including the $5 
billion ASR.
 
Capital allocation is a subject on which the board and management have 
been intensely focused, and we will conti
nue that focus going forward. As 
part of the review of financial and structural alternatives, the board and 
management will consider changes to the capital return program.
 
We have a high
-
caliber board with exceptionally qualified directors who have 
been ac
tively implementing changes to drive stockholder value. Today we 
announced that we have added Mark McLaughlin and Tony Vinciquerra to the 
board. Mark is the Chairman, President and CEO of Palo Alto Networks and 
was previously the President and CEO of VeriS
ign, where he helped improve 
the cost structure and rationalize their portfolio of businesses. Tony was 
formerly the Chairman and CEO of FOX Networks and Lead Independent 
Director of Motorola Mobility, where he oversaw a meaningful cost 
rationalization pro
gram. He was also a director of its predecessor company, 
Motorola, where he was involved in evaluating and implementing its 
separation. We also expect to appoint a third new independent director. 
These new directors bring skills, expertise, and experience 
that will be 
helpful as we implement our strategic realignment plan.
 
In addition, the average tenure of the board will come down. General Brent 
Scowcroft and Duane Nelles have retired from the board. As we previously 
announced, Sir Donald 
Cruickshank will not stand for reelection to the board 
in 2016. Raymond Dittamore has also informed the company that he does 
not intend to stand for reelection in 2017, assuming he is reelected at the 
2016 meeting. On behalf of the company, the Qualcomm bo
ard sincerely 
thanks these valued directors for their years of service. Without question, we 
are a better company as result of their dedication to Qualcomm and their 
service to the stockholders.
 
The board also plans to make changes to our compensation prog
ram to 
strengthen the connection between compensation decisions and the goals of 
our strategic realignment plan. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee 
plans to change our executive compensation program so that it is more 
closely aligned with our operatio
nal performance and stockholder return 
objectives. That means adding return on invested capital as a metric for 
determining performance
-
based equity awards. The Compensation 
Committee also intends to use earnings per share results in determining 
additional
 
cash bonuses and plans to take stock
-
based compensation 
awarded to all employees into account when calculating EPS.
 
Fiscal 2016 will be a transition year as we continue to implement these 
initiatives, but we intend to build upon our technology leadership 
position. 
Our balance sheet is strong and we have the right assets in place. We have 
been through industry transformations before, and Qualcomm has always 
thrived coming out of them. In the process, we have delivered substantial 
stockholder value. After pi
oneering digital cellular communications, we 
pioneered mobile computing, and now also have world
-
class technology in a 
number of important areas such as graphics and connectivity.
 
We successfully evolved our chip business from providing just modems to 
prov
iding a smartphone SoC platform with a multitude of industry
-
leading 
technologies. We are now the number three semiconductor company in the 
world, with broad presence across mobile, networking, connectivity, and 
other industry segments. We also navigated t
he transition from CDMA 
through the introduction of WCDMA and 3G to the launch and ongoing 
enhancement of 4G/LTE. We intend to drive the evolution of 5G next.
 
There are big opportunities in front of us to build upon our technology 
leadership, and we believ
e that the plan we are announcing today will set us 
up well to capitalize on these opportunities. We have recently concluded the 
NDRC investigation and announced several investments in China that 
position us well to grow our businesses in China going forwa
rd. In addition, 
we are investing in adjacent opportunities that are already delivering 
significant revenue for QCT today and which we expect to drive meaningful 
growth for QCT in the coming years. Finally, our disciplined investments 
outside of QCT and QT
L and our technical capabilities provide the 
opportunity for us to participate in new high
-
growth segments such as the 
data center.
 
QTL remains a source of strength for Qualcomm, where our IP and 
technology leadership is unrivaled, with more than 275 3G li
censees and 
more than 140 4G single
-
mode licensees. QTL will remain a growth driver for 
the company. We are continuing to invest in leading
-
edge technologies for 
the future, wireless technologies as well as a broad set of other device 
technologies. We also
 
are investing in new technology areas designed to 
grow and diversify the licensing business beyond 3G/4G devices, and 
equipment.
 
We expect strong global 3G/4G device growth to continue, with device sales 
expected to increase at a mid to high single
-
digit 
CAGR over the next five 
years. We also continue to expect modest declines in global 3G/4G device 
ASPs over the longer term, consistent with our previous commentary. 
Finally, we continue to target longer
-
term QTL margins in the range of 86% 
to 88%.
 
We have 
a growing technology leadership position in QCT. Our product 
roadmap, which was developed in tandem with leading global network 
operators, remains at the forefront of the industry. We are an industry
-
leading innovator with worldwide scale. Our footprint an
d scale position 
provides cost savings and leading global support capabilities. We have 
strong design win traction for new handsets at the premium tier, including 
among Chinese OEMs.
 
The current industry environment has seen OEM share shift in the highly 
p
rofitable premium tier, where the top player continues to take share and 
where, according to IDC, the top two manufacturers together now have 
more than 85% share of premium tier shipments.
 
The current product cycle also has seen certain OEMs pursue vertica
lly 
integrated strategies at increased levels compared to the past. These 
developments along with other product cycle issues are currently impacting 
our business. We have a plan that we believe will allow us to deliver 
profitable growth in this challenging
 
environment moving forward while we 
continue to execute on the technology and product roadmaps that position 
us for future success.
 
Now turning to our significant opportunities for QCT growth, even as we take 
down companywide costs, we are equally committ
ed to continuing to 
strengthen our position in key technologies and capitalize on additional 
silicon opportunities in smartphones. Cumulative smartphone unit shipments 
are forecast to be more than 8.5 billion between 2015 and 2019, according 
to IDC, and we
 
are growing our share of content within devices with new 
technologies. That requires investments in modem and differentiated IP 
leadership, technologies that scale across the core smartphone and adjacent 
growth businesses, and process node leadership with
 
multi
-
fab support. And 
we have the scale and technology leadership to drive profitable growth.
 
We have the best modem roadmap and team, application processor 
leadership across tiers, and tremendous scale. We are applying our core 
smartphone technologies i
nto rapidly expanding adjacent opportunities in a 
disciplined way, carefully selecting the opportunities where we can create 
the most value and generate the best returns. We already have a significant 
business in these areas, with fiscal 2015 revenues esti
mated to be 
approximately $1.6 billion.
 
We have identified networking, mobile computing, IoT, and automotive as 
the highest return areas and will focus our investments there. In fact, we 
continue to expand our investment in these growth areas. These areas 
have 
an addressable opportunity of more than $10 billion today. Based on a mix 
of third
-
party estimates and our own forecasts, the serviceable addressable 
opportunity for these four areas is expected to double by 2020 to more than 
$20 billion. Our strategi
c realignment plan combined with execution on 
growth opportunities and product design improvements provides the basis 
for our long
-
term operating margin target of at least 20%.
 
In summary, with the strategic realignment plan, we have taken actions 
designed
 
to drive stockholder value, improve performance and execution, 
and position Qualcomm for long
-
term success. These steps are being 
implemented on an accelerated basis, and we will continue to explore 
additional steps to enhance stockholder value. Our balan
ce sheet remains 
strong. And with the NDRC review behind us, we moved quickly to 
significantly increase our capital return program, the largest in our 
company's history. Shortly thereafter, we commenced a comprehensive cost 
review that resulted in a $1.1 b
illion cost
-
cutting plan that is detailed and 
actionable and will be at its full run rate by the end of fiscal year 2016.
 
Investments outside QTL and QCT will be refocused on the highest return 
areas and reduced by approximately $300 million. Annual share
-
based 
compensation grants are also being reduced by $300 million. Our board and 
management are taking a fresh look at financial and structural alternatives 
to enhance stockholder value. We are further aligning executive 
compensation with our performance an
d stockholder return objectives. We 
have added new directors and reduced the average tenure of the board, and 
we are refocusing our investment spend to drive growth while delivering 
attractive returns.
 
We have significant opportunities before us, and we ar
e executing on a 
strategy to realize these opportunities. We are absolutely committed to 
leading the next wave of mobile computing and delivering profitable growth 
in new areas beyond the smartphone in order to deliver significant value to 
Qualcomm stockho
lders.
 
I want to thank the Qualcomm employees around the world whose 
dedication and focus will be critical as we work to implement this plan. Our 
long
-
term opportunities are significant, and we have complete confidence in 
our ability to realize our vision.
 
With that, I will pass it over to George.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone.
 
Our fiscal third quarter results were in line with our expectations, with both 
revenue and non
-
GAAP earnings per share within our prior guidance ranges. 
In QCT, revenue was in line with expectations at $3.85 billion. And the 
operating margin at 7.5% was at the low end of the guidance range as 
stronger than expected share and units in the low tier i
n China were more 
than offset by weaker mix in the premium tier. We believe that in addition to 
reduced demand, sell
-
through for some of our premium tier customers was 
weaker than expected, leading to an inventory build, which we now expect 
to impact QCT M
SM demand in the fiscal fourth quarter.
 
In QTL, total reported device sales by our licensees were $60.4 billion, up 
4% year over year, but below the low end of our prior guidance range, 
reflecting lower than expected reported device shipments. The lower
-
th
an
-
expected reported device shipments were primarily driven by a higher mix of 
unlicensed three
-
mode units and the fact that it is taking us longer than 
previously expected to conclude new license agreements with certain 
Chinese OEMs.
 
QTL revenues were up 
7% year over year and modestly ahead of our 
expectations. Audit recoveries and other payments for prior
-
period activity 
recognized in the quarter more than offset the impact of lower reported 
device sales. We estimate that the average selling price of repo
rted devices 
sold during the third fiscal quarter was approximately $208, up 
approximately $12 sequentially at the midpoint.
 
Turning to capital structure, we continued our aggressive capital return 
program, returning a record $6.2 billion to stockholders i
n the quarter, 
including $757 million of dividends paid and $5.4 billion in stock 
repurchases. These amounts include a $5 billion accelerated share 
repurchase, which we expect to be completed no later than November. Our 
shares outstanding were reduced by 3
% in the last quarter and 6% since the 
start of fiscal 2014.
 
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range 
of $4.7 billion to $5.7 billion, down approximately 22% year over year and 
11% sequentially at the midpoint. This out
look puts us at the low end of our 
previous revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. We expect sequential QTL 
revenues to be flat to up slightly in the fourth quarter, driven by increased 
3G/4G total reported device sales, including from the execution of
 
new 
agreements with Chinese OEMs, offsetting the absence of audit recoveries 
and prior
-
period revenues recognized in our third fiscal quarter. Our outlook 
also incorporates a continuing foreign exchange headwind.
 
Let me comment further on our progress imp
lementing the revised licensing 
terms in China. We are adding new agreements and continue to expect 
improvement over time in the underreporting we have been experiencing, 
including collecting on three
-
mode shipments. However, the timing of 
executing new ag
reements and improving the underreporting is likely to 
remain somewhat difficult to predict. As we evaluate TRDS for the second 
half of fiscal 2015, we now estimate that TRDS will be lower than previously 
expected, primarily driven by a higher mix of three
-
mode devices in China, 
an increase in share by Chinese OEMs globally, as well as the timing 
uncertainty relating to new agreements and compliance I just discussed.
 
Having said that, our outlook for global device sales remains strong, and we 
continue to be
lieve we will successfully conclude new agreements in China 
and improve collections over time, consistent with our prior views.
 
Turning to QCT, we have reduced our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter on 
lower shipments, which I will discuss in a moment. 
We now expect QCT 
operating margins to be approximately 2% to 4%. The revenue and margin 
downside to our previous expectations for the fourth quarter are driven 
primarily by three factors weighing on premium tier demand.
 
First, we are seeing share 
concentration in the premium tier impact demand 
for certain OEM devices that use our chipsets more than our previous 
expectations. This dynamic led to inventory build in the fiscal third quarter 
for these OEMs, which is driving reduced demand for our chips
ets in the near 
term on inventory drawdown. Second, we are seeing weakness in demand 
for our premium tier chipsets from a vertical customer based on a change in 
the mix of devices that are selling through. And third, lower than expected 
sell through in Chi
na of certain handset models using our premium tier 
chipsets is impacting demand in the fourth quarter.
 
Product costs are expected to be modestly higher than previous 
expectations, as some of the yield
-
related benefits forecasted on higher 
volumes will not
 
be realized. We are pleased with our design traction across 
all tiers, and our view on fourth quarter low
-
tier unit volume and share in 
China is consistent with prior expectations.
 
Let me spend a moment on the sequential change in units. We are guiding 
to
 
a 45 million unit sequential decline in MSM shipments. This decline is 
explained by two factors. First, our previous guidance expected MSMs to be 
down sequentially by 10 million to 15 million units in the fourth quarter. And 
the addition of 5 million unit
s into the third fiscal quarter brings the 
anticipated impact closer to 20 million units. Second, the remaining 
approximately 25 million unit reduction is largely explained by the premium 
tier developments I explained a few minutes ago.
 
Turning to our earn
ings outlook, we estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share 
in our fiscal fourth quarter to be approximately $0.75 to $0.95 per share. 
Fiscal 2015 full
-
year earnings guidance range is $4.50 to $4.70 per share.
 
While it is too early to forecast fiscal 2016, the s
trategic realignment plan is 
designed to deliver significantly improved QCT margins, even assuming the 
industry trends experienced in the second half of fiscal 2015 persist and 
does not assume the potential upsides from market improvement or 
recovery of pr
emium tier share at a leading vertical OEM. We believe these 
actions position the company well going forward and will require our 
complete focus over the next year to ensure we execute well on our 
customer commitments and technology roadmaps while deliveri
ng on the 
plan.
 
That concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back to Warren.

Great, thank you. Steve and George, maybe you can just share with us a

Yes. Hi, Mike. This is George. The cost savings will come in over time, as you 
would expect, throughout the year. We'll have some front loading, but we 
see costs actually based on the timing that's required for meeting the 
roadmap requirements and othe
r factors spreading it out. But we expect the 
cost savings to be fully realized by the end of the year. And if you average 
out what we expect, we think about $600 million will come out in the fiscal 
year.

Mike, this is Steve. Just very quickly on programs. Essentially what we're 
doing is we're going to protect our IP roadmaps. We are not going to 
withdraw from tiers. We're going to do some changes to how we're doing 
things and where we're putting emp
loyees, and obviously, we'll be out 
talking to customers and making sure they're comfortable with that as well. 
But I think you're looking at a case where we've had some significant growth 
and we're trying to get our cost structure in advance or trying to 
react to 
what's happening in the industry and get ahead of it, and I think we'll be 
healthier as a result. But we're going to definitely be continuing to invest in 
the roadmap.

BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Thank you. I just want to get back into the chip business here. I get the 
moving parts around units and market share, and it sounds like a little build 
this quarter and a little bur
n next quarter. But if I average the two of them 
and just divide by the TRDS units and compare that to the few quarters 
before that, it looks like about 10 full points of market share reduction. And 
at the same time, it looks like ASPs have come down and g
ross margins dip 
into 40% or maybe even lower for that segment. So is there something else 
going on competitively, other than the Samsung vertical integration and the 
channel build? It seems like we're at a step function down in market share 
above and beyo
nd the high end at that one customer.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Hi, Tim. If you look at the fourth quarter effects that we're talking about, 
they're effectively all premium tier. I know Derek may want to jump in, in a 
minute
, on the TRDS point. So our design traction in the premium tier has 
not had any change. So we did cite that we had lower volumes at one 
vertical OEM, which you could describe it as share loss. But overall, it's really 
the fact that we have this concentrate
d environment and a very large impact 
on a number of our premium tier customers as a result of that. The other 
piece is we cited in China that certain handset models using our chipsets had 
lower demand than was forecasted going into the quarter.

Hey, thanks for taking my question. Steve, I was wondering if there's any 
way you could quantify the impact of t
he Snapdragon 810 issues, whether 
it's some of your customers choosing to use prior
-
generation chips or any 
expenses that you've had to incur that are abnormal related to that.
 
And then secondly, I know you've looked at the separation in the past. Can 
you 
remind us the logic of having QTL and QCT together, at least the major 
points that came to a conclusion in the past to keep these together? Thanks.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Sure. Why don't I ask George to handle the 
first one? I'll be happy to do the 
second part about separation.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Sure. In terms of the Snapdragon 810, I think probably the biggest single 
impact as we look at the year 

 
first off, again
, much like the fourth quarter, 
it's almost entirely attributable to changes in the premium tier and certainly 
the socket loss at a major vertical customer. And so that would typically 
have been a customer for the Snapdragon 810 for their new
-
generation 
de
vices. But it's also been a factor of the impacts that are happening in the 
premium tier overall, that we're seeing SKUs other than the leading SKUs 
that are not selling through at the levels that customers thought that are 
impacting some of our premium ti
er chipsets as well. So the only other thing 
from a cost standpoint is we have had some increased E&O and certainly 
some portion of Snapdragon 810 is a part of that. But overall, it's really 
been more a function of the significant shift in demand that we'v
e seen 
throughout the year.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
And with regards to the separation, I think each individual time that we've 
looked at this, the circumstances were different. I think we've looked at it a 
number of times
 
over the last decade and a half. Today, given that we're on 
the other side of the NDRC investigation, the structure of the industry, how 
we're looking at the market, I think it's time to take a fresh look, and I think 
that's what we're describing. There's
 
no foregone conclusion either way 
here. But we want to make sure we do a thorough look to make sure that 
we're looking at all ways to drive shareholder value. One of the reasons that 
we look at our board composition, we do have some new eyes coming in 
tha
t can help us look at that as well with some unique experience, so we're 
going to go through the process and we will update you shortly.

Hey, thanks for taking my question. George, I just wanted to clarify on the 
timing of the OpEx cuts. I thought I heard you say $600 million this year. I

obviously, the fiscal year ends in

more carrier 
aggregation to create an advantage?
 
George S. Davis

Hi, Blayne. This is George. On the $600 million, my point there is that we'll 
take $600 million of the $1.1 billion run rate out in fiscal 2016. I didn
't mean 
to imply 2015, if that's how it came across.
 
In terms of the inventory, we're really going to have to see how it plays out. 
We certainly are coming into the quarter with a significant overhang that we 
didn't forecast coming into the quarter. And so
 
we will 

 
I mean in the 
previous guide. So it will really depend on how our customer sell
-
through 
plays out in the quarter.

With respect to the carrier aggregation question in China, China Telecom 
has 
already launched. It's starting to work its way through the design cycle and 
through the ecosystem. China Mobile is expected to launch at the end of this 
calendar year. And we think this will be a good dynamic and has been 
anticipated in our roadmap, a
s you may know. The other dynamic that's 
happening in China is just also is just the desire for the Chinese OEMs to be 
exporters, and that's also been a good trend for us. But we're looking 
forward to this carrier aggregation launch happening in China.

Sorry, let 
me start again. I was just saying that first of all on the cost 
savings side, how much of them will be reinvested? And furthermore, will 
some of the $1.1 billion, that's a gross number I think, how much drops to 
the bottom line, how should we think about t
hat?
 
And then on the separation point, can you please just give us the pros and 
cons of separating in the sense that right now QTL license is so much of the 
handset industry, it's almost achieved a large part of what you needed to do 
to be with QCT in the 
first place? Is now the right time to separate? What's 
the dyssynergy of separating, for example? I'm not asking for a number, but 
what are the arguments we should think about? Thanks.

Ku
lbinder, the cost reductions are meant to be reductions relative to the run 
rate that we had in 2015, so they are effectively net reductions in that 
sense. We'll certainly spend some more in certain areas of the company, but 
it's a pretty broad
-
based reduc
tion, and the $1.1 billion is meant to be the 
amount of savings that are coming out pre
-
tax.

Kulbinder, this is Paul. We don't want to get into a lot of the details on

James E. Faucette

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on the cost reductions. You've 
talked about OpEx reductions, and I am wondering how muc
h improvement 
in cost of goods and gross margin, particularly on the chip business, may be 
attainable. I guess I'm interested in that simply because if I look at what 
you're targeting for a run rate exiting next fiscal year and apply that to just 
the QCT g
ross profit you put through this quarter, it would indicate a better 
operating margin then you've even targeted for next year. So I was just 
wondering how we should think about COGS and that as a cost reduction 
effort.
 
And my second question is back on the
 
demand. I guess I'm wondering how 
long you think it will take to work through this inventory because 25 million 
units roughly, as George outlined, is a huge proportion of the customers that 
you have in that high
-
end segment. And so I'm just wondering how 
long you 
think it will take to put through and get through that inventory adjustment? 
Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So most of the cost savings that we've talked about are coming out of OpEx, 
although there are engineering activities within cost of sales that are part of 
the overall $7.3 billion base that we've talked to.
 
In terms of COGS, we've had, as you know, for some time a significant focus 
on improvements in our supply chain, including s
ome long
-
term agreements, 
some prepayment activities. We've said that we expected to start to see the 
fruits of those things after 2015 and getting through the initial ramp of 20
-
nanometer. So most of the savings we're focusing on here are really OpEx 
rela
ted, but we will continue to look for opportunities to improve COGS. And 
we have not forecasted margin improvements as part of this exercise, but of 
course that's something that we'll be focused on as well.
 
In terms of the demand, the 25 million is really 
the number of units that is 
below what we had anticipated in the fourth quarter, which accounts for 
really the bulk of the revenue and margin decline that we're seeing. It's not 
necessarily just the inventory balance. So it's not 

 
as you know, the 
invento
ry, we can look into the channel and we can certainly clearly see 
significant build across that channel, but to know exactly how it will come 
out would be hard to forecast. We just know it's going to have a significant 
impact in the fourth quarter.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question, I just wanted to 
clarify. It doesn't look like you took your global unit forecas
t for QTL for 
calendar year 2015 down. That's still sitting at 1.560 billion, which suggests 
you're not seeing any further degradation in the second half versus your 
prior outlook for the global market. I just wanted to verify that and ask you 
how confiden
t you are that there are no impending headwinds building in the 
market itself in the second half of the year.
 
And for my second question, on chipsets and the 16% margin guidance, I 
know you said you're not factoring in anything improving in the market. But
 
at this point, why shouldn't we be factoring in the prospect for the market 
getting worse, given a lot of the issues that seem to be hitting here on 
margins in terms of competition and mix and everything else, at least to me, 
would appear to be structural
 
rather than something that would be fully in 
your control?

Stacy, this is Derek. Why don't I take the first one? I think we looked across 
the market. There are obviously some puts and takes, a little softness we're 
seeing in th
e premium tier and a little bit slower early parts in China for the 
year. But as we look at the full year, we do think that will reaccelerate in 
China in particular. And the net
-
net of the overall reevaluation of the market 
we still feel confident in the p
rior forecast that we put out there, so we're not 
going to adjust it at this time.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Stacy, on the planning assumptions that we used, we think that the second 
half gives you a pretty balanced view. We
 
saw weak mix in the third quarter. 
We obviously see a very difficult environment in the fourth quarter. And 
really it's meant to be a planning assumption so that we can give some 
sense of where we see the company and QCT in particular on margins 
coming ou
t at the end of next year. We believe there are certainly upsides 
and downsides to that planning assumption, but to try and forecast what 
that means for 2016 until we get closer is too difficult at this point. So we'll 
do that in November, and we'll have a
 
better view whether we're in a weaker 
or stronger situation.

Thank you. I had two. First of all, George, relative 
to the new QCT operating 
margin targets by the end of next year, when you say that that doesn't 
assume any improvement in the industry, does that mean to say that it 
assumes that QCT revenues stay in this low $3 billion per quarter range?

Hi, guys. You've said in the past that you may consider acquisitions in order 
to grow to the markets. The fact that there is a business 
change as well as a 
big restructuring plan and you need to deal with all these issues, does it 
mean that they're going to put any M&A aspirations on the back burner 
more and focus internally on the other things you announced? So that's 
question number one.
 
And question number two, when I calculate the implied price for MSM, what 
are the puts and takes this quarter when it comes to the price? I'm trying to 
reconcile your verbal comments with the price change. That is not very 
different from what we expected.
 
So what are the puts and takes there? And 
then what's your best guess 

 
again, not in terms of numbers, but in terms 
of the drivers 

 
what's your best guess for what's going to impact this 
implied price in the coming quarters? Thanks.

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Tal, this is Steve. I'll give my answer to the first one. Perhaps my colleagues 
can jump in on the second one. With regards to M&A, we obviously have 
CSR outstanding and getting to the point soon here where we hope to 
be 
talking about that as something that influences earnings, obviously 
something that's accretive to our fiscal year 2016 plan.
 
I don't think we've made a change in terms of our M&A stance. I will say 
that when we look at the management team and what we're
 
focused on, 
we're very focused on delivering this cost plan. I think right now, we look at 
that and we say that really positions the business in a way that will really 
benefit the shareholders and drive value. So that's what we're focused on.
 
George S. Da
vis

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
Tal, on the revenue per MSM in the third quarter, you're right. It wasn't 
terribly different than expectations as the quarter pretty much on an 
operating basis came in where we thought it would. But 
you did see higher 
MSMs. Those are really part of the story of us having stronger than expected 
share in the low tier in China in the third quarter. That just created a little 
bit weaker mix. We're actually seeing some of that. As we said, we expect to 
see
 
lower low
-
tier volumes in China in Q4. That was already in our forecast 
in our prior guidance. So we actually get a little bit of mix benefit in the 
fourth quarter even though overall it's not as strong as we would have 
thought because we had a much bette
r premium tier mix in our original 
expectations.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go 
ahead.
 
Rod B. Hall

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just had two. I guess the firs
t 
one is back to the MSM chip unit guidance. Even once you reconcile this 
back, the difference between the guidance and last quarter or this quarter 
you just reported, we're still flat quarter on quarter, which is abnormal 
seasonality. Typically in fiscal 
Q4, you see unit volumes on MSM up. And it 
doesn't sound like, even after all the reconciliation, you're expecting that. So 
I just wanted to just ask you guys if you could talk a little bit about why the 
seasonality is somewhat abnormal this year. Is it a 
demand issue? What's 
going on with seasonality once you make all the adjustments?
 
And then the second thing I want to ask you is maybe just a little bit longer
-
term question, which is we know about the vertical integration into one 
ODM. I'm just curious. W
hat probability, Steve, would you assign to further 
vertical integration, especially up in the high tier? Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So on the seasonality, again, I think the effects that we're seeing in th
e 
marketplace of concentration and again, as we said, the pullback in unit 
share that we're seeing in the low tier in China, I think those things 
dominate our view of the MSM situation I think much more than the 
seasonality adjustment would explain.
 
Steven
 
M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
This is Steve. My view on the vertical aspect, I would argue that what you're 
seeing was probably more of a product cycle issue versus a general trend. 
The overall difficulty of delivering MSMs or deliver
ing something like our 
MSM is actually getting harder. And the same dynamics, particularly with 
concentration in the industry, the same dynamics that occurred over the last 
decade and a half to people like Nokia or Motorola with a vertical strategy, I 
thin
k still happen with chipsets today. So I think I don't see that as a trend 
that's going forward now. Clearly with our planning assumptions for planning 
our OpEx, we wanted to put the business in a position where it is less 
susceptible to those individual d
esign wins, which I think is part of our cost 
program, but I think it's going to get harder and harder.
 
The other thing I would note too is that feedback from customers and 
particularly customers who you may be worried about with respect to 
vertical aspira
tions have been strong with respect to our Snapdragon 820 
and other designs. So I feel like our roadmap is getting a warm reception 
broadly, and we just have to continue develop on it and get our cost 
structure in the right spot.

Thank you, gentlemen. I understand the OpEx issue and also the potential 
split, maybe some consideration for the issue related to the maturing 
s
martphone market and the change, possibly permanent change, in your 
customers who want to do their own chipsets. So perhaps how Qualcomm 
can quickly move into new markets to find a home for new chipsets, and are 
they large enough to replace the substantive
 
smartphone market?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
This is Steve. I think our challenges are 

 
the smartphone and the handset 
business continues to be an attractive market. I think we need to get our 
profitability up in that oppo
rtunity, which is why we're taking these changes 
to our cost structure and get ahead of what we see happening in the market.
 
But equally, I think there's significant growth available to us as we leverage 
the IP roadmap that you develop in smartphone SoCs a
nd take that and 
really fan that out into a number of new markets. If you look at what's 
happening across the board from every major consumer electronics industry, 
they're all trying to embrace the smartphone, and part of what we are doing 
is moving resour
ces off of the phone space into supporting those new 
markets. So if we can boost profitability in our home market and take 
opportunity of these new or take advantage of these new opportunities in 
adjacent markets, I think we'll have the business back on a 
good track for 
growth.

Thanks very much. You mentioned, Steve, that you won't be withdrawing 
from certain tiers in QCT. But
 
can you share with us with your business 
activities on the low end consistently make money as we continue to hear 
about aggressive price cuts in this segment, particularly in the last couple of 
quarters? So just can you give your perspective there?
 
And, G
eorge, just following on from the last question, on COGS savings in 
QCT, that wasn't mentioned as part of the cost review. I'm just wondering 
whether you think there's an opportunity to improve gross margins in QCT 
since your scale is way more than any of 
your rivals and you are diversifying 
with different foundries. Should we expect any savings at the COGS line? 
Thank you.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
 
So let me take the COGS savings question first. We have had, like 
I said 
previously, we've had a keen focus on leveraging our scale throughout the 
industry to make sure that we have competition for the volumes among our 
foundry partners, and we believe we have a very good roadmap to maximize 
the cost of our use of that s
upply chain over time. And we had cited as part 
of the reason we would be off on margins at the start of this year that we 
are really coming out of a situation where we had, at 20
-
nanometer, a less 
than optimal COGS situation.
 
That being said, volume matte
rs, and we've seen some of the issues that 
came with lower than expected volumes, so we're not quite seeing some of 
the benefits. As volume recovers, we would expect to see that. But the basic 
structural changes that we need to make in terms of working wit
h a broad 
range of very capable foundry partners is part of our existing plan, so we're 
not really making a change to that. That being said, of course, it's critical 
that we get both margin expansion as well as improvement in the OpEx 
areas, and we'll be v
ery focused on that. And as we make progress beyond 
what is in our base plan already, we'll keep you informed.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Brett, this is Steve. With respect to the low tier, I think the entire industry is 
actu
ally challenged in terms of making money at the low tier. We're probably 
in a better position than most because of the ability to leverage our IP 
roadmap across the tiers. We're making some changes in this realignment 
plan where we're doing work to try to 
get the cost per head more in 
alignment with some of our competitors. But we still think it's an interesting 
opportunity for us to go after. And as George mentioned, we are assuming 
that this aggressive price environment continues with respect to our 
plann
ing assumption on the realignment plan.
 
So we're probably better than most in terms of where we're going, and we 
think it's an important market to contribute in. It will also be a market that 
will move more toward 4G. Today, it is split between 3G single
-
m
ode. It will 
move to multi
-
mode 4G, which should advantage us worldwide. We just 
need to get ourselves better set up to address it.

Thank you very much. There have been several mentions of a more focused 
look at expanding into markets that are already in prices you have or very 
closely adjacent products you are going to develop. It seems to make sen
se. 
Where does that put you on the RF side of the business? I know RF360 has 
been a big initiative for you for the last several years, and you're still 
working on that. Does that change your view of moving into that vertical?
 
And then in terms of investmen
t in QTL, I know that you put out a notice 
about more regulatory action from Europe. What's your thinking now on the 
settlement you had in China spreading to other geographies? Although the 
laws are different, it seems like there's still a lot of interest 
from other 
regulatory agencies in maybe changing Qualcomm's licensing agreements. If 
you can comment on that, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

Ed, this is Steve. The opportunity to grow content in the

exists, particularly in an environment where the LTE band proliferation 
continues to be very wide. We're actually quite pleased with the RF360. It's 
still early days. I think we have something like 350 OEM designs already on 
the parts
, and we think that that will build over time as we start to add more 
capability. But the environment for growing content in the phone we still 
think is a good opportunity for us.

Ed, this is Derek. On the regulatory question, a
ctually the European Union 
investigations that were I think announced this last week or so, really it's 
just a new phase of the proceeding, and it's still relatively early in their 
process. But it's focused really not on the licensing program of the compan
y. 
It's really focused on chipset pricing and rebate type agreements. So again, 
as we look at it, we've commented on this quite a bit over the last couple of 
calls. We do believe that the result in China is unique to China. And although 
we could very well 
have other regulatory proceedings to deal with, we're 
very confident in our ability to defend against those.

Thank

actions, if any, can you take locally in China to improve collections going 
forward?
 
Derek K. Aberle

Presiden
t
 
This is Derek. Actually, there are a couple of drivers here. As we said coming 
out of the resolution with NDRC, we were going to need to go through this 
process of offering new terms to our licensees. We're getting pretty far along 
in that 
process. We've made progress. But as we noted last time, this is 
going to take some time, and it's a bit hard to predict. We've given you our 
best view on the timing of when we'll be able to conclude agreements. But 
some of these things take a bit longer t
han others, and so that's going to 
probably have some impact. We now think that just pushing some units out 
of our fiscal year into next year that we thought we may be able to get 
earlier, but again, it's not a change in our view as to whether we'll be abl
e to 
ultimately collect royalties on those units. It's just more a question of timing.
 
So really the process is to get these new agreements in place and get 
companies that were previously unlicensed for three
-
mode devices signed 
up. And again, we're going 
through that process now and have companies 
that have signed agreements and are reporting royalties to us now on three
-
mode, but we still have some work to do there. And then beyond that, it's a 
lot of the things we've talked about in the past in terms of 
ratcheting up the 
level of auditing and compliance activities in China. And ultimately, if 
necessary, which we always try to do everything we can to avoid this, but if 
we have to, enforcing the terms of our contracts that are in place there. So 
we're going
 
through that process now, and we'll be updating you as we 
continue to progress there.

GAAP earnings of $0.80 per share was at the high end of our 
guidance range, driven by improved product margins, lower R&D and SG& A 
an
d a lower tax rate.
 
In QTL, following the district court's ruling, our licensees continue to perform 
under their agreements. In parallel, at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, we 
are pursuing a partial stay in appealing the ruling. Of note, with a stateme
nt 
of interest of the Department of Justice in support of our stay motion, 
stating that Qualcomm is likely to succeed on the merits in the appeal.
 
The Huawei export ban, along with the pivot from 4G to 5G which 
accelerated over the past couple of months, h
as contributed to industry 
conditions particularly in China that we expect will create headwinds in our 
next two fiscal quarters.
 
As a result of the export ban, Huawei shifted their emphasis to building 
market share in the domestic China market, where we d
o not see the 
corresponding benefit in product or licensing revenue.
 
In addition, our customers in the China market are working through their 
existing 4G inventory and deemphasizing their second half 2019 4G 
launches, as they shift their priorities to thei
r 5G launches in early 2020. As 
a result, we do not expect the typical seasonal benefits given this unique 
market dynamics.
 
For the first calendar quarter of 2020, we anticipate reaching the inflection 
point as our financial results begin to reflect the be
nefits of our substantial 
efforts over the years to bring 5G to the market worldwide.
 
Let me walk you through the dynamics of 5G rollouts. 5G network rollouts 
are progressing at a much faster rate when compared to 4G. We expect over 
20 operators to launch 
5G service and over 20 OEMs to have 5G devices in 
the first 12 months after the first commercial launch. This compares to four 
operators and three OEMs with the launch of 4G with the major difference 
being that China is launching 5G in the first year.
 
In C
hina, 5G commercial service was officially approved in early June and 
our current estimate is that by the end of this year, the three operators will 
deploy roughly 100,000 5G base stations, which to put in context is the 
equivalent of the scale of the enti
re network of a large US wireless operator.
 
And in the US, 5G is being deployed across sub
-
6 and millimeter wave for 
nationwide coverage. Verizon has noted that they expect three quarters of 
the phones they are launching next year will be 5G.
 
AT&T announce
d that they are on track for a nationwide 5G coverage in 
midyear 2020 and we expect the proposed T
-
Mobile
-
Sprint merger to result 
in an accelerated nationwide 5G rollout. I would add, that we expect the 
millimeter wave to be a mandatory requirement at all 
major carriers in the 
United States.
 
Also helping to drive this accelerated transition to 5G is dynamic spectrum 
sharing which enables carriers to dynamically repurpose 4G spectrum for 5G 
use. DSS is a game changer for the carriers and will result in a muc
h more 
rapid proliferation of 5G than we have seen in prior G transitions.
 
Before I talk about our products, I would like to remind you of our 
contribution to develop the fundamental elements of 5G including 
innovations that enable massive MIMO, millimeter
 
wave, security and the 
deployment of 5G technologies in networks across broad spectrum 
allocations.
 
This early work has resulted in a valuable IP portfolio and provided us with 
an early insight into what products need to be developed and 
commercialized at
 
scale. This will continue as 5G expands beyond Release 
15 and the feature sets continue to evolve.
 
Today, we are the only chipset vendor that has 5G system level solutions 
spanning both sub
-
6, gigahertz and millimeter wave bands. This is key to 
global dep
loyment. Our 5G system level solutions span baseband, 
transceiver, RF front end and antenna elements as the components are 
tightly coupled together for best in class performance spanning multiple KPIs 
including power area and modem benchmarks.
 
Let me now g
ive us an update on our OEM traction. All of the major Android 
OEMs have announced 5G devices for this year and as volume ramps in 
early 2020; device offerings will expand beyond premium tier devices.
 
As an example, China Mobile plans to drive 5G devices t
o price points under 
a US dollar equivalent of $300 by the end of 2020, representing about 40% 
of the Chinese smartphone segment by price band. Our Chinese customers 
have recently made product portfolio decisions consistent with that carrier 
objective to d
rive 5G into lower price bands.
 
On the product side, our 5G design wins have doubled since our last 
earnings call. We now have over 150 5G designs launched or in development 
using our 5G chipsets. In addition to core chipsets, virtually all our 5G 
design w
ins are powered by our complete RF front
-
end solutions for 5G sub
-
6 and millimetre wave.
 
We are the only company today delivering an end to end comprehensive 
modem to antenna solutions. The complexity of 5G and the value of 
innovative solutions enables us 
to expand our ASPs significantly from 4G.
 
Turning to more detail on our legal matters. On July 8, we filed our motion 
for a partial stay with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. And as you may 
have seen, the Department of Justice on behalf of the United St
ates filed a 
statement of interest that supports our request. We cannot predict the exact 
timing, but we expect the Court of Appeals to rule in our stay motion in the 
near future.
 
In the meantime, as can be seen from our results this quarter, licensees 
con
tinue to perform under their agreements, consistent with our view, that 
the District Court decision does not nullify the existing license agreements.
 
On our appeal on the merits of the FTC matter, the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals granted their request fo
r an expedited briefing schedule. We expect 
briefing to be complete by the end of the calendar year. And the court has 
said it will schedule the case for oral arguments on the next available 
hearing date, after briefing is completed. With regards to Huawei
, we 
continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of the dispute, focused on a final 
agreement.
 
Turning to QCT, on July 15, we announced our Qualcomm Snapdragon, 855 
Plus mobile platform, providing about 1 billion mobile gamers, a leading 
flagship option for
 
pro
-
like gaming devices.
 
Expanding on our China relationships, we are pleased to announce a 
strategic cooperation with Tencent, to deliver premium 5G and gaming 
experiences to consumers and developers in China and other regions. This 
cooperation includes joint efforts on Snapdragon
-
based mobile gaming 
devices, Snapdragon Elite gaming, cloud gaming, AR, VR and always
-
connected PCs. We continue to execute on our growth opportunities across 
automotive, AR/VR, connectivity and networking a
nd IoT. In compute, we 
are on track to see the first Snapdragon 8cx based designs, to launch in the 
second half of calendar year 2019.
 
In summary, while near term demand trends are not surprisingly soft as the 
entire market and industry transitions to 5G, 
we are very excited with our 
design wins and growth in device content as 5G ramps, particularly into 
2020. Put simply, our position at the center of developing this incredible 
technology represents a large opportunity for our stockholders.
 
I would now like
 
to turn the call over to Dave.
 
Dave Wise
 
Thank you Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. We delivered third quarter 
GAAP revenues of $9.6 billion which included $4.7 billion related to the 
settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers.
 
GAAP EPS was 
negatively impacted by a $2.5 billion non
-
cash charge to 
income tax expense due to a write
-
off of a deferred tax asset, resulting from 
recently issued US tax regulations.
 
Our non
-
GAAP revenues were $4.9 billion despite top line softness. Non
-
GAAP EPS was $
0.80 at the high end of our guidance range due to better 
QCT gross margins, lower combined R&D and SG&A expenses and a better
-
than
-
expected tax rate.
 
During the quarter, SG&A expenses benefited from a faster than expected 
reduction in excess litigation exp
ense. QCT delivered revenues of $3.6 billion 
on 156 million MSM shipments, below the midpoint of our guidance range 
given a larger
-
than
-
expected impact from market weakness. QCT's EBT 
margin was 14% in line with our guidance reflecting improvements in both
 
gross margins and lower operating expenses.
 
QTL's third quarter revenues of $1.3 billion came in slightly above the 
midpoint of our guidance range, and included both current period Apple 
royalties and the last $150 million interim payment from Huawei. Our
 
third 
quarter QTL results reflect the view that post the ruling in the FTC case, our 
licensing agreements remain enforceable and our licensees are expected to 
perform under their agreements which they have done to date. QTL's EBT 
margin was 70% above the 
high end of our guidance range on lower 
operating expenses due to a faster than anticipated reduction in excess 
litigation expense.
 
Turning to our outlook. As Steve mentioned, as we look forward over the 
next couple of quarters, our business is being impac
ted by several factors in 
advance of the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020. We see continued 
weakness in China demand, Huawei gaining share inside of China and our 
Chinese OEMs managing their inventory ahead of 5G.
 
We are lowering our estimates for g
lobal 3G, 4G, 5G device shipments in 
calendar 2019 by 100 million units to a range of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion. We 
now expect handsets shipments to be down mid
-
single digits year
-
over
-
year.
 
In China, through the June quarter, while device shipments from 
handset 
makers into the carriers and retailers was down only 5%, the device sell
-
through from carriers and retailers to consumers was more pronounced, 
down approximately 20% year
-
over
-
year, reflecting in part a pause by 
consumers ahead of 5G and an uncerta
in macro environment. As a result, 
we have seen a meaningful build in channel inventory during the first half of 
calendar year 2019.
 
Over the next two quarters, we expect a significant impact on device 
shipment as sell
-
in and sell
-
through growth rates real
ign and channel 
inventory levels are drawn down in China.
 
In other regions including North America and Europe, we are seeing 
lengthening of handset replacement rates impacting unit volumes, as well as 
some softness in India and in non
-
handset devices.
 
Furt
her, as a result of the trade dispute, our business is being impacted by a 
shift in OEM share towards Huawei as they increase their focus on domestic 
China sales and to a lesser extent by the loss of the direct sales to Huawei 
affected by the trade ban.
 
La
stly, we are seeing our Chinese OEMs respond to these factors by pulling 
back on new 4G device orders and managing their inventory in advance of 
the transition to 5G in early calendar 2020.
 
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance. We expect revenues 
to be in 
the range of $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of 
$0.65 to $0.75. For QCT, we estimate MSM shipments to be in the range of 
140 million to 160 million units, down 4% sequentially at the midpoint.
 
Historically, we have see
n mid teens percentage growth in MSM shipments 
from our third to fourth fiscal quarter reflecting normal seasonal strength in 
the latter part of the year as OEMs build for the upcoming holiday season. 
The estimated lower MSM shipments in our fourth quarter
 
are being 
impacted by the factors I just described.
 
The China related weakness is particularly impactful to QCT revenue subject 
to our leading position with a Chinese OEMs in the premium and high tiers. 
We estimate QCT's EBT margins for the fourth fiscal 
quarter will be 13% to 
15%, flat sequentially at the midpoint. We estimate QTL revenues will be in 
the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion with EBT margins of 62% to 66%, 
down sequentially versus the third quarter.
 
Our fourth quarter forecast does not incl
ude any revenues from Huawei with 
the last interim $150 million payment, recognized in the third quarter. 
Similarly to QCT, QTL is not seeing the seasonal uptick in our fourth fiscal 
quarter, reflecting weaker device shipments.
 
We expect non
-
GAAP combined 
R&D and SG&A expense to be down 1% to 
3% sequentially, reflecting the absence of the catch
-
up and employee bonus 
expense that occurred in our third quarter offset by an increase in R&D 
spend.
 
We plan to remain disciplined around cost management and expect 
operating expenses to increase slightly from our fourth quarter run rate as 
revenues ramp through fiscal 2020.
 
We estimate our fourth quarter a GAAP tax rate to be 16% and our non
-
GAAP tax rate to be 13%. We believe the 13% rate is a good proxy for both 
ou
r GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates going forward.
 
As an update on our share repurchase activity as of today, we have 
completed approximately 90% of the ASRs at an average price of 
approximately $64 per share. As a reminder, we expect to complete the 
ASRs in ear
ly September.
 
We are estimating 1.21 billion weighted average shares outstanding for the 
fourth fiscal quarter and expect to exit the fiscal year with approximately 
1.16 billion shares outstanding post the completion of the ASRs.
 
Looking beyond the quarter
, we expect these market headwinds impacting 
our business to continue through the remainder of the calendar year and 
expect our revenues and earnings in our fiscal first quarter of 2020 will be in 
a range similar to our fourth quarter forecast.
 
We are opti
mistic that 5G will be a catalyst to market improvement with 
broader rollouts of 5G networks globally, including the US, China, Europe, 
Korea, Japan and Australia. We expect 5G device volumes to ramp more 
meaningfully in early calendar 2020 with new flagsh
ip device launches from 
global and Chinese OEMs supporting 5G.
 
In QCT, as we transition to 5G, our addressable dollar content opportunity 
per device is up to 1.5 times greater than a comparable 4G device, given 
greater chipset complexity and our ability to
 
capture 5G RF front
-
end 
content.
 
We remain confident in the incremental $2 of EPS related to the longer term 
contribution from the agreements signed with Apple as product shipments 
ramp. And one final comment, we will be hosting an Analyst and 
Investor 
Day in New York on November 19 this year. Please stay tuned for further 
details.
 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mauricio.
 
Mauricio Lopez

Hodoyan
 
Thank you, Dave. Operator, we are now ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Op
erator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Faucette with 
Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
 
James Faucette
 

couple of different forces that are impa
cting demand for QCT right now, both 
Huawei's more internal focus on China as well as pause in demand ahead of 
5G.
 
Can you talk a little bit about how that is impacting, not only unit volumes 
but the pricing and mix currently? And then how you're looking a
t the impact 
on at least qualitatively your anticipation for 5G volumes et cetera next year, 
especially since we seem to be coming off of a lower base?
 
Then as a follow
-
up, can you just talk a little bit more and give a little more 
color on how you may be 
handling any requests for renegotiation for the FTC 

terms of treating those requests and dealing with compliance in the interim? 
Thank you.
 
Dave Wise
 
This is Dave. Let me start and 
Cristiano will jump in. So if you think about 
the dynamics in the market we called down the market 100 million units, a 

We referenced in the comments the sell
-
through market to con
sumers being 
down 20% year
-
over
-

-
in down 5%. So we see the back half of the year, a conversion of those 
growth rates so the sell
-
in rates coming down more aggressively in the back 
half of the year.
 
Th
at in the back half of the year is compounded by some runoff of channel 
inventory that's been built up over the first half as well. And so some 
pronounced impacts on really Q3 with respect to the channel inventory 
runoff. And so we think that the market dy
namics in the market units flow 
out a little bit in Q3 and then hitting our Q4 and our fiscal Q1 as those 
dynamics play out.
 
And the way to think about how that impacts the business is first you think 
about QCT. We typically would see from a seasonal persp
ective maybe a 
15% to 17% increase in MSM shipments as we move from Q3 to Q4. I 
mean, obviously, we guided down 4%.
 
So if you think about jumping off from 156 million MSMs in Q3 that gap from 
what we normally expect to see is about 35 million units. About 
two thirds of 
that is market related with China being a meaningful component of that. I 
would point out that a lot of the China dynamics and certainly the things 
related to pause before 5G are more premium and high tier dynamics that 
are more impactful fro
m a revenue perspective for us.
 
And the other third would be really share shifts, there's OEM share shifts 
towards Huawei away from some of our OEMs, as well as a little bit of a 
share loss at the low tier, but that's not really sort of financially impactf
ul. 
So that's I think the way to think about the impacts on the next quarter to 
hear.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Jim, this is Cristiano. Just to add some additional color. So building what 
Dave had said, if you remember I think China got authorization to launch 5G 
bac
k in the June. And so there was a lot of uncertainty whether they will 
launch or not given the environment they did the launch.
 

confidence on the 5G transition as we had some of the OEMs
 
cancel some of 

seeing a lot of requests for pulling in and we see preparing for the 5G ramp 
at the next selling season. And one we do have this I would say onetime 
impact as Huawei deman
d got suddenly reduced in Europe there we saw an 
increased focus of Huawei in China. That kind of changed the OEM mix.
 
But the general sentiment and that's what we're seeing in the activity is to 
drive as fast as possible to the 5G ramp as we bleed this in
ventory on the 
premium and high end channel and we see 5G ramping across multiple tiers 
as Steve said even at the price points of $300 and above.
 
Alex Rogers
 
Jim, this is Alex. On the second part of your question, how we're handling 
requests for renegotiat
ions. As you may have seen we had a number of 
request for renegotiations coming. We've also had license agreements that 
were in the process of renegotiation recently.
 

FRAND proce
ss that the licensee has an opportunity to drive to a fair 
reasonable and non
-
discriminatory result in any license agreement that's 
ultimately reached.
 

to get to a process that rec
ognizes the value of our portfolio. We think 
--
 
which we think is a very, very good as 5G ramps.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with 
Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Chris Caso
 
Yes. Thank you. I 
guess first question is on the sell
-
through versus the sell
-
in expectations over the next couple of quarters and understand what you 
guys said on the revenue expectations for you that take into account some 
of the inventory adjustment that's going on.
 
What
 
are your expectations for sell
-
through? Does it stay at this sort of 
down 20% year
-
on
-
year rate as we get into the 5G transition at the 
beginning of next year? What's embedded in the guidance?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

e not expecting to sell
-
through to 
remain low through the rest of the calendar year reflecting as we said sort of 
some of the macro environment, but also really some of the pause before 5G 
ramps more meaningfully next year.
 
So we expect that to remain low 
and then the sell
-
in to start to converge 
towards that over the remainder of the year. And then that's just as we said 
compounded by the fact that there's been some channel inventory build 
-
 

robably factor.
 
Chris Caso
 
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow
-
up, I guess we all understand 
that you're hoping to get a stay in the FTC ruling. Could you lay out for us 
what the contingency plans are in the event that a stay is not granted? What 
are the steps that would need to be taken and what would be the financial 
impact of having to take those steps before appeal is finally decided?
 
Don Rosenberg
 
Hi. Chris, this is Don Rosenberg. As you know, we are smack in the middle 
of the Court of Appeals
 

what we can say about that. But I should point out, I don't think it's missed 

erroneous in many, many respects. And the fact tha
t United States, the 
Justice Department through the 
-
 
with the support of the Department of 
Defense and Department of Energy have filed a brief 
-
 
statement of interest 
rather in support of our motion to stay, in which among other things they 
objected both 

to be successful on the merits.
 
In addition the Court of Appeals has expedited their review of our appeal on 

think a
s I said that there is a widespread view that our chances are very 

stay and then proceed from there.
 
Alex Rogers
 

ental points 
that can't be missed is that the current agreements are valid and 
enforceable even the FTC has waited and said that the agreements are not 
nullified, and so that's very important.
 
In addition we have a couple of what I would call anchor agreem
ents that 
are very good agreements that we're quite happy with and that's Samsung 
and the recently signed Apple agreement. And as I said our IP position is 
very, very strong through 4G and ramping into 5G.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from t
he line of Blayne Curtis with 
Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
 
Blayne Curtis
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could 
comment on Apple purchased Intel's modem and then as you think longer 
here, it sounds like Huawe
i's focusing more on post this ban 

 
attempted 
ban here, focusing more internal on their modem. I know you shift to a 
portion of that, so I'm kind of curious.
 
Any view on how this Apple purchase affects the $2 you guys talked about? 
And then can you just c
omment on Huawei and if they gain share and do 
more in
-
sourcing, the opportunities for you as you go into 5G?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Blayne this is Steve. I'll handle the first one and Christiano I think is going to 
jump in onto Huawei question. I would say in t
erms of the recent news flow, 
it's really 
-
 
I think that was pretty highly anticipated. It was clearly 
anticipated in the agreement that we did. Remember we did two agreements 
a patent license agreement as well as a product agreement, multiyear 
product agr
eement.
 
We don't see anything changing in terms of our ability to deliver on those 
agreements and we think it still remains a pretty competitive at least 
attractive competitive dynamic for us when you look at industry and our 
roadmap versus others even aft
er those agreements expire. And I think very 
clearly in answer to your question we don't see any impact to the $2 number 
that we have put out there.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi. This is Cristiano. So on the Huawei, Huawei has been in a number of 
years that their pre
mium and high tier has been focused on their own. And I 
think our shipments to Huawei so kind of that mid
-
to low tier pair. But I look 
at the Huawei focus on China a little different; I think it creates an 
opportunity for our customer base coming out of Ch
ina companies like Vivo, 
Oppo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi, outside China especially in Europe that's 
accretive to us especially in the 5G transition. And we look that opportunity 
is probably permanent not one
-
time. I think the interest on the European 
carriers ha
ve been very high.
 

we're kind of generations ahead on our 5G chip, I think the latest report 
show that the Huawei modem is at least 50% bigger in area than the first 
generation QCT.
 
I thin
k, we had compete with many other companies throughout the years 

drive a good transition for us to look for customers in China including 
competing with Huawei in domestic China as
 
well.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with 
JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with 
-
 
kind of 
question on 5G. 
You're clearly excited about your position in 5G, but as you 


going to a big driver. So how you are seeing
 
kind of the progress on that 
front?
 
And just as a follow
-
up, I think you mentioned kind of plenty of operations 
you expect to launch 5G. Can you just help us think about the mix of sub
-
six 
versus millimetre wave?
 
And you mentioned you would expect the mil
limeter wave to be mandatory 
kind of what's driving your view there given what we hear is the 
infrastructure is not really ready to support millimeter
-
wave in most 
geographies yet? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Samik, this is Steve. Maybe I'll take the first on
e and Cristiano will jump in a 
bit on the RF components. I would say, I look at the 5G rollout in general 
has a higher intensity and a more global nature than what we saw even in 
4G. So the pressure that we are getting to accelerate not only the premium 
ti
er, but also higher tier devices is pretty amazing.
 
If you were to look China Mobile came out with a data point that said 
essentially RMB 2,000 devices roughly $300 phone that will be where they're 
going to target the 5G line next year pretty substantial b
y the end of the 
year. That's pretty substantial move.
 
I would expect at the beginning of the year, which is what really focused on 
right now, you'll start to see that line be somewhere close to the RMB 3,000 
so roughly $430 price point. That's pretty sign
ificant actually.
 
And it's anticipated in our roadmap in terms of our integration. You may 
have seen us and remember that we have talked about how we have been 
moving our 5G into an integrated roadmap even more quickly than we did in 
4G.
 
Now two things hap
pened to us that I think are beneficial in addition to just 
a good a dynamics that happen when you have transitions in technology. 
One is because the complexity of 5G goes up the ASP of the baseband, we 
tend to have an attractive move just from the ASP bas
eband alone tier
-
to
-
tier. So 4G same tier to 5G same tier. The ASP the baseband is good for us.
 
Secondly, we see a strong opportunity in the RF to grow the content of the 
device. As you know, we have had strong traction there in part because of 
the importa
nce of wrapping the system design around the antenna.
 
You will see consistent with the design that I mentioned or the feature that I 
mentioned dynamic spectrum sharing you'll see an opportunity to extend of 
those 5G RF design opportunities into the legacy 
4G bands as they are 
effectively dynamically reformed with that feature.
 
So we see a continued roadmap for us to continue 

 
to grow content per 
device and that's why we've been investing so heavily to put that in place. 
It's in a place now, and the real ac
tivity is for us is how quickly can we get 
this to ramp and can we do it worldwide. So we are pleased with that, I 
would say the dynamics. And we have a lot of visibility to that. We have a lot 
of confidence that we think that we'll be able to do it.
 
Alex 
Rogers
 
Hi. So Cristiano, just to answer your question on sub
-
6 and millimeter wave 
mix. So millimeter wave right now is a requirement across all the main 
carriers in United States. I think we saw phones again launch the millimeter 
wave, and in 2020, we'll 
see that in Korea and Japan.
 
So if you look at developed economies, I think of Japan market, Korea 
market and the States market require millimeter wave. That will be no high 
attached in terms of the total 5G volumes. But it's not stopping there.
 
So Europe 
that is launching with sub
-
6 millimeter wave has already been 
auctioned in Italy. And it is a now likely to get license in the UK as well. So 
5G's really been designed for the combination of sub
-
6 and millimeter wave. 
And we are optimistic about millimeter
 
wave attach increasing.
 
One other thing to mention is, sub
-

reforming on existing spectrum because of the dynamic spectrum sharing 
technology. So that also create opportunity for us to expand our RF front
-
end that

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of 
America. Please proceed with your qu
estion.
 
Tal Liani
 
Hi, guys. When you say that there is slowdown in the 4G versus 5G, is it 
only China
-
specific? Or can give the global context of this comment? It's just 
hard for me to believe that there is any slowdown in Europe or the US 
because of 5G. S
o I want to understand it?
 
Second can you comment on relationship with Apple, post the acquisition of 

-
 
where 
do you see yourself kind of in the future playing with Apple, kind of how do 
you w
ork with Apple, given that they're going to have a modem asset in
-
house? Thanks.
 
Dave Wise
 
This is Dave. I'll start. So let me start with China. So we are seeing a pause 
or a slowing in terms of 4G orders in advance of 5G in China. Really there is 
a number
 
of 

 
as we reference a number of dynamics going on in China right 
now. There is sort of a realignment of the sell
-
in towards the lower sell
-
through growth rate, so some compression on growth rate in the back half of 
the year, the channel inventory being d
rawn down. And so headwinds for the 
OEMs in terms of the market in the China in the back half of the year.
 
And then what we're seeing is an element of the softness in the sell
-
through 
market, really being attributable to more high and premium tier segments
 
of 
the market pausing before 5G. So we are seeing that 
-
 
some of that pause 
before 5G and a desire by some of our OEMs try to accelerate efforts to 
bring 5G into the market, so seeing that there.
 
Outside of China we referenced lengthening replacement rate
s in developed 
markets like the US and Europe. And so, we think a little bit at play there as 
well in terms of some pause again at sort of the higher tiers in advance of 
5G.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And Tal, this is Steve. With respect to Apple, I think the relati
onship is quite 
good what really characterizes it now is the 100% of the intensity is how do 
we get products out together. Very natural I think for both companies.
 
We and I think both sides really anticipated that there would be some 
announcement like you've seen. But it hasn't changed the way in which we 

products out together and I think that's very healthy relationship.

Thank you. Our next question comes f
rom the line of Ross Seymore with 
Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hey, guys. I want to talk about the 5G side. You're clearly excited about the 
first half of next calendar year. Can you talk a little bit through do you think 
it's going to be more of a unit demand environment where that's really going 
to rise? Or is it going to be more of a substitution effect there? And people 
on the sell side and buy side should more or less focus on that 1.5x 
increasing content that you talk
ed about Steve?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yeah, Ross. I think as we look out over the next year and the transition to 
5G, we don't really look at it in terms of being a unit growth story, where 
the market units increase. What we really see is in a flat market, the 
transition over to 5G creating an opportunity for us by the fact that our 
monetization per phone is going up as Steve referenced. We see high rates 
ASPs associated with the complexity as well as the capture of the 5G RF 
front
-
end content. So it's really mo
re about of that as a growth driver for us 
as we head into the first calendar quarter next year and on into rest of fiscal 
2020.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Ross, this is Cristiano. I'd like to add the following. When you look at the 
first half just the launch of the 5
G by the operators and how unlimited data 
plan starts to move to the 5G devices you'll see that replacement and with 
that you do see this 1.5 factor coming in as we grow content and RF front 
end.
 

ith every 
different a transition. Some of the service of every a video or gaming or 
streaming gaming starts to become more popular and device form factor 
changes for a larger screen. You could see the market growing faster than 
single
-
digit. But we're not 
making that assumption for 2020.
 
Ross Seymore
 
That's helpful. I guess as my follow
-
up question sticking with China theme in 
general, can you give us whether its your QCT revenues or the MSMs any 
sort of even rough estimates about the percentage of those th
at are 
associated with China, because the year
-
over
-
year growth rates you're 
talking about, or decline in this instance are quite acute.
 
I know in the September quarter you had 14 weeks last year and some of 
things have changed and you walked through the i
nventory dynamics. But 
even if I adjust for those, it seems like you're down a better part of 15%, 
20% year
-
over
-
year. So to the extent China is such a larger exposure for 
you, can you just talk about how big is it?
 
And is there anything that you can do to
 
help mitigate these sorts of booms 
and busts as we go into that first half of 2020, when the count with the 5G 
ramp could lead to the same sort of volatility?
 
Dave Wise
 
Yeah. A quick comment on year
-
over
-
year, so if you take a look at where we 
are year
-
ov
er
-
year there's a couple of thing 

 
couple of factors that affect 
the decrease, or the reduced level of revenues. One, I would remind you 
that last year there was significantly more Apple in our business versus the 
current quarters.
 
So that's a meaningful 
portion of the decrease in revenues on a year
-
over
-
year basis. We also had some low end share loss over the last year that had 
some contribution to the reduction as well, but Apple a big part of it in terms 
of QCT.
 
On the QTL side, just to highlight it in 
the year ago quarter we had $500 
million from Huawei compared to $150 million in the current quarter. So, 
overall that contributes to the comparison also.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And I will just add one 
-
 
this is Steve. I would just add one I think you have 
an un
usual event here, which was the reaction of Huawei to the ban and 
how it retrenched into China. And I think that was a very unusual share shift 
that obviously we got impacted probably more than other folks probably 
because the tiers and the OEMs that were 
impacted are ones that we tend to 
monetize.
 
We think that gets back into more normal position kind of snaps back the 
other way with the launch of 5G. And hopefully, wouldn't have a one
-
time 
event like that, but it should be more stable post that big ramp w
ith 5G.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with 
Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. A couple of additional question 
on China, one from each side of the busine
ss. I know Steve or Cristiano, I 
know you've talked a little bit about the Huawei retrenchment and the 
impact on QCT units. It's been topical that obviously China after the Huawei 
entity list stuff and other factors has maybe focused more as a country on 
i
ndigenous development.
 
Have there been any movements for high silicon to supply any other OEMs 
in China or for OEMs broadly source from China? And then on the QTL side, 
since Judge Koh's ruling any change in compliance with Chinese OEMs 
outside of Huawei t
hat we should note? Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thanks for the question. Look, I think the way to think about it, Huawei had 
a sudden change in their phone landscape, especially what happened with 
Europe. I think there was a drastic reduction in demand. An
d I think that 
causes them to be very focused on China, because that's the place they 
could be focused on.
 
I think the big picture answer to your question is China has many initiatives 
and their initiative in China is not only about China domestic 
market, but 
also the Chinese mobile system growth outside China. And what we have 
seen, it's 
-
 
our relationship with China remains a very healthy and is 
expanding, and in addition to the relationship with Vivo, Oppo and OnePlus 
as they range in Europe, we 
recently signed an agreement with Tencent 
talking about content in 5G use case development.
 
And I expect that the relationship between QCT and China in the 5G era will 
continue to be healthy, because we help the expansion outside China. And 
that's how we l
ook at. We don't see any signs today that the dynamic is 
changing.
 
Alex Rogers
 
And then this is Alex. On the QTL side, there was as we referenced one 
incident that would have affected the compliance and we engaged very 
rapidly on that take to it very serio
usly. But as you can see as we ended the 
reporting here we've got good compliance.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with 
Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for 
taking my question. I wanted to ask about the QCT 
trajectory. So, I know you talked about inventory flash and some of the 
weakness in everything else. But at the same time, if I look at your forward 
guidance on chipsets, I mean you've been missing for the 
last several 
quarters. So why all of a sudden is the inventories in a pause in front of the 
5G versus just a continuation of the trend that we've already been seeing for 
the last three or four quarters?
 
And for my follow
-
up, I just want to know do you guys
 
think 5G overall is 
accretive to licensing revenues? I mean, you lowered the rate when you 

incremental unit growth for the market for 5G. So, how do we think about 
5G's impact 
on the run rate of royalty revenues as it is today? Thank you.
 
Dave Wise
 
Hey, Stacy. So, with respect to QCT side, first of all, I would make the 
comment that stepping back over the course of this year, I think with the 
recent 100 million unit reduction, w
e've seen a sort of a continuing erosion 
in the handset market over the course of this year. So, this has been 
something that has been a headwind for the business I think for the last 
several quarters. And so I think that's been a dynamic that has been 
imp
acting MSM units as well as sort of the overall business.
 
I think what we saw this 
--
 
what we're seeing now is maybe a little more 
pronounced growth impacts on the back half of the year as again we go back 
to the sort of sell
-
through rates remaining down i
n China and the sell
-
through 
--
 
sell
-
in rates not yet aligned with that.
 
So realignment there 
--
 
the fact that they weren't aligned in the first half 
resulting in some channel inventory build. So, really more market dynamic in 
terms of pressure on units.
 
A
s we said a little bit of share loss at the low end, not financially significant. 
And then the more I would say unique situation was Huawei really 
entrenching and focusing on the domestic China market and really putting 
their attention there and grabbing s
ignificant share.
 
So, that little bit more of a unique situation to what we're seeing right now. 
But I would say a lot of it is really attributable to the market headwinds that 
we've been frankly seeing all year long.
 
And then QTL, with respect to how to t
hink about that as a 5G as an upside 
a lot of the agreements we signed are for 4G 
--
 
3G, 4G, 5G. And so really we 
look at it as just a continuation and extending of the monetization of the 
handset market as it evolves from 4G to 5G just like we did from 3G
 
to 4G.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC 
Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mitch Steves
 
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just had a quick one just kind of 
turning back to the ASP
 
as expected if we're going to ramp 5G faster. So I 
guess two parts. So, first does this mean that essentially we're going to see 
kind of a bigger pause in smartphones shipments and then to increase 
demand for the kind of 5G shipments out in 2020? And then
 
secondly, if 
that's not the case, what should we think about as a kind of a normalized 
unit base for the smartphone industry at this point?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes. In our comments when we talked about the 100 million unit reduction, 
we kind of gave a sense 
it's 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion units in total. We 
indicated that now translates into a handset market being down sort of mid 
single digits year
-
over
-
year.
 
And so if you look 
-
 
if you step back over the last number of years, it's been 
relatively flat hand
set market, so down a little bit as we see some of this 
pause and some of the macro environment impacts affecting us. So we don't 
really see any sort of it changes in the overall unit market beyond the 
comments that we made.
 
Mitch Steves
 
Yes, just to clari
fy a quick, I heard you guys, did a good job as a question 
referring more to 2020, so essentially, if people are pulling down the 
numbers for this year. Does that mean essentially 2020 should be up like 
7% or 8% to kind of offset those as more of a down ye
ar or is it too early to 
call that?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

expect to as we said see an inflection beginning in the first calendar. So it 
will be our second fiscal quarter with 5G launc
hes happening more 
significantly in China, as well as other flagship device launches at Mobile 
World Congress and things like that and then sort of a building over the 
course of the year as we think about moving towards really more flagship 
launches happen
ing in the fourth fiscal quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman 
Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
 
Rod Hall
 
Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just a couple of things, I wanted to 
ask kind 
of deviate from all the demand staff and just ask you if you could 
update us on the CFO search kind of what the status of that is? And then I 
also want to come back to just the demand stuff, just to kind of clarify what 
your 
--
 
what information you're acti
ng on?
 
So are you seeing 
-
 
did you see deterioration of demand through the 
quarter? Could you just kind of talk to us about what sort of data points 
you've seen here and how they came to you? Did things weaken toward the 
end of the quarter or they just rem
ained weak or kind of give us some idea 
what trajectory look like to you? Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Rod hi, it's Steve. We continue to look nothing to announce right now. But 
we'll keep you updated.
 
Dave Wise
 
Then with respect to sort of how things have 
unfolded I guess more recently. 
So one I think we tracked like the CMMR Report. I mean, we track that like 
probably a lot of others in terms of watching what's happening with the sell
-
through. And so we've seen that continue to be down even through the Jun
e 
quarter with really no significant movement away from that trend.
 
And then we'll look at that relative to kind of where we see handset demand 
coming in with respect to sort of our own data points around the markets. 
And so we look at it from that standpo
int.
 
We look at our demand profile is coming in from customers in QCT and 
factor that into the mix as well. And that's why we've seen some of the 
pullback that we talked about with respect to 4G units.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
This is a Cristiano. Like we

I think 
I've mentioned it before. We saw some 
phone model cancellations, which is on the 4G segment second half launch. 

metric having the phone model cancellation on the 4G side.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's question

answer session. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before 
adjourning the call?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. And maybe 
ju
st to the employees of Qualcomm, thank you for a good quarter. We have 
a lot of work ahead to launch 5G. It's a big opportunity for the company and 
look forward to the next several quarters. And a lot of work to do, but I think 
a great opportunity for us. 
Thank you.

Thank you, Warren, and good afternoon, everyone. We just completed a 
solid quarter with record performance in QTL, as the global adoption of our 
broad set of technologies drove all
-
time high 3G/4G device shipments by our 
licensees. In addition, 
we had several major accomplishments, including the 
resolution of the NDRC investigation, our announcement of a $15 billion 
stock buyback authorization, and a 14% increase in the dividend.
 
We are pleased that the NDRC investigation has been concluded and b
elieve 

broad adoption of 3G/4G technology. The impact of the resolution and the 
recent agreement with a large licensee in China announced on the January 
call are starting to pos
itively impact the QTL business. Derek will discuss this 
in more detail in a few moments.
 
While we are ahead of our expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, we 
are guiding the second half lower due to a number of factors in QCT. First, 
the extent
 
of the impact of OEM concentration at the premium tier and the 
impact of share loss in the Galaxy S6 and Note.
 
Second, the altered launch plans of the OEMs in the premium tier with some 
OEMs delaying launches and then OEM rationalizing their portfolio by 
deemphasizing designs using our legacy parts. We are not seeing a change 
design share or the competitive environment, but rather a change in timing 
of some 810 designs.
 
And finally, QCT continues to face competitive pressures in China. The China 
contributi
on to earnings is roughly flat to the previous outlook with more 
strength at the premium tier offsetting some expected share loss in the low 
tier in the fourth quarter. As I will explain later, we expect this near
-
term 
trend to improve as we launch new par
ts and China enters modem transition 
later in this calendar year.
 
Based on our current customer engagements and our future product 
roadmap, we do not believe these product cycle issues reflect the long
-
term 

 
we do believe the impact 
of the current product cycle will extend into next fiscal year.
 
Clearly, we are not pleased with our reduced outlook. Accordingly, we have 
initiated a comprehensive review of our cost structure in QCT and 
throughout the company. T
he goals of this review are to align our cost 
structure with the changing marketplace and improve efficiency. We have 
begun a comprehensive assessment of costs and opportunities for greater 
efficiency company
-
wide with the help of an outside expert and wil
l be 
reporting on those initiatives on the Q3 earnings call.
 
With respect to the roadmap, we remain confident that our differentiated 
Snapdragon processor and modem leadership positions us well across 
multiple price tiers and customer segments entering the
 
next product cycle. 
In the premium tier, we are very pleased with the design traction on the 
Snapdragon 810 with over 60 designs having won the key premium design 
slots with the exception of Samsung.
 
Since our last earnings call, LG has begun shipping the
 
innovative G Flex2, 
Sony has announced the incredibly thin Xperia Z4 phone and tablet, and 
Xiaomi has announced the Mi Note 4 with category 9 carrier aggregation. 
Recently teardowns and press reports correctly highlight the advantages 
delivered by our int
egrated approach.
 
We are also encouraged by the customer interest in our new Snapdragon 
820, which is on track to ship in the second half of this calendar year and is 
built on the latest FinFET node. The Snapdragon 820 represents a new 
design point for our
 
SoC architecture and will be the first to include our new 
custom 64
-
bit CPU microarchitecture.
 
Since our last call and in response to the competitive environment in China, 
we have also enhanced the Snapdragon 615, which will be commercial this 
year. In ad
dition, we expect a modem transition in China later this year and 
we are seeing signals to the OEMs from the operators consistent with this 
view. Our Snapdragon 425 with industry leading uplink carrier aggregation 
and a new low
-
cost RF front
-
end is well po
sitioned for this opportunity and is 
on track to be in devices later this calendar year, well ahead of our 
competition.
 
Turning to the longer
-
term outlook, the smartphone opportunity remains a 
strong positive for Qualcomm and we forecast continued healthy 
global 
demand in the near
-
term and over the next several years. IDC estimates 
that over 8.5 billion smartphones will be sold from 2015 through 2019. We 
also continue to gain traction in adjacent areas where our mobile 
technologies and capabilities can deli
ver next generation solutions. Areas 
such as automotive, the Internet of Things, mobile computing, and 
networking, these areas are expected to represent large new opportunities 
for Qualcomm with over 5 billion new non
-
phone connected device 
shipments expec
ted in calendar year 2018.
 

year 2015 estimated revenue. In automotive, for instance, we have over 40 
connected car programs with 15 plus OEMs and we recently announced two 
new mode
ms, the Snapdragon X12 and X12 that augment our portfolio to 
support connectivity across all tiers of the automotive industry.
 
Our scale and position in mobile makes us well positioned to capitalize on 
these opportunities. In summary, we are well positione
d to address the 
significant opportunities ahead given the strength in our core businesses and 
traction in new growth opportunities. We are focused on completing our 
implementation of the rectification plan in China, concluding new license 
agreements in Ch

future generations of the modem and connectivity, including 4G 
enhancements such as LTE
-
U and 5G, as well as future evolutions of Wi
-
Fi 
and the convergence of Wi
-
Fi and Cellular. We are confident in
 
our QCT 
roadmap for the reasons I just explained, but intend to take a 
comprehensive look at our cost structure in
-
light of the changing industry 
dynamics and structure.

Thank you Steve and good afternoon everyone. As Steve noted, we 
delivered a solid quarter achieving record non
-
GAAP operating income. QCT 
operating performance was in
-
line with expectations as favourable operating 
expense offset slightly weaker mix. Q
TL performance was ahead of 
expectations with revenues, earnings before tax, and total reported device 
sales all setting records driven by strong 3G, 4G device shipments, improved 
compliance in China and a catch up amount for prior period sales from the 
li
censee with which we recently resolved the dispute.
 
Fiscal Q2 revenue for QTL was up approximately 17% year
-
over
-
year even 
without this catch up amount and in the face of foreign exchange headwinds, 
QTL would have delivered a record quarter across these sa
me metrics. As 
you are aware, we recently announced a resolution with China's National 
Development and Reform Commission regarding the investigation of us 
under the China antimonopoly law. As part of this resolution, we agreed to 
implement a rectification 
plan that modifies certain of our business practices 
with respect to the licensing of our 3G and 4G essential Chinese patterns for 
branded devices sold for use in China.
 
Since that time we have been implementing the plan and offered the revised 
license ter
ms for our current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patterns to both 
our current licensees and to a number of unlicensed OEMs and 
manufacturers. Following the offers we have met with a large number of 
licensees both in and outside of China to discuss the revise
d terms. Although 
we are still relatively early in the process, we are making good progress to 
date as over 35 licensees have accepted the revised terms so far, including 
with respect to 3
-
mode devices sold in China.
 
The rate at which licensees are accepti
ng the new terms and signing new 
license agreements has been accelerating throughout the process. We now 
have 125 licensees in total with licences covering 3
-
mode devices with more 
than 85 in China, including Huawei and ZTE. We are making progress on the 
u
nderreporting issues in China as well. We estimate that approximately 200 
million units were sold during calendar 2014, but not reported to us by our 
licensees in line with our prior guidance.
 
To put this in greater context, we have also increased our esti
mates for the 
calendar 2014 global 3G 4G market by approximately 20 million units versus 
our prior guidance and now believe that a larger percentage of the units 
shipped in 2014 where 3
-
mode devices where we had a low collection rate 
during the year. In ot
her words, the percentage of calendar 2014 units that 
were reported to us came in higher than previously expected. As we 
continue to implement our compliance and audit plans, as well as conclude 
new 3
-
mode license agreements we believe that this collection
 
percentage 
will continue to increase and we are seeing early evidence of that in the 
March quarter sales.
 
While we are making good progress we do expect this process to extend 
beyond this fiscal year. It is also possible that in some cases it may require 
litigation and/or actions to compel certain licensees to honour the contracts 
and for unlicensed companies to execute new licences. We are prepared to 
pursue that path if it becomes necessary. We are raising our fiscal year 
outlook for QTL based on favoura
ble total reported device sales in the 
second fiscal quarter, in addition to higher forecasted total reported device 
sales for the second half of the fiscal year. Total reported device sales for 
the second fiscal quarter came in above the high
-
end of our g
uidance range, 
a portion of which was driven by higher than expected catch up amounts.
 
Our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year reflects updated favourable 
reported device sales trend, improved compliance in China, and expected 
continued progress
 
on concluding license agreements in China, offset by 
foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect QTL revenues to grow 
approximately 8% at the midpoint year
-
over
-
year. This includes the 
favourable effect of some catch up payments for prior sales offset by th
e 
negative effect of foreign exchange, without including these two effects we 
estimate that QTL revenues would grow by more than 8% in fiscal 2015, as 
we believe the negative foreign exchange impact is larger than the catch up 
benefit.
 
Turning to our 
view of global 3G, 4G device demand we continue to see very 
healthy growth and have increased our calendar 2014 global 3G, 4G device 
shipment estimate to approximately 1.37 billion units, up approximately 
27% year
-
over
-
year. As a reminder, this includes th
ose devices we expect to 
be reported to us, as well as our estimates of unreported and unlicensed 
device sales, but excludes TD
-
SCDMA devices that do not implement LTE.
 
We saw strength in both developed and emerging regions during 2014 and 
finished the yea
r with favourable replacement rate trends in developed 
regions, as well as LTE volume strength, particularly in China. We expect 
these growth trends to continue throughout calendar 2015. We now expect 
global 3G, 4G device shipments to be 1.25 billion units
 
to 1.6 billion units in 
calendar 2015, up approximately 11% to 17% with our buyers continuing to 
be towards the high end of that range.
 

According to GSMA intelligence only 8% of g
lobal connections are LTE. In 
February, China granted nationwide FTD
-
LTE licenses to both China Telecom 
and China Unicom, each of the Chinese operators has announced significant 
investments in LTE network build
-
outs and has set aggressive targets for 
subsc
riber additions this year. For calendar year 2014, we are increasing our 
estimate of reported 3G, 4G devices to between 1.17 4 billion units and 1.19 
billion units.
 
Turning to estimated 3G, 4G device ASPs, the ASP of devices reported to 
QTL during the seco
nd quarter of fiscal 2015 was approximately $196 at the 
mid
-
point. Absent the effect of prior period catch up units the reported ASP 
would have been approximately $211 at the mid
-
point up $14 sequentially, 
driven by stronger ASPs in both emerging and devel
oped regions, reflecting 
a favourable mix of higher tier handsets.
 
We are now forecasting global 3G, 4G device DSPs to the decline 
approximately 11% to 12% year
-
over
-
year in fiscal 2015, an improvement 
to our previous estimate of 12% to 13%, despite an inc
rease in negative 
foreign exchange effects. The improvement is primarily due to a favourable 
mix of higher tier handsets and stronger pricing in the low to mid
-
tiers of 
LTE devices in China. We now expect global 3G, 4G total device sales in 
fiscal 2015 to 
be up approximately 8% to 11% over fiscal 2014, despite 
foreign exchange headwinds, driven by both stronger units and ASP, 
particularly in emerging regions.
 
Turning to the regulatory issues, we have been notified that the Korean fair 
trade commission is co
nducting a new investigation of the company. We 
believe this new investigation relates primarily to our licensing business and 
we are cooperating with the agency. To conclude, QTL is making good 
progress on our efforts in China, while experiencing strength
 
in underlying 
demand where we continue to see strong global 3G, 4G device sales and 
stronger global ASP trends.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to George Davis.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you Derek and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal sec
ond
-
quarter 
revenues were $6.9 billion, up 8% year
-
over
-
year and non
-
GAAP earnings 
per share were $1.40, up 7% year
-
over
-
year at the high end of for prior 
guidance range. In QCT, MSM shipments were $233 million in
-
line with 
expectation with revenue of $4.4
 
billion. Implied revenue for MSM was 
approximately $19, down slightly quarter
-
over
-
quarter, reflecting a lower 
mix of premium tier shipments than previously expected.
 
QCT operating margin was 17% in
-
line with our prior expectations. In QTL, 
total reported
 
device sales for our licensees were a record $75.8 billion, up 
14% year
-
over
-
year and at the high end of our guidance range, including 
the impact of our higher than expected catch up report. Non
-
GAAP combined 
R&D and SG&A expenses increased 2% sequentiall
y, driven primarily by 
seasonal increases in payroll taxes.
 
We continue our aggressive capital return program, returning approximately 
$2.6 billion to stockholders in the quarter, including $689 million of 
dividends paid and $1.9 billion in stock repurchas
es.
 
And as you will recall, in March we announced a major increase in our capital 
return program, including an increase in our stock repurchase authorization 
to $15 billion and our plans for a $10 billion buyback in the next 12 months, 
which is incremental
 
to our ongoing return of a minimum of 75% of free 
cash flow.
 
Fiscal second quarter cash flow from operations was negative at 
approximately $650 million this quarter reflecting a long
-
term capacity 
prepayment of approximately $950 million made by QCT as pa
rt of our 
supply chain cost reduction initiatives and the payment of the approximately 
$975 million NDRC fine.
 
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29.6 billion. 
Our non
-
GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 20% above expectations du
e 
to business mix. We now expect our non
-
GAAP tax rate to be approximately 
19% for fiscal 2015.
 
Looking ahead, as we already indicated, we are reducing our financial 
forecast for fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower excepted and profitability in 
the premium 
tier for the QCT business. We now estimate fiscal 2015 
revenues overall to be in the range of approximately $25 billion to $27 
billion, down approximately 2% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. The 
increased impact of the product cycle issues in QCT is affecti
ng our revenue 
and margin outlook for the chip business. We now expect QCT revenue for 
the fiscal year to be down approximately 6% year
-
over
-
year with operating 
margin for fiscal 2015 between 14% and 17%.
 
We expect combined non
-
GAAP R&D and SG&A expense to
 
be up 1% to 3% 
year
-
over
-
year. This represents a reduction of 2% overall relative to our 
prior guidance, however, this outlook does not factor in potential reductions 
to be identified as part of the cost assessment that Steve discussed.
 
On the QTL, as Der
ek indicated, we are raising our fiscal 2015 revenue 
outlook to approximately 8% growth year
-
over
-
year reflecting higher total 
reported device sales as well as the larger than forecasted catch up royalties 
reported this past quarter. We continue to expect 
QTL operating margins will 
be within our prior 85% to 86% guidance range.
 
We expect fiscal 2015 non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 
$4.60 to $5, down approximately 9% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint relative 
to fiscal 2015 and down $0.15 at th
e midpoint from our prior guidance.
 
Turning to our fiscal third quarter, we estimate revenues to be in the range 
of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion, down approximately 15% year
-
over
-
year and 16% sequentially at the midpoint. The sequential chang
es 
reflect both the chip revenue challenges and the normal seasonal effects of 
QTL coming of its seasonal peak quarter.
 
We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be in 
the range of $0.85 to $1 dollar per share, down approximate
ly 36% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect fiscal third quarter non
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up 6% to 8% sequentially, 
primarily driven by QCT product roadmap spend that back half loaded, 
certain supply chain initiatives, as well a
s cost related to marketing and 
legal.
 
In QTL, we estimate total reported device sales of $61 billion to $67 billion 
will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they 
made in the March quarter, up approximately 10% year
-
over
-
year at 
the 
midpoint, but lower sequentially as compared to the seasonally higher 
holiday quarter shipments in Q2.
 
We estimate that the QTL reported device ASP will be modestly up versus 
the second fiscal quarter, which included higher
-
than
-
expected lower price 
ca

83% and 85%, lower sequentially due to seasonal factors, OEM mix, as well 
as increases in marketing and legal expenses. We expect that the implied 
royalty rate as we calculate it will 
be lower quarter
-
over
-
quarter, reflecting 
licensee mix, as well as the impact of the new licensing terms in China.
 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 210 million to 230 
million units during the June quarter, down approximately 6% sequenti
ally 
and down approximately 2% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. We expect 
revenue per MSM to be down 8% to 9% sequentially due to unfavorable mix 
in the premium tier and price competition in the mid tier.
 
We expect QCT operating margin for this product cycl
e to bottom in the 
fiscal third quarter at approximately 7% to 10% of revenue, reflecting lower 
volumes, weaker mix, and timing of roadmap spending pushed into the 
quarter.
 
That concludes my comments and will now turn the call back to Warren.

Thank you. Just a question on the chip side, I guess you mentioned before 
the GS6, you also mentioned the Note, so just curious is that this upcoming 
one later this year? And maybe talk a little bit about how we should think 



margin is down again for the division. So if you could just maybe touch on 
Samsung impact across the model? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

products at Samsung. We anticipate a similar share picture than what you 

cycle, as I mentioned in my re
marks, I think we feel that we have a very 
competitive roadmap. We are also seeing OEMs and I think the supplies to 
that OEM, looking at their portfolio and rationalizing, what that really means 
is putting more concentration on the newer products and less 
on the legacy 
products as you would typically see in a particular year and that obviously 
given our design and share impacts the outlook as well. So, those product 

premium tier is very
 
concentrated really in two players right now.

Hi, guys. Can you perhaps talk about some of the cost synergies or cost 
savi
ng that you might see as you go through this kind of evaluation of your 
cost structure? Are you targeting things like wafer design cycle times? Or 
can you maybe talk about it and how do you see that potentially helping 
your operating margins particularly i
n QCT as move forward? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 

that we started in 2014, which were fairly comprehensive. We brought down 
the rate of spending substantially in 2014 exiting the year 
lower than the 
run rate we had coming into 2014. We then forecasted to bring it down 

guidance on OpEx as well. But we will be looking pretty comprehensively 
across the board and c
ertainly that touches everything from how can we be 

 
become more efficient testing projects once again for ROI and things like 
that. So, as you would expect, it will be comprehensive and we look forward 
to reporting on it next quarter.

Your next 
question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord 
Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Great, thanks. Just down on the last two questions, on the QCT with 
operating margins potentially bottoming out below 10% in the third qua
rter, 
September quarter, and you talked about it extending into the first half of 
fiscal 2016. Other than looking at operating cost, how does the gross margin 
improve given the competitive cost environment? Or to ask it another way 

the thought process to maybe get back to high
-
teens to 20% operating margins in QCT? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
I think we view it as a bottom because, first, Q3 really is an incredibly 
concentrated quarter when you look at the premium tier and it has within 
that meaningful Samsung GS6 impact. We expect to see some improvement 
with the premium tier launches of other leading OEMs that use our 
Snapdragon. We also expect cost and efficiency activities to start to 
moderate some of the market structure impacts over
 
time, but ultimately we 
are going to continue to invest strongly in the roadmap and we think that's 
the basis for having a competitive position in the next product cycle that is 
different than what we are experiencing now.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Mike this is St
eve, I think also if you look up and down the product line, the 
current product cycle that we are in at the top tier, we think it turns over 
with the 820, at the bottom tier you tend to see a modem transition, 
particularly in China, which is advantageous w
e think to us. We are also 
moving rapidly toward advanced notes which we think will actually help us in 
terms of delivering products to market at better costs. There is a little bit of 
a trough right now in the cost equation because we are at 20 nanometre.
 
As 
we move on to further notes we think we get into a better cost perspective 
and I think we are differentiated also in our ability to do it.
 
We are also 
-
 
just to follow up on the cost side, cost structure of the 
company, we want to make sure that we put
 
ourselves in the position, we 
are a little bit less sensitive to the these market dynamics and then we can 
write them out easier as well. One other thing element on that also is that 
the adjacent markets as they start to contribute more, again I said they
 
were about 10% of QCT this year that tends to help us as well. They tend to 
be fairly highly leveraged from the same investment on the selling space.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. 
Please go ahead with your
 
question.
 
Ehud Gelblum
 
Hey guys appreciate it. I know Derek you are not going to totally tell us, but 
trying to try and give a couple of data points you gave us with respect to the 
catch up and how large that was, any other information you can give us in 
terms of the access TRDS this quarter that the catch up helped would help 
kind of bridge the gap between the TRDS this quarter and next quarter. So, 
whatever you can do to give us a sense as to the size of the catch up period 
in this quarter would be helpf
ul.
 
Then Steve question on GS 6 and note going forward, I understand of the 
revolution of using your custom core and moving them to 14 nanometre et 
cetera with everything you said about concentration at the premium tier, if 
in a situation you don't get bac
k into Samsung, where does that leave you? 
If your share in the GS 6 and note going forward is roughly the same as 
where it is now when it is back
-
and
-
forth, is there enough other market to 
make the margins work back into the 20% plus range at QCT?
 
Derek A
berle
 
Hey this is Derek. Yes we are not, as you suspect we weren't planning on 
breaking out exactly the amount of the catch up. One of the points I wanted 
to highlight was we had 17% year
-
over
-
year growth in QTL this quarter and 
that was in the face of som
e meaningful foreign exchange headwinds. And 
so when you sort of looked at that impact netted against the catch up 
amount, you know the foreign exchange impact was actually for the year will 
be greater and would be for the quarter as well. So still even if
 
you strip out 
the ketchup would be a record quarter for QTL and really strong growth.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And Ehud on the question about the premium tier and the concentration. 

scenario to plan for. We do think that our roadmap is very compelling, we 
like the impact that we are gett
ing, the interest that we are getting from the 
OEMs, I think broadly we also think our business, which is also supported by 
our modem leadership also we think is in a good position when you look at 
the competitive dynamics as well. That being said, it woul
d help us a lot if 
the industry structure was to be different. We don't have a lot of control 
over that, but I would say the history of that is that it does move around 
quite a bit. We want to be in a position to participate in that and I think one 
of the 
reasons that we are looking at our cost structure is to make that 
easier to handle, should we have to ride out a product cycle or not.

Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Curtis with Barclays. Please 
go ahead with your question.
 
Blain
e Curtis
 
Yes a [indiscernible], just maybe from a very high level you obviously 
already reduced full
-
year guidance based upon kind of same factors and 


 
kind of holding in. Samsung has been very 
public about their AP plans for a longer time here for a change. So, I am just 
trying to figure out what has changed really since the end of the last year 
and definitely spend your first negative revision of maybe
 
a billion dollars, 
now that you are doing again. And then when you look at gross margin, 


another step down
 
over a couple hundred basis points? Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So, the change in the guidance is really more a change in our view of the 
sizing and concentration in the third quarter compared to our original 
estimates. And you know Steve talked about some thing
s about some of the 
OEMS pushing out their timing based on what they were seeing in the 
marketplace and other factors. There is some gross margin impact actually 
that we see going into Q3 and then I think the balance of the impact is really 
the timing road

Steve, you want to say something.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
I was just going to say, just a little bit of color from a perspective of an OEM, 
OEMs typically have a pretty broad portfolio and they may put 
emphasis in 
one place or another depending on the reaction of a flagship launch and the 
timing of a flagship launch. I think this year is probably characterised a bit 
by the first calendar quarter of 2015 was probably a little stronger in quarter 
for U.S. 
based flagship company. And then people move around I think 
based off of big launch. So, I think when the Galaxy S6 came out people 
moved around their plans a little bit, including Samsung. So, that tends to 
ripple through to us beyond our control. Those t
hings can also change a lot 
during the year, but I think this is our best estimate of where we are today.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit 
Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
Thanks. M
y question is for Derek on the licensing side, what I'm trying to 
understand is I think you said you had signed 35 licensees on these new 

some kind of broad indications to, does that
 
actually cover a significant part 


have as we head into fiscal year 2016 of recapturing some of tho
se licensing 
revenues. That's my kind of first question. The second one is as I think 

year would have grown I assume given the market shares the Chinese 
vendors have gained and the
y would have grown revenues quite 
meaningfully as well. So, should we think about at some point over the next 
whether it is one two or three years? That 200 million unit number which 
has a revenue number attached to it in TDRS, so you then license against 
and it should be significantly higher when it starts coming in or is that the 
wrong way of thinking about it. Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Kulbinder this is Derek. So just to be clear the 200 million number that we 
put out for 2014 is sort of a combination of unit
s that we think are actually 
being sold by licensees who didn't report them, as well as basically 
unlicensed activity, you know the most prominent one we talked about is 3
-
mode. So, it is a little bit hard to translate that over into the 

 
kind of the 
new 
terms. If you think about the new terms that we are going out to offer, 
if the licensees accept them after we offer them and discuss them with them 

thought about the under reported amoun
ts, as well as then impact the 3
-
mode, which we had kind of bucketed at unlicensed.
 
So it is a little bit hard to split that out in terms of what percentage get 
picked up that we weren't collecting anything on at all, but we are, well I 
think we are making
 
good progress, we've got relatively significant number 
that kind of run the spectrum of very large to small companies that have 


-
mode devices sold for use in China
. So, I think that 
has been a positive trend for us. There have been a couple of other positive 
things. One is as I try to explain the market we think actually came in larger 
in 2014 than we thought when we originally gave out that 200 million unit 
number,
 
which means by that holding steady effectively our collection 
percentage went up. It also went up in the face of kind of a worse or a more 
difficult market shift because more of the market also we believe was three
-
mode where there is a larger portion of 
unlicensed activity.
 
So kind of in a worsening marketing environment and a growing market, we 
were able to kind of hold the number flat, which means we are making 

quarter based on t



 
that the past sales will be things that we

that will come

Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, if I sort of back into the 
royalty rate trajectory, you seem to be guiding royalty rates or implied rates 
next quarter to maybe 3%, probably down 20 basis points and m
aybe even 

starts to come back in which it actually is coming at the lower rate, how 
should I think about the trajectory of royalty rates as I go into 2016 and 
beyond is presumably 

growing the biggest and it will be under the new royalty rate terms?
 
Derek Aberle
 

sort of quarter
-
over
-
quarter Q1 to Q2 relatively sp
eaking sort of in line in 
terms of the implied rate that you guys calculate, we do see that taking a 
step down in the back half of the year and I think you pretty much hit it on 

a 
number of the other factors that always move it around. But we do expect 
a couple of things impacting the back half, two of which are the licensees, 
kind of the impact of the licensees accepting the China terms in China, but 
also with us concluding agreeme
nts on three
-
mode where we were collecting 
before.
 
As we bring that revenue into the program that will come in at a lower rate 
as we talked about when we announced the resolution. So kind of the 
combination of those factors will push it down. Really hard t
o say longer

previously explained in terms of market share of OEMs and ASPs and caps

Your next question comes from the line o
f James Faucette with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
 
James Faucette
 
Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask two follow
-
up questions on a 
lot of those that have already been asked. First, can you talk a little bit 
about from a 
visibility standpoint, I think one of the things that may be 
concerning to some investors is, I guess, the poor or lack of visibility relative 
to new product launches. They seem to taking a little bit by surprise. Can 
you talk about it if that indeed has b
een the case et cetera on the chip side? 
And then on the royalty side, Derek, I just wanted to ask about, as you are 
addressing the new licensing structure how are you handling the non
-
essential IP licensing and how we should think about the impact of that
 
and 
can you give us any sense of 

 

terms of like what the 

 
the rate at which things are 

 
or you are signing up 

think about your 

 
what a r
easonable alternate capture rate should be and 
that kind of thing? Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
James on the chip side, the way I think about it 

 
one of the big OEMs what 
they tend to do, in fact the one that you are probably concerned with, they 
tend to h
old two designs until very late in the process and make a decision 
very late in the process. And in some cases, actually might go to market 
with multiple designs, one with our chip, one not with our chip, and then 
make a decision regionally even during the
 
ramp of the design. So it can be 
quite difficult to project share and units as a result of doing that much later 
in the process than I think people typically think. The other element which is 
mix of OEMs and who wins in the marketplace and whether an OEM 
decides 
to rationalize their portfolio by no longer focusing on SKUs in the n
-
1 product 

visibility into and it tends to be something that the market controls. So I 
think we are all tryi
ng to figure out how to get a better handle on that.
 
Derek Aberle
 
And then 

 

we are going to deal with the patents that are sort of outside the scope of 
the commitment we made to the NDRC. 

licensed generally our whole portfolio together, but one of the things that we 
agreed to as part of the rectification plan in China is that we would 
separately offer to license just the 3G/4G essential Chinese patents and then 
we would negotiate agreements for the rest of the portfolio kind of separate 
from that.
 
So really the first order of business for us is to go out and really implement 
the commitment that we made which is to offer these terms and around the 
essential portfo
lio and get those concluded. And then as part of those 
discussions, it could involve some of the other patents or we could end up 
dealing with the need for licenses to the rest of the portfolio down the road a 

e and are thinking around fiscal 
2015 really just is based on what we would expect to collect on the essential 

remainder of the portfolio, although we do believe there is an opportuni
ty 
there.
 
On compliance, we think that we are in a position really to kind of drive the 
business back more to normal course before we had the investigation and I 

to take some time
 
to get there, but we do believe that we can get back to a 
high compliance environment in China with some of the tools that we have 
available to us and now with the investigation behind us.
 
We do also think there is going to be some industry dynamics that 
will help, 
I do think there is going to be consolidation around the OEM base in China, 

easier thing to deal with from compliance standpoint than a lot of smaller 
players. And they are
 
going to build successful export businesses where 
there is a need to play by international rules both inside and outside of 
China. So I think over time those trends really point in a positive direction 
for us.

Tal Liani
 
Hi, guys. I just have two questions quick questions kind of big one. First, 
when it comes to exchange rate, are we 

 

exchange rate? I
s there a risk that actually you see the impact of exchange 
rate next quarter because of the mechanism that you can clarify? And then 
the weird question I have is really for next year and this question was asked 
many times, but may be a different way, is i
t all 

 
if you think about 
competition, I mean you think about MediaTek and Intel and Marvell and the 
local Chinese, how does it get better from here? I understand that this one is 
a trough from an expense point of view and margin point of view, but on the
 
business, how does it get better from here? What needs to happen for you to 
see growth in revenues on the semiconductor side? And let me stop here 
[indiscernible]. Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Tal, this is Derek. Maybe I will answer your first question on the FX.
 
Really 
the primary FX effect on the company is really around the licensing business. 
And couple of things to remember there I think that you know is that 
obviously the sales are reported to us one quarter in arrears. But the basic 

 
probably the most sign
ificant exposure for us is really the euro and basically 

difficult to always estimate precisely the impacts, but I think we have a 
pretty good sense of it at a higher magnitude. But ba
sically there is a 
mechanism for them to convert their sales in local euro back into dollars for 
purposes to calculate in the royalties and that creates an impact to the 
business. If you think about this year, in particular, there is probably at least 
a co
uple of percentage points of revenue growth that QTL has been 
impacted by just on FX alone.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And on next year and to the forward
-
looking view in terms of the 


 


 

changin
g that much and I would say our view of the current competitive 
environment may be different than what you see, you know we look at the 

and we pretty good about our position there. I t

differentiator for us. We have also moved quickly to advanced nodes. One of 
the things we did this year and we are currently investing in is moving 
rapidly across the tiers to the advanced nodes, which we think is a good 
strategy a
nd enables us to leverage our feature leadership in the premium 
tier down and that I think has good results.
 
It's being offset a little bit now because of the concentration in the premium 
tier, so you're not seeing that maybe as broadly as you would think.
 
The 
product cycle is quite fast in China as I mentioned. The modem transition 
later this year, I think a number of OEM, our competitors are having a 
difficult time producing five more designs and certainly have in the ability to 
do multi
-
SIM and all of th
e VOIP and international features that allow them 
to grow, at the same time we are changing the table stakes across the tiers 
on the modem. So we actually view our roadmap as getting stronger over 
time at least based on our view of the competitive environm
ent. I don't think 
at the premium tier with the exception of the vertical threat at one of the 

implied in the question.

Thank you very much I had two. First of all Steve, can you again just from a 
higher level, can you remind us or maybe discuss the high level merits for 
keeping the two

this new one from Korea. So again just getting your view there would be 
good. And then secondly I noted that George talke

payment is this opportunistic or is it more

a defensive I guess?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 


is something that is constantly and periodically discussed at the 
manag
ement team and at the board level. There are lot of puts and takes 
and those puts and takes change over time depending on the situation, but I 
would say just broadly you should think of the businesses as having 
significant synergies in the ability to deliv
er products to market.
 
So, for example the channel of QCT is very, very important to be able to 

to work. There are many things like that, but that is one of the ones that we 
want t
o make sure we can maintain, particularly given that we are driving

Fi 
and Cellular and the modem itself is moving much more rapidly then I think 
people are thinking. At the same time the
 
industry, the number of players 
who are investing in those technologies and that breadth of technology is 
decreasing. So we think we have an opportunity for us to continue to deliver 
modem innovation. That being said, it is something that we actively eval

question, in terms of QCT, can you walk through implied PBT [ph] margins 
into 
September and your long term outlook for MSM pricing and then a little 
bit bigger picture thanking on the chipset side. As you think about adjacent 
growth, particularly hyper connected areas like IOT and Auto, do you have 
the scale across technology custom

succeed or do you need to look at acquisitions, and if yes, would you 
consider large scale M&A, or would you continue to focus solely bolt

ng the effects both of the positioning

Steve Mollenkopf
 
And with respect to the adjacent businesses, there are a lot of technologies 
that are leveraged from the mobile space. There are some things that are 
not, for example, we got t
hings like networking from the Atheros acquisition 
and we believe we are going to get a strong portfolio of technologies with 
the announced acquisition of CSR, which we hope will close here in this year. 
I think one of the things you get besides technology
 
is the sales channel and 
the ability to sell into different types of customer then our current slate in 

reasons why we have done M&A. It is also I think an environment in the 
indust
ry right now where there is a lot of consolidation, particularly in the 
semi

conductor space and it is something that we think about and I think we 
can potentially have an opportunity to de

risk some of those things if we

Srini Pajjuri
 
Thank you. Steve, this question 
has been asked, but I just want to ask a 
little differently, you said in the modem differentiation is your key 
competitive advantage and you seem to be banking on that, you know to 
regain some of the business, I am just curious you know given that in a lea
d 
that you have, it appears that Samsung is using an internal modem even 
now, even though I guess they could have used your modem with their own 
processor, I am just wonder, is the modem technology that mature that 

fferentiation or in a 
-
 
what do you 
think cause that.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Well I think when you have a vertical decision there could be many more 
elements in the decision than just technical merits or what might have 
happened outside of that environment. They
 
have the ability to share one 
place or the other. When we look at the tier downs of those decisions we 
tend to see that it compares at least from a feature and a geography point of 
view to a product that we probably delivered two generations ago. So, I 
wo
uld actually view it as more evidence of our modem lead.
 
Now it is possible to portions of the SKUs without having the modem 
expertise, but I think you are always better off having in the application 
processor and the modem together and have that worldwide
 
scale, 
particularly given the industry structure today. We are seeing that the very 
attractive in the case of the internal OEMs or the Chinese OEMs that want to 
go international. So, we still think that modem is an important component. If 

in the head of any modem player they have enormous

So, we think the modem still ha
s an enormous migration and then upstream 
and then beyond that you are going to have 5G. So the modem continues to 
be big. In addition, hopefully we are not downplaying the strength of our 
application process. So, we have 

 
we think the best mobile CPU com
ing and 

strength in the GPU is, I think quite strong, we are market leader in terms of 
mobile GPU shipments and look at the performance of the 89, 94 I think you 

strong. So, we feel like we are in a good position. We 
just need to get through this product cycle, maintain the investment in the 
roadmap and at the same time sort of get ourselves in a position where we 
can weather out these storms a little bit easier an
d I think we are going to 
have a reasonable business there.

Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond 
James. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Tavis McCourt
 
Thanks for taking my question. Derek you ran through a few nu
mbers, now I 
want to make sure I had them right, they are not addition up to me. I think 
you said QTL ASP this year would be down 11% to 12% in the fiscal year. 
Device sales would be up 8% to 11% but revenues will be up 8% or so, was 
that the right numbers
 
for fiscal 2015?
 
George Davis
 
So I think we probably 

 
we kind of mix
-
and
-
match a little bit. The units are 

not the one that necessarily will get reported to us, that sort of the al
l
-
in 

guidance on a reported ASP for fiscal 2015 for a number of reasons, 

payments and the timing of signing some o
f these new agreements. So I 
think that may be your difficulty in trying to triangulate the numbers back to 
the 8% revenue guide for QTL.

Tha

some of the smartphone makers do spend money to develop their own 

would change anytime soon because the mar
ket is maturing and Samsung, 
Apple, they all want to focus on improving their margins. So within those 
confines, how should we think about the automation in terms of pushing it to 
new markets outside of smartphones and how to fund those investments so 
that
 
we can actually see a better return on the invested capital in other 
segments of the business? Thank you, gentlemen.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Mark, you are breaking up a little bit. So I will try to answer what the 
question was and I think it was related to how w
e can continue to invest and 
have confidence given that some people are trying to go internal. Our 
evaluation of the efforts to go internal, they actually tend to be more 
expensive than if you had bought them externally, particularly when you 
amortize the 
R&D investment across all of the many different technologies 
that are required to produce and integrate it or a mobile smartphone 
offering. In fact, I would say, particularly, given the fact that in some cases 
people are launching very early in the node, y
ou really pay a penalty for 
yield. And our estimate is that it would be quite expensive right now to be 
launching without good yield.
 
I think you will also see if you look at teardowns, the difference between the 
size both footprint on the board as well as
 
cost to assemble all of the 
components that we have in Snapdragon using external partners, it tends to 
be fairly expensive. For example, Snapdragon has GPS integrated inside of it 
and putting that on externally tends to be fairly expensive. There are 
numb
er of things, codec, a number of things that sit there and become more 
expensive. So our view of the trend is that things are moving more toward 
integrated versus less toward integrated. And when we look at the 

ave people compete, have the 
same internal offering unless you have a fairly large scale, R&D scale.

This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do 
you have anything further to add before adjourning the call?

Mollenkopf
 
Thank you very much for your attention. We look forward to a call next 
quarter and will give you an update on our cost initiative at the time. Thank 
you.

Mollenkopf.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to first take a few 
minutes to 
discuss the performance of the company both in the quarter and 
against our longer term goals before providing my perspective on the legal 
and regulatory matters impacting the company. I'm very pleased that in the 
time of these external challenges our emplo
yees are executing well on our 
expansion into new opportunities and at the same time improving the 
competitive strength and profitability of our industry leading product.
 
We reported fiscal third quarter non
-
GAAP earnings per share and revenues 
consistent 
with our revised guidance and above the guidance range midpoint 
driven by better than expected product mix in our semiconductor business. 
Our QCT business is executing very well with profitability up both 
sequentially and year
-
over
-
year. QCT has now delive
red improved year
-
over
-
year quarterly profitability for five consecutive quarters on the strong 
execution, as we have continued to refresh our product roadmap, delivered 
improved product cost and grow EBT margins despite the impact of second 
sourcing at Ap
ple over this same time period.
 
In Mobile, QCT continues to see strength in the highly competitive China 
region and is executing well across all price gears. Our gigabit LTE and 5G 
leadership combined with our Snapdragon 835 and new Snapdragon 600 
product 
are well ahead of our competitive solutions. We continue to see 
good traction in our QCT adjacent opportunities of automotive, networking, 
mobile compute and IoT, where our efforts deliver, our technologies are 
gaining momentum.
 
We saw a strong revenue gro
wth in those adjacent businesses in fiscal 2016 
and forecast growth of more than 25% in fiscal 2017. As reflected in our 
fourth quarter MSM guidance, we expect QCT's strong performance to 
continue. We are ramping investments necessary to extend our leaders
hip 
position in 5G as operators and customers seek to accelerate their launch 
date.
 
We now believe that both millimeter ways and sub
-
6 gigahertz capability will 
be table stakes for 2019 5G launches. The modem technology and 
complexity is increasing and we 
believe we can continue to outperform our 
competitors with our level of 5G innovation. It is clear that our technology 
position and product roadmap are strong as they have ever been.
 
In addition, we believe the pending NXP acquisition will provide us great
er 
scale in automotive IoT security and networking with their highly 
complementary product and world class sales channel, serving the long tale 
of customers that are driving growth. The combined company will be a 
technology and semiconductor leader with fu
ture annual revenues projected 
to be more than $30 billion.
 
The NXP transaction remains on track to close by the end of calendar 2017. 
We have regulatory clearance in four jurisdictions including here in the U.S. 
and Taiwan and we continue to make progress
 
in our work with regulators in 
five remaining regions.
 
In QTL, third quarter results and fourth fiscal quarter guidance reflect the 
impact of our dispute with Apple and the licensee dispute that we disclosed 
last quarter. Despite the near term financial i
mpact to our business by the 
actions of a small number of powerful industry players, the long
-
term 
outlook for our licensing business continues to remain strong. With more 
than 300 freely negotiated global license agreements and a technology 
portfolio that
 
is fundamental to the performance of wireless and mobile 
computing devices today and for many years to come. The licensing 
business will continue to be a significant revenue and profitability generator 
for the company longer term.
 
Moreover it is important
 
to remember that 3G, 4G device trends which are a 
key driver of QTL financial performance remain very healthy. We are 
forecasting 3G, 4G device shipments to grow by approximately 6% in 
calendar 2017. The long
-
term growth outlook for units combined with 
mo
derating ASP decline, are consistent with our prior expectations for longer 
term globally 3G, 4G device sales growth.
 
Turning to the current legal matter, we believe we hold the high ground with 
regard to the dispute with Apple. We will take the actions th
at are needed 
and appropriately defend the tremendous value that our innovations bring to 
this industry, innovations which enable a competitive ecosystem to thrive. 
You have now seen some of the steps we have taken in our dispute with 
Apple, including the 
filing of patented actions in the U.S. ITC and in U.S. and 
Germany court to address the use of our unlicensed IP in their devices.
 
We do not take these challenges lightly and we are focused on achieving the 
right long
-
term results for the licensing busines
s, which also is in the best 
interest of our stockholders. We know that fundamentally these issues are 
driven by commercial interests and contract negotiations and we will 
continue to work to reach resolutions as we have done in the past.
 
As you know, we h
ave a strong relationship with Apple for many years and 
they have been a long standing and valued customer. We intend to continue 
to provide them with our industry leading products and technologies as we 
always have and do our best to remain a good supplie
r to Apple even while 
this dispute continues.
 
Derek will provide further detail on the actions we have taken in connection 
with our dispute with Apple as well as the specific steps we have taken in the 
other matters to defend the value of our innovations a
nd our business 
model.
 
Looking ahead, our innovations driven by decades our R&D investments are 
at the forefront of multiple new industries and product categories. Our 
intellectual property as never been more valuable and relevant and 
opportunities ahead f
or Qualcomm have never been greater. Our breadth of 
technologies and products continues to benefit from our ongoing strategy to 
invest ahead of the industry and combined with our global scale and 
partnerships, we are extremely well positioned to grow into 
an expanding 
step of new opportunity.
 
Further with the pending NXP acquisition we will further accelerate our move 
into these exciting industries. I will now turn the call over to Derek.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. QTL fisca
l third quarter 
revenues were $1.2 billion with earnings before tax as $854 million. As 
Steve mentioned, QTL fiscal third quarter results reflect non
-
payment of 
royalties on Apple products by Apple's contract manufacturers, as well as the 
non
-
payment of ro
yalties by the licensee with which we have a dispute that 
was disclosed last quarter.
 
During the fiscal second quarter, the licensee reported and paid only a 
portion of the royalties it owed under its license agreement and at that time, 
we expected the lic
ensee to continue to report and pay sum, but not all of 
the royalties they owe for the fiscal third quarter. Although, we remain in 
discussions with this licensee in an effort to resolve the dispute, the licensee 
did not report or pay any royalties during 
the fiscal third quarter.
 
This is a dispute as per the terms of the licensee's existing agreement that is 
similar to a number of the ones we have resolved in the past and we expect 
to be able to do that again here. With Apple's contract manufacturers 
refus
ing to fully report their total reported device sales for Apple products 
and the licensee with which we have a dispute also with holding reporting, 
we are not providing quarterly actuals or guidance for total reported device 
sales and related unit shipment
s and ASPs by our licensee. Because the 
significant portion of quarterly activity is not available and would not be 
included in those metric, making them incomplete in a limited value.
 
We are however, providing quarterly QTL revenue guidance to help our 
in
vestors model our expectations for the licensing business going forward. 
Despite the near term impact of these items, which we believe we will be 
able to resolve over time to QTL financial performance it is important to note 
that 3G, 4G global sales and de
vice trends remain very positive.
 
For fiscal 2017, global 3G, 4G handset ASPs continue to track consistent with 
our prior expectations of low single digit percentage declines year
-
over
-
year. 
Global ASP trends continue to be strong this year with ASPs conti
nuing to 
increase in China and for devices sold by Chinese OEMs globally. We also 
continue to see healthy growth in global device sales for the fiscal year, 
consistent with our longer term growth expectations of mid
-
single digit 
annual percentage increases
.
 
For calendar 2017 3G, 4G device shipments, we continue to estimate 
shipment of 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices globally, up approximately 
6% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. Our licensing and compliance initiatives 
remain on track and continue to bea
r fruit. Excluding the effect of the 
underreporting caused by the disputes with Apple and its contract 
manufacturers as well as the licensee I just described which we do not view 
as compliance issue. We estimate that the level of compliance by our 
licensee
s were sales during the March was in line with sales by our licensees 
during the December quarter.
 
As you have seen from our recent announcements, we continue to actively 
pursue resolutions of the challenges to our licensing business that have been 
orchest
rated by a few of the most profitable and powerful companies in the 
world. And to defend a well
-
established value of our patented technologies in 
the regulatory and other legal matters in which we are involved. And our 
appeal of the Korean FTC decision hea
rings were held last week in the Seoul 
High Court on our motion to say that remedial portion of the KFTC's order 
while we proceed with the appeal. We expect to get a decision on the 
request per se in the coming month.
 
The U.S. FTC lawsuit is on track to be
 
tried at the beginning of 2019. We 
look forward to demonstrating that many of the facts are wedged in the 
complaint are wrong. And the FTC's legal theories are without merit. As to 
the Taiwan FTC investigations, we continue to work to find a resolution an
d 
we are continuing to cooperate with the TFTC. We also continue to work 
through additional investigations in Europe. However, those investigations 
do not target Qualcomm's licensing business or practices.
 
Finally as Steve mentioned, we have now filed 
patent infringement 
complaints against Apple with both the International Trade Commission and 
in Federal Court in the US. The six patents are assorted in those actions 
enable high performance in a variety of areas of the smartphone while 
extending battery 
life. Each of the patents does so in a different way for 
different popular smartphone features. While the technologies covered by 
the patents are central for the performance of the iPhone including internal 
performance, graphics, higher data rates and netw
ork capacity, flashless 
boot and power management.
 
The assorted patents are not essential to practice any standards in a mobile 
device or subject to a commitment to offer to license those patents. We 
expect that the ITC investigation will commence in Augus
t and that the case 
will be tried next year. We expect the Federal Court case to trail the ITC 
action will be stayed pending the conclusion of the ITC act.
 
This week we also filed two patent infringement lawsuits in Germany against 
the Apple seeking damage
s and injunctive relief for iPhones imported into or 
sold in Germany. The patents we are asserting in these cases represent two 
technologies important to iPhone functions. But again they are not standard 
essential patent and are not subject to end commitme
nts to license those 
patent.
 
Similar to the ITC process here in the US, we expect this litigation in 
Germany will move on a fairly fast timeline with an outcome likely in 
approximately 12 months. In addition, we have filed a motion asking the 
Federal Court
 
in San Diego to require Apple's contract manufacturers to 
comply with the terms of their license agreement with respect to Apple 
product, while the various cases are heard.
 
Before it instructed its contract manufacturers to stop paying royalties to 
Qualco
mm, Apple had been indirectly paying royalties on its products based 
on the contract manufacturer agreement for 10 years. Nothing has changed 
Apple continues to generate substantial profit by using our technology in the 
contract manufacturer agreement rema
in valid. There will be a hearing on 
that motion in mid
-
August.
 
Yesterday, Apple's contract manufacturers responded to our claims against 
them and the motion I just described. In addition Apple start to oppose our 
motion in the contract manufacturer cases,
 
as well as to consolidate the 
contract manufacturer cases with the Apple cases. These filings by Apple and 
its contract manufacturers prove what we have been saying all along. Apple 
has interfered with our license agreement with its contract manufacturers
 
by 
instructing them not to pay the royalties they owe for sales of apple product 
and then agreed to indemnify and protect the contract manufacturers 
against any damages and payments they would owe to Qualcomm as a 
result of Apple instructing them to breac
h their license agreement.
 

statement and actions in the litigation. If Apple hadn't interfered with the 
licenses and instructed the contract manufacturers to take these actions, the 
c
ontract manufacturers would not be contesting the licenses now. It is 
important to remember that in most cases our license agreements were 
negotiated and entered into with the contract manufacturers before Apple 
ever entered the smartphone market. And then
 
Apple decided to rely on 
them for a decade, before now trying to disrupt them.
 
One of Apple's claims has been that this is just a dispute about how much 
they should pay for using our valuable intellectual property and that they 
have stopped paying because
, they don't know how much to pay us. This is 
quite obviously wrong. As I just explained the long standing and valid 
contract manufacturer licenses clearly specify the royalties that are due and 
payable on Apple products, yet Apple is interfering with thos
e contracts.
 
Further, we have made several offers to Apple to have an independent third
-
party result of parties best agreement over the value of Qualcomm's 
technology and set the royalty terms of a direct license between Qualcomm 
and Apple once in for all.
 
Apple has refused those offers each time, which 
shows they are more interested in pursuing the strategy the way rather than 
good paid resolution.
 
We will continue to vigorously defend the value of our innovation and our 
pro
-
competitive business model. Tur
ning to our datacenter business, we 
remain on track for commercial shipments of the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 
processor family by the end of the calendar year and we have already 
shipped more than 1000 evaluation platforms to leading customers and 
partners.
 
We
 
continue to be very encouraged by the engagement with and feedback 
from a variety of our growing list of customers and partners as to the 
performance of our product. In parallel, we are working hard to continue to 
build the datacenter ecosystem for Centri
q
-
based server. This quarter we 
announced the collaboration with Packet a leading bare metal cloud provider 
to deliver a consumable cloud platform based on the Qualcomm Centriq 
2400 processor for access by the software development community.
 
We demonstrate
d with Canonical a highly scalable OpenStack NFV 
infrastructure running on a Qualcomm Centriq 2400 platform. And we 
announced the collaboration with MariaDB to implement MariaDB's 
enterprise grade, database architecture on the Qualcomm Centriq 2400 
process
or to drive performance and compute that scale.
 
That concludes my comments. And I will now turn the call over to George.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Derek and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a 
solid fiscal third quarter consistent with our r
evised expectations. Revenues 
were $5.4 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share were $0.83. Our results 
were above the midpoint of guidance driven by better than expected QCT 
results on higher revenue and stronger margins. QCT EBT margin was 
14.2% for the 
quarter at the high
-
end of expectations driven by favorable 
mobile product mix. We are continuing to see strong traction in QCT 
adjacent opportunities with quarterly revenues from these areas in total up 
approximately 30% year
-
over
-
year. As a reminder our 
adjacent 
opportunities include our chip sales into automotive IoT networking and 
compute.
 
In QCT MSM shipments were 187 million up 4% sequentially and modestly 
below the midpoint of our expectations, on softness in mid and low tier 
devices. In QTL, revenue
s were $1.2 billion largely in line with expectations. 
Consistent with our revised guidance, the quarter was negatively impacted 
by our dispute with Apple, as they instructed their contract manufacturers to 
not fully report and to not pay royalties due on 
sales of Apple products.
 
In addition, we did not report QTL revenues from the ongoing dispute with 
the licensee that we disclosed last quarter, as that entity did not report or 
pay royalties this quarter. Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses 
overall thi
s quarter were up 6% sequentially, which was above our prior 
guidance of up 3% at the midpoint.
 
Our prior guidance reflected the impact of a full quarter of the RF360 joint 
venture spending being included in our results. The increase in spend 
relative to o
ur original expectations was driven by higher than expected 
litigation expenses, as actions related to our dispute with Apple escalated 
and from accelerating investment related to pending 5G trials and related 
technology development.
 
We believe these prior
ities are critical for value creation and preservation, 
but are contributing to higher than model spending in the near
-
term, which 
we will address as we get through this period. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate for the 
quarter was 5%, reflecting the prior period impa
ct of our revised April 
guidance of a full year non
-
GAAP tax rate of approximately 14%. As a 
reminder, our effective tax rate is influenced by the mix of onshore and 
offshore earnings. The result of a lower mix of licensing revenues which are 
onshore impac
ts that a full U.S. rate is a reduction to our overall blended tax 
rate.
 
Turning to our balance sheet, in May we issued $11 billion of debt in the 
capital market. The funds from this offering will be used to finance a portion 
of our proposed acquisition of
 
NXP and for general corporate purposes. With 
this financing, we have now completed our prefunding for the NXP 
transaction.
 
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $38 billion and 
total debt outstanding of $22 billion. Our non
-
GAAP oper
ating cash flow in 
the fiscal third quarter, which excludes the impact of the KFTC fine and the 
BlackBerry arbitration was approximately $2 billion or 39% of non
-
GAAP 
revenue. As a reminder, while a charge related to the KFTC fine was 
recorded on our incom
e statement in our fiscal first quarter and the charge 
related to the BlackBerry arbitration was recorded in our fiscal second 
quarter. The related cash payments for both were made in our fiscal third 
quarter.
 
Through our fiscal third quarter, we have retu
rned approximately $3.4 billion 
to stockholders this fiscal year, including $2.4 billion in dividends paid and 
$1 billion in share repurchases. This is consistent with our continued 
commitment to the dividend program and dividend growth and our intent to 
r
epurchase shares to offset dilution.
 
Turning to our fiscal fourth quarter guidance, we estimate revenues to be in 
the range of approximately $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion down approximately 
6% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint. Our revenue and EPS estimates ex
clude 
QTL revenues for Apple related products and for the other licensee in 
dispute. We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal fourth 
quarter to be approximately $0.75 to $0.85 per share.
 
We expect fiscal fourth quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D an
d SG&A 
expenses will be approximately 1% to 3% sequentially driven primarily by 
increased litigation related expenses and 5G investment. As Derek 
explained, we are providing guidance for QTL's segment revenues for the 
fiscal fourth quarter, which we expect
 
to be in the range of $1.0 billion to 
$1.3 billion. We expect QTL's EBT margin percentage to decrease 
sequentially and be between 64% and 68% reflecting lower revenues at the 
midpoint and increase litigation related expenses as we continue to defend 
our b
usiness model in various forms.
 
Turning to QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter of 
approximately 205 million to 225 million units up 15% sequentially at the 
midpoint driven by OEM product launches and continued traction with OEMs 
i
n China. We expect QCT EBT margin to be approximately 17% to 19% in 
the fiscal fourth quarter increasing from 16.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
2016 favorable mobile product mix and growth in adjacent opportunities 
year
-
over
-
year.
 
For our Snapdragon 83
5 premium tier chipset, we expect to supply of 10 
nanometer to largely meet demand in the fiscal fourth quarter consistent 
with our prior expectations. We expect that interest expense will be up 
sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter reflecting a full q
uarter's impact 
related to the $11 billion of debt issued in late May. For fiscal 2017 overall, 
we now expect the combination of investment and other income and interest 
expense to be roughly flat versus fiscal 2016.
 
Lower interest income year
-
over
-
year ha
s been supplemented with gains on 
the sale of higher risk assets in our portfolio, as we move into highly liquid 
short
-
term investments in preparation for funding the NXP acquisition.
 
That concludes my comments and I'll now turn the call back to John.
 
John Sinnott
 
Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go 
ahead.
 
Mike Walkley
 
Thank you very much. Just really trying to get a clarific
ation, so for the 
licensing dispute outside of Apple, can you just walk us through what from 
that licensee maybe was included in your Q3 results and what's excluded for 
Q4 guidance maybe you can help us on a sequential basis, just on that 
licensee maybe in
 
ballpark that dealt between Q3 and Q4? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hey Mike, this is Derek. So, I think when we reported last quarter, we had 
some amount of revenue from that licensee in Q2, but it was an 
underpayment, they didn't pay the full amount. And we 
at that time had 
expected Q3 to include an underpayment, but include some payment. And 
basically the way things turned out, they did not report or pay anything for 
Q3 and that's consistent with the way that we have guided for Q4. So, 
basically both of the 
quarters exclude any revenue from the licensee that's in 
dispute.
 
George Davis
 
Mike, hi it's George. Let me just add to that, I think one of the things that 
we've seen people struggle with is, the 
-
 
there is no constant since this is an 
individual OEM. So 
in Q2 going to Q3 is typically a step down in the level of 
revenues and then you have a seasonal uptick picking up for Q3 and Q4. So, 

the reasons why in the guidance for this
 
quarter we guided QTL revenue 
overall, because we understand using the old method of trying to get their 
TRDS's can be too difficult.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with 
your question.
 
Rod Hall
 
Yes great, thanks
 
guys. I guess, I had one clarification and one question. So, 
I wanted to on that last question with regards to this licensee, it looks like, I 
mean are detailed your guidance deviating another 100 million from what we 
were forecasting and even though I ge
t that you guys don't want us 

models to run that way. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us any idea 
whether the full with holding us payments from that licensee is in the 
ballpark
 
of say $250 million or something like that? Just so we can think 
about what the deviation from our model looking forward might be? And 
then, the real question I've got is on the European review NXPI that's moved 
a full review, can you, Derek could you jus
t give us any color on what is 
happening there, why reportedly anyway you guys have not decided not to 
go along with remedies that have been suggested and now we are into a 
more detailed review, was that always the expectation in Europe or has 
something ch
anged in regards to your discussions with the regulators there. 
So could you just give us a little bit more color on what's happening there? 
Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
So hey Rod, let me comment. I think one of the things I would remind 
people as they look at pa
rticularly the year
-
over
-
year comparisons for the 
licensing business, both in Q3 and Q4 comparatively. We saw good market 
underlying market in both of those, so there is no the 
-
 
any shortfall in your 
estimates are not really related to the market. What we
 
saw is there was 
catch up from the settlement of Chinese agreement in Q3 and Q4 of 16 that 
are impacting year
-
over
-
year comparisons. And so, one of the things that 
the models would need to show is the lower catch up in Q1 or should be in 
Q4 up 17 relative
 
to 16. And then the rest is really just Apple and the other 
licensee and the impact of the specific dollars related to those OEMs. But 
those are really the only factors impacting the underlying estimate.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hey Rod, this is Derek, let me just ad
d that, our practice historically has 
been not to disclose the identity of licensees when we're trying to resolve 
dispute and it hasn't yet gone to litigation. And so, we're going to go ahead 
and stick to that practice and so, we're not going to give speci
fic color on the 
amount of underpayment coming from any particular licensee. I think one of 
things just to think about in terms of volume, we have had catch up 
payment kind of flowing through QTL from prior period sort of quarter
-
to
-
quarter, we said that's
 
going to be lumpy and will be hard to predict in 
coming over time. And there were some those amounts, meaningful 
amounts in Q3,but I would say the midpoint of our 
--
 
QTL revenue in Q4 
doesn't really include a significant amount of that so, that maybe anot
her 
kind of deviation when you look into your model.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
And Rod, this is Don. I'll take your question about NXP in Europe. There is 
not a lot to say about that at all, but phase I process as you know is fairly 
short. We're dealing with significa
nt acquisition here in both with both the 
U.S
-
based company and a major European
-

surprising that we are moving into phase II, we are engaged in phase II, we 
will listen to any concerns that maybe expressed and we'll respond to th
em, 
we think within the time period that should be the normal run of phase II 
process. Obviously can't predict, but we're very optimistic about our ability 
to continue to demonstrate the complementary nature of this acquisition 
with four regulatory approva
ls already we think 
-
 
we're on a pretty good 
track there.

Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go 
ahead with your question.
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
Thank you. My question is for Derek
, well just on the dispute with the 
licensee, which is not, just to be clear not like a regular audit type which is a 
fundamental disagreement, on the both parties in terms of how the licensing 
agreement how that is being interpreted. So, this may come las
t for some 
time is that the right way of thinking about it?
 
And the second question is, in a world in which the smartphone market in 
revenue terms is building up growing very much, I would say 2% or 3%, if 
Apple do gain meaningful market share in the next 
two years it's reasonable 
to assume that even this licensing run rate would contract or the other 
drivers that we should think about, can we just think there is obviously a 
super cycle coming up there and Apple getting a lot of share in the 
[complete proce
ss] [ph]? And based on your [Technical Difficulty] these are 
right way to thinking about it?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Kulbinder, this is Derek. I think on the first one, I would characterize it this 
way, I mean we have 
--
 
the dispute we have with this licensee is a 
dispute 
over the terms of their agreement, not to just similar to ones that we've had 
in the past. They've resolved themselves in a variety of different ways 
historically, some of them, most of them frankly we've been able to resolve 
through some period of
 
negotiation.
 
We're still in that phase with this licensee and then you might recall back 
even just most recently with LG that did escalate even arbitration but, then 
we were able to resolve it fairly quickly even after the arbitration is to, was 
resolved.
 
So, I don't think we can predict with any certainty that exact 
timing, but I don't think it's a full drawn conclusion that this will be 

dependent on the circumstances.
 
I think you mig
ht have some, let me try to reframe kind of the second 
question, our view, I'll give you some data points to support this is that the 
license business has the ability to continue to grow with the end market. We 
see end market growth continuing going forwar
d, once we have these 
disputes resolved, and, I think even if you look at this quarter, we would 
have seen year
-
over
-
year growth in licensing business that you adjusted for 
kind of all the anomalies of the disputes and some of the one
-
time payment.
 
But, if
 
you step back and look longer term at the end market, the units 
continue to grow in line with our projections last year, unit growth was about 
10% in our current forecast, which were holding in calendar 2017 is about 
6% unit growth, and you combine that w
ith the moderating declines in ASPs 
and we still believe, the TRDS independent of any particular OEM. So even if 
Apple were to gain share is something that we'll grow in the mid
-
single 
digits.
 
And I think the, the thing that's been very positive for us thi
s year is that 
ASPs probably a moderating even the ASP declines are moderating even 
more than we expected meaning the declines are less than we would have 
expected going into the year. And that's largely being driven by strength in 
China as well as increas
ing ASPs by many of the Chinese OEMs as they build 
their businesses outside of China, which are couple of the important trends 
that we highlighted starting 2 or 3 years ago of why we believe we would 
see long term growth in the market. So again, if you wra
p that all up end 
market will continue to grow, we think it can continue to grow meaningful. 
And we think once we get through these disputes we can continue to grow 
the licensing business in line with that.

Our next que
stion is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
 
Doug Clark
 
Thanks. This is Doug Clark on behalf of Simona. One follow
-
up question to 
kind of the historical context of disputes with some licensees, I mean putting 
all of those together is there any genera
lization or kind of role that you've 
come to notice as a result of the resolution of these disputes they've either 
resulted in kind of deflationary to the royalty rate or as in certain cases 
you've been able to hold those royalty rate constant. I want to k
now if there 
is kind of any conclusion that you've drawn from those.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Doug, this is Derek. It's pretty hard to answer, in kind of at a high level. I 
think each individual deal is different, I would say through any of the 
negotiations and disput
e resolutions we 
--
 
I think we've been successful 
historically and obtaining, what we believe is a fair value for the portfolio. 
Some of those deals have taken different forms and different structures over 
the years, but I think by enlarge, that sort of th
e principle that we operate 
by, it's the same principle that we operated by as we resolved the remaining 

really the same principle that we'll be applying to our dispute with Apple as 
we look for trying to achieve the right long
-
term agreement for the company 
and consistent with the value of our intellectual property.
 
Doug Clark
 
Okay. Got it. And then my follow up question is, as we move to kind of the 
key market product launches partic
ularly upcoming iPhone, have any of the 
disputes in your opinion had any impact on how share will shakeout from a 
chipset standpoint?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi Doug, this is Cristiano. Look I think we had said, I think the things go 
back in time that we have plann
ed for multi
-
sourcing. And I think at this 
time, I think what we see will continue to be engaged with them on the 
product side, we feel very confident about, I think the capability of the 
product, I would argue that generation
-
to
-
generation our differentia
tion is 
actually increasing. And right now we see continue to receive orders from 
the CMs. So, I don't think we can at this point identify anything different 
than what we have been expecting.

Great. Thank you very much. Firstly Don, I know you touched on [Technical 
Difficulty] how since the NXPI acquisition was announced or the intension to 
acquire NXPI, how ar
e your conversation with kind of these opportunity with 
[Technical Difficulty]? Thanks.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
Hi, this is Don. So, on your NXP question to remind you there were nine 
jurisdictions originally that had to approve, we've 
--
 
as I said had four 
approved
 
the U.S, Mexico, Russia and Taiwan, those that are left are the EU, 
China, Japan, South Korea and Philippine. We are proceeding in each case 
by engaging with the regulatory bodies and each to a restriction we are, we 
think on track in terms of following t
heir processes and as we've indicated, 
Steve indicated earlier, we expect that the timeline as we've outlined it will 
continue and we're shooting for the end of 17. And I don't think there is 
really, there is really much to say about those other regulatory
 
bodies other 
than that, as I said we're cooperating with them and haven't seen any issues 
at the moment.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
James, this is Steve. I would say the discussions with the customers have 
been good, I mean obviously we have limitations, since that
 
agreed to which 
we can have discussion given that we are pretty close. I've been pretty 
pleased with what we are hearing with respect to kind of the industrial logic 
behind the deal. So some of the 
--
 
the, I think the bringing together of the 
Qualcomm IP 
roadmap and technology roadmap to the channel of and the 
broader portfolio of products at auto has been, I think positively received by 
the customers as far as my discussions. And I think also the, importance of 
increasing the scale and the channel in the 
IoT spaces is definitely being 
validated in terms of our view of the market. And, I think also if you look at 
the last two quarters of the product business here for us, it really seems to 
be headed in the same direction, or headed in a way that is consiste
nt with 
the industrial logic behind the acquisition, which is that, has things get 
connected, you're going to start to see more overlap in terms of the required 
technologies across these business. I think that's actually good for the end 
markets and we've 
been hearing comments consistent with that from the 
customer.
 
So, we're planning for, actually planning for the integration and working 
through the regulatory issues and moving quickly before the closing at the 
end of the year, before the end of the 
year.

Our next question is from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.
 
Tim Long
 
If we could maybe switch over to the chip business, George you mentioned 
in the guidance for MSMs next quarter some product launches and China 
strength, it's a
 
little bit of more stronger than normal seasonal. So, could 
you talk a little bit about were, was inventory a little low heading in, China 
has been a pretty touch end market so far this year, so do you think there is 
going to be a turnaround in the busine
ss there, is there is market share, is it 
more exports. So maybe talk a little bit about that strength and maybe 
sustainability and then related to that, I would assume that we might be up 
for a little bit weaker of ASP calculated in that division in the S
eptember 
quarter? Thank you.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Hi Tim, this is Cristiano. Look I think, it's probably important to understand 
the trends in China market. China has been a growth, strong story for us 
and I think we see that continuing. So, first your point abo
ut what we 
thought about the product mix, I think we see the market moving up and we 
see that consistently, we saw that, the ASP market matures, they pierced on 
the devices we see higher low freights in the higher tiers than in the lower 
tiers. And I think
 
Snapdragon 600 and the Snapdragon 800 are doing very 
well; in particularly the Snapdragon 600 has been a very good story for us. 
When you ask about the going forward, I would maybe remind you we 
--
 
we've said in the past about things like Al Mode in carag
gregation now 70% 
of every single device in China is Al Mode 4G plus is now well understood by 
consumer as a caraggregation. And we speak things, moving towards higher 
speeds both on our integrated WiFi as well as cellular leading to gigabit LTE. 
And I thi
nk 5G is likely going to be one of the largest market that China 
would not want to be behind all the other economies. So, I think the story in 
China is very good. In your last point about growth, we saw the top ten 
Chinese OEMs, which I think that we are v
ery well
-
positioned going 
aggressively outside China. And I think that is enabling our China business 
to grow faster than the market. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. 
Please go ahead with your quest
ion.
 
Ross Seymore
 
I have two questions. The first one on the OpEx side of the equation, 
George, obviously the litigation coming in [to the extent] [ph] so why the 
spending will be a bit higher in the quarter and the guide? But, the other 
side of the equati
on the 5G acceleration, can you talk a little bit about the 
sustainability of that, is it kind of last for a couple of quarters and then fall
-
off generally the strategy behind that.
 
And then, the second question I had was on the NXT deal, the regulatory 
en
vironment a lot of people have asked about that roadmap. But, I'm 
receiving a lot of questions with people debating that the price that you paid 
given the move in the semiconductor market may appear to be low. So, I 
was wondering if we could just get your 
thoughts on the price that you guys 
have agreed upon with NXT.
 
George Davis
 
Ross, let me start with the OpEx question. Clearly, as you said we are 
escalating the activity with respect to litigation and so that you will continue 
to see growth in the spend t
here. But, on the 5G side and I may have 
Cristiano add some thoughts on this as well. We are seeing polling of activity 
by customers. And the number of trials increasing and we feel is very 
important to be seen and continue to be seen as leading those acti
vities of 
course and on top of that that just means that the roadmap for 5G is getting 
pulled in more rapidly.
 
So, it's not clear to me that this is a one or two quarter type event, I think 
we are going to see some elevated spending here over the next year
 
to two 
as we get through these 5G trials and the beginning of commercial 5G 
launches. I will stop there for a minute and Cristiano if you want to add 
something.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
No. I'm just going to say that I think more and more we see 19 as a reality 
for
 
5G commercialization.
 
George Davis
 
Great. Thanks. And then, on the NXT deal, I will just reemphasize, our focus 
is really on the regulatory matters and getting those closed out along with 
the integration planning and we are confident we are going to go ah
ead and 
close this on the terms that we've agreed to by year
-
end.

Our next question is from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Tal Liani
 
Hi. Few questions, f
irst, puts and takes if you can discuss puts and takes of 
gross margin of QTL next quarter? And is there anything outside of lower 
revenue of level in the litigation expense? That's number one.
 
And then, the second question is, now you lost big QCT busines
s with your 
largest customer Apple. You lost 
--
 
there are some disputes with one of your 
largest customers on licensing. And the question is, does it will make more 
sense now to break up the company into two pieces or you are in the same 
position as before
. I want to understand if you think there is any correlation 
between your ability to maximize the value of each segment separately in 
light of these disputes and these arguments with customers? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
Tal, its George. What you are seeing in t
he gross margin effect or really the 
margin effect that we guided for QTL is really revenue and revenue coming 
down based on these disputes that we have discussed actually the market is 
quite healthy, so all the other dynamics are very attractive. And then
, the 
fact that we are ramping spending into that lower revenue for litigation 
matters. So, its combination of the two just pulled the margin down. It's not 
like a product business where you have a variable cost as revenue comes 
down where your cost come d
own. So, this one where until we get through 
this period of higher litigation spending and the dispute period, you will see 
lower than historic but the fundamentals behind the business outside of 
these disputes are quite attractive.
 
George Davis
 
It's also Steve with respect to the business structure, I think we have looked 
at it pretty heavily in the past and it's still an area that we look at as the 
environment changes and make sure that we are 
--
 
we are making sure that 
we are putting the busine
ss in the right place to maximize value. But, at this 
point I think we feel like we have the right structure to resolve this dispute 
as well as the position the business for the future in terms of the transition 
into 5G as well as the growth into driving t
he cellular roadmap into new 
technology areas or new end opportunities.
 
So, again, we look at this from time to time, continue to look at it the way to 
maximize value but I think we feel like we have the right business structure 
to resolve it.

Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please go 
ahead with your question.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Here are my questions. First, regarding this other licensee dispute, is it safe 
to say that this other dispute is 
not with the Chinese OEM given that you 
have already settled with the large Chinese OEMs, or is that not a leap of 
logic that it would be appropriate for me to make?
 
Secondly, given the escalation here and given everything else has been 
going on, how do we
 
gain conviction that we don't see further contagion, 
further spreading of this to other customers given this as soon as we 
bleeding out across the rest of your business?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Stacy, this is Derek. As I said in response to an earlier question, we a
re not 
going to at this point disclose the identity of the licensee that we have the 
dispute with. So, not going to comment on that one further.
 
I think on the question of contagion, if you think about we are working very 
hard across a number of fronts to 
really stabilize the regulatory environment 
and that remains a priority for us. Historically, we've had disputes with 
licensees large and small going back all the way to even with Nokia where 
they had 40% to 50% of the market and we are not being as for a 
period of 
time and that did not translate into our other licensees stopping payment. 
That's just one data point. But, as we sit here we are focused on resolving 
the issues we have, the current dispute with the licensee beyond. Apple is 
focused on their agr
eement, the contract dispute under their agreement. We 
are going to focus on getting those things resolved and I don't think as we 
sit here, we have any indication that that this somehow going to result in the 
bunch of other licensees deciding not to repor
t and pay royalty.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
But, you never have any indication do you?
 
Derek Aberle
 
If we didn't ever know 
--
 
which you ever know, but I'm saying historically 
--
 
if you look at it historically we haven't had that problem as we had disputes, 
we have bee
n able to work through and resolve them without other licensees 
necessarily just deciding that they are not going to comply with their 
agreements. So, I think that's the best we can tell you at this point.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
But that's exactly what's happening r
ight now, isn't it?
 
Derek Aberle
 
No. That's not what's happening. We have a dispute with Apple and their 
contract manufacturers and we have dispute with one other licensee.

Vijay Rakesh
 
Thanks guys. Just going back on that other licensee, am I need to 
understand that it went from a partial non

payment to a full non

payment 
for the next quarter, is that what you are assuming in the guide?
 
And on the A
pple side, with the new litigation that you announced which is 
non
-
spend IT, can you give us some timelines from that, how does that 
stand? Thanks.
 
George Davis
 
This is George. I will take the first question. Our guide in Q3 assumed a 
partial payment which
 
we did not receive and we assume no payment or 
report in Q4 guidance.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
And this is Don. On the 
--
 
I think you are referring to the two in the U.S. 
that we brought, and one recently in Germany. As we've said before the ITC 
case in the U.S. 
generally takes about 18 months, so we are hoping it will 
stay along that timeline. The cases in Germany could go as quickly as one 
year. But, obviously every case is somewhat different, but that's a good 
estimate, I would say.

since you announced your intension to buy the company. There has been 
uncertainty more recently on just whether or not you will get the 80% 
approval.

how is 
the process wo

Our next question is from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. 
Please go ahead with your question.
 
Tavis McCourt
 
I think my que
stion have a couple. First one into to make sure that the 
closing of the TDK joint venture, did the June quarter have a full quarter of 
revenues and cost from that, or is that just partial? And then, Derek, I think 
you mentioned in the answer to a previous
 
question if there were some 
catch
-
up payments in the Q3 QTL revenues, can you dimensionalize that or 
give us an indication that if you back those out, it would be pretty similar to 
their Q4 guide.
 
And then, a question I guess for Steve, I think there was 
a lawsuit threat by 
Intel during the quarter related to Windows 10 and X80 simulation and I'm 
just wondering as it moved beyond a threat and does it change your opinion 
on that in market opportunity for you? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
On the 
--
 
for the third
 
quarter we had a full quarter of the TDK joint venture. 

-
up payments they were, for Q3 I 
don't think we gave a specific number. They were meaningful and I think the 
way to think about the guide on Q4 is that the 
midpoint for the QTL revenue 
guidance, it doesn't have significant amount of catch
-
ups. So if you kind of 
look at it, quarter
-
over
-
quarter Q3 to Q4 relatively flat based on our guide. 
But, you are coming off a Q3 that had some meaningful catch up in it.
 
Ge
orge Davis
 
And with respect to the lawsuit and I think it was actually just a press report 
that I had heard and I think if anything, if I remember correctly wasn't 
directly toward us, it is probably directed toward the customers and the 
ecosystem involved 
in the PC space. We haven't heard anything about that 
since then. I will say that we are actively engaged with customers who are 
interested in that opportunity and that opportunity is coming here per the 
schedule that we gave in the past. So, it's a

I t
hink it is building some 
excitement, and we are pretty excited about what we are seeing there.

Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes. Thank you. First of all, I just want to thank all the employees for their 
hard work and maybe I will finish up with four final thoughts. The first one 
is, given the environment that we are in just want to recognize and thank 
everybody for the strong r
esults on the product side. It's really an indication 
of the strategy playing forward and we are pleased to see the results here in 
the business.
 
Second one is the timing of NXT, it's on track. And I think building 
momentum and looking forward to that happ
ening. We mentioned that on 
the third point that we are 
--
 
we believe we have the high ground on Apple 
in terms of our legal dispute we obviously ask for some patience in terms of 
us getting through that. So, we do feel good about our positioning there and
 
hope you will be able to report people or we able to provide status as we 
report it.
 
And finally, I just want to acknowledge the team for putting together a great 
roadmap and consistently showing up not only in the results, but also in 
some of the 5G exci
tement.
 
And with that, I will just close and look forward to talking with you all next 
quarter. Thank you.

Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report 
strong results this 
quarter. Fiscal second quarter non
-
GAAP earnings per 
share were $0.14 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, reflecting 
a continued focus on operational performance across the businesses.
 
Our semiconductor business continues to benefit from both a
 
strong product 

trends that bode well for our ability to further grow the semiconductor 
business outside of handsets. Automotive, networking and IoT were 
particularly strong this q
uarter.
 
Several of these product lines became part of QUALCOMM largely through 
M&A and will be further strengthened with the upcoming addition of NXP. 
Our QCT business continues to deliver a broad set of industry leading 
products, positioning us well for t
he opportunities ahead. We delivered 
strong topline results this quarter and operating margins were ahead of 
expectations.
 
Our partners are already announcing new premium tier devices based on our 
new Snapdragon 835 mobile platform including the Samsung Ga
laxy S8 and 
S8+, Sony Xperia XZ premium and the Xiaomi Mi 6. Additionally, the 835 is 
extending to new categories beyond smartphones such as the ODR or ODG 
AR smart glasses announced at CES. Our high and mid
-
tier Snapdragon 600 
and 400 platform offerings c
ontinued to see high adoption, particularly in 
China with 200 plus devices and design in the 600
-
tier and 190 plus devices 
and design in the 400
-
tier worldwide.
 
In March, we announced our 205 mobile platforms designed to bring 4G LTE 
connectivity and 4G se
rvices for entry level feature phones and we expect 
OEM devices to be announced starting this quarter. The increasing number 
of gigabit LTE operator launches around the world this year validates our 
early investment and enabling gigabit speeds across 4G ne
tworks and our 
modem roadmap continues to be more than a generation ahead of the 
competition.
 
Telstra launched the world's first gigabit LTE network and device earlier this 
year and all four major U.S. carriers have announced plans to launch gigabit 
LTE in
 
2017. Our Snapdragon X16 gigabit LTE modem was featured in 
February in a live demo of the Sony Xperia XZ premium and more recently 
versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8 including in North America, China and 
Japan also featured gigabit LTE based on the Snapdra
gon 835. We continue 
to lead the industry to 5G through our 3GPP leadership, ongoing prototype 
efforts, announcements of meaningful 5G new radio trials as well as our 
industry first X50 5G modem.
 
In February, we demonstrated the first 3GPP based 5G new rad
io connection 
and announced the extension of our Snapdragon X50 family of 5G modems 
to include support for the global 5G NR standard across the millimeter wave 
and sub
-
6 gigahertz frequency bands, along with backwards compatibility for 
2G, 3G, 4G, includin
g gigabit LTE. We expect commercial products to be 
available to support the first large scale 5G NR trials and commercial 
network launches starting in 2019.
 
Turning to QTL, the licensing business had a strong quarter. Total reported 
device sales were a rec
ord driven by strong 3G/4G unit shipments and 
higher than expected ASPs. QTL results were in line with expectations as the 
stronger market and improved licensing in China offset the impact of a new 
dispute with a licensee.
 
During the quarter, we returned a
pproximately $1.1 billion to stockholders 
through dividends and stock repurchases. We also announced a 7.5% 
increase in our quarterly cash dividend now at $2.28 per share annually 
reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and 
futu
re earnings growth.
 
During the quarter, we closed on our joint venture with TDK, which is an 
important strategic milestone to grow our portfolio of RF front
-
end products 
and technologies. I am very pleased that we now have all the critical 
components to bu
ild industry
-
leading RF modules across tiers and to 
compete in the total RF front
-
end service available market. We also received 
U.S. regulatory clearance for our pending acquisition of NXP. We remain on 
track to close the transaction this calendar year an
d integration planning 
continues across both companies.
 
Looking ahead, the adoption of mobile technologies and mobile computing is 
accelerating around the world. Our broad and growing set of technologies 
and innovations are fundamental to mobile communicat
ions and are enabling 
entirely new business models and ecosystems. This trend will continue for 
years to come as advanced 4G, 5G and other mobile technologies expand 
their footprint into new industries.
 
Looking across the growing set of new industries embr
acing mobile 
technologies, we have more opportunities ahead of us than it any time in the 
Company's history. Against this backdrop, we have had a series of legal and 
regulatory challenges that have unfortunately overshadowed otherwise 
strong operating perf
ormance at QUALCOMM.
 
We have successfully navigated challenges like this in the past and we have 
confidence in the sustainability of our licensing business. But we know these 
periods can generate added volatility in near
-
term results and require open 
and r
egular dialogue with our investors, which is something we are fully 
committed to providing. While we work to conclude the right deals that will 
deliver long
-
term value to our shareholders.
 
Most importantly, we will remain focused on investing to lead innov
ation in 
key mobile and related technologies as that has always been the core of 
what's placed us in this unique and unmatched leadership position. While 
Derek will provide more details on the recent legal challenges, we have 
taken several specific steps t
o address the KFTC and FTC matters during the 
last quarter.
 
And last week, we filed our answer and counterclaims in the Apple litigation 
here in Southern California. It is important to remember that ultimately this 
is about a contract dispute and business 
negotiation and we will work to 
reach the right resolution for our shareholders as we have done so often 
throughout our history.
 
Further, the Company will continue to focus on developing and delivering the 
best products to our customers including Apple con
sistent with our track 
record to
-
date. We are optimistic about the speed of innovation in the 
modem and RF areas with technologies such as gigabit LTE, 5G NR, 
multimode and millimeter wave becoming increasingly important. 
Considering the strength of both o
ur product roadmap in R&D investments, 
we expect to continue to be an important supplier to Apple now and into the 
future.
 
As we continue towards the closing of our pending acquisition of NXP later 
this year, I thought it would be good to review some of th
e larger growth 
opportunities that will be enabled by our unique collection of technologies, 
sales channels and scale for the interconnected world.
 
First, we will lead in 5G. 5G is the interconnecting fabric for the connected 
world and will drive not only 
an upgrade cycle in mobile, but will also enable 
new industries to take advantage of the mobile ecosystem. We will continue 
to work closely with global infrastructure vendors and operators on 5G NR 
trials to drive the mobile ecosystem toward validation and
 
timely 
commercialization of 5G NR.
 
To
-
date, we have announced 5G NR trials with SKT and Ericsson in Korea, 
AT&T and Ericsson in the United States, ZTE and China Mobile in China, 
Telstra and Ericsson in Australia, and Vodafone and Ericsson in Europe. The 
i
nteroperability testing and trials are planned to launch in the second half of 
2017.
 
Second, we will grow our content in the device with our expanding RF front
-
end capabilities. We have taken a big step forward in closing the RF360 JV to 
transform this bus
iness and we also have already started delivering our first 
gallium arsenide PAs. As we move to 5G, the device will become more 
complex from an RF point of view as massive MIMO and multi
-
element 
arrays exist on many devices and our unique ability to provid
e solutions 
across the baseband and RF will become even more important to our 
customers.
 
Third, automotive will continue to be a source of growth and we are winning 
more than just the telematics systems. Our automotive solutions, including 
cellular, Wi
-
Fi,
 
Bluetooth and infotainment SoCs have been adopted by every 
major global automaker. Our Snapdragon, automotive infotainment 
platforms have won new designs at 12 of the top 25 global automaker 
brands. This strong design pipeline shows the strength of our co
mputing 
solutions in the automotive market and represents an opportunity to sell 
multiple Snapdragons per car.
 
With the addition of NXP, the opportunity to grow content in the car 
increases dramatically and we will be uniquely positioned for ADAS and 
auton
omous driving, a large multi
-
decade mega trend that is just starting. 
You will be hearing more from us on this important topic in the future.
 
Fourth, IoT will drive meaningful growth across a broad range of 
opportunities. Success in these opportunities wil
l be defined by the ability to 
combined connectivity, computing and security along with a broad channel 
to serve not only industrial verticals, but a long tail of customers to deliver 
high complexity products and platforms that are easy for our customers t
o 
use and integrate. Here again the acquisition of NXP will uniquely position us 
with IoT systems solutions and channels and builds on the success we are 
seeing in the business today.
 
Fifth, we have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the P
C and 
the datacenter. Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into Mobile PC designs 
running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar 
quarter this year. In the data center, we announced the collaboration with 
Microsoft and demonstrated Wind
ows Server Running on our 10 nanometer 
Qualcomm Centriq processors, the first 10 nanometer server processors in 
the industry.
 
To close, we are very focused on resolving the challenges to our licensing 
business and business model and we are 
confident we will be able to 
successfully navigate through this environment. At the same time, this is an 
extremely exciting and transformative time for our Company as the 
technologies and products are well positioned to expand into a growing set 
of opport
unities and will be further enhanced with the completion of our 
pending acquisition of NXP.
 
I would now like to turn the call over to Derek.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a 
strong fiscal second quarter 
with record total reported device sales of 
approximately $82.6 billion, up approximately 18% year
-
over
-
year and just 
above the high
-
end of our prior guidance range. The record TRDS for the 
quarter reflects significantly increased year
-
over
-
year unit report
ing from 
recent China licensing progress as well as ASP strength particularly in China 
and typical seasonal strength in North America.
 
We estimate that reported 3G/4G device shipments were approximately 400 
million units within ASP of approximately $207 at
 
the midpoints. Global 
3G/4G handset ASPs are tracking consistent with our prior expectations of 
low single
-
digit percentage declines year
-
over
-
year. We also continue to see 
healthy growth in global 3G/4G device shipments. For calendar year 2016, 
we have i
ncreased our estimate of global 3G/4G device shipments to reflect 
even stronger December quarter shipments than we previously expected led 
by stronger sales in China.
 
We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion 3G/4G devices were shipped in 
2016, up approxi
mately 10% year
-
over
-
year. For calendar 2017, we are 
reaffirming our estimated global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.75 billion to 
1.85 billion devices, up approximately 6% year
-
over
-
year at the midpoint.
 
We believe that some of the December quarter shipments
 
strength in China 
resulted in a modest build
-
up of inventory there, which we expect will be 
sold through in the first half of calendar 2017. We estimate that this will 
push some of the expected first half calendar 2017 shipments into the 
second half of th

fiscal 2017.
 
The fiscal second quarter revenue and operating profit results for QTL, which 
were largely in line with our prior guidance were negatively impacted by a 
dispute with one of our license
es. This dispute resulted in the licensee 
underpaying royalties of more than $150 million for sales during the 
December quarter. We are working to resolve this dispute, but we expect 
the licensee, which is not one of the suppliers of iPhones to Apple to 
co
ntinue to under report its royalties until the dispute is resolved and 
therefore have factored that into our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 
2017.
 
Last week, we announced that an arbitration panel awarded BlackBerry and 
$850 million refund of roya
lties that have previously paid to QUALCOMM for 
past sales. The dispute related to whether our voluntary per unit running 

-
refundable prepayments of 
royalties for a license to sell a specified number of handse
ts from 2010 
through the end of 2015.
 
We strongly disagree with the ruling, but it is binding and not appealable. It 
is worth noting that this was a specific contract provision that was unique to 

eements with 
any other licensee. The contract provision also does not apply to BlackBerry 
sales after 2015.
 
It is also important to note that even after this refund, BlackBerry paid 
royalties for all devices it sold during the 2010 to 2015 time period equa
l to 
the per unit amount specified in our voluntary per unit running royalty 
program. We continue to actively pursue resolutions and protect the 
established value of our patented technologies in the regulatory and other 
legal matters in which we are involv
ed. We have plans for addressing each 
of these proceedings and are confident that the QTL business will remain a 
strong cash flow contributor to the Company for many years to come.
 
Regarding the KFTC, we have begun the formal legal process for both an 
appe
al and a stay of the decision pending the outcome of the appeal, as the 
ruling is clearly inconsistent with the facts and the law reflects a flawed 
process and represents a violation of due process rights owed American 
companies under the Korea, U.S. pre
-
t
rade agreement. We expect to have a 
decision on our application for a stay in the coming months.
 

compliant consistent with our ongoing view that the complaint which was 
filed jus
t days before the change in administration in over a strong objection 
by the commissioner who is now the acting chair of the FTC fails to state a 
plausible antitrust claim and offers no facts or economic theory supporting 
the claim of competitive harm.
 
As 
to the Taiwan investigation, we are continuing to cooperate with the TFTC 
as we work towards finding the resolution of this matter. While certain 
investigations in Europe remain pending. These investigations do not involve 
QUALCOMM's licensing business or 
practices.
 
Finally, as Steve mentioned, we have now formally responded to the 

includes numerous misstatements and mischaracterizations of our 
agreements, negotiations and contributions
 
to the industry. I urge you to 
read our answer which clearly describes in detail the facts and corrects these 
misstatements and mischaracterizations as well as details of the value of the 
fundamental technologies we have invented, contributed and shared w
ith 
the industry through our licensing program.
 
We have a strong track record of establishing and defending the value of our 
technologies that have played an important role in enabling the entire 
mobile ecosystem, including the incredible smartphone experi
ence. We have 
freely negotiated and entered into more than 300 license agreements over 
many years, including with the largest and most sophisticated companies in 
our industry.
 
The offers we have made to Apple for a direct license to QUALCOMM cellular 
stand
ard essential patents are consistent with the value of our patent 

agreements and are fully compliant with QUALCOMM's FRAND commitments. 
It is unfortunate that Apple has rejected these fai
r and reasonable offers.
 
Also our license agreements with Apple suppliers remain valid long
-
term 
agreements many of which were negotiated and entered into before Apple 
sold the first iPhone. Despite Apple's claims against QUALCOMM, Apple 
suppliers remain c
ontractually obligated to pay royalties to QUALCOMM 
under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to 
Apple.
 
In our fiscal second quarter, Apple interfered with the license agreements 
between QUALCOMM and the Apple suppliers by acti
vely inducing them to 
underpay the royalties they owed to QUALCOMM for sales during the 
December quarter. Apple withheld payment to their suppliers for sales in the 
December quarter in an amount equal to what Apple claims QUALCOMM 
owes to Apple under a sep
arate cooperation agreement between the 
companies.
 
This was consistent with what Apple said it would do in the complaint it filed 
in San Diego prior to our last earnings call. Apple suppliers then underpaid 
royalties to QUALCOMM in the same amount. In the 
aggregate, this amount 
is approximately $1 billion. Most of Apple suppliers have already reported 
the royalties they owe to QUALCOMM for sales to Apple during the March 
quarter and they are obligated to pay the full amount of those royalties to 
us.
 
While w
ould expect Apple suppliers to pay the royalties they owe us under 
their license agreements, it is possible that Apple will continue to interfere 
with the Apple suppliers license agreements leading those suppliers to 
breach their contract with QUALCOMM by 
underpaying some or all of what 
they owe us.
 
We expect to have more visibility into this in the coming weeks. Given this 
uncertainty, our fiscal third quarter guidance assumes a range of possible 
payments from Apple, from the Apple suppliers, but does not 
reflect a 
scenario that Apple suppliers pay nothing to us for March quarter sales.
 
Turning to our data center business, as Steve mentioned, we recently 
announced the collaboration with Microsoft to accelerate next
-
generation 
cloud services on our 10 nanome
ter Centriq 2400 platform, which will span 
multiple future generations of hardware, software and systems.
 
We also showcased our first public demonstration of Windows Server on ARM 
running on our processors and contributed a Qualcomm Centriq Open 
Compute Mo
therboard to the OCP community. We remain on track for 
commercial shipments of our server processors by the end of the calendar 
year and we continue to receive good feedback from our customers.
 
That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over 
to George.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter 
was another solid quarter with non
-
GAAP revenues of $6 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $1.34, up 13% sequentially. We exceeded the 
midpoint of our 
non
-
GAAP earnings per share by $0.14.
 
Better than expected performance at QCT accounted for approximately 
$0.05 of the upside on solid MSM demand and strong performance across 
auto, networking and IoT. The balance of the performance came from better 
than e
xpected investment portfolio gains and a lower estimated annual tax 
rate. QTL was in line with expectations for the quarter despite the impact of 
a licensee dispute join the positive effect of licensing progress in China, 
strong 3G, 4G demand and a focus o
n costs.
 
In QCT, MSM chip shipments were 179 million, modestly above the midpoint 
of our prior guidance. QCT revenues were $3.7 billion and implied revenue 
per MSM was up sequentially on stronger product mix consistent with our 
expectations. QCT 
operating margin was 13% above the high
-
end of our 
prior expectations, reflecting higher gross margins in mobile and better than 
expected operating results in auto, networking and IoT.
 
As Steve mentioned, we were pleased to close the RF360 joint venture in
 
February. We are consolidating the results of the JV on a one
-
month lag 
basis and it added approximately 75 million in revenue in the quarter on 
one
-
month of activity. QTL fiscal second quarter revenues were $2.2 billion 
in line with expectations. Total r
eported device sales were a record and 
exceeded our prior guidance range on strong ASPs offset by an estimated 
underpayment of more than 150 million related to a dispute with a licensee.
 
As Derek explained, Apple suppliers reported royalties in the fiscal 
second 
quarter for sales activity in the December quarter withheld approximately $1 
billion from their payments. This amount is equal to the amount that Apple 
claims QUALCOMM owes it under a separate cooperation agreement between 
QUALCOMM and Apple.
 
It is 
worth noting that fiscal second quarter royalties revenues were not 
impacted by the underpayment because the suppliers reported the full 
royalties for the term of their agreement and acknowledge they were due, 
but underpaid by the same amount that QUALCOMM
 
is withholding from 
Apple under the cooperation agreement. This is consistent with the guidance 
we provided last quarter.
 
GAAP results for our fiscal second quarter reflect a $974 million reduction of 
revenues associated with the BlackBerry arbitration aw
ard including 
estimated interest in attorney's fees. This reduced fiscal second quarter 
GAAP EPS by approximately $0.48 per share.
 
Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses increased approximately 7% 
sequentially including the RF360 JV, which was not in our 
original guidance. 
Absence of JV, we would have been at the low end of our prior 6% to 8% 
guidance range. Our non
-
GAAP tax rate during the fiscal second quarter was 
15%. We now estimate that our fiscal 2027 non
-
GAAP tax rate will be 
approximately 17% down 
from our prior estimate of 18% on changes in 
business mix.
 
We returned approximately $1.1 billion to stockholders in the quarter 
including $782 million of dividends paid and $283 million in stock 
repurchases. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable s
ecurities of 
$29 billion. The balance sheet this quarter merits some additional 
commentary to explain the impacts of the licensing related matters as well 
as the close of RF360 joint venture.
 
First, there were notable adjustments associated with our joint 
venture with 
TDK. As a reminder, we are fully consolidating the results of this joint 
venture as we have the ability to control the business. As a result, our 
balance sheet reflects the addition of approximately $3.1 billion of the JVs 
net assets including
 
$1.7 billion of intangible assets in goodwill, $800 million 
in property, plant and equipment, $260 million in inventory, and $250 
million in accounts receivable.
 
Our accounts receivable balance at quarter end also reflects the 
approximately $1 billion due
 
from Apple suppliers and we continue to carry 
approximately $1 billion in other current liabilities for the unpaid disputed 
amounts with respect to the cooperation agreement with Apple, which 
expired at the end of calendar 2016.
 
Note that these unpaid dis
puted amounts have been accrued as a reduction 
to revenues in our P&L over the past few quarters. Also including other 
current liabilities is $974 million related to the recent BlackBerry award, 
which we expect to pay in the next few months and $921 millio
n related to 
the KFTC fine, which was paid shortly after the end of the fiscal second 
quarter.
 
I will now turn to our fiscal third quarter. Our guidance range for earnings 
per share is wider than our typical practice primarily due to the uncertainty 
around
 
whether Apple suppliers will withhold some portion of the royalty 
payments they are obligated to pay another contracts with us. We have 
considered a variety of scenarios within the range.
 
Our guidance range does not include the case where no payments are 
made 
by Apple suppliers. We will update our guidance if we subsequently learn of 
any action that would take us materially outside of the announced guidance 
range. We have also assumed in our guidance that the licensee dispute that 
Derek mentioned, which ar
ose in the fiscal second quarter remains 
unresolved in the third quarter and will result in an underpayment relative to 
what the licensee owes for the third quarter.
 
As a reminder, we are coming off the seasonally strong fiscal second quarter 
for QTL and o
ur fiscal third quarter typically reflects our low quarter of the 
year for both revenues and EPS on a normalized basis. We estimate 
revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. The 
year
-
over
-
year comparisons for both revenue a
nd EPS are impacted by more 
than $400 million in catch up licensing revenues recorded in the third 
quarter of fiscal 2016.
 
We estimate non
-
GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be in 
the range of approximately $0.90 to $1.15 per share. We 
expect fiscal third 
quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up 
approximately 2% to 4% sequentially primarily due to a full quarter impact 
of the RF360 JV operating expenses and growing spend on litigation matters.
 
In QTL we estimate total r
eported device sales between $59 billion and $67 
billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments 
they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to the 
seasonally high holiday quarter shipments reflected in fiscal Q2.
 
This 
includes estimated 3G/4G device sales from Apple's contract manufacturers 
as well as from the licensee currently in dispute in underpaying.
 
In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 180 million to 200 
million units during the June quarter,
 
higher sequentially at the midpoint 
despite the excess inventory at certain OEMs in China exiting Q2. We expect 
inventory levels at those OEMs to largely correct within our fiscal third 
quarter.
 
For the Snapdragon 835 premium tier chipset, we are seeing s
trong demand 
exceeding supply. Our growth in operating margin relative to demand in the 
quarter is being limited by our ability to ramp volumes at 10 nanometer. We 
expect this to begin to normalize in the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect 
QCT's fiscal third
 
quarter operating margin to be approximately 13% plus or 
minus 100 basis points reflecting year
-
over
-
year improvement as we 
continue to gain traction in adjacent opportunities particularly auto, IoT and 
networking.
 
Our current expectation is that we will 
be in the capital markets in the 
second half of fiscal 2017 to fund the remaining portion of our acquisition 
related needs. We continue to sell longer dated and higher volatility assets in 
our treasury investment portfolio in anticipation of funding the cl
ose of our 
pending NXP acquisition later in the calendar year.
 
Based on the current market environment, we expect the total of net 
investment income and interest expense for fiscal 2017 to be flat to down 
modestly on a non
-
GAAP basis versus fiscal 2016. Th
e outlook has improved 
somewhat on the higher yields on short
-
term assets.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.
 
John Sinnott
 
Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank y
ou. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of 
Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
 
Rod Hall
 
Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hope you can hear me okay. I 
just wanted to clarify George what you guys are saying abou
t the 
withholding, and Derek as well. So our understanding is the rebates, the 
alleged rebates were withheld for a couple of quarters, and so it sounds like 
what you're saying is the amount of royalty withheld is catching up for two 
quarter of rebate withh
oldings. So I just want to clarify that is in fact the 
case.
 
And then I also wanted to see if you guys could give us any further color on 
the guidance range and are you assuming that the royalty withholdings at 
the midpoint would be equivalent to these reb
ates that are allegedly not 
being paid, and then how does the top and bottom end of that EPS range 
figure into what you're assuming on royalties? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hey, Rod. This is Derek. So if you think about Q2 which we had talked about 
last 
quarter in our reporting obviously for this quarter. Basically what 
happened is, we have a dispute with Apple as to whether we owe them 
about $1 billion under a cooperation agreement we have. That spans over 
several quarters of possible payments.
 
What they
 
said in their complaint and what they ended up doing as it relates 
to the second quarter which are sales through the end of December of 2016 
is they effectively withheld payment to their contract manufacturers who 
then in turn withheld payment to us for r
oyalties that were owed under the 
contract manufacturers agreements with us in the amount of this disputed 
cooperation payment, which is about $1 billion.
 
And so that is all reflected in Q2, and as George mentioned because the 
amounts were reported to us a
nd acknowledged as due, and then we have 
the cash that we haven't paid to Apple, effectively we took the revenue in 
Q2 for the amount of the four royalties that were paid net the reserve we 
had for the payments that are being disputed going back towards Ap
ple. So 
that's the situation on Q2.
 
On Q3, the guidance as we mentioned includes sort of a variety of possible 
assumptions on what may play out in terms of what gets paid to us by the 
contract manufacturers for Q3. I would say the high end of the guidance 
would be reflective of us getting paid in full, but we've got some other 
scenarios that are reflected in the range.
 
The agreement itself with Apple which is where we have the dispute of what 
is owed to them expired at the end of 2016, so has really no rele
vance or 
impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the 

on this is what is not contemplated in the guidance range is for the contract 
manufacturers to pa
y us nothing or very low amount. If that were to happen 
then we would update you all.
 
George Davis
 
Rod let me add one thing as well, when you look at Q2 you can look to the 
balance sheet and see the accounts receivable has had a fairly significant 
pop, not
 
only because we've brought in RF360, but the receivable is up by 
the 
-
 

disputing the fact that they have reported and are obligated to pay under 
the contract for this amount. So it has shown 
as a receivable. We are still 
holding the $1 billion related to the dispute from the prior quarters under 
current liabilities on our balance sheet.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit 
Suisse. Please go ahead.
 
Kul
binder Garcha
 

-
 
on the 
-
 
just a 
clarification on your own building was withheld by the contract 
manufacturers, but something was paid to you, something else was paid to 
you above that level I assume and it

going forward, am I thinking if I wrong?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 

 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
And then the other question was really more strategic about how the Ap
ple 
and QUALCOMM thing plays out. The Foxconn agreement you have is that 
due to expire anytime soon? I assume it's not you haven't told us about 
device when it clarify that and it's very rare from what I can remember 
where you have an agreement with a part
y and it just stopped paying you. 
You had a deals expired in the past and you've had disputes perhaps and 
you have people that want to report on you all day, but is has ever been a 
scenario where you've had an agreement that last or some period of time 
and
 
vendor in question just stops paying?
 
George Davis
 
So Kulbin, I'll take the first part of the question, which is what they paid to 
us, was simply the difference between the full amount owed under the 
contract minus the disputed amount. So there was some i
ncremental 
payment that came in, but it was net of that $1 billion that that we 
described in the prepared remarks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yes, just to add to that 
-
 
this is Derek. The cooperation agreement between 
QUALCOMM and Apple as I said expired at the end of 2
016. So unlike Q2 
there really is no basis on which to even argue that there should be a 
payment of something less than the full amount that the contract 
manufacturers owed to us.
 
In terms of the Foxconn agreement, it's a long
-
term agreement. It is not set
 
to expire any time soon. Those are again long
-
term agreements that are 
valid in binding and include the contractual obligation to pay the only thing 
that expired or the direct agreements between QUALCOMM and Apple and 
those went away at the end of 2016.
 
A
nd to your last point, yes it's been very rare, actually as I sit here can't 
think of a situation where somebody just simply stop paying us entirely 
under their agreement where we didn't have a dispute with them as to what 
they owed or some other thing goi
ng on, so that would be rare.
 
Donald Rosenberg
 
This is Don. Just to add one or two things. So to be clear, the excuse that 
the contract manufacturers used was that Apple wasn't paying them and 
what Apple was saying was that they are holding back payment to
 
them to 
match the payments that they claim we owed them from the other 
agreement to BCPA, no connection to the license agreement between us and 
our contract manufacturers.
 
So with this totally improper for the contract manufacturers to withhold and 
we now
 
look at what they're going to do going forward and we say well even 
we excuse that they used before that is Apple claiming that they were 
making up for amounts that we didn't pay them doesn't exist anymore. So 
there doesn't seem to be even an arguable rat
ional reason for anybody to 
withhold payments.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord 
Genuity. Please go ahead.
 
Michael Walkley
 
Great, thank you. Just staying on this topic, just trying to understand maybe 
the 
guidance in accounting ramifications, one, you have a licensee that 
you're dispute with and you didn't recognize $150 million in revenue and I 
think when you had a dispute with Nokia going back in time when they 
materially underpaid during that process you
 
have withheld Nokia revenue 
from your guidance.
 
So if say the contract manufacturers pay some smaller dollar amount that 
Apple theoretically said they should pay them, do you still recognize a 
portion of that revenue or do you just take out for altogether
 
like maybe 
you've done with some of the licensee. Just trying to understand the 
accounting ramifications if there is any change from your licensee?
 
And then my more fundamental question just on the outlook for QTL, if you 
can help just walk us on a sequen
tial between seasonality of this the Apple 
range and then you had this licensee disputed maybe if you could help us 
just see the sequential decline kind of those different puts and takes that 
would be helpful? Thank you.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
So in terms of tak
ing revenue in the case of a dispute, typically if there's a 
formal dispute then we would not take revenue until the dispute is resolved 
and I'll let Derek or Don comment on what constitutes the formal dispute, 
but certainly entry into arbitration or lawsu
it is one case in the past.
 
For the customer in the second quarter, the customer reported fully and 
underpaid and as not filed a formal dispute and in that case we take the 
revenue for the amount paid while we're working on collecting the balance 
owed from
 
the customer. And then do you want to add to that at all?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Yes. I think just the difference Mike 
-
 
this is Derek 
-
 
in the two scenarios 
that the situation we have the current dispute where we didn't take revenue 
this quarter about 150 million 
-
 
little more than 150 million. That situation 
where we did not get paid, so typically if there's a dispute and we're not 
getting paid, we wouldn't take the portion that's being withheld, which is 
different than if we are getting paid.
 
On your sequence que
stion, I think really got to remember the Q2 obviously 
is seasonally high quarter for the year, December quarter obviously typically 
the high quarter for QTL, so there would normally be a sequential decline 
going into Q3. I think other factors to consider,
 
I would say we're assuming 
as I mentioned in my remarks that this dispute will not get resolved with the 
licensee we mentioned in Q3. So Q2 to Q3 were both assuming an 
underpayment and then we have a range of possibilities in the assumptions 
for what we'l
l get paid from the contract manufacturers supplying to Apple.
 
If I up level it to the market, the market I think is continues to be quite 
strong. I would say it played out just a little bit differently in terms of what 
came in, in Q2 versus Q3. If you loo
k at the TRDS range, we were above the 
high
-
end slightly of the Q2 TRDS range because of the phenomena of just 
more sales into China with a little inventory build that we expect will get sold 
through in Q3, which is therefore a bit of a drag on Q3 TRDS. So
 
I think 
those are sort of the main drivers to keep in mind.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital 
Markets. Please go ahead.
 
Tim Long
 
Thank you. Just two quick ones if I could here. First, I just want to clarify 
the g
uidance for next quarter. Are you still booking the operating expenses 
or COGS hit that you were taking for the payment that was going back to 
Apple previously under that agreement. So if you can clarify if that's still 
hurting your EPS and reserving again
st it on the balance sheet and when 
would that change?
 
And then secondly, the licensee with the $150 million dispute, Derek could 
you talk a little bit about, I know you can't get into too much of the details, 
but I just want to understand is this somethin
g that maybe is a by
-
product 
of other licensees seeing some of these special Apple agreements that were 
mentioned in their dispute in the BlackBerry arbitration and if not are you 
getting a lot of phone calls from other OEMs that have seen these other 
deal
s that they maybe do not have an understanding they have separate 
arrangements is that potentially causing any renegotiations? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Tim on the 
-
 
in terms of the accruals that we've taken, those stopped as the 
contract expires at the end 
of the calendar year with the last period that that 
would be reported in 
-
 
for us was in fiscal Q2.
 
George Davis
 
And just to be 
-
 
just a reminder, we didn't characterize sort of where those 
-
 

 
like we're 
validating your description of them. On the second point, I think the way to 
think about that is the licensee with, which we have a dispute now, those 
discussions with the licensee I would say have been ongoing for some time 
and predated the fi
ling in any of the litigation between us and Apple.
 
A lot of times these discussions will go for a period of time before they 
escalate into a dispute and so that the timing is what it is, but I think it's 
important to note that the discussions leading up t
o dispute predated into 
the BlackBerry or the Apple litigation. And I don't really see a connection to 
that if you think about the BlackBerry decision. It really is an isolated 
agreement.
 
And as I mentioned in my remarks even after we make the refund, the 
amount that BlackBerry paid per unit during that time period was basically 
consistent with the caps that we have for premium tier devices. So I don't 
anticipate really any impact from that decision on what other licensees 
would claim in terms of what it me
ans to their agreements.
 
The Apple situation as we mentioned in a lot of detail in our response, the 
terms under those agreements I think were grossly mischaracterized in 
Apple submission. So, yes we've had to have some discussions with 
licensees to try to
 
clarify what it is and isn't. But I would say that's sort of 
normal course discussions we would typically have with companies.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Tim, I would add that as I said in my prepared remarks that the disputed 
amounts under the cooperation agreemen
t were accrued as a reduction to 
revenues in the P&L. So we can give that level of commentary.

Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan 
Stanley. Please go ahead.
 
James Faucette
 
Thank you very much. Just a couple of ques
tions, first on that the topic of 
royalties from the contract manufacturers, have you received any payments 
sense that the original lawsuit was filed and is that part of the reason that 
you feel comfortable assuming that at least some royalties will be pai
d and 
in the June quarter?
 
And then I did want to touch quickly on the NXPI acquisition. Any update on 
timing of other regulatory body approvals? And can you give us a rough 
outline yet as to what the financing cost for that portion will be or what the 
interest rates may look like et cetera if and as that deal closes? Thank you 
very much.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Jim, this is Derek. On your first question about the contract manufacturers. 
So yes for Q2 what was reported and owed to us by the contract 
manufacturers a
ctually exceeded the amount that's in dispute between 
QUALCOMM and Apple under the cooperation agreement. So we did receive 
payments under those licenses for the difference as George mentioned 
between what those companies owed and basically the disputed am
ount that 
Apple withheld.
 
And for the Q3, basically we've already received royalty reports from most of 
the contract manufacturer suppliers to Apple and believe there is a clear and 
binding payment obligation as it relates to those payments and there is no
 
dispute about other money that is owed from QUALCOMM to Apple.
 
So again if these licensees are operating in accordance with the terms of the 
agreement they should pay and they should pay the full amount, but again 
more 
-
 
a little cautious until we actuall
y get the payment in hand and so 
that's reflected in the guidance as well as just pointing out that the situation 
where there's zero payment is not reflected in our range today.
 
Donald Rosenberg
 
This is Don. On the NXP question. So yes, we're pretty much m
oving as 
expected as Steve mentioned, we have past the HSR process in the U.S. We 
should be filing very shortly in Europe and we filed in China already that has 
not yet been doctored by China, but it's there. And we would anticipate filing 
in the other jur


 
George Davis
 
On the financing front, we expect to be in the market in the second half, we 
have not put out an estimate yet on the f
inancing costs. No material change 
in our expected sizing, which was between $10 billion and $12 billion of 
acquisition debt. But the form of that debt, the term and the tenor will all 
have an impact on estimated cost and we're not locked down on those yet
.

Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Hi. Thank you very much. First, I just wanted to clarify if the payments to 
Apple under the BCPA were previously reported as comes f
rom revenues in 
QCT or in QTL. And then the question on the new licensee that was 
underpaying in the quarter, did they still pay the majority of what they owed 

what they owed you?
 
A
nd then along the same lines, your accounts receivable increased by about 
$2 billion of which you commented that $1 billion was due to the Apple 
withholding and then some of that was the TDK joint venture, but in the 
filing 
-
 
in the Q, you also say that so
me of the increase was due to the 
delayed payments of other licensees. So I was just curious if there are other 
potential disputes that contributed to that or if that's just purely timing?
 
Derek Aberle
 
Hi, Simona. This is Derek. Maybe I'll take the first t
wo and then George can 
take the last one. Yes, the amounts that are in dispute between us and 
Apple as we mentioned last quarter have been fully accounted for and run 
through the P&L in prior quarters. We did not specify sort of where in the 
P&L, the vario
us payments were flowing and I think at this time are going to 
continue on that path. As to the dispute with the licensee, I'm not sure I can 
characterize majority versus minority, but they did pay a significant amount 
of royalties to us and didn't withhol
d 
-
 
they withheld only a portion of what 
they owed not the entire payment.
 
George Davis
 
So on the accounts receivable outside of the Apple related $1 billion and the 
RF360 amounts, what you had was growth in receivables related to QCT, 
which was just a tim
ing issue or payment relative to when shipments were 
made. And then on the QTL piece that is really just the timing of payments 
that are being made on some of the catch up payments where they're 
spread out over a short period of time just to allow customer
s to get caught 
up in addition to fully paying at their new run rate.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. 
Please go ahead.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I know you're making the 
po
int that the contract manufacturers are under obligation to pay no matter 
what they're getting from Apple, but let's be honest they're going to pay you 
whatever they get from Apple given presumably. So given what you know at 
this point of Apple's intention
s, how can we assess that risks just the fact 
that you're 
-
 
you aren't contemplating Apple completely ceasing their 
payments, so I just think you judge their risk of that happen to be lower, it's 
just not a scenario that you want to contemplate at this poi
nt?
 
And on the revenue recognition, you give us some good color on kind of 
what constitutes a deferral versus not, but let's just say hypothetically next 
quarter the contract manufacturers were to pay you 50% of what you 
believe they owe you for Q3. Would 
you be able to recognize all that 50% or 
would you have to defer at that point and send an arbitration and call it 
zero? How do we think about revenue recognition depending on what's 
coming in?
 
Donald Rosenberg
 
Stacy, this is Don. Maybe a couple of us who 
would want to respond to the 

speech, let's be honest. We are being honest and what is a good thing to 
think about is I disagree with you that it's a foregone conclusion.
 
As I sa
id earlier, Apple's claimed in its case against us is that they would 
held the specific amount of money in payments to their contract 
manufacturers because they said it's an offset against money that they 
claim, we withheld from them improperly in another 
contract. While we 
disagree with that claim obviously, the rationale for that no longer applies.
 
As Derek said earlier, that BCPA contract is expired. So they're no more 
moneys even arguably due from us to them and therefore no basis or 
rationale to contin
ue withholding from the contract manufacturers. And as 
Derek also said the contract manufacturers have valid binding contracts with 
us and our expectation is that they will abide by those obligations and pay 
us the amount they owe us, which they reported f
or the quarter.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Stacy, this is Derek. I think on your second question, I think probably the 

circumstances under which the revenue got reported and paid to us to sort 
of 
make a final judgment on that, but at a high level I would say we have 
binding valid agreements with them if they reported half of what they owe 
and paid that to us. I think the most likely scenario is as long as we're not in 
litigation with them that we w
ould recognize that revenue within the quarter 
that is paid.

Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond 
James. Please go ahead.
 
Tavis McCourt
 
Hey, thanks for taking my questions. The $150 million or so license 
payments that have been withheld in the second quarter, was that 
contemplated in your second quarter guidance or is that something that 
happened after the last report? And then, so just to be clear on the contract 
manufacturers payments for your third quar
ter guidance, the high end of the 
guidance would presume they pay in full, but there's no presumption of, 
obviously, the cooperation agreement payments from you towards Apple 
with that guidance? Is that correct?
 
George Davis
 
Let me start with your first qu
estion which was 
-
 
we did not contemplate the 

point that actually if you factor that out it was a strong quarter for QTL, they 
were able to come in at expectation despite that, and yo
u saw that in the 
strength of the market and also the strength in ASP's, they also worked hard 
to manage the cost.
 


hings 
that we thought could happen. We are anticipating in our guidance that we 
have not resolved the dispute with the one customer that made the 
underpayment in Q2, so that is factored into our guidance. And then there's 
a variety of scenarios for the App
le contract manufacturers and also just the 
normal range of uncertainties that we have when we give guidance.

Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyo
ne. We are pleased to 
report strong results in the fourth quarter with non
-
GAAP earnings of $0.78 
per share, above the high end of our guidance range on solid performance in 
our licensing business. We are also pleased to see our licensing revenue 
return to
 
a seasonal pattern with fiscal Q1 as a high, based on our recent 
licensing agreement with Apple. Over the last several years, we have 
invested to establish Qualcomm as a leader in 5G. As a reminder, 5G brings 
a significant increase in complexity over 4G, 
such as new and dense network 
architectures, high performance basebands, advanced RF front end designs, 
increased processing requirements, in addition to driving the leading edge 
process node.
 
We are actively focused on helping to define and standardize re
leases 16 
and 17 features to support the expansion of 5G into new large adjacent 
markets such as enterprise, industrial IoT and automotive. The complexity 
and expansion of cellular technologies beyond the smartphone into nearly 
every industry play directly
 
to Qualcomm's strengths and are why we believe 
5G will represent the single biggest opportunity in Qualcomm's history.
 
Looking ahead to fiscal year 2020, the Company remains focused on these 
three key priorities. Number one, continue executing on 5G with 
our 
partners around the world. The number of OEMs and operators launching 5G 
products and services continues to increase throughout the year. There are 
now over 40 OEMs and over 30 operators launching or announcing 5G 
products or commercial service, up fro
m approximately 20 OEMs and 
operators respectively at the start of the year. Looking forward, we expect 
5G to launch in all regions, within the next two years to three years.
 
On the product side, in September, we announced plans to accelerate 5G 
global com
mercialization at scale by expanding our portfolio of 5G mobile 
platforms into the Snapdragon 7 Series and 6 Series, launching as early as 
calendar Q1 2020. Our integrated 5G SoCs will support both sub
-
6 gigahertz 
and millimeter wave at the volume tiers ac
ross all geographies.
 
As we continue to expand our 5G product portfolio, our design wins are also 
increasing. We now have over 230 5G design wins launched or in 
development, up from 150 in the prior quarter, virtually, all of which are 
using our RF front
-
e
nd solutions for 5G sub
-
6 and/or millimeter wave. 
Notably, multiple OEMs are now shipping or have announced their second or 
third 5G device models using both our Snapdragon 5G core chipset and our 
modem to antenna RF front
-
end solution. In Korea, the migra
tion to 5G 
continues at a strong pace. According to the Korean Ministry of Science and 
ICT, Korean operators have already signed up 3.5 million 5G subscribers 
through September, a pace that remains faster than its migration to 4G. 
Additionally, 5G millimet
er wave services are in planning stages by Korean 
carriers for calendar 2020.
 
In the United States, Verizon has committed to deploy 5G Ultra Wideband 
millimeter wave in 30 markets by year
-
end and T
-
Mobile separately 
announced plans to cover 200 million peo
ple with 5G on 600 megahertz 
before the end of this year. And in Europe, there are multiple 5G launches 
across Switzerland, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
 
In China, all three mobile operators commercially launched 5G services last 
week bringing 5G
 
to the largest smartphone subscriber base in the world.
 
We now estimate that by the end of this year, the three operators will 
deploy a total of approximately 130,000 5G base stations. We further 
estimate that by the end of 2020, 5G base station deploymen
ts will increase 
to approximately 1 million which to put in context is 10 times the scale of 
the entire network of a large US operator.
 
Lastly, TSMC recently attributed the significant increase in demand for their 
leading technology nodes to a stronger out
look for 5G deployment next year. 
This is yet another significant indicator of the 5G ramp into 2020.
 
Second priority, to expand our technology platform into adjacent industry 
segments. In automotive, we are very encouraged with the engagement and 
design w
in traction we are experiencing from automakers and Tier 1 
customers with our Telematics and third
-
generation Snapdragon automotive 
cockpit solutions. Our design win pipeline has now increased to almost $6.5 
billion, up from $5 billion at the start of the 
fiscal year, giving us great 
visibility into strong growth in auto over the next several years. Over time, 
as the technology roadmap in auto converges with the cellular roadmap, we 
expect to see an increased opportunity to lead in new product categories, 
n
otably ADAS.
 
In compute, we continue to build traction in the Windows on Snapdragon 
always
-
on, always
-
connected PC category. In August, Samsung announced 
the Galaxy Book S, based on the Snapdragon 8cx. This is the Samsung 
second Windows on Snapdragon devic
e, and the first announced Snapdragon 
8cx always
-
connected PC.
 
In October, Microsoft launched the Surface Pro X, our first design with 
Microsoft in this premium tier, powered by a Snapdragon 8cx variant that is 
designed for the always
-
on compute environmen
t, the Microsoft SQ1 
developed in partnership with Microsoft. This is the finest surfaced ever and 
has three times the performance per watt of the Surface Pro 6.
 
Priority three, drive revenue growth, operating leverage and earnings per 
share. Consistent wi
th our comments last quarter, we continue to expect a 
positive inflection point as 5G ramps beginning in our fiscal second quarter. 
With the conclusion of our cost plan and significant share repurchases over 
the last year, we are poised to deliver margin e
xpansion, an outsized growth 
in earnings and earnings per share as revenue growth accelerates.
 
We are pleased with the progress we have made over the course of 2019 
and believe the business is very well positioned for sustained long
-
term 
growth as we benef
it from the decisions and investments made over the last 
several years, including 5G, the return of Apple licensing and product 
revenues, growth in RF front
-
end and growth in adjacent businesses.
 
Before I turn the call over to Akash, I'd like to congratula
te him on becoming 
Qualcomm's Chief Financial Officer. As QCT Finance Lead for the past four 
years, Akash brings a deep knowledge base of our company, both 
operationally and strategically. I'm looking forward to working closely with 
Akash as we enter this 
next chapter of our history.
 
I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. It is a very exciting time 
to become Chief Financial Officer of Qualcomm and I'm looking forward to 
engaging with
 
our shareholders and analysts. I will begin with a discussion 
of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings. We delivered strong results with non
-
GAAP EPS of $0.78, $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range, and 
revenues of $4.8 billion, above the midpoint o
f our guidance range.
 
The outperformance in the quarter was primarily driven by QTL on higher 
units and stronger mix resulting in QTL revenues of $1.16 billion and EBT 
margin of 68%. As a reminder, we did not record any royalty revenues from 
Huawei in our 
fiscal fourth quarter results. QCT delivered revenues of $3.6 
billion and $152 million MSM chip shipments, in line with our expectations 
for the quarter. QCT's EBT margin was approximately 14%, flat sequentially 
and at the midpoint of our guidance range.
 
T
urning to fiscal 2019, we recorded $19.4 billion in non
-
GAAP revenues and 
$3.54 in non
-
GAAP earnings per share. During the year, we achieved several 
key milestones that position us favorably for fiscal 2020 and beyond. First, 
our early investments in 5G pl
ayed a key role in accelerating 5G 
deployments and we have secured over 230 chipset design wins. Second, we 
completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in RF360 Holdings and 
established a strong design win pipeline for RF front
-
end products across 
5G 
sub
-
6 and millimeter wave devices.
 
Third, we signed global patent license and multi
-
year chipset supply 
agreements with Apple. Fourth, we concluded our cost reduction plan 
announced in January 2018. And lastly, since our July 2018 announcement, 
we have 
completed approximately $23 billion in stock repurchase through 
fiscal 2019, at an average price of $65 per share, resulting in a 22% 
reduction of our shares outstanding.
 
Turning to our outlook, we are maintaining our estimate of 1.7 billion to 1.8 
billion units for calendar 2019 for global 3G, 4G, 5G device forecast. For 
calendar 2020, we are estimating 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion units, up 
approximately 3% at the midpoint, reflecting flat handsets and low double
-
digit growth in non
-
handsets. We ar
e estimating 175 million to 225 million 
5G handset units in calendar 2020.
 
Consistent with our comments on our previous earnings call, our business 
outlook is impacted by several factors including weaker demand in China and 
certain developed regions, Huawe
i share gain in China and OEMs managing 
4G inventory ahead of the transition to 5G.
 
Turning to our first quarter guidance for fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to 
be in the range of $4.4 billion to $5.2 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per 
share of $0.80 to $0.
90. We estimate fiscal first quarter QTL revenues to be 
in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 70% to 74%. 
We expect QTL revenues to be up 21% sequentially at the midpoint in our 
fiscal first quarter due to normal holiday seasonalit
y driven by timing of 
flagship phone launches. Our fiscal first quarter forecast does not include 
any royalty revenues from Huawei while we continue to pursue a negotiated 
resolution of the licensing dispute.
 
With the completion of the global patent licens
e agreement with Apple 
earlier this year, QTL revenues will begin to reflect a seasonally high fiscal 
first quarter. Following the seasonal uplift, we expect QTL revenues to return 
to a range of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion in our fiscal second quarter.
 
In
 
QCT, we estimate fiscal first quarter MSM shipments of 145 million units 
to 165 million units and EBT margin in the range of 10% to 12%. QCT's EBT 
margin guidance reflects lower volume in the premium and high tiers, driven 
by a pause ahead of the transiti
on to 5G in early calendar 2020 and the 
normal timing of handset launches by our customers in these tiers. As we 
look beyond our fiscal first quarter, we see a significant inflection point for 
QCT as we expect to realize the benefits from the ramp of 5G ha
ndset 
launches. In the fiscal second quarter, we anticipate QCT revenues to grow 
in the mid
-
teens sequentially and QCT EBT margin to return to the mid
-
teens.
 
In our fiscal first quarter, we expect non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A 
expenses to be flat to down 
2% sequentially. As a reminder, expenses are 
typically higher in our fiscal second quarter as it includes the normal 
calendar resets for certain employee
-
related costs.
 
Interest expense net of investment and other income in the fiscal first 
quarter is expe
cted to be approximately $100 million and is a reasonable 
estimate for each of the remaining quarters in fiscal 2020. For our fiscal first 
quarter, we also estimate approximately 1.16 billion weighted average 
shares outstanding and a tax rate of 14%.
 
Looki
ng forward, 2020 is an exciting year for Qualcomm as we expect the 
financial upside of our 5G strategy to begin to play out with multiple drivers 
of non
-
GAAP revenue and earnings growth, including the launch of 5G 
devices, RF front
-
end design win traction,
 
growth in adjacencies combined 
with operating leverage and a substantially reduced share count.
 
We look forward to seeing you in New York at our Analyst Day on November 
19th, where we will be providing additional details about our long
-
term 
growth strateg
y. Thank you.
 
And, I will now turn the call back over to Mauricio.

Thank you, Akash. Operator, we are ready for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Caso with 
Ray
mond James. Please proceed with your question.
 
Chris Caso
 
Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess, first question would be on the pace 
of the 5G ramp as we proceed through the fiscal year, you've given some 
indications on where you expect overall revenue to 
be, if you could talk 
about that in percentage terms of 5G as a percentage of the mix as it goes 
through the year even on revenue terms or MSM terms, whatever you could 
do to give us some sense of how 5G penetrates as the year goes on?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Thank
s, Chris. This is Cristiano. Consistent I think with what we just said, in 
the earnings call, I think timing, our fiscal Q2 is that we started to see the 
inflection point as the devices have just started to show up in volumes and 
overall I think mix, we ex
pect that to be ramping in the high and the 
premium tier and some of the markets that we've seen launching 5G, within 
that, we provide a metric before that we will see probably 1.5 times the ASP 
as we look at higher content, both the modem as well as the R
F front
-
end.
 
Chris Caso
 
Okay, thank you. And as a follow
-
on for that maybe you could give us some 
commentary on how that impacts QCT margins as the year progresses. 
Obviously, you've got that additional content. The margins are depressed 
that you're making
 
the transition now, what should we expect as the year 
goes on those QCT margins?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. Hi, Chris. This is Akash. The way you should think about the year 
playing out for QCT with 5G is really there is going to be two inflection points 
in th
e chip business. The first inflection point will be flagship launches in 
early 2020 by both our global and Chinese OEMs and you should think of it 
as RMB3000 and above handsets will start adopting 5G. The second 
inflection point will be in the fall time fr
ame when another set of flagship 
devices will adopt 5G. So that should be kind of the shape of 5G adoption 
through the year, and how this translates into margin is, we gave guidance 
for our second quarter margin. We are expecting from first to second quart
er 
revenue will go up mid
-
teens and operating margins will also be in the mid
-
teens range in the second quarter. We are not guiding longer term margins 
at this point, but we will talk about it at Analyst Day as well.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question w
ill come from James Faucette with Morgan 
Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
 
James Faucette
 
Thank you very much. I wanted to ask kind of a follow
-
up to that and 
maybe, Cristiano, you can talk about where you see Qualcomm where it's 
particularly str
ong positioned in terms of like, if we look at flagships down 
through the different tiers of phones, where you've talked a lot about design 
wins, but where should we expect you to show up most strongly versus 
where may there be a bit more variety of suppli
ers?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Thanks for the question, James, We updated our design pipeline. The design 
pipeline is about now 230 plus 5G devices across now multiple tiers. It's up 
substantially since 6 months ago, and I'll answer your question in two ways. 
First, I think, it's been very clear that our early investments in millimeter 
wave have provided Qualcomm with a significant technology advantage in 
having the technology to maturity and we're optimistic about millimeter 
wave going from the United States i
nitial launches into Korea and Japan and 
other markets, including being license already in Europe where Telecom 
Italia was the first one happening throughout 2020, that's a very good thing 
for Qualcomm.
 
Having said that, I would probably say that every sin
gle launch of a flagship 
OEM today with the exception of Huawei, they use their own silicon, every 
other launch of every other OEM has been a Qualcomm Snapdragon 
platform, and that positioned us very well about partnering with OEMs for 5G 
ramp including Sa
msung, which we have not only launched with the 
traditional markets, but also I point you to the A Series, which is the second 
tier below the flagship that are being launching with Qualcomm globally in 
addition to the Galaxy Fold.
 
So those are positive thi
ngs as we think 5G transition for Qualcomm
 
James Faucette
 
Great. And then follow
-
up question, maybe for Steve and Don. You 
mentioned that you're in ongoing negotiations with Huawei, but haven't 
reached any agreement as of yet. How do you think or what need
s to 
happen to move an agreement across the line? And are we going to is 
--
 
I 
guess I'm wondering how China
-
US trade relations and potential resolution 
or at least a trade agreement may factor into those negotiations and 
conversations with Huawei?
 
Steve Mo
llenkopf
 
James, it's Steve. So we continue to talk to Huawei. I would characterize the 
discussions as ongoing, but really nothing to report on. Obviously, we don't 
have the numbers. We don't have any revenue in the numbers right now for 
licensing revenue. 
In terms of how the trade discussions between the two 
countries impact the probability or chance that we can get a resolution, I 
think it's too early to tell. I think it's pretty opaque at the moment. it's good 
that we're talking, but there's really nothin
g to report on right now. And you 
know that the product business for us is actually quite small. We tend to be 
a little bit more insulated I think from the trade talks compared to maybe 
other companies, but too early to tell in terms of what it will mean t
o the 
licensing discussions.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. 
Please proceed with your question.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Hi, thanks for taking the question. I would just wanted to start off firstly on 
the 
--
 
by focu
sing a bit on the RF front
-
end opportunity. You mentioned that 
most of the design wins you're seeing kind of both the modem and the RF 
front
-
end go together. So just wanted to kind of get your thoughts about 
how you're thinking about market share in RF fro
nt
-
end and the early
-
generation 5G phones to do some of the incumbents in the space and then 
how should we think about sustaining that market share and kind of the 
second
-
generation, third
-
generation 5G phones? And then I have a follow
-
up. Thank you.
 
Crist
iano Amon
 
Thanks for the question. So, we look at 5G as the key entry point for RF 
front
-
end business and we're very satisfied with the ability as we started to 
look into the designs with the 5G content, which are specifically sub
-
6 
spectrum as well as mil
limeter wave spectrum. We actually have seen a very 
high percentage. Virtually, all of the 230
-
plus designs now for 5G content 
have Qualcomm modem to antenna design. We have seen in those devices, 
some of our existing incumbents continue to support and pro
vide content for 
4G, but the 5G position of Qualcomm is very strong. What we are very 
happy especially at this time, as we head into the Q2 ramp of 5G, we see 
now as we go into second
-
generation designs for these 
--
 
for the second
-
generation devices as wel
l as lower tiers, we have maintained that pattern. 
So we're now going into design number two and design number three that 
maintain the 5G caught on the RF front
-
end and we're very happy with that 
development.
 
Samik Chatterjee
 
Okay. And if I can just follow
-
up, you've talked extensively about the 
opportunity on 5G handsets. If you can help me quantify the revenue 
opportunity outside of handsets, be it like small cells or IoT that is also tied 
to 5G opportunity, but outside of handsets? Just looking for some 
color 
there.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Yes. So I may give you the first part of the answer, and I'll ask Akash to 
add. Devices and smartphones are definitely going to be the vast majority of 
the earnings, especially as we had in 2020 is how 5G is going to ramp. 
Howev
er, we are happy about the 5G traction in all of our adjacents from 
upgrade of Telematics in automotive to 5G, we've seen a lot of industrial IoT 
applications and even our small cell business is getting traction including 
with traditional infrastructure ve
ndors. So we expect that to be a growth 
story in as we head into 2021 and '22. In '20 the ones I want to single out is 
CPE for mobile broadband. And that's part of a lot of the carriers deployment 
of 5G and fixed wireless.

Thank you. Our next ques
tion comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche 
Bank. Please proceed with your question.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Hi guys, congrats on the strong results and 5G color. I just wanted to see 
about the seasonality in the QCT side, Steve 
--
 
or QTL side, excuse me. 
Steve, you m
entioned that you were happy it was returning to a seasonal 
pattern. You talked a little bit, I think Akash about what it was going to do in 
the fiscal second quarter. Can you just talk about the seasonality of that? Is 
the range that you've given in the p
ast of kind of the $1.1 billion to $1.2 
billion, is that the new range in kind of the weak quarters and the stronger 
quarters be closer to the $1.4 billion you just did? Or how should we think 
about that as the year progresses?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, hi, Ro
ss, this is Akash. I think that's a fair way of thinking about it. We 
just reported actuals for the September quarter at $1.16 billion and we are 
guiding the December quarter at the midpoint of $1.4 billion and the March 
quarter at $1.1 billion. So that ki
nd of gives you a sense of the seasonality in 
the business, and those are fair numbers to use to project the business 
going forward.
 
Ross Seymore
 
Thanks for that. As my follow
-
up, perhaps one for Cristiano on the revenue 
per MSM side of things, just would 
hope to get a little more color on why is 
that going down sequentially in your fiscal first quarter guidance. And 
perhaps more importantly, it seems like it's up very nicely, almost 12% 
year
-
over
-
year in fiscal ' 19 and still despite that sequential declin
e in your 
fiscal first quarter is still up, the better part of 10% there. I was wondering 
what's driving the sequential decline, the year
-
over
-
year increases. And 
then, if that's all pre
-
5 G, how should we think about the lift off of this level?
 
Cristiano 
Amon
 
All right, Ross. So our ASP per MSM has a very high sensitivity to high and 
premium tiers and I guess if you look at what happened in the quarter and 
the guide for the next one, I think consistent with what we said on the last 
earnings call that we're
 
going to see the dynamic throughout the calendar 
year. We have seen a weaker market, weaker demand in China and that 
combined with Huawei gaining share in domestic China as well, that's one 
dynamic. The other dynamic is OEMs canceled some of the 4G flagsh
ips and 
moved their portfolio towards 5G getting ahead of the launch. So that 
created basically a change in the composition of MSM because of the high 
and premium tier units as we go through that transition. However, the 
inflection point for Q2 is where yo
u started to see the effect and when we 
talk about at the 1.5 times. If anything, the guide that we provide in Q2, it 
contemplates the core market environment, the typical seasonality of our 
business, no significant changes in OEM share and does not includ
e yet the 
ramp of the Apple business, you will see that change just with the 1.5 which 
in average has higher ASP content on the modem plus the RF front
-
end.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please 
proceed with 
your question.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Congratulation Akash. I guess, 
Steve, my first question is around the 5G unit numbers that you gave for 
calendar '20, I guess the midpoint that you guys have laid out is 200 million 
units. May
be you could give a little color on what you're assuming the 
geographic mix of those units is, in particular, what percentage might be 
China versus rest of world? And then I have a follow
-
up. Thanks.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, hi Matt, this is Akash. So the way
 
we thought about the 5G forecast for 
2020 is a couple of ways. We looked at the tops
-
down of how transitions 
have typically happened in previous generations. And the one 
-
 
-
 
the two 
things that are different with 5G versus transition from 3G to 4G is Chin
a is 
adopting 5G at the same time as the other geographies versus in 4G they 
were a couple of years late. And then also within 5G, we are seeing multiple 
tiers of products being launched simultaneously, which we did not have for 
4G. So that's why we think 
the intensity of the 5G rollout is actually faster 
and you have China as a big portion of it happening early in the lifecycle. Of 
course, in addition to that, we are obviously talking to all of our OEM 
customers and we have a very good sense of how many de
vices they are 
planning to launch over the next and several months with 5G and at what 
price points and that also allows us to inform our tops
-
down forecast.
 
Matt Ramsay
 
Got it, that's really helpful. As my follow
-
up a quick one for Alex on the 
licensing a
greements and obviously we're all encouraged to see the progress 
you've made on 5G. There has also been this dynamic of SEP
-
only licenses 
become a bigger piece of the mix and some implications for the implied 
royalty rate. I know that moves around a bit, b
ut I think you guys talked 
about in an answer to an earlier question about how to model the QTL 
business going forward. I wonder if we're now at relative steady state for 
implied royalty rates as we go forward? Any comments there would be 
helpful. Thank yo
u.
 
Alex Rogers
 
So, I think that may be a fair way to look at it, but I think what 
--
 
the way 
you should look at it for guidance is we're guiding revenue. And so, as we 
noted, we're going to see seasonality and we're going to see the remaining 
quarters at t
he range that we identified, and of course, that's without the 
Huawei numbers, but we have made really good progress with signing up 5G 
agreements. We have over 75 agreements now in place since we started our 
5G licensing program. So I think that reflects 
a very strong IP position. But I 
think again, if you look to our guidance on revenue, that's probably the 
easiest way to think about it.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
And Matt, this is a Akash. Just a quick reminder that our revenue guidance 
numbers does not include Hu
awei. So as that gets resolved, that would be 
incremental to the range.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with 
Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Thanks for taking my questions. Aroun
d the March quarter on QCT guide. So 
units in March quarter for MSM units are typically down seasonally, you're 
obviously guiding revenues up mid
-
teens on the 5G ramp. So is that all or 
even maybe more than 100% due to increases in revenue per MSM, like is
 
it 
with the 5G ramp itself and content is enough to offset the normal seasonal 
decline in unit shipments? Or are you seeing kind of like an ending of the 
flush that we've been having and maybe a reversal with some fillers when 
the new products get in. How
 
do we think about that unit versus ASP trend 
in that 
--
 
embedded in that March quarter revenue guide for chipsets?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, hi, Stacy. So there are couple of factors. This is Akash by the way. 
There are couple of factors that affect our secon
d quarter numbers for units 
and ASP. You're correct about the seasonal 
--
 
seasonally lower quarter, but 
that is also offset by a stronger mix because we launched our new premium 
tier chip and new high tier chip during that quarter as well. So there is a mi
x 
implication before we get to the 5G benefit. And then the third factor is our 
-
-
 
what we have disclosed previously, which is with 5G devices on a like
-
for
-
like device basis, we expect 1.5x monetization as a combination of the 
chipset and the RF front
-
end
 
revenue on top of it. So those are kind of the 
three factors that impact the volume and price revenue per MSM mix in that 
quarter.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
Thanks. And maybe just a follow
-
up on that. So, you mentioned 1.5 times 
content increase, but at the same time,
 
you also mentioned multiple tiers 
launching simultaneously, which is something we didn't really see in 4G. So 
how do we think about that, I guess that 
--
 
that differential of those drivers 
on content increase overall versus the general, a mix of tiers tha
t are 
launching, and do you think that is enough to keep revenue per MSM rising 
through 2020 
--
 
through fiscal 2020 as 5G becomes more mainstream?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, so the way we think about the 1.5x is really for a given tier device, so 
comparing a pr
emium tier to a premium tier device, when you go from 5G 
--
 
4G to 5 G, the revenue opportunity increases by 1.5x. And then this would 
also apply to the tiers as it penetrates further down, and so you should, you 
should think of that as a mechanism of model
ing our business as the mix 
improves from 4G to 5G
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital 
Markets. Please proceed with your question.
 
Mitch Steves
 
Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus a little bit ba
ck just on 
the pricing you guys are getting. So I realized this to be down a little bit in 
December quarter. But, so two really clarifications. If Huawei does come 
back, would you get an implied ASP that goes up or down? And then 
secondly, how do we think 
about that kind of ramping over the next 12 
months. I mean, I think most models have it going up a few dollars. But is 
that rate still or do you guys think it needs to be changed after seeing the 
mix come through?
 
Alex Rogers
 
So, this is Alex. You're 
asking about on the licensing side or is 
--
 
Mitch Steves
 
Yes.
 
Alex Rogers
 
Okay. Look, again, the way we think about it is that 
--
 
Akash maybe weigh 
in here, the way we think about it is that Huawei is incremental and I'm not 
sure what more to say to 
that other than what we've already provided by 
way of guide.
 
Mitch Steves
 
Okay. I guess, maybe we should return to Huawei piece that if that comes 
back is that, are you going to be increasing ASPs, or you think that the ASPs 
will be flattish or similar?
 
Ak
ash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, the way 
--
 
this is Akash, Mitch. The way you should think about Huawei 
is we don't have Huawei units or revenue contemplated in the QTL guide at 
this point. So when Huawei gets included into the guide, it would be based 
on what their de
vice ASP is and our licensing deal with them. So it will just 
fall out of the agreement that we end up having with Huawei.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman 
Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
 
Rod Hall
 
Yes, hi guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to just go back to the 
progress of 5G and particularly millimeter wave attach. And I wonder, 
Cristiano, if you could talk a little bit about 
--
 
of the 230 wins or maybe 
Steve, you want to address this, how m
any of those have millimeter waves 
attached to them or at least some version of them? And then as we get to 
the flagship launches at the beginning of next year, kind of proportionally, 
how does it look? And then as we get to the end of next year, how does 
that 
look? Do we do we get to most phones by beginning of next year having 
millimeter wave attach or some smaller proportion? Could you just walk us 
through that and then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Rod, thanks for the question. So the way to think 
about it, it's pretty much 
at this point by market, for example, the United States market, all of the 
devices they have launched, there is a requirement for millimeter wave that 
the spectrum utilized by all of the three of the four carriers right now and 
t
herefore we have seen the initial launches of millimeter wave. Going into 
2020, the current planning assumption is you're going to start to see 
millimeter wave also coming in the Korean market, is going to come into the 
Japan market, and in the later part 
of '20 and beginning 2021, you start to 
see that in Europe. And that's how it's going to change the mix. So right 
now, you should look at some of the China launches that we're going to see 
in '20, they're all going to be sub
-
6,and the Europe in '22 first h
alf will be 
sub
-
6, Japan, Korea, and United States are going to have millimeter wave. 
That's how to think about it.
 
Rod Hall
 
And is it your 
--
 
Cristiano, just to follow that up, is it your assumption then 
or our assumption should be that every market that 
has millimeter wave 
deployed in the wireless network, you would expect to see millimeter wave 
attach to most phones in that market. Is that correct?
 
Cristiano Amon
 
That's correct. Especially because you have in the wireless industry today 
you have probably
 
a single SKU launched by an operator within their entire 
geography, even if you're going to have some markets with millimeter wave, 
some markets with sub
-
6, that has been the requirement of a millimeter 
wave capability in many of those 5G devices.

Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
C.J. Muse
 
Yes, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess to 
follow
-
up on the last question, as you think about the 200 million 5G uni
t 
market plus or minus in 2020, what percentage do you believe will have 
millimeter waves? And then as part of that question, can you kind of talk 
through the tax rate that you're seeing on RF front
-
end for you guys at sub
-
6 versus millimeter wave. I would
 
assume a much higher rate there on 
millimeter.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Hi, let me answer in reverse order. So, on the Snapdragon platform today, 
the attach rate on millimeter wave in sub
-
6 is the same. I think we have 
modem to antenna designs including RF front
-
end in all of the Snapdragon. 
There are very few exceptions, and sometimes exception is just one or 
another band and is very small quantities. I will say the absolutely majority 
of the devices, we've been winning RF front
-
end across millimeter wave and 
sub
-
6, is not unique to millimeter wave. However, millimeter wave drives a 
lot more content because unlike sub
-
6 you need multiple antenna modules 
and multiple RF change of millimeter wave. So the content is 
disproportionately higher on the millimeter wave si
de.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
C.J., on the mix of sub
-
6 versus millimeter wave within the 200 million, at 
this point, we're not disclosing a mix really. But the way to best think about 
it is what as Cristiano mentioned earlier, is by market and so there are 
certain
 
markets, US and then Japan and Korea next year, where millimeter 
wave would be required from an operator perspective. And so those markets 
would have millimeter wave. So the best way to think about it is a mix of 
markets

Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please 
proceed with your question
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Hi, thanks. I wanted to just clarify the answer that you had to a prior 
question on the March guidance for QCT. So are you 
basically implying that 
units are going to maybe be seasonal plus just [indiscernible] and most of 
the increase in QCT revenue in March is ASP. Is that right?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes, I think the units will have kind of the regular cadence of seasonality, 
may
be with some increase that's driven by 5G launches, but primarily it will 
be a mix of the tier mix within the chips we have and then also the 4G 
versus 5G mix.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
Okay. And then I guess just following on to that then if you're not getting 
much 
of the unit benefit yet in March, obviously you're going to eventually 
have to see that unit benefit. So, how sustainable is the growth in QCT 
revenue into fiscal Q3 when you would I would think see much more of the 
unit growth in that quarter? Thanks.
 
Aka
sh Palkhiwala
 
So from a market perspective, the way we are planning our business going 
forward is, we're assuming the current market dynamics hold, and within 
that, our benefit as the transition happens to 5G and then so that's 
--
 
that 
should be the basis 
for the assumptions for next year. Now, as we have both 
kind of initial set of 5G launches happen and then additional 5G all launches 
happen across flagship models later in the year, we will see our operating 
margin ramp in addition to revenue per MSM as w
e see the benefit of 5G 
going through our portfolio.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Simpson with Arete 
Research. Please proceed with your question.
 
Brett Simpson
 
Yes, thanks very much. Cristiano, I just have a couple of questions, m
aybe 
first up on the 5G outlook for calendar 2020. You're talking about 200 million 
units at the midpoint. And I know other chipmakers who have reported in 
the last week or so were talking more like 300 million units globally for 5G 
next year. I just wante
d to sort of delve in a little bit into your assumptions. 
Are you expecting the large flagship launches next year to be only 5G or do 
you expect global flagships to also be 4G in that outlook? And anything you 
can tell us about what your assumptions are fo
r China within that 5G outlook 
you've given would be very helpful. Thanks.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Excellent question, so let me break that down. As we said earlier in this 
earnings call, I think Akash also mentioned this. We are assuming existing 
market dynamics. 
And I think that's why you probably see us in a more 
conservative estimate. If you believe that there is a pent
-
up demand for 5G 
devices and it's kind of consistent with other transitions, you could have a 
change in replacement rates and that's going to dr
ive a bigger market, 
bigger market is even better news for Qualcomm. So we're just assuming 
existing market dynamics in our projections. Now, going back to the outlook 
in '20, we talk a lot about the dynamics on Q2, but maybe to add to the 
prior question, 
you should expect as we get into the second half of '20, then 
we're going to see the addition of Apple volumes and so that's, you should 
think about really a 5G ramp for Qualcomm in 2020.
 
Your last question is about China. The order of magnitude of deploym
ent in 
China is significant in we said during the script that it's now the projection is 
1 million [indiscernible] or base stations by 2020. That's going to drive a 
very aggressive migration. So China could also be upside if the market 
dynamics don't hold 
and you have higher replacement rates, and also if you 
assume that the current Huawei share gains in China, which we're assuming 
as our going assumption if that changes and get to some more normal 
levels, that's upside as well.
 
Brett Simpson
 
And maybe if I
 
can just ask a quick follow up here, just to clarify on the RF 
front
-
end side, when you talk about modem to antenna in 5G, are you also 
including 4G modules, 4G RF modules, like low band, mid high band 
etcetera? Or are you really talking about ultra high 
band RF and also just on 
millimeter wave because I know there's a lot of investors questioning the 
viability of millimeter wave at the moment. What are you doing in your 
second
-
generation millimeter wave platforms to improve things like battery 
life, or ho
w do we think performance is going to pick up here? Thank you.
 
Cristiano Amon
 
Okay, maybe I'll 
--
 
two questions. Let me try to go quickly to them. So the 
first one is we have been very focused in 5G as the entry point. So we have 
been winning RF front
-
end 
in the 5G mid bands, and the 3.5 bands in some 
cases, and some of the reform bands as well at lower frequencies as well as 
millimeter wave. It's both. We continue to see the incumbents providing the 
4G, but I pointed to what we're going to see in 2020 espe
cially with dynamic 
spectrum sharing is going to be the re
-
farming of existing 4G bands, and we 
expect that to be an expansion of our existing 5G RF front
-
end solution. So 
that was the first question.
 
If you 
--
 
can you remind me the second question 
--
 
on t
he millimeter wave 
performance. Yes. So as we launched a new technology, there is a lot of 
features that come across the device and the infrastructure and they don't 
come all day one. So some of the initial I think battery life or even terminal, 
that was e
xperienced by millimeter wave in the first
-
generation chipsets, 
they've already been addressed with software updates and we've seen a full 
day battery life on existing first
-
generation chipset. As we go to the second
-
generation Snapdragon, we see with acro
ss process node and evolution of 
our modern technology also significant improvements in battery life area for 
the millimeter wave footprint as well as terminals.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini [ph] with SMBC. Please 
proceed with you
r question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Thank you. Couple of follow
-
ups actually. I guess first on the 5G ASP boost. 
There has been a lot of talk about the chipset ASP boost, but I'm just 
curious, I mean do you see any benefit on the QTL side, I know, I think mos
t 
of the 4G premium phones are probably already hitting your cap, but as we 
transition to 5G, what sort of benefit, if any, do you see on the QTL side?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Hi Srini, this is Akash. When 
--
 
again kind of going back to history, what has 
happened
 
from 3G to 4G and previous generations. We have seen typically 
an increase in replacement rates and an increase in ASPs when we go to a 
new generation. So that is certainly something that is possible and maybe 
even likely with 5G. For our business plannin
g purposes, we are, as we said 
earlier, we are planning based on a market being consistent and then within 
that having a transition to 5G. So that could be an upside opportunity for us. 
That's not included. And then, you could also see users with low and m
id
-
tier 
devices upgrade and buy higher tier devices because of the increased 
capability that 5G brings and that could help QTL ASPs as well, but again, 
that is not modeled into our business at this point.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
And one quick point with our 
early R&D and IP leadership, it's just a really 
good context for driving new agreements.

Got it. And then Akash, on the margin front, at QCT, I know you said the 
margins will improve over the next few quarters. But my question is on a 
like
-
for
-
like basis, does 5G give you better margins? Meaning, if I go back to 
the second half of 2017, I think you hit your 20% and 21% EBIT margin for 
QCT at that time. Your revenue run rate was close to $1 billion. So when we 
get back to that kind of re
venue run rate, do you expect the margins to be 
higher than the 20%, 21%?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Yes. So Srini, at this point, we are not disclosing kind of separate margins 
for our 4G versus our 5G business or a specific target for long
-
term margins. 
But this i
s something we will address at Analyst Day. So if you can stay 
tuned for a couple of weeks and we'll plan to address it there.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please 
proceed with your question.
 
Vijay Rakesh
 
Yes. J
ust wondering 
--
 
just looking at the RF front
-
end wins that you're 
seeing into next year, if you could give us exiting calendar '20, what you see 
would be the mix of RFFE within your QCT or could you give us some dollar 
number on what you think your RFFE w
ould be? Thanks.
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Hi, thanks for the question. We're not really breaking that down, but we did 
provide that metric of 1.5 times that include both the ASP increase in a 5G 
modem as well as our RF front
-
end content in average per tier.
 
Vijay 
Rakesh
 
Got it. And on the QCT side, I know you guys talked about a nice pickup with 
the mix going to 5G. What kind of ASP assumptions that you assuming on 
that as you go through 2020 especially as you might have some other 
merchant suppliers entering the m
arket? Thanks.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Well, the way to think about it is, we always have competition and there is 
nothing that we see in the market on the competitive side that is different 
than we expected and that is factored in our projections.

Thank
 
you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walsh with 
Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Walsh, Your line is 
live. You may proceed with your question.
 
Patrick Walsh
 
Sorry about that. I had it on mute. I just had two quick quest
ions. So the 
first question on the RF side, when you hear the traditional RF players, 
Qorvo Skyworks talk, they talk about a change in RF content from either 18 
to 20 going to 25. And so my question for you, it seems like, initially you 
guys are focused mo
re on that incremental $5 to $7. Is that a fair 
assessment and is the majority of that $5 to $7 made up by millimeter 
wave? And then if we think about that core 18 to 20 that's been historically 
there, are you really aiming for these kind of re
-
farmed band
, and then I 
guess within the bands, can you 
--
 
do you have 
--
 
I know you have bought 
capacity via TDK, I wouldn't imagine it's too much just given that 
[indiscernible] and Qorvo have probably I think 80% of the capacity out 
there. So would you be targetin
g more like low
-
band paths?
 
Akash Palkhiwala
 
Patrick, in terms of kind of the ASP question you asked, I think the examples 
you were quoting was for a premium tier device. Really, as you look at 
different regions and you look at different frequency bands in
 
a given region 
and tier of device, those numbers could be vastly different. So I think it's 
very difficult to generalize in terms of ASP advantages. The way you should 
think about that is, there is a certain market for RF front
-
end that exists. 
With 5G co
ming in, that is going to expand, and that's going to create an 
opportunity for us to significantly improve our share in the market. And then 
on top of that, as Cristiano mentioned, as DSS happens, dynamic spectrum 
sharing and bands get re
-
farmed to 5G, we
'll be able to participate and 
further expand our revenue opportunity. So that's kind of the framework you 
should use.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. That concludes today's question
-
and
-
answer session. Mr. 
Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before 
adjourning the call?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
Yes, thank you. I just want to thank the team 
--
 
the Qualcomm team for 
their hard work and the great execution through 2019. 2020 is the year of 
5G. I want to thank everybody for their hard work, we're on the cusp of i
t, 
and I'm very excited about it. But thanks everybody, see you next time.

Steve Mollenkopf
 
Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong 
quarter with revenue and non
-
GAAP EPS growth of 4% and 23% year
-
over
-
year respectively, reflecting strong results of technology leadership and 
disciplined execution in our core mobile businesses.
 
Before discussing our business activities further, I would l
ike to first 
comment on the recent legal challenges facing QUALCOMM. This is 


and they have been a 
long standing and valued customer. We intend to 
remain a good supplier to Apple, even while this dispute continues, and 
believe there is no better long
-
term partner for Apple than QUALCOMM and 
our industry leading technology. We believe that our strong and
 
highly 
differentiated product roadmap will continue to be the foundation for our 
relationship, and covers a broad range of technologies that will be 
fundamental to new products for years to come.
 
Our preference is always to resolve customer disputes throu
gh negotiations, 
instead of litigation. So it is regrettable that Apple has chosen to take this 
path. We are well prepared and confident in our ability to successfully defend 
against Apple's claims, as well as the related regulatory matters in Korea 
and wi
th the FTC. Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions. But in the 
end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They 
want to pay less with the fair value that QUALCOMM has established in the 
marketplace for our technology,
 
even though Apple has generated billions in 
profits from using that technology.
 
QUALCOMM has always been and remains a systems innovator, and R&D 
engine for the mobile industry. Unlike virtually every major company in our 
industry, sharing technology broa
dly with the industry through our licensing 
program has always been a paramount aspect of our business model, along 
with enabling competition. Our inventions have fundamentally enabled the 
mobile industry, and while those contributions began more than thre
e 
decades ago. We continue to invest heavily and lead the way in 4G LTE 
technology and mobile computing, and we are now leading the industry to 
5G.
 
And, although the initial market value of our portfolio was established a long 
time ago, that value has tang
ibly and meaningfully increased overtime as 
our technology contributions and our patent portfolio have grown 
significantly. Yet, we have never raised our royalty rates. This established 
value, that has been reaffirmed time
-
and
-
time again as we have 
renegot
iated existing licenses and entered into new license agreements with 
numerous licensees over the years, including over 120 new licenses in China 
within just the last two years.
 
As many of you on the call today are aware, we have a long history of 
successfu
lly defending our licensing practices and business model, which 
have been tested around the global, most recently in China. The resilience of 
our practices reflects both the fundamental and differentiated contributions 
we make to the core technology, enabl
ing the smartphone platform and the 
mobile industry as a whole. We invest heavily to push the technology 
boundaries for the benefit of our licenses and their customers, and the 
industry as a whole. And their licenses become more valuable and 
comprehensive 
overtime.
 
We out
-
innovate and out
-
invest other players in mobile and have negotiated 
and signed more than 200 license agreements, which validate and recognize 
the value of our technology contributions and related portfolio of IP. At the 
same time, I believ
e we have more opportunity ahead of us than at any time 
in the Company's history. And I assure you that our teams remained focused 
on executing on those opportunities, which when realized, will provide the 
next significant growth period for QUALCOMM with a
n estimated $138 billion 
serviceable addressable market in 2020.
 
Our pending acquisition of NXP is reflective of and consistent with these 
opportunities. This highly complementary combination accelerates our scale 
and portfolio of products and technologies
, as well as expands our go
-
to
-
market channels in the growth segments of automotive, IoT, security, and 
networking. We are seeing very strong support for this transaction, and our 
conversations with customers. And look forward to realizing the full potenti
al 
of bringing the two companies together.
 
We are progressing on our regulatory filings for the NXP transaction and 
integration planning is well underway. Another important opportunity comes 
with the formation of our joint venture with TDK. We are concludi
ng 12 
months of preparation and expect to close the JV this quarter. I believe this 
JV would transform our activities RF front
-
end from a strong niche player to 
a truly formidable challenger competing with all the necessary technology 
blocks to build our p
resence in that space.
 

bring Snapdragon to mobile compute. This allows us to bring the advantages 
of mobile innovation, leading consumer electronics technologies, and 
connectivity of t
he Snapdragon platform to laptop PCs, and expand our 
participation in a serviceable addressable market opportunity, expected to 
be $6 billion in 2020. As another example of our ability to expand our 
computing presence, our data center business also continu
es to execute 
well, as Derek will explain in more detail in a moment.
 
I would like to thank the QUALCOMM team for a strong showing at CES. Our 
newly announced Snapdragon 835 sets new standards for the next 
generation of smartphones, computing, VR and AR, a
nd many other 
applications. And we are leading the semiconductor industry in 10 
nanometer technology. We also continue to set new bars in modem 
technology, including our new X16 gigabit LTE and X55 modems. Simply 
stated, the roadmap is as strong today as i
t is ever been.
 
To summarize, we are very excited about the future and the many 
opportunities directly in front of us. This is a truly transformative time in the 

challenges underway
 
as we have done many times in the past. And in the 

major businesses.
 
I would now like to turn the call over to Derek.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone.
 
First, I would like to build 


standards
-
based agreements that have been the backbone of the mobile 
revolution, th
e framework that has facilitated and motivated a small number 
of companies, like QUALCOMM, to make investments to develop new 
technology, as well as the products and infrastructure to support that 
technology.
 
The cornerstone of the global mobile technology
 
ecosystem and the success 
of so many industry participants is based on the notion that companies that 
are willing to invest the necessary capital and devote engineering talent to 
invent technologies long before they can ever be implemented be fairly 
compe
nsated for sharing those inventions through licensing. At QUALCOMM, 
we have spent billions of dollars, and have continually focused on inventing 
the breakthrough technologies that have fuelled the mobile revolution, and 
enabled multiple generations of tech
nological innovations in smartphones 
and other connected devices.
 
Our industry leadership today comes from making these significant focused 
investments ahead of the industry over many years to create leading 
technology. From our inception, QUALCOMM has bee
n at the forefront of the 
industry; imaging, inventing and commercializing the fundamental 
technologies at scale that brought high
-
speed mobile data and computing to 
a global mass market reality. It is QUALCOMM, which drove the development 
of ubiquitous ce
llular connectivity in mobile computing, including increasingly 
higher data rates and spectrum efficiency, as well as more powerful and 
efficient mobile computing solutions that enable the key features and 
functions of smartphones, and which are making con

connecting billions of people to the Internet for the first time, and enabling 
countless new businesses in industries.
 
Our technology has enabled the mobile economy and the foundation for 
business models and applications of companies 
like Uber, Snapchat, 
Instagram, messaging apps like WhatsApp and iMessage, streaming services 
like Spotify, smart assistance like Siri and Google Assistant, and many 
others across the globe. Our innovations in assisted GPS have also led to 
location based s
ervices, real
-
time mapping, and navigation service on which 
hundreds of millions of people around the world now depend.
 
This mobile application revolution was enabled directly by QUALCOMM's 
business model of inventing and broadly sharing through licensing 
our key 
technologies with hundreds of companies in the mobile ecosystem. Without 
our technology, our investments and our innovation, the mobile world today 
would not be nearly as disruptive, efficient or useful. QUALCOMM led the 
industry in producing innov
ations that provide or support almost every 

 
And Apple has been among the largest beneficiaries of our efforts in 
investments by been able to easily enter the smartphone space with little to 
know investments in the co
re technology. Apple has utilized our technology 
as the foundation for becoming the most profitable smartphone supplier in 
the world. Apple's own marketing statements recognize the value 
QUALCOMM technology contributes to its products. For example, Apple 
r
ecently acknowledged that the roll
-
out of LTE networks in India will be the 
transition that unleashes the power and capability of the iPhone in India. As 
the leading innovator in 4G LTE, we agree.
 
Touching briefly on Apple's complaints filed in San Diego a
nd China, they 
claims that QUALCOMM should be required to license its cellular, standard 
essential patents for SEPs to modem suppliers, that even when licensing 
those patents at the device level, QUALCOMM should only be able to charge 
royalties on the pric
e of the cellular modem chip inside the device. These 
positions, however, are inconsistent with long
-
standing industry practice, the 
IPR policies of the relevant standard setting bodies, the realities of licensing 
large portfolios of patents, and basic not
ions of efficiency fairness and 
economics.
 
First, QUALCOMM and many other major patent holders have long
-
followed 
the practice of licensing portfolios of SEPs at the device level, including for 
3G and LTE. There has been no sudden change in the law to make
 
this 
practice improper. And it remains the most efficient and fair method of 
licensing. Second, neither QUALCOMM's licensing commitments nor panel 
requires QUALCOMM to license its SEPs at the component level, or charge 
royalties on the modem chip within a
 
smartphone.
 
There was an attempt by Apple and others to modify the IPR policy of SE, 
which governs licensing commitments for cellular SEPs to include these 
concepts. But that effort failed. Third, QUALCOMM has a vast technology 
patent portfolio that is br
oadly applicable to the technology and features 
implemented in smartphones.
 
Focusing on just our cellular SEPs, which is a subset of our overall patent 
portfolio, only a small percentage of the claims in those patents are 
implemented entirely within the ce
llular modem chip. So, even if QUALCOMM 
were to license that subset of its cellular SEPs to a modem chip supplier. The 
device supplier using that chip would still need to take a license to the 
reminder of our cellular SEPs and other patents. Engaging in li
censing at 
multiple levels create significant inefficiencies with no tangible benefits. And 

change by moving from device
-
level licensing to multi
-
level licensing at both 
the model 
chip and device levels.
 

pay higher royalties whenever they add new features that they claim have 


functions that Apple highlights. In addition, it is well
-
know that QUALCOMM 
has per unit running royalty caps as part of its licensing program. This 
effectively results in licensees not p
aying running royalties as a percentage 
of the device price above a certain net selling price of any given device.
 

device level provides the licensee with the certainty that it has
 
the rights 
needed to design, manufacture, and sell devices, regardless of which 
components within the phone, implement the patents, or whether the 
component supplier has a license for those patents. Charging royalties, as a 
percentage of the device price,
 
is fair and consistent with the fact that lower 
price devices can be used and rely upon less of the licensed technology than 
the more expensive fully featured devices.
 
The recent KFTC decision, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission compliant, 
and the filing o


business and jurisdictions around the world, and misrepresenting facts and 
withholding information.
 
Apple claims the QUAL
COMM retaliated because Apple cooperated with 
government investigations. To be clear, we did no such thing. We simply 
objected to Apple making false and misleading statements and withholding 
information to motivate a tax against QUALCOMM. We welcome the 
op



 
With respect to the KFTC decisi
on, in December, it announced that it intends 
to issue a corrective order and impose a fine. As we said last month, this is 
an unprecedented and unsupportable decision. Inconsistent with the facts in 
the law and representing a clear violation of due proces
s rights under the 
Korea U.S. pre
-
trade agreement.
 

appealing the decision and seeking a stay in the sole high court, which we 
expect will rigorously analyze evidence and apply sound antitr
ust principles. 
It should be noted that the KFTC usually takes some number of months to 
go from a post
-
hearing decision to a written final order. Here the KFTC 
completed a very lengthy written decision in less than a month time, which 
is further evidence t
he KFTC hurry to judgment without regard to the merits 
of the case.
 
With respect to the FTC complaint, filed last week, as we outlined in our 
press release, it was a split decision taken in the last days of the Obama 
administration and is very focused on A
pple, which filed its related case just 
days later. It is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support, 
and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry. It is 
also very important to note that FTC commissioner, Maureen Ohlh
ausen, 
voted against filing the complaint, and went so far as to issue a strong 
defending statement.
 
We look forward to vigorously defending our business. We have faced legal 
challenges to our business model over the years, given the powerful 
commercial in
terest that play. But there is clear evidence of vibrant 
competition across the mobile industry. And this environment is enabled by 
our broad pro
-
competitive licensing program. We expect and look forward to 
outcomes that confirm the valuable contributions 
to innovation and 
competition that our technologies bring. Apple's attack on QUALCOMM's 
business model is not only an attack on QUALCOMM, but also an attack on 
the smartphone competition that QUALCOMM's business model enables.
 
Shifting gears, as Steve note
d, QTL had a strong first fiscal quarter, as we 
continue to make very good progress signing new license agreements in 
China, including a complete resolution of our outstanding legal issues with 
Meizu. QTL revenues were $1.8 billion, up approximately 13% ye
ar
-
over
-
year, driven primarily by favorable trends in China including handset sales 
growth and licensing and compliance progress in the region, as well as 
strong growth of global sales by Chinese licensees.
 
Total reported device sales in the fiscal first q
uarter were $62.9 billion, 
above the mid
-
point of our prior guidance. And we estimate that reported 
3G/4G device shipments were 330 million units with an ASP of $189 at the 
mid
-
point. After the end of the first quarter, we completed licensing 
agreements wi
th both Gionee and Meizu, and have now completed 
agreements with all of the top 10 Chinese OEMs according to IDC.
 
To date, we have completed agreements with more than 120 manufacturers 
in China consistent with the NDRC terms. We estimate that we are now 
co
llecting royalties on approximately 80% of Chinese OEM global 3G/4G 
device sales. We remain focused on improved compliance and completing 
additional agreements, which could provide upside to our estimates.
 
Turning to global 3G/4G device shipments. For cale
ndar 2016, we estimate 
1.56 billion to 1.7 billion devices were shipped, up 8% year
-
over
-
year at the 
mid
-
point and in line with our prior forecast. For calendar 2017, we continue 
to expect approximately 7% growth year
-
over
-
year with global 3G/4G 
device shi
pments of 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices, driven by demand in 
the emerging regions. We estimate the global handset ASP in fiscal 2016 
was approximately $185, down approximately 6% year
-
over
-
year, 
consistent with our expectations and well below the 12
% decline in fiscal 
2015.
 
We continue to expect that the annual decline in the global ASP for handsets 
shipped, during fiscal 2017, will further moderate as compared to fiscal 
2016, despite FX headwinds. You may recall that a few years ago we 
forecast that
 
global handset ASP would go through a period of accelerated 
erosion for a couple of years, and then those declines would moderate 
overtime. We are seeing those trends play
-
out as we predicted.
 
We expect total reported device sales from licensees in the se
cond fiscal 
quarter to be approximately $74 billion to $82 billion, up approximately 24% 
sequentially and 11% year
-
over
-
year at the mid
-
point, driven primarily by 
the busy holiday December quarter shipment activity, and reflective of 
increased licensing an
d compliance progress.
 
In our data center business, we achieved a key milestone as we announced 

10 nanometer server processor. And early customer feedback and testing 
have been enc
ouraging. As the first in the QUALCOMM Centriq product 
family, the QUALCOMM Centriq 2400 series has up to 48 cores, and is built 
on the most advanced 10 nanometer FinFET process technology. It features 
the QUALCOMM Falkor CPU, QUALCOMM data center technolo
gies, custom 
RMVA compliance core, which is highly optimized to deliver both high 
performance and power efficiency, and designed to tackle the most common 
data center workloads.
 
In China, we also have made great progress with our data center joint 
venture,
 
which is now busy developing a customized server CPU product 
based on our technology and designs for the China market. Although, we 
have several ongoing challenges to our licensing program, we are confident 
in our positions. And we believe we will come ou
t of these challenges 
stronger as a Company in the end as we have done many times in the past.
 
That concludes my comments. And I will turn the call over to George.
 
George Davis
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal first quarter results 
we
re in line with our outlook with revenues of $6 billion, and non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share of $1.19, $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance, 
driven primarily by performance in our licensing business. In QTL, revenues 
were $1.8 billion and total reported de
vice sales by licensees were $62.9 
billion, just above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by stronger ASPs in 
developed regions. The Q1 results for QTL exclude contributions from the 
recently signed licensed agreements with Meizu and Gionee, which expect
 
to 
start benefitting 
--
 
we expect to start benefitting QTL in fiscal Q2.
 
In QCT, MSM chip shipment were 217 million, modestly above the midpoint 
of our guidance range. Overall, performance was in line with expectations 
and we had strong contributions from
 
our adjacent areas, including IoT, 

versus the first fiscal quarter of 2016, reflecting strong demand for our new 
products, growth and adjacencies, and an improved cost structure. QCT 
oper
ating margin was approximately 18% for the quarter, up more than 300 
basis points over the same period last year.
 
For the Company, non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses increased 
by less than 1% sequentially, modestly above our prior guidance. GAAP 
earni
ngs included the accrual of the KFTCs approximately $868 million fine 
announced in late December, which is excluded from our non
-
GAAP results. 
The accrual impacted fiscal first quarter GAAP EPS by $0.49 per share, and 
raised our full year GAAP estimated ta
x rate by approximately 280 basis 
points to 22%.
 
We plan to appeal this decision, but we are still required to pay the fine 
within 60 days of receiving the written order, which was received earlier this 
week. We returned $1.2 billion to stockholders in the
 
quarter in the form of 
dividend and buybacks. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, we had 
approximately $2.5 billion of our stock repurchase authorization remaining.
 
Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, our outlook 
reflects
 
the seasonally stronger December quarter, 3G/4G device shipments 
for QTL, and the seasonally lower first calendar quarter MSM shipments for 
QCT, typical for this time of year. We are not forecasting any impact to 
revenues related to the dispute with Apple
 
as we are continuing to meet 
their supply needs in good faith, and expect Apple will continue to meet its 
obligations. We have not reported any benefit to the P&L associated with 
non
-
payment of disputed amounts to
-
date or in our Q2 guidance.
 
We estimate r
evenues to be in the range of approximately $5.5 billion to 
$6.3 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 
approximately $1.15 to $1.25 per share. We anticipate fiscal second quarter 
non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up ap
proximately 6% 
to 8% or $110 million at the mid
-
point sequentially, reflecting employee 
related costs that typically begin with the new calendar year, increased QTL 
compliance initiatives, and growing investments in data center and 5G.
 
In QTL, we estimate 
total reported device sales of $74 billion to $82 billion 
will be reported by our licensees in the March quarter, for shipments they 
made in the December quarter, up approximately 24% sequentially and 11% 
year
-
over
-
year at the mid
-
point. Our financial guid
ance includes an estimate 
for some catch
-
up licensing revenue, we expect to record in the quarter, 
including some benefit related to the recently concluded license agreements 
with Gionee and Meizu.
 
In QCT, we expect MSM shipments of approximately 165 milli
on to 185 
million units lower sequentially, reflecting typical seasonal trends. Year
-
over
-
year differences also include lower modem sales, given second sourcing by a 
customer. We expect QCT revenue for MSM to be up modestly on a 
sequential basis in the sec
ond fiscal quarter on stronger product mix. We 
expect QCT's fiscal second quarter operating margin to be approximately 
10% to 12%, reflecting significant year
-
over
-
year improvement, consistent 
with the product and cost elements that drove our fiscal first 
quarter 
performance, but down sequentially on seasonality.
 
We expect to close the TDK joint venture later in this quarter, but are not 
including the expected impact in our guidance. We will update the go
-
forward implications of closing the joint venture on
 
our next earnings call.
 
Turning to our investment income, in anticipation of funding the acquisition 
of NXP, we will continue liquidating the longer duration risk assets in our 
treasury portfolio over the next couple of quarters, which we expect to result
 
in lower yields and total returns, more in line with short duration high credit 
quality portfolios. The impact of these changes will primarily be seen in the 
second half of the fiscal year. We also plan to execute a meaningful portion 
of our acquisition r
elated financing in the second half of fiscal 2017.
 
As a result, we expect the combination of lower net investment income and 
higher interest expense to impact EPS by approximately $0.15 or 
approximately $300 million before tax in the second half of 
2017 as 
compared to the levels we saw in the second half of fiscal 2016.
 
Despite recent foreign currency headwinds, we continued to estimate mid 
single
-
digit percentage growth of global 3G/4G handset sales in fiscal 2017. 
We are estimating that FX headwind
s of approximately 200 basis points 
based on current exchange rates will be partially offset by a better than 
expected outlook for global 3G/4G handset ASPs on a local currency basis.
 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John.

seasonality of the business in to the March quarter, could you talk about 


eeing in the 
Chinese market in terms of your sequential MSM shipments. And then just a 
clarification for Derek and Don, as you look at the global dispute with Apple 

ODMs, such as F
oxconn. Could you just walk us through that and maybe any 

Thank you.

think Q2 MSM unit moveme
nt is largely seasonal. I think we see seasonality 
tied to two main effects; one, I think you have build on the Chinese 
customers in anticipation of the Chinese New Year. And I think they basically 
build and bleed as related Chinese New Year sales. We also
 
saw

Q2 are dependent on timing on launching on Flagship devices within the

license with QUALCOMM today. And so the royalties on Apple products, they 
get paid to QUALCOMM or reported and paid by their contract 
manufacturers. So, although we do have a dispute now with Apple and 

contracts that we have in place with their suppliers remain valid and 
enforceable. And we would expect that our 
licensees will continue to comply 
with the terms of their agreements. And we would also hope and expect that 
Apple would not interfere with the terms of those agreements. But of course, 

 
So, I guess, a little bit that w

--
 
take a wait and 
see approach. We have no indication as we sit here today that our licensees 
will stop paying royalties. In the past, when we have had disputes with 
companies related to the royalties they own under an existin
g valid 
agreement, generally, those companies tended to report and pay royalties, 
even when we were in disputes like in arbitration. You might remember that 
was case with LG, not only have the recent arbitration with them also the 
case with Panasonic when 
we had a previous arbitration with them.
 


that we will see an impact in the second quarter or second fisca
l quarter 
from the dispute, and our guidance reflects that.

Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman 
Sachs. Please go ahead.
 
Simona Jankowski
 
Two questions for Derek. Apple claims that your NDRC rectification plan ha
s 
never been adopted or endorsed by any agency or court. And they are 
challenging your royalty rate in China, and have now taken to court there. 
So can you clarify if your new license structure in China was in fact endorsed 
or not by the NDRC? And then the
 

addressed Apple's charge that your chipset exclusivity agreement was 
evidence of abusive monopoly power. So I would love to hear your position 
there as well.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So, in China, basically the way that the NDRC 
investigation was resolved, 
QUALCOMM 
--
 
the NDRC issued an order and QUALCOMM submitted what we 
called a rectification plan. And within the rectification plan, we basically 
committed to offer a new set of licensing terms for sales for use in China 
under ou
r Chinese essential patents. And as part of that, the NDRC agreed, 
and this was main public I believe in the press release at a time that 

fully addressed the issues that were raised in 
the NDRC's order. So, 
although, I am not sure I would use the term endorsed, certainly, we believe 
the NDRC agreed that the rectification plan and the licensing terms are very 
consistent with addressing the concerns in their order.
 
Of course, since then, w

license agreements with terms that are consistent and reflective of the NDRC 
terms, and that was done under the supervision of the NDRC. So, we feel 
very confident that those terms are fair and reasonable, a
nd we think it's a 
difficult position for Apple to claim that those terms are not fair. By the way, 
we have offered those same terms to Apple we did with all our other 
licensees, and they have refused to accept them.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
With regard to your quest
ion about, so called, exclusivity deal, first of all, I 

believe we have monopoly power in the chip market or any other market, 
and nor do we have an exclusivity arrangement. We have never p
revented 
Apple or anybody else from buying from competitive chip makers. And in the 

Intel fairly recently. So, it's a mischaracterization to call it an exclusive 
dealing arrangement.
 
We have been defending that accusation in Europe for 

in the open that Apple is the one who has challenged us on this. And we will 
continue to defend it both in Europe and in thi
s case. But we are quite

that according 
--
 
I mean your understanding of the contracts that they are 
paying, the contrac
ted amounts in full? And then I guess for Derek and Don. 
How should we think about timeframes for both, for the KFTC and FTC case, 
the U.S. FTC cases, in terms of how long to go through the process of appeal 
or be a case itself here in the U. S.? And then 
Don you also just mentioned 
Europe. Where we are on that investigation, and any since of timing on 
when we may see further progress or the next steps there? Thank you very 
much.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So, on the ODM contracts, I think the point to keep in mind is th
at, again 
Apple is not a direct licensee. And we have valid and enforceable contracts in 
place with their contract manufacturers who are our licensees, and have 
been paying royalties to us under those agreements. Again, we would expect 
and hope that our li
censees will continue to comply with their agreements, 
and that Apple will not interfere with those contractual relationships that we 
have in place. And we have no indication, as we sit here today that the 
ODMs will stop paying or that Apple will interfere


As to our guidance in Q2, we believe at this point that it will not be an 
impact in terms of the revenue for QTL in Q2, which would be sales through 
the 
December quarter.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
So, with respect to, I think I guess three questions; one, timing of KFTC 
timing of the FTC and then DigiComp status. The KFTC, as Derek indicated 
earlier, has now issued its order in that case, which means that the order is
 
now effective as opposed to the press release that was issued less than a 
month ago. And we will now be able to seek an appeal at the sole High 

stay of the remedial release that wa
s ordered by the KFTC. And we are 
obviously going to pretty strong arguments with respect to their conclusions, 
and hope that that will lead to a stay. And then the appeal process can take 
quite sometime in the sole High Court, and then if necessary, subse
quent 
courts.
 
The FTC case, which was filed in District Court in the Northern District of 


needs to do is rea
d the descending statement of commissioner Ohlhausen to 
get a good sense of how we object to that, and how she did. And I 

 
We have two paths to follows. Obviously, once a new Federal Trade 
Commission is assembled, we
 
will probably go back to the full commission, 
or at least when there is a majority of more than 
--
 
at least, there are more 
than two commissioners in place. And seek a re
-
evaluation of that late 
decision to file. And hopefully we might be able to get that
 
withdrawn, if not, 
we will proceed with, as usual, defenses in the northern district and that will 
take some time obviously. With respect to DigiComp, we have two 
statements of objections, as you know, that we have been defending there, 
and I have no new 
news as to timing there. We are waiting at this point for 
the next step from DigiComp.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital 
Markets. Please go ahead.
 
Tim Long
 
Two quick ones, if I could, or maybe not quick. George, y

think your language, is no benefit to P&L impact from non
-
paid amounts. Are 
you referring to what Apple called the rebates or the payments in their 
complaint? But either way, if you can just talk about changes in contracts, it 
sounds lik
e nothing has hit the P&L yet. But where was that impacting, was 
that a COGS item in QCT, was it somehow in the QTL line? It would be 

going out, at what point, would that become a 
benefit to the QUALCOMM 
model? And then Derek, I mean, you talked a lot about this thing about just 

other major patent holders, the Nokia's and Ericsson's that I think also 
license at
 
the device level, but their rates wind
-

higher than them. So, can you just talk a little about maybe your difference 
in materiality of your patent pool relative to other players that might result 
in higher rates than the others,
 
which consider something lower to the 
FRAND? Thank you.
 
George Davis
 
So, yes, there has been no P&L benefit from the payments to
-

been held on the balance sheet as current liabilities. As you know, the 
agreements are now subject to litigation
. And so there is a limit to how 
much we can describe, where they might 
--
 
how things might be resolved in 
the future. But the amounts will remain on our balance sheet until the 

the 
resolution has reached.
 
Derek Aberle
 

contributions that QUALCOMM has made to the technology
-
first and all the 
way back to 2G, but then moving on to 3G and 4G and now on to 5G, all the 
wa
y along the path. We really have been, from our perspective, the leading 
contributor to the most valuable portions of the technology that are in those 
standards. And I think that has borne
-
out through the commercial 

iate through arms length and fair 
negotiations over the years with 250 plus licenses.
 

years old. Many of those have been renegotiated several times with the 
largest players over th
e year, and continually reaffirm the value of our 
portfolio. So, we believe our contributions, which are tend to be more 
focused on the device side and then the overall system as well, are just 
frankly more valuable than some of the other contributions tha
t we see 
across the industry. And the second piece is you have to look at the 
circumstances under which the other companies negotiated their licenses. 
Obviously, when Nokia negotiated a number of their licenses, they had a 
significant device business, and 
they bargain for cross
-
licenses from other 
patent holders, which would have been offset and help establish the value of 
their portfolio. Same is true with Ericcson.
 
So again, those companies both have made significant contributions. I am 
not doing anything
 
to suggest, otherwise. But we believe that our 
contributions have been different in kind. And again, the market has valued 
those contributions through the agreements we have negotiated over the 
years.
 
Don Rosenberg
 
I just want to add one or two points to 

--
 
primarily as he said, we 
have enormous contributions. But the point that Derek was making needs to 
be hammered home, because people get confused. He was talking about 
cross
-
licenses, like the Samsung and Nokia. As you know, we are not in the 
dev

-

dynamic in the negotiation, and people often get confused about that.
 


is lot in the record of this. Of all the losses that Apple has brought against its 


n interesting 
comparison to their claiming in terms of the portfolio that we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan. Please

Rod Hall
 

uple. One is 

the end of 2016? We understand it probably was good. Could you just 
clarify, whether that is the case and in fact this is part of normal deal 
expiration and then negot

question? Second question is on materiality of this. If they were to stop 

others have gotten around 25%. I wonder, could you guys ju
st say whether 
those calculations are in the ballpark? And if not, give us any kind of idea of 
what sort of EPS impact we might expect if they were to stop payment? And 
then I guess my last question for you is, whether you had any direct 
discussion with Fo

continue to pay, strictly based on legal agreements. Are they based also on 
some discussions that you had with them, and that have been sued after the 
suits were filed? Thank you.
 
Derek Aberle
 
Maybe I w
ill take your first and last and last question, and then maybe 

--
 
the agreements 


to assume that those 
agreements basically expired at the end of 2016. As to Foxconn, again, we 

tell you is we have no indication and we do have frequent interactions with 
our licen
sees. We have no indication at this point that Foxconn or any of our 

probably the best we can tell you at this point.
 
George Davis
 
Rod on the materiality, clearly, Apple and 
Samsung are two very large 

revenue, but that includes both chip and licensing for both. The way we 

disputes
 
in many cases and also our ongoing relevant to customers across 
their business generally provides additional coverage there. But part of why 
we have a strong balance sheet is, so that when events like this happen, we 
are able to not only sustain ourselves
 
and the investments that required but 


and under almost any circumstance.

Your next question
 
comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & 
Company. Please go ahead.
 
Timothy Arcuri
 
I guess, my question, Derek, is really what does Apple want? Because if you 
look at the effective rate that they are paying, they pay basically on
-
cause 
and they p
ay the contract 
--
 
and the contract manufacturer pays you. If you 
do some math, they are sort in the low to mid
-
200 basis points as a 

what the 4G rate that you signed in China is. So, w
hat do they want other 

 
Derek Aberle
 
Really, I mean, if you peal apart all of the arguments that Apple is making, 
as we said, we believe firmly that they are all without merit. In the end o
f 
the day, they essentially want to pay less for the technology that they are 

they wrap a lot of stuff around that, which really we think overtime, we will 
be able to clearly show 
is false. But in the end of the day, they want to get 


that we have established and our other licensees ar


 
Timothy Arcuri
 
And then I guess just as a quick follow up Derek. What is the way to think 
about to sustained royalty rate? Does this change how we should think about 
it this and particularly what's h
appening with the KFTC as well? Does that 
change the 290 basis points longer term rate that we should think about? 
Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
I think from our perspective, again, as Don mentioned, we are going to 
appeal and seek a stay of the decision in Korea. 
And in the end of the day if 
that decision even were to come into effect, it's not going to 
--
 
it does not 
invalidate the contracts that we have. It just set forward process for having 
us enter into renegotiations with some number of companies. And then if
 
we 
can't resolve that, ultimately enter into some kind of dispute resolution. But 
we believe firmly that the contracts that we have in place are complaint with 
FRAND and consistent with our obligation. So we would expect, even if we 
had to go through that
 
process that we would end up in the same place.
 
So again, as we look at all these things, also the FTC, we believe, that we 
will be able to defend against that claim hopefully more quickly rather than 
over a longer period of time. And we ultimately believ
e we will prevail into 
seeding the arguments that are being brought by Apple. So, really none of 
this affects our long
-
term view for the growth of the business, or the 2.9%

as kind of normalized rate 
over 
time.

Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein 
Research. Please go ahead.
 
Stacy Rasgon
 
I have one on Apple and then two quick operational ones. Just on Apple, the 
structure of your business, obviously, device level pri

think a good case for why it's done this way. Has this model ever actually 
gone to an actual court in front of a judge and jury? And if so when, and 

ac
tually gone in front of 
--
 
in the court. In terms of operation, we just 
--
 
recently give us feeling for how much of the TRDS guidance next quarter is 
catch
-

inventories, why are they so high? Why
 
do they go up so much into a 
quarter where chipsets are falling a lot?
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
So, Stacy, let me take your first question. Listen, as we noted in some of the 

is that roy
alty should be based on just the base band chip within the phone 
or what they refer to as small and sellable unit. But that is 
--
 
there really is 
-
-
 

of patents, such as a large p
ortfolio of standard essential patents, that that 
legal document has any application. And there are numerous examples, 
reasonable royalties being set in court cases as a percentage of the end 
product.
 
So, this is a well understood, I think, a well laid out
 

consistent with the way that, not only in QUALCOMM has licensed in our own 
industry for decades, but also virtually every other patent holder when they 
are seeking to collect royalties on their intellectual property. And I think, as 
Don 
mentioned, even when non
-
standard essential patents are asserted, 
royalties have been sought on a per unit basis far in excess of what 
QUALCOMM charges for a much larger technology contribution in the license.
 
On the question on TRDS, I think, probably you
 
have to 
--
 
the impact of the 
--
 
was that on Q2?
 
Derek Aberle
 
If you think about on in terms of the impact of catch
-
up, the overwhelming 
growth is coming from the seasonal movements, and less than a third of the 
EPS impact is related to catch
-
up, which is 
pure revenue, pure profit.
 
Steve Mollenkopf
 
I can address the inventory question. So, Stacy, I think inventory maybe 
three topics for you to think about it on the chip side. I think one is, as we 
said the Chinese New Year. So, I think given how we feel goo
d about our 

meeting customer demand with some of those products launch. The other 
thing to think about it is we had early in the year as normal with any new 
process know that we had a
s conservative planning on 10 nanometer ramp, 
we just had a little bit more parts of the predecessor in case of some of 
those things shift in into the quarter. And the last one, I think, you probably 
know there is cancellation of orders from a customer for
 
one of this, or 
flagship products, last year they got cancelled. And I think endorsing will 
flow through normal inventory levels throughout the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit 
Suisse. Please go ahead.
 
Kulbinder Garcha
 
I have a couple of questions, on the Apple situation maybe for Derek. Apple 
has put in the lawsuit that they would be withholding payments to their 
contract OEMs. Now, I know your licensees are saying that they will continue 
to pay you, wh
ether it's Honhi or whoever. But there must be a risk that that 
gets withheld from you at some point. Are you just saying that you don't see 
it right now? That's my first question. And my second question is that 
--
 
linked to Apple is that there was various
 
points in their lawsuit that seemed 
to imply that they didn't have visibility over which intellectual property they 
had indirectly licensed. And so my question is are there vast parts of your 
portfolio, which they have not licensed? And what are you doing
 
about 
maybe pursuing them? Or is that something you are considering right now? 
And my operational question, just on China, is what level of compliance that 

[indiscernible] [59.20
] in the area? Thanks.
 
Derek Aberle
 
So, let me take each one of those. On the first question, basically, what 
Apple said in its complaint was that it would withhold payment to its contract 
manufactures of an amount equal to what it claims that we owe 
them. But it 

withhold payment for all royalties going forward. They just talked about the 
amount that was in dispute. And I think George covered off already how 

ith that in our P&Ls.
 
But again on a going forward basis, these are valid and forcible contracts 
with our ODMs, there is no question there. And we would expect to get paid 

interfere wit
h those contracts. And we have no indication as we sit here that 
either party will be either of those things, meaning withhold payment or 

approach. This is a fluid situation. Comp
laint just came late last week, and 

things progress.
 
We have given Apple more than full visibility into the scope of our 
technology, and the scope of our patent portfolio. And they
 
have 
tremendous amount of information from us in terms of what we expect them 
to pay for in terms of our technology position. There is, as I said before, the 
contracts that we have today are with their contract manufactures. Those 
agreements do not includ
e licenses to all of our portfolio. But we both been 
-
-
 
we have been discussing a direct license with Apple as well, which would 
obviously include a broader portfolio license.
 
So probably not going to comment today on our legal strategy as to what we 
may o
r may not do with the patents that are unlicensed to Apple or a 
contract manufacturers, but there are some patents in our portfolio that are 
outside those agreements. I mentioned in my remarks that with the further 

n of collecting on about 80% of the 
Chinese OEM global device sales. You may remember back in February at 
the last Analyst Day, we talked about trying to get to about 75% collection 

nu
mber higher.

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Good afternoon and thank you 
for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter 
results, which were at the high end of our prior expectations. Performance 
was better than expected in QCT, driven by stronger than expected MSM 
shipments. We are pleased with our progress in QCT, and we are ent
ering 
2016 with a strong product roadmap and a clear path to revenue and margin 
improvement.
 
This performance was partially offset by delays in concluding new license 
agreements in China and share gains by Chinese OEMs that have been 
under
-
reporting royalt
ies in QTL. Despite near
-
term results, the overall QTL 
business remains strong with a healthy industry backdrop. And we are highly 
focused on taking actions to close the gap between global 3G/4G devices 
sales and total reported device sales.
 
Before we get 
to the details, I want to take a step back and review our 
progress in 2015 and key business drivers. We faced a number of challenges 
in fiscal 2015, and we've taken aggressive actions to address these 
challenges and drive meaningful change to improve perfo
rmance. At the 
same time, we are continuing to drive innovation and growth through 
investments in our core businesses and emerging growth areas.
 
First, the NDRC resolution in February was essential milestone, removing 
significant uncertainty and providing 
a framework for our licensing business 
in China going forward. Second, we executed a major increase in our capital 
return program, one of the largest in the tech sector, reducing our share 
count by 9% year over year. Third, we remained focused on addressin
g 
areas within our control, including making sure we have the right cost 
structure for the future, a corporate structure that maximizes value and will 
position us for the strategic opportunities ahead within a dynamic industry 
landscape, the appropriate ca
pital structure and level of dividends and share 
repurchases, the optimal board composition and management incentives, 
and a capital allocation plan that ensures that our investment dollars are 
spent in areas with the most promising risk adjusted returns.
 
We are on track with the strategic realignment plan announced in July, and 
we are making excellent progress on each of the initiatives. In the fourth 
quarter, we made significant progress in implementing our $1.4 billion cost 
reduction plan. We took action
 
to decrease spend in QCT and reduce 
investments outside of QCT and QTL with the recently closed sale of Vuforia 
and significant reductions in areas such as display.
 
We are on track with a review of financial and structural alternatives and 
continue to exp
ect to complete the review by the end of the calendar year. 
Our two new board members have already made valuable contributions and 
we are in the process of adding another new member to the board. We have 
also implemented changes to our executive compensati
on plans that further 
align our compensation with performance.
 
In fiscal year 2015, we remained extremely focused on driving our position 
in key adjacent areas. In August, we completed the acquisition of CSR, 
which we expect to drive meaningful growth for 
QCT in key adjacencies such 
as automotive and IoE.
 
Finally, QUALCOMM's innovation pipeline remains strong. Our technology 
and product roadmap continues to lead the industry and we are investing to 
drive the next wave of growth in mobile as well as in other
 
opportunities. We 
are excited about our latest products, including the Snapdragon 820, and 
expect momentum for these products to build through fiscal 2016 and into 
2017.
 
Before turning to the business, I want to comment on the change we've 
made to our app
roach to guidance. Going forward, we will provide quarterly 
financial guidance as we've always done but adjust our approach to annual 
guidance. We will continue to provide certain industry and financial metrics, 
but we will no longer provide guidance on to
tal company annual revenue and 
earnings per share. To help you with this transition, we will continue to 
provide certain fiscal year information for 2016 which George will detail 
shortly. This change aligns our guidance practices more closely with our 
semi
conductor and large
-
cap tech peers.
 
To be clear, we're not changing any of our long
-
term guidance metrics 
provided prior to this call. Specifically, our 20%
-
plus operating margin target 
for QCT, our 86% to 88% operating margin target for QTL, or our ongoin
g 
capital return commitments. We also continue to target a QCT operating 
margin of at least 16% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
 
In QTL, our path to growth is driven by continued strong unit growth in 
emerging regions, the replacement trends in develo
ped regions that we have 
previously explained, and the adoption of 3G/4G cellular connectivity in 
adjacent segments.
 
In China, we have been working hard to implement the NDRC licensing 
terms and improve compliance. While we have made progress with these 
ne
gotiations and concluded new agreements recently with two major 
Chinese OEMs, progress has been slower than we had originally anticipated. 
The timing of concluding new agreements and progress with compliance is 
inherently difficult to predict, but we fully
 
expect to successfully conclude 
new agreements and improve compliance over time.
 
In the near
-
term, these factors will continue to impact our ability to grow the 
licensing business in line with global 3G/4G device sales. However, as we 
work through the com
pliance and licensing matters, we expect our growth 
rate to converge with the rate of global 3G/4G device sales growth. 
Depending on the amount of catch
-
up reporting, we could exceed global 
3G/4G device sales growth for a period of time.
 
QTL remains a sour
ce of significant strength for QUALCOMM and we are 
confident in our long
-
term QTL business outlook based on continued growth 
of 3G/4G across mobile devices and new product categories, as well as our 
continued innovation in new mobile technologies.
 
Let me n
ow turn to QCT. Fiscal 2016 will be a transition year for this 
business, and we expect our performance in the second half of the year to 
be much stronger than in the first half, which will continue to be affected by 
the factors that impacted 2015. Our perf
ormance improvement will be driven 
by our strong lineup of new chipsets across tiers, benefits from our cost 
reduction efforts, operational improvements, and reduced product costs as 
we transition to the 14 nanometer node.
 
Specifically, at the premium tier
, we are seeing strong customer interest in 
Snapdragon 820 among leading OEMs with more than 60 designs overall. 
We have launched our fifth
-
generation Snapdragon X12 LTE modem, which 
offers industry leading throughput and power efficiency with support for 
all 
modes and the latest Cat 12 downlink and Cat 13 uplink capabilities. We 
have confidence in customer traction and expect it to be a significant 
product for us in the second half of the fiscal year.
 
In addition, we are upgrading our mid and low tier road
maps. We recently 
announced our new Snapdragon 430 and 617 processors which have added 
support for carrier aggregation with X7 and X8 LTE modems respectively, 
and new support for dual cameras.
 
We are also continuing to expand in adjacent areas where we can
 
build off 
our differentiated skill set and core IP roadmap in smartphones to create 
new revenue opportunities. To highlight just a few examples, in the 
networking space we launched a Wave 2 802.11ac Wi
-
Fi system
-
on
-
a
-
chip 
for routers, gateways and access 
points. We also expanded our portfolio for 
smart carrier home gateways following our acquisition of Ikanos 
Communications.
 
In the IoT space, we launched a reference design for IP cameras, new LTE 
Cat 1 and Cat
-
M modems for connected devices, and the Snapdr
agon Flight 
Reference Design for consumer drones. The IoE applications for QUALCOMM 
technologies are vast, and I believe we are just at the beginning. We also 
continue to advance our position in the compute space with three tiers of 
Snapdragon LTE modems f
or Windows 10 notebooks, 2
-
in
-
1s and tablets.
 
Further, CSR expands our distribution channels and strengthens our position 
by accelerating our time to market in the key IoE and automotive segments. 
Revenues from our adjacent business areas, automotive, mobi
le compute, 
IoE and networking delivered approximately 10% of QCT revenues in fiscal 
2015, and we expect this to grow significantly in 2016 with the addition of a 
full year of CSR revenues as well as through organic growth. We expect our 
momentum in QCT to
 
continue into fiscal 2017 and beyond.
 
As we did in both 3G and 4G, we are investing to lead the industry in the 
development of 5G technologies such as a unified air interface with 
optimized OFDM
-
based waveforms. 5G will offer native support to unlicensed 
spectrum and enhanced mobile broadband performance and enable 
connectivity for the Internet of Everything as well as new types of services 
that require lower latency and higher reliability and security. Our focus on 
5G, along with leadership in LTE advance
d and Wi
-
Fi, including Wi
-
Fi 
802.11ad in 60 gigahertz, allows us to offer integrated modem solutions that 
leverage licensed and unlicensed bands. We are enabling mobile operators 
and new wireless players such as cable companies to deploy a multitude of 
new
 
services to their subscribers.
 
We've announced LTE
-
U chipset support for small cells and mobile devices, 
and operators in the US including Verizon, AT&T and T
-
Mobile are 
commencing trials as early as this year, with some of them planning for 
initial comme
rcial deployments in 2016. We are well positioned to address 
this increasing complexity of wireless networks and bands by offering 
integrated solutions at scale and enabling rapid worldwide deployment 
capability to our partners.
 
We are confident in our lea
ding technology and multiyear roadmap and we 
are focused on improving the efficiency of our operations and taking 
advantage of the significant opportunities for growth available to us. We 
believe our business initiatives will enable QUALCOMM to drive value
 
and 
growth momentum so that we exit fiscal 2016 on an improving financial 
trajectory.
 
With that, I will turn the call over to Derek.

President
 
Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2015 was a record 
year for QTL with 
total reported device sales, revenues and earnings before 
tax all reaching record levels. We concluded the NDRC investigation and 
resolved a dispute with a major Chinese licensee. We launched a significant 
effort to implement the terms of the NDRC resoluti
on in China, including 
signing licenses for 3
-
mode devices and to improve compliance by our 
licensees.
 
Looking ahead, the outlook for global 3G/4G device sales continues to be 
strong. We expect low single digit percentage growth in global 3G/4G device 
sale
s in fiscal 2016. However, longer
-
term we expect stronger global 3G/4G 
device sales growth as unit growth continues to stay strong and annual ASP 
declines further moderate over time.
 
We estimate that global 3G/4G device shipments will grow approximately 
14
% in calendar 2015 and 10% in calendar 2016 at the midpoint, driven 
primarily by the migration to 3G/4G devices in emerging regions and cellular 
connectivity growth in adjacent segments outside of handsets.
 
We expect global 3G/4G device ASPs to decline at 
a more moderate rate in 
fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015, although still at a higher rate than we expect 
over the longer term. This outlook reflects a number of factors including 
heavier than normal discounting of high premium tier devices in the near 
term a
nd continued share gains by Chinese OEMs that are currently selling 
at lower prices than other licensees. Over the longer term, we expect ASP 
declines to moderate for a variety of reasons including OEM consolidation in 
China and increasing device ASPs by C
hinese OEMs, as well as users in 
emerging regions replacing devices at higher price points.
 
We are continuing to aggressively seek to conclude new license agreement 
with Chinese OEMs on the NDRC terms and improve compliance with 
Chinese licensees. To date 
we have offered the NDRC license terms for our 
current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents to our licensees and to a 
number of unlicensed OEMs and manufacturers. We are continuing to make 
progress with these negotiations and recently concluded new agreemen
ts 
with two major Chinese OEMs, ZTE and TCL, on terms consistent with the 
NDRC terms. This brings the total number of new China patent license 
agreements we have signed to over 60. Importantly, these agreements also 
include royalty bearing licenses for 3
-
m
ode devices.
 
While we continue to make progress in our continued interactions with the 
NDRC and other parts of the Chinese government give us confidence that we 
will be able to conclude agreements with all of the important OEMs, the 
negotiations with a han
dful of these licensees are taking longer than we 
previously expected. In some of these cases, although the licensees 
acknowledged they need to pay royalties to QUALCOMM, we believe in 
connection with the negotiations they have stopped reporting certain of
 
their 
sales and royalties or did not report their sales and royalties in a manner 
that allows us to record revenue.
 
Similar to the dispute we resolved during fiscal 2015 with a major Chinese 
OEM that resulted in a catch
-
up payment for prior period amounts
, we 
expect these licensees will report and pay the royalties they are improperly 
withholding once we conclude new license agreements with them.
 
While we continue to work to conclude new license agreements and improve 
compliance through commercial negotiat
ions and audits, we are actively 
preparing to enforce our agreements and/or take other actions against OEMs 
that are not negotiating in good faith, under
-
reporting royalties, or refusing 
to conclude agreements within a reasonable period of time. We have a 
number of tools at our disposable that can be deployed both within and 
outside of China that we believe will ultimately resolve this activity.
 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the global 3G/4G device sales were in 
line with our expectations but total
 
reported device sales for the quarter 
came in below the low end of our guidance range, primarily as a result of the 
Chinese licensees I just mentioned refusing to report royalties, slower than 
previously expected progress on signing license agreements cov
ering 3
-
mode devices, and Chinese OEMs that are either unlicensed or under
-
reporting royalties growing at a faster rate than the overall market and 
thereby gaining share. These factors resulted in approximately $200 million 
less in QTL revenue for the four
th quarter as compared to our prior 
expectations and lower than expected QTL operating margin.
 
We expect QTL operating margin be flat to down quarter over quarter in the 
first quarter of fiscal 2016 but then improve with revenue growth throughout 
the rest 
of the year. We expect the factors that impacted our fiscal 2015 
fourth quarter results will continue to impact the licensing business until we 
conclude additional license agreements with the remaining major Chinese 
OEMs and improve reporting compliance, t
he timing of which is difficult to 
predict.
 
Despite our expectation for continued progress, given this inherent 
uncertainty, we are taking a cautious approach to our QTL guidance. Under 
this scenario, total reported device sales for the first quarter of fi
scal 2016 
are expected to be in the range of $50 billion to $58 billion and fiscal year 
2016 QTL revenue is expected to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $8 billion. 
The key drivers between the low and the high end of the fiscal 2016 range 
are the timing 
of concluding new license agreements with the remaining 
major Chinese OEMs and the pace at which our efforts to improve 
compliance deliver results.
 
The $7.3 billion low end of the range assumes a meaningful year over year 
increase in the number of unreport
ed device by Chinese OEMs, little to no 
progress on signing new license agreements or amendments with Chinese 
OEMs and no significant catch
-
up amounts related to prior periods or audit 
recoveries. The $8 billion high end of the range assumes meaningful 
pro
gress in a number of these areas but does not reflect the reporting of 
royalties on the full fiscal 2016 global 3G/4G device sales or the receipt of 
catch
-
up amounts for all prior period sales.
 
It is also important to understand that we expect QTL fiscal 2
016 revenue 
growth will be impacted by the full year effect of applying the NDRC terms 
for sales in China as compared to only a partial year in 2015, and expected 
year
-
over
-
year increase in reported mix to more 3
-
mode sales as the year 
progresses and a ful
l year effect of FX headwinds.
 
We are not satisfied with the gap that exists between the global 3G/4G 
device sales and total reported device sales, and we are highly focused on 
taking actions to close that gap and collect catch
-
up payments from prior 
perio
d under
-
reporting as quickly as possible. We continue to expect QTL 
revenue to track global 3G/4G device sales growth over the longer term and 
catch
-
up payments to provide additional growth as we work through these 
issues.
 
We expect roughly similar seasona
lity in fiscal 2016 as in prior years with 
December shipments driving a stronger fiscal second quarter for QTL. 
Depending on the pace of progress in China, the implied royalty rate that 
you calculate based on the information we provide is expected to be do
wn 
modestly in fiscal 2016 as compared to where we exited fiscal 2015, based 
primarily on an increase in devices being reported under the NDRC terms, 
including 3
-
mode devices.
 
In conclusion, we continue to see favorable long
-
term market trends for our 
lice
nsing business and remain confident that we will be able to conclude new 
agreements with the remaining Chinese OEMs and improve compliance over 
time. That concludes my comments.
 
I will now turn the call over to George.

Chief Financial Off
icer & Executive Vice President
 
Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon everyone. I will begin with comments 
on our fiscal fourth quarter results, update you on our cost reduction 
initiatives, provide our first quarter guidance and then discuss some key 
metri
cs for fiscal 2016. In our fiscal fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of 
$5.5 billion and non
-
GAAP earnings per share of $0.91. In QTL, total 
reported device sales by our licensees were $58.3 billion, below the low end 
of our guidance range for the reaso
ns Derek described. QCT had a stronger 
than expected quarter with revenues of $3.6 billion and an operating margin 
of 8%. While industry trends in the quarter were mostly in line with our July 
expectations, we also saw incremental demand strength for low t
ier devices, 
particularly at a large customer. Revenue per MSM continued to reflect the 
mix shift toward modem
-
only products at a large OEM in the premium tier.
 
We closed the CSR acquisition in August, which contributed approximately 
$80 million in revenue
 
in the quarter and was marginally accretive to our 
non
-
GAAP results. Non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses were down 
2% sequentially on cost controls and spending reductions under our 
strategic realignment plan.
 
During the fiscal fourth quarter, we retu
rned $3 billion to stockholders 
including approximately $738 million of dividends paid and $2.2 billion in 
share repurchases. We also completed our $5 billion accelerated share 
repurchase program that we launched last May. Additionally, since the end 
of th
e fiscal fourth quarter, we have repurchased an additional 24.6 million 
shares for approximately $1.4 billion. During fiscal 2015, we returned over 
300% of free cash flow to our stockholders on share repurchases of $11.2 
billion and dividends of $2.9 billi
on, which included the 14% dividend 
increase we announced in March.
 
These actions represent significant progress on our SRP commitment to 
reaffirm our ongoing return of 75% of free cash flow in dividends and share 
repurchases in addition to our commitment 
of an incremental $10 billion in 
share repurchases by March of 2016. We are on track to achieve the $1.4 
billion of spending reductions related to the SRP. As a reminder, the $1.4 
billion number includes a $300 million reduction in annual employee stock 
gr
ants and a $1.1 billion, or approximately 15%, reduction in non
-
GAAP 
combined R&D and SG&A and engineering spend in cost of goods sold. This 
plan excludes the impact of acquisitions.
 
We continue to expect fiscal 2016 results to benefit from $600 million of
 
these cost reductions which represents approximately 8% of the SRP 
spending baseline. Fiscal 2015 spending came in approximately $200 million 
below the SRP baseline. This includes approximately $100 million of SRP 
cost reductions as well as lower than bas
eline variable compensation, which 
combined impacts the year
-
over
-
year comparison by approximately 2% 
relative to the baseline.
 
Including recent acquisitions, of which CSR is the largest, we expect non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense will be down approx
imately 1% to 
3% year over year. Without the acquisitions, we would be lower by 
approximately 6% to 8% year over year. Our IR website provides an 
updated overview of the SRP spending reductions, including the impact of 
acquisitions. During our fiscal fourt
h quarter, severance and others costs 
related to the plan were $190 million and were excluded from non
-
GAAP 
earnings. We continue to expect the range of charges to be $350 million to 
$450 million. And as previously discussed, our cost actions ramp througho
ut 
fiscal 2016 and are more heavily weighted to the back half of the fiscal year.
 
Let's now turn to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. We estimate 
revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.2 billion to $6 billion, up 
approximately 3% s
equentially at the midpoint. We estimate non
-
GAAP 
earnings per share in our first fiscal quarter to be approximately $0.80 to 
$0.90 per share, down 7% sequentially at the midpoint. We anticipate fiscal 
first quarter non
-
GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses 
will be up 2% to 
4% sequentially, reflecting a full quarter of CSR in our results and increased 
variable compensation accruals, partially offset by the early stage benefits of 
the SRP cost reduction program.
 
For the reasons Derek explained, we're taking a 
more cautious approach in 
providing our QTL guidance for the fiscal first quarter. In QTL, we expect 
total reported device sales for the fiscal first quarter, reflecting reports of our 
licensees for shipments they made in the September quarter, to be in th
e 
range of $50 billion to $58 billion, down approximately 7% sequentially at 
the midpoint, driven by the China impacts that Derek described as well as a 
sequential decline in the ASP, but to a lesser degree than the decline we 
experienced in the same quart
er last year.
 
In QCT for our fiscal first quarter, we expect MSM shipments will be in the 
range of approximately 225 million to 245 million units, up approximately 
16% sequentially at the midpoint, reflecting the seasonally strong fourth 
calendar quarter a
nd our view of a more normalized inventory environment. 
We expect healthy demand growth for our modems and high and mid tier 
chipsets providing support for QCT operating margins to be at 10% or 
slightly better.
 
With respect to our annual guidance, 
we're providing our outlook for global 
3G/4G adoption trends including calendar year 3G/4G unit shipments and 
fiscal year global 3G/4G device sales. We are also providing fiscal year 
guidance on operating expenses, combined interest expense and investment 
income, and tax rate.
 
We expect the industry trends we saw develop in the second half of fiscal 
2015, particularly in the premium tier, to continue to impact QCT in the first 
half of fiscal 2016. Consistent with prior years, we expect QCT's fiscal 
second q
uarter to be down sequentially with operating margins in the low to 
mid single digits, driven primarily by seasonally lower MSM shipments, 
annual pricing resets, and increased costs tied to the ramp of new products.
 
We expect improving product mix from new
 
chipset introductions, 
particularly in the second half of fiscal 2016, resulting in improved revenue 
per MSM. Combined with the benefits of our cost savings over time, this mix 
shift underpins the improvement we see in QCT's profitability in the fiscal 
fo
urth quarter. We continue to expect QCT to improve to at least a 16% 
operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016.
 
In QTL, as Derek commented, our guidance reflects the timing uncertainty in 
China inherent in signing new licensing agreements and r
esolving 
compliance issues. This scenario implies a range of QTL revenue from $7.3 
billion at the low end of the range to $8 billion, approximately flat year over 
year, at the high end of the range with progress on signing new licensing 
agreements and othe
r compliance measures the key drivers of that range.
 
Combined interest expense and investment income is expected to be lower 
by approximately $400 million year over year, with about half from interest 
expense related to higher average debt balances, and th
e other half 
reflecting lower expected realized gains on financial market conditions as 
well as lower investment balances due to our expanded return of capital 
initiatives. We estimate our non
-
GAAP fiscal 2016 tax rate to be 
approximately 19% to 20%.
 
That 
will conclude my comments, and I will now turn the call back to 
Warren.

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify a little bit more what is 
causing the hold up in the collections within QTL, especially consid
ering that 
the couple of large licensees you cited are taking the NDRC terms rather 
than your traditional more flexible terms. So it would seem like that's little 
bit more cut and dry. And then as far as what you're assuming in the 
guidance for QTL for the
 
first fiscal quarter, it sounded like you're not really 
assuming any recovery of the prior royalties even though you've just signed 
a couple of the licensees, ZTE and TCL. So I just wanted to clarify if the 
catch up for those two is included or why wouldn
't you be seeing some 
improvement just from those two alone?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
Hi, Simona. This is Derek. Yes, really in China, I think it's much of the same 
story that has been playing out through the year. We are making progress, 
as you said. W
e signed both ZTE and TCL this quarter, which I think is good 
continued traction on significant OEMs, now that's added to the list with 
Huawei that have accepted the NDRC terms. But there are a handful of still 
significant Chinese OEMs that we're continuin
g to negotiate with and as we 
noted before, these things are difficult to predict from a timing standpoint. 
And so we're going to continue to work through that and as we do, we 
expect that the picture will improve moving forward.
 
I would say the thing that
's a little bit new this time is as the negotiations 
have progressed, you have discussions around 3
-
mode licensing where the 
companies were unlicensed in the past and therefore not paying while the 
negotiation progresses, but in most other cases, licensees
 
have continued to 
report and pay on their non 3
-
mode devices, such as WCDMA devices. And 
that is a little bit different this quarter in the sense that a handful or less 
than a handful of these companies have actually, we think as a negotiating 
tactic, sto
pped reporting and paying similar to what we went through last 
year when we were dealing with the other dispute with the Chinese OEM, 
which ultimately got resolved as you may recall, with a catch
-
up payment 
coming in. So again our feeling is that in the en
d, we will get these 
agreements concluded, and when that happens, these payments will come 
in. But we are taking a cautious approach to the guidance for Q1 as well as 
the full fiscal year in QTL just because the timing of these things is 
uncertain.
 
On ZTE 
and TCL in particular, those companies were reporting royalties 
while we were negotiating those deals, so even though we signed, there will 
not be significant catch
-
up payments coming through, although there will be 
some royalties coming in on 3
-
mode. Thos
e players are not the largest 
players in the 3
-
mode space in China.

James E. Faucette

Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Sorry. It was on mute. So I just want to ask a clarifying question there, 
Derek. On Huawei, ZTE and TCL, it sounds like then whatever catch
-
ups 

 
or 
should we assume that all the catch
-
ups from those players are either quite 
small or alr
eady built into the reported numbers in the December quarter 
guide?
 
And then I wanted to ask quickly about chipset shipments, what drove the 
upside to your estimates in the December quarter? It seemed like coming 
out of the June quarter that you were conce
rned about overall channel 
inventory and you seemed to imply that came down in spite of the much 
stronger shipments. So I'm just wondering where the upside came from. 
And then finally, George, in the September quarter results and the 
December quarter outlo
ok, how much of a contribution are you getting from 
CSR for those two periods? Thanks.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
This is Derek. On the first one, actually Huawei was signed earlier in the 
year, didn't come through this quarter. And as to TCL and ZTE, the
re will be 
some catch
-
up payments that come through December, but they're 
relatively small in comparison. So you should think about the cautious Q1 
guidance as really not reflecting resolution of these pending negotiated 
agreements or any catch
-
ups that wo
uld flow through there.
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf

Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
James, this is Steve. With respect to the chipset shipments in Q4, what 
happened was really there was a broad
-
based improvement in share relative 
to expectations in that quar
ter, in particular at a large customer, our mid 
and low tier shipments were stronger than we expected. So I think we're 
exiting the fiscal year a bit stronger than we would have said we were going 
to exit in July. So we're pleased with that.

James, this is George. On CSR contribution, it was $80 million in revenue in 
the quarter. It was very modestly accretive, so if you back that out, you can 
see that we were above the midpoints of our gu
idance without consideration 
of CSR.

Thank you. Maybe just give China a break, over to the chips 
again. Two 
things on the margins here. First, could you just talk a little bit 

 
it looks to 
us like the gross margin did improve in the quarter. Was that just a mix 
thing or are we starting to see either better pricing discipline or some of the 
benefits o
f the restructuring program taking effect and could we expect that 
to continue? And then related to it, talking about $400 million in OpEx 
coming on from the acquisitions, seems a bit large. Is that a number that 
will be subject to the similar type of anal
ysis about a restructuring program 
that the rest of the QCT business went through? So in other words, is there 
opportunity to move that number lower being combined with the broader 
QUALCOMM? Thanks.
 
George S. Davis 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vic
e President
 
Hey, Tim, it's George. On gross margin, I would say it was more a function 
of mix that you were seeing in the quarter. And if I look at acquisitions, that 
includes, I should point out since we were talking about it in the context of 
the baselin
e for the strategic realignment plan that that was, includes the 
engineering spend within cost of goods sold as well. So now again, the 
majority is OpEx. We will have synergy plans and we do have synergy plans 
for both of the acquisitions that are included
 
in that, and again CSR being 
the largest. We're going to talk about our view on these acquisitions and the 
synergy plans as part of the Analyst Meeting which we expect to be in the 
first quarter, and we'll give you little more color there. So we will exec
ute on 
the synergy plans, but it is not part of the strategic realignment plan.

Great, thanks. Derek, just
 
going back to the units, can you ballpark for us 
how many units you think you weren't paid for in fiscal 2015 and where you

reported in the last one or two quarters?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-

Mike, without really getting into the units, because I don't think we have 
broken that out, if you actually look at the metrics we did give, we gave you 
a global 3G/4G device sales number for the fiscal 2015 year and the 
midpoint of that is about
 
$275 billion
-
ish, and if you look at where we rolled 
up for the reported TRDS at about $251 billion
-
ish. You can see that the gap 
there's a little more than $24 billion of TRDS for fiscal 2015. That probably 
was a little more back half weighted versus fro
nt half weighted, but the delta 
is more in the range of approximately 9%.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I ju
st want to understand, it 
seems like ASP for MSM is down. Obviously more thin modems may 
contribute to that in the December quarter. And then as you look into next 
year, if you just comment on the progress of the 820. You said customer 
acceptance, there ha
s obviously been some talk again about issues with 
that. You would think that would have a positive impact for your MSM ASPs. 
When would you expect to get a more material contribution from that 
product?

Hi, Blayne. It's George. I'll just give you the quick overview. We do think 
revenue per MSM improves throughout the year on mix. It is driven by our 
view of the premium tier improving in the second half, and first part of the 
year, we see m
uch more of a weighting of the impact on the modem on the 
business driving the mix effects in the first part of the year. Steve?

On the 820, it's looking great and the customer feedback is quite str
ong on 
it. It's going to be something that contributes in the second half of the year. 
It's certainly not going to be in the first quarter necessarily. But we have 
high hopes for that product, and you heard me say that customer traction is 
quite strong. It

Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to a
sk about the QTL 
margins. They were depressed in the September quarter and then the 
guidance on our math anyway seems to suggest that they're at least flat and 
probably down in the fiscal Q1. I wonder first of all if we got that right on the 
QTL margins. A
nd then could you comment on what those margins are likely 
to do next year? Are they likely to stay at these same depressed levels or do 
you think they bounce back as you recover more of the unreported revenue? 
Just kind of give us some idea for what the t
rajectory of that looks like. 
Thanks.
 
Derek K. Aberle

Rod, this is Derek. Yes, I think you got it right. It's really largely a revenue 
driven story. There's a little bit of the OpEx that rolls through in the current 
quarter that we wouldn't exp
ect to see again in next quarter. But you know, 
it's really a revenue story. So as the year progresses and we make progress, 
we do believe the margins will be stronger kind of as we move forward 
through the year.

Kulbinder S. Garcha

Credit Suisse Securities (
USA
) LLC (Broker)
 
Thanks. A question for Derek. Just on the QTL business, as I look at it from 
a fiscal year perspective, you're basically implying it's going to shrink. The 
overall TAM is expanding, which you talked about. And then I've got to 
assume that in fiscal year 20
16 versus 2015 you're having more of the 
under
-
reported units that were there paying you. So it should kind of grow, I 
think. So is it because the people that are under
-
reporting last year are 
gaining so much share that that's having a negative impact on t
he QTL 
revenue line? Is that one of the drivers I'm missing? Or is something 
happening to the actual royalty rate going down for some sort of mix? Can 
you just comment on, is there something wrong with that high level way of 
thinking about fiscal year 2016
 
from fiscal year 2015 numbers on the QTL 
side? Or is there any other facts I should think about? Thanks.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
Kulbinder, this is Derek. Yeah, let me try to break it down. So if you think 
about the end market, the global TRDS we expe
ct will grow kind of low 
single digit over fiscal 2015. So there will be some growth there, but not as 
strong as we saw last year. We think that that actually picks up over time as 
the ASP declines further moderate and we continue to see good unit growth. 
But in 2016 in particular, the growth is somewhat muted.
 
On top of that, you do have some headwinds facing the business and I 
mentioned them in my remarks. One is that in 2015 we had a partial year 
effect of the Chinese companies that accepted the new NDRC
 
terms, 
reporting under those terms as opposed to the old ones, which were higher. 
In 2016 we would have a full year impact of that. In addition we had some 
FX headwinds in fiscal 2015 that were really a partial year effect that we 
expect will actually be 
a full year effect in 2016. And finally we expect within 
the China market a higher mix of 3
-
mode devices, which under the NDRC 
terms come through at a lower revenue per unit, is one way to think about 
it.
 
So when you roll all that up just from a nonstructu
ral standpoint, that gives 
you a growth picture for the business. On top of that, there is obviously an 
impact from the negotiation process where these handful of licensees that 
were in negotiations with stopped reporting, and we've rolled a cautious 
appro
ach to that through our guidance. And as we make progress on those 
negotiations, we expect that to improve.
 
So if everything came together and we were able to get the remaining 
agreements done and resolve some of the other compliance issues and 
recover the
 
catch
-
ups, we would come in above the high end of our range. 
It's just that's a lot to promise within fiscal 2016, so we haven't built all of 
that upside into the guidance range.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I got to say, I'm a little confused. 
I was hoping you can clear this up for me. So it seems like you've been 
holding your outlook for t
he global market flat to even up over the last few 
quarters and yet you've been stepping what you're capturing down, which 
implies to me that your ability to get paid in China has been getting even 
worse and worse after you signed the NDRC settlement, whic
h to me just 
doesn't make a lot of sense. Why would your ability to get paid get worse 
after you settled with the government? How do you know you're not just 
underestimating the market growth itself rather than your ability to get paid 
in that market? Like
 
how can we get comfort around that?
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
Stacy, this is Derek. So listen, we have a view on the market. We think that 
that's a pretty well informed view and it is modest growth year over year, 
2015 to 2016. I think what you're seein
g in China is a picture play out that 
was not all that unexpected, meaning once the resolution happened with 
China, we had to go through the process of implementing the agreed
-
upon 
terms with our licensees, and we knew that that process would take some 
tim
e.
 
We have made a lot of progress on that. As I mentioned, we've got a 
number of agreement signed up, but there are still a handful of significant 
ones that are under negotiation. So what's played out through the course of 
this year really are a few differ
ent things. One is we have made slower than 
expected progress in these negotiations which means that we're not getting 
paid on as large amount of the 3
-
mode volume that we expected. And that's 
really a negotiating dynamic from our perspective. Once we get 
these 
agreements done, we will get paid.
 
The second is as I mentioned, more recently the handful of negotiations that 
we are involved in, we've had some of the licensees take probably a little 
more aggressive negotiating stance and start withholding paymen
ts while 
we're negotiating. We do have confidence, they acknowledge that they owe 
the royalties and that we will get paid on these once the agreements are 
concluded. But the timing of that's uncertain and so we're being cautious 
about the guidance on that.
 
Finally, if you look at the share of the Chinese OEMs worldwide, the Chinese 
OEMs have continued to gain share throughout 2015 and we believe that will 
be the case in fiscal 2016 as well. And so you essentially have a piece of the 
market that has very hig
h compliance losing share to another part of the 
market that has some compliance challenges and the issues that I just 
mentioned.
 
So that's really what's driving the gap between the end market and what's 
getting reported to us. And we believe we have a wel
l
-
thought
-
out 
aggressive plan for how to deal with that. It's just a question of when that 
will all get resolved.

Hey. Thanks for taking my question, got a couple. First for George, if you 
could outline the onshore cash position at the end of the year. And then two 
for you, Steve. In terms of the Snapdragon 820, obviously 60 design wins 
sounds impressive, but equally obviously there's a handful that really 
matter, right. So I'm trying to figure out based on your full year guidance of 
improving trend, how much of that is still business to be won versus 
business that's in hand, design wins 
on the high volume projects? And then 
also, if you could talk a little bit about 5G. You mentioned OFDMA. In terms 
of a near (49:36) interface, is there debate about that at this point? Or are 
pretty much all sides of the industry firmly aligned with OFDMA
 
at this point? 
Thanks.

Hi. This is George. In terms of onshore and offshore, we ended the year with 
$31 billion in cash, $5.3 billion of which was onshore.

On the 820, this is Steve. On the 820, I feel like we've got broad
-
based 
design wins there and we feel good about it. It's certainly a component of 
the improving trend that we think is going to play out in 2016 in QCT. There 
are
 
also a number of other products that we have upgraded that will also 
contribute to that, but on the product side, we feel good about that product, 
as I said. And I think that will be a good story as we roll through the year if 
we continue to execute. In t
erms of the timing of these products, as you 
know it continues to move throughout the year. So from everything that we 
see so far, we're pleased with how we see it.
 
On 5G, a couple things on 5G. First, when we look at 5G, we look at that as 
an area where i
t will be a continuation of 

 
we think the strength that we've 
had in 4G will also transition over to 5G. One of the reasons is that the 
anchor bands or the anchor, 5G actually uses a 4G anchor. I think there's 
pretty well 

 
a pretty good alignment at the 
physical layer on how we put 
things together. We are obviously contributing a lot on 5G. 5G compared to 
maybe 3G and 4G, there are probably fewer companies really carrying the 
load there. We're certainly one of them. And then upstream of that will be 
we th
ink a number of products that deliver on 4G and Wi
-
Fi together. And so 
from the modem perspective, I think it's going to roll out and be a pretty 
good dynamic moving forward. It will be more complex, but we think 
complexity is something that we're equipped
 
to handle and handle at scale 
for the industry.

Thank you. On QCT, if I consider your qualitative comments 
today, the worst 
seems to be over and next year will show a return to growth. The renewed 
optimism aside from the product competitiveness and the diversification, do 
you feel that you are winning back a lot of the OEMs? And also in terms of 
quantifying IoT
, is there an opportunity to take a leadership pole position in 
IoT considering the rapid growth that we should see in this segment over the 
next few years?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Mark, yeah I would agree with your charac
terization. I think this year was a 
real transition year for the structure of the QCT business. We had to change 
two things. One is we changed our cost structure. We're obviously executing 
on that and we will be throughout the fiscal year. The other one is
 
that 
we've restructured the way in which we are organized to enable us to go 
after new markets yet still leverage the same IP roadmap that we build and 
continued to develop to service smartphones and mobile.
 
And in particular in the area of IoE and such, 
it's really become an 
interesting story. I mean we have created products that from an engineering 
perspective feel like derivative products, but now they are products that 
enable us to take our modem leadership and to deliver it into new markets. I 
talked 
about a couple of our modem upgrades where we take products, we 
focus them on some of the machine
-
to
-
machine applications that exist in the 
3GPP standard, and it really opens up our ability now to sell products into 
things like Chinese white good manufactu
rers or into automobiles and 
machine
-
to
-
machine products. So I think there's a good pipeline and a good 
fan
-
out for our IP roadmap and we'll start to deliver that more and more as 
we go through fiscal year 2016, and it will be one of the reasons why we 
thi
nk we'll be on an improving trajectory as we exit the fiscal year.

Thanks very much f
or taking my question. Steve, just to return to that topic 
we were just on. Even though I think the 820 probably gives you a great 
chance to recapture some share in the market, the trend seems to be 
towards the lower end now, and where the high end does ex
ist, it seems to 
be captured or dominated largely by the iPhone right now where you don't 
have the apps processor attached. What is the risk that when we do move 
into the back half of the year, this same dynamic exists and challenges your 
ability to show t
hose improvements you're looking forward to?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Well, I think a couple of things, Alex. One is that we do participate in I think 
a broader cross
-
section of the market than just the high tier Snapdragon
 
products and that's obviously something that's helped us in Q4 right now. 
And we've also taken our cost structure and made fundamental changes to it 
really to desensitize the business to some of the concentration impacts that 
you've seen in fiscal year 20
15. Taken a lot of work from the team to do 
that. I think that will isolate or at least insulate us a bit from those things in 
the future.
 
That being said, I'll tell you I'm looking at what's happening in the industry 
and the share shifts and the design
-
in
 
momentum and it's probably a little 
bit more optimistic a view from our view looking at the customer space than 
some of the narratives that you'll hear about the products. I mean we've 
upgraded the product line from top to bottom here in the last six mont
hs 
and we're very pleased with how we're getting traction and I hope the 
market will support that as the products move forward. And we've got the 
things that we can control hopefully in the right spot as well. We're clearly 
executing on those things and we
're going to keep people up to date as to 
how we're doing.

Thank you for taking my question. Steve, foll
owing up on those line of 
questions, how do you feel about your relationship with Samsung right now 
and how broadly are you exposed to their product mix?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Well, I think we have a very good relationsh
ip with Samsung. I think also 
the relationship with Samsung is much broader than perhaps people ask us 
about. We are a strong foundry partner and foundry customer of theirs. We 
obviously have an IP arrangement as well as a product arrangement. We 
also have
 
partnerships with products that we put on our Reference Design, 
so it's a very broad relationship. And the way I would characterize it is that 
it's getting stronger versus moving the other direction. So it's good to have 
the scale and the breadth of produ
cts that we have. I think it gives us 
probably a little bit more to bring to the table when we talk to large 
multinational companies.

Hey, guys. Thanks. Just on the handset ASPs, I was wondering since you 
talked about China being a drag longer term, where do you see handsets 
ASPs exiting fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017? Thanks.
 
Derek K. Aberle 
-
 
President
 
This is Derek. Yea
h, so I think what you're seeing is the trends that we've 
talked about for some time playing out broadly in line with what we 
expected, meaning we did expect ASPs to moderate over time and if you 
look at what we're projecting to happen in fiscal 2016 as co
mpared to 2015, 
we do expect further declines, but probably at about half the rate that we 
saw in 2015. And over time we expect that that will moderate further for a 
lot of the reasons we've already explained including the fact that there will 
be further c
oncentration we think within the Chinese OEM base. And we are 
continuing to see evidence that the Chinese OEMs' ASPs are increasing over 
time to come closer in line with some of the non
-
Chinese suppliers. And 
that's a trend that we think will continue goin
g forward.
 
And then importantly, as we see more of the growth in the future coming 
from the emerging regions, we're going to get to a place, probably starting 
next year, where there's more of a replacement market in the emerging 
regions as opposed to the f
irst migration from 2G to 3G/4G. And that will 
have a moderating effect on ASP declines over time. So again, I think like I 
said, broadly in line with what we've been expecting and we'll definitely be 
updating this picture when we do our Analyst Day early 
in the next calendar 
year.

Thank you very much. In terms of the competitive environment in A6 
(59:20) as it stands now, I know that there were some struggles with the 
ASP erosion in this period and it sounds like you're going to continue that 
maybe the next too. What is 2016? I know you've got a new product 
roadmap coming out here, but if you look 
at both the emerging market 
products coming out of MediaTek and Intel, and the internal solutions which 
seem to be spreading at least to their own OEMs and Samsung, Huawei and 
Xiaomi, how does that change next year? Do these OEMs continue to use 
these prod
ucts and will they propagate out? And will 5G help you at all since 
most of that is probably RF driven more so than basebands? I'm just trying 
to get an arm around how the dynamic that's causing some of the problems 
in QCT changes in the next year or so. T
hanks.

Ed, this is Steve. I think the competitive dynamic, it's still a very competitive

strong position there. I feel goo
d about our competitive position. At the 
higher tiers and particularly in the areas where people want to have 
international launches, I think our position, it feels quite comfortable. That 
being said, there are a lot of people going after this market. It's
 
an 
attractive market, but I think it's getting harder and harder for people to 
have the breadth of technology to deliver on all of these products. But you 
know, the competitive marketplace, it's still a lot of people that want to 
enter into it. But we fee
l good about our competitive position.

Thank you. Steve, I had a question on your modem business. I'm just 
curious 
as to how much visibility do you have into your design wins, and 
based on what you see out there, how you feel about your market share in 
the high tier modem segment?
 
Steven M. Mollenkopf 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer & Director
 
Yeah, on the modem side, it's o
bviously a strength of QUALCOMM's. We tend 
to be several if not multiple generations ahead of our competitors, primarily 
on feature set, but also on maturity, geographical breadth. And those are 
important things when you're talking about dealing particular
ly with 
worldwide OEMs, and it's an area that we obviously defend very rigorously. 
The other aspect that's happening and will play out over the next couple of 
years is that the importance of having RF, the access to multiple bands, the 
ability to deliver p
roducts not only in the licensed bands but in the 
unlicensed bands will continue to become, actually will increasingly become 
more important, and those things will be table stakes by the time you get to 
5G. Now we're driving to have those things happen as 
quickly as we can.
 
In terms of visibility into design wins, I think probably the most important 
thing is we have visibility into the competitive positions of where we sit 
relative maybe to some of the competitive or the competing chipsets, and I 
think we f
eel good about those positions. That being said, we do try to 
manage our business to never take those things for granted and keep 
driving it forward, and hopefully you're hearing that tone from us on the call 
today. We're continuing to invest in what we th
ink are the things that drive 
benefit to the business, and this is certainly one of them.

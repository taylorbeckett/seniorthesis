Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Ellen. Hello, everyone. I want to say at the outset that this 
quarter, Google turned a strong performance, and this despite substantial 
currency headwinds. As we have all seen, the U.S. dollar has con
tinued to 
strengthen, which resulted in a gross negative currency impact on our 
revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter.
 
Even after the significant benefits of our hedging program, the net impact to 
our gross revenue was still $795 million. If these curre
ncy trends persist, FX 
headwinds would obviously continue to impact our results in 2015. So for 
our results now, our gross total consolidated revenue was $17.3 billion, 
growing 12% year
-
over
-
year and declining 5% quarter over quarter.
 
Without currency fluc
tuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth is 
in fact a healthy 17% year
-
over
-
year. Despite significant FX pressure, 
Google site revenue was up a healthy 14% year
-
over
-
year to $11.9 billion 
and was down 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Once again, stren
gth in mobile 
search was the key driver of growth here.
 
Network revenue was up 1% year
-
over
-
year at $3.6 billion and down 8% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, our network businesses 
includes two businesses with two different growth profile
s: our legacy 
AdSense business and our newer display and programmatic business where 
the latter continues to perform quite well.
 
This quarter, we reclassified some revenues, primarily related to double
-
click 
ad serving software from the other revenue to ne
twork revenue line. This 
reclassification increased network revenue by approximately $130 million in 
Q1 and decreased other revenue by about the same amount, or the same 
amount. The display and programmatic business, as I mentioned earlier, 
continued as al
ways to be reflected in the network line. To see the impact of 
this re
-
class on historical periods, please see the earning's slides on our IR 
website.
 
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 23% year
-
over
-
year to $1.8 billion and 
was down 2% quarter
-
over
-
quar
ter. It was driven really by year
-
over
-
year 
growth by the Play Store, offset by declines at Nexus and what I have 
mentioned the FX impact. Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 13% 
year
-
over
-
year, down 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our aggregate CPCs were 
do
wn 7% year
-
over
-
year and down 5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And on our 
monetization by property, Google sites paid clicks were up 25% year
-
over
-
year, down 3% quarter
-
over
-
 
quarter. Google sites CBCs were down 13% 
year
-
over
-
year and down 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Network paid clicks were down 12% year
-
over
-
year and up 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, and network CPCs were up 2% year
-
over
-
year and down 11% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. As you know, we don't usually break down the impact 
of the individual factors on the quarterly c
hanges in our clicks and CPCs. But 
this quarter, I want to provide more color on what's happening within our 
sites, clicks, and CPC metrics so that you can better understand the 
dynamics of the underlying businesses that drive them.
 
So many commentators ar
e incorrectly assuming that the growth trends in 
our sites, clicks, and CPCs are primarily due to difficulties monetizing search 
on Mobile, but that's in fact not the case. Remember that sites metrics 
includes clicks and revenues related to ads served and 
Google's and on 
properties, most notably, obviously, Google.com, but as well as YouTube, 
engagement ads like TrueView, where users choice not to skip an ad is 
counted as a click.
 
While over the past year, we have seen YouTube viewership claimed 
dramaticall
y both in established markets but also due to rapid expansion in 
emerging markets, and quality improvements in the TrueView ads mean that 
more users are in fact choosing not to skip them, increasing the overall ad 
view.
 
So this means that there is much hig
her volume of TrueView ads being seen, 
which has been a significant driver of year
-
over
-
year growth in numbers that 
you have seen in site's clicks. True view ads currently monetize at lower 
rates than ad clicks on Google.com, but as you know, video ads gen
erally 
reach people earlier in the purchase funnel and so across the industry, they 
tend to have a very different pricing profile than they would have on a 
typical performance search ad. Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView 
ads, growth in site clicks w
ould be lower, but still positive, and our CPCs 
would be healthy and growing year
-
over
-
year. So really, we have two 
positive stories to tell here today.
 
First, as I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing real strength in mobile 
search, and the CPCs in core 
Search business is continuing to grow year
-
over
-
year, so it's doing very well. Second, viewership in YouTube videos and 
TrueView ads are growing significantly and YouTube's contribution to our 
advertising revenue continues to grow at a strong rate year
-
ove
r
-
year. And 
we're really pleased with how the YouTube business is progressing. So that's 
the story.
 
Turning to geographic performance, you'll see in our earnings slides, which 
you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken 
dow
n our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of the world, and show the impact 
of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those 
slides for the exact calculations.
 
So despite large currency headwinds, as I mentioned, we saw solid 
performan
ce for our core Advertising business all around the world. The U.S. 
was up 11% year
-
over
-
year to $7.4 billion. The U.K. was up 6% year
-
over
-
year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 12% year
-
over
-
year. Our non
-
U.S. revenue, which 
excluding the U.K., was up 14% 
year
-
over
-
year to $8.2 billion, accounting for 47% of our total revenue. And 
in fixed FX terms, the rest of the world grew a solid 24% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Now let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion f
or 
the quarter, or 22% of total advertising revenue. Our non
-
GAAP other costs 
of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, which excludes SBC. Our non
-
GAAP 
operating expenses totaled $5.4 billion, again excluding stock
-
based 
compensation.
 
As a result, our non
-
GAAP o
perating profit was a healthy $5.7 billion, and 
non
-
GAAP operating margins, 33% in Q1. Headcount was up just over 1,800 
people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,400 full
-
time employees at Google. Our effective tax rate was 22% for
 
Q1.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was 
$157 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the 
continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more 
details on OI&E, please do refer to the sl
ides that accompany this call on the 
IR website.
 
We're pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.6 billion. CapEx for 
the quarter was $2.9 billion. This quarter, most CapEx spend was related to 
first product, production equipment, data center const
ruction and facilities, 
in that order. Clearly, our computing capacity is a strategic asset for us and 
that's why we're investing in it. But we innovate there, just like we do 
everywhere else. To give you an example, compared to five years ago, we 
can now 
deliver more than three times as much compute power for the 
same amount of power or money. Our free cash flow for the quarter was 
$3.7 billion. So once again, strong results in the core business as evidenced 
by our 17% fixed FX revenue growth this quarter,
 
and solid margin. Now I 
would like to turn it to Omid to provide you more specifics on our successful 
performance of our core and new businesses, and then we'll turn it over to 
questions. Omid?
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thank you, Patrick. Our teams turned in a gre
at performance across our 
business this quarter. I thought I would switch up our typical format a bit 
this time around. So I'll quickly share some highlights, and then I want to 
talk more about growth areas that we are really focused on, mobile and 
brandin
g.
 
Let's start with the rise of programmatic ad buying. It's an extraordinary 
change for the ads industry, and I want to point out that our investments in 
the DoubleClick platform continue to be a big positive for us. We recently 
made TrueView our skippable a
d formats on YouTube, available through our 
DoubleClick suite, and we brought Internet
-
delivered TV content to our Ad 
Exchange through M Dialogue, a company we acquired last year.
 
Google Play is also growing fast, connecting developers and content 
provider
s with more than 1 billion people on Android devices around the 
world. Developers are building thriving businesses in our platform, and in 
February, we announced that over the past 12 months, we paid more than 
$7 billion to developers. We're honored to be 
partnering with them.
 
Our partner hardware ecosystem is also doing great. LG Watch, Urbain and 
Huawei Watch recently announced new Android wear devices, and Pioneer 
launched in
-
dash car units compatible with Android auto. Also, 10 top 
computer OEMs are now
 
making more than 35 Chrome devices, available in 
38 countries, so they're great momentum for us.
 
Google for Work continues to grow at an impressive pace, thanks to the 
addition of customers like G4S, one of the world's largest private
-
sector 
employers, wh
o move 70,000 of their employees to drive for work. Working 
with our partners, we also recently launched android for work to accelerate 
the general adoption of android devices in the work place. Business is going 
great in these areas, and we continue to in
vest to capture the potential we 
see for growth.
 
Now I want to talk more about the two areas were a see a lot of opportunity 
for us. First, the shift to mobile, and then the trend of TV budgets shifting to 
digital. Mobile devices are driving the huge shift
 
in the way people consume 
media. You've heard about the trends many times. Here is our point of view. 
As we all know, consumers reach for their phones a lot, and some of these 
moments matter more than others, like when people are looking for answers 
or ma
king a decision about what to buy or do.
 
For example, more than eight in 10 smart phones users use their phone one 
to research a product decision they're about to make in a store. These 
moments include small things like looking for a movie review, and real
ly big 
decisions like researching a new home purchase or figuring out what car you 
want to buy next.
 
So people expect to get exactly what they want, when they want it. As a 
company built on intent and immediacy, that's good news for Google. Our 
job has alw
ays been to connect people with what they are looking for in the 
exact moment they are looking. Our ad products are a critical way we've 
delivered the right answers and the right moment, and it's something we do 
really well. It's often more valuable to kno
w someone is shopping for a new 
SUV than it is to know basic demographic information about them.
 
We have great opportunities in mobile with some of the most popular mobile 
apps including the Google app, YouTube, Gmail and Maps, and our great 
android platfo
rm. Search is also important to the mobile experience. We 
have re
-
tooled our search engine for mobile, providing direct answers 
enabling voice queries. It's really a delightful experience. Try opening the 
Google app and asking what's the plot of the Godfat
her movie or flip a coin. 
You will be pleasantly surprised.
 
Chrome for mobile is also a popular app with more than 400 million users 
and, of course, a large number of people use it as a primary way to search 
the web. We continue to invest in proving the mo
bile web for both users and 
developers. In the recent chrome release, we made it easier for users to add 
their favorite sites to their phones home screens and get helpful opt
-
in 
notifications from sites they visit often.
 
We've also been working to index ap
ps just as effectively as we index web 
content. We now have 30 billion links within apps indexed. And if you're 
looking for information that lives within an app that you don't have, we'll 
now begin showing links to install the app right under the searches 
all page. 
The Google app on android can also give you up
-
to
-
date 

 
can also keep you 
up
-
to
-
date by servicing information from more than 40 different apps when 
it's relevant, like Pandora music recommendations on your commute, or a 
car to request a lift whe
n you arrive at the airport.
 
We are also working very hard to make our products more accessible to the 
next billion people who are coming online. The first computing experience for 
these users won't see on a desktop machine or a laptop. They will be on a 
m
obile phone from day on one. In fact, many of them will use a mobile 
device as their only computer. We launched android one, a new family of 
high quality, low
-
cost smart phones in Indonesia and the Philippines this 
quarter, making it available in a total o
f six emerging markets.
 
We're also working to eliminate the barriers to access from connectivity 
issues. For instance, in countries like India, where a user might have a slow 
wireless connection, we can deliver a fast loading light version of search so 
the
y can get their answers quickly and pay less for data. And with the 
chrome app for android and iOS, our data compression features help reduce 
data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web. There's tremendous 
upside to these efforts, and we're in a great p
osition.
 
I'm also very excited about how we're helping marketers succeed in this 
mobile world. As I noticed earlier, we're connecting brands with the right 
people at the precise moment when it actually matters because of our 
strong, intense signals. Mobile
 
also enables us to help drive the 90% of 
commerce that still takes place off
-
line, which is a massive opportunity that 
are partners are really excited about.
 
People are searching on Google for things like near me, closest, and nearby, 
twice as much as the
y did last year. Our local inventory ads are a great way 
for businesses to drive purchases in stores right when people are looking for 
local options. We also help advertisers better measure the store visits that 
their digital ads drive, and we recently exp
anded the capabilities to 
advertisers in new countries. Our ads are also driving people to download 
apps precisely when they are looking for them.
 
Our ad mobile ad network offers great targeting and reach and is the 
foundation of our app install offerings.
 
Last month, we also introduced ad 
promotion video ads and extended app install ads to our mobile Google 
display network, which increased install volumes for early testers by an 
average of 28% without impacting cost for install. We also recently began 
test
ing sponsored search results within Google Play with a small set of users 
and developers, helping ad developers reach valuable users directly within 
the store.
 
So I am very excited about the Mobile future, and marketers are, too. Our 
pivot to mobile has gr
eat momentum and is delivering strong benefits to 
users and advertisers. I also feel very excited about the trend of video 
content and TV budgets shifting to digital. YouTube is the world's most 
popular video service on all screens, with hundreds of millio
ns of hours 
watched on YouTube every day. The place where 1 billion people come to 
watch video is a natural home for video advertising budgets. When people 
come to YouTube, they come the intent of watching video, so it's the perfect 
time to reach them with
 
a video ad, not when they are distracted by 
something else. More and more, brands are seeing the value reaching 
audiences on YouTube two, with the number of TrueView advertisers 
growing by 45% in 2014.
 
YouTube drives great results, and we can measure the 
impact. We have run 
over 6,000 brand live studies to date across some of those largest brand 
advertisers, and in studies we have run for Google preferred campaigns, we 
found that 94% of the campaigns we studied drove a significant lift an 
average of 80% in
 
ad recall. That's why we're bringing it back this year and 
expanding it to more than 10 new markets. Google Preferred is also 
attracting some of the biggest TV advertisers to YouTube. More than 30 
major brands that have never advertised on YouTube before 
signed on with 
Google preferred and saw such great results that they have continued to 
advertise with YouTube afterwards. YouTube is home to great content and 
engaged audiences, and we're seeing the natural shift of TV budgets.
 
So those are some of my obse
rvations on the trends affecting our business, 
what I'm hearing from partners and why I'm upbeat on the opportunities 
ahead. You will see a lot more at our brand cast up
-
front in Europe next 
week at the AdWords performance Summit in early May and our I/O 
d
eveloper conference in late May. We look forward to seeing you there. 
Before I go, I want to thank all the Googlers worldwide for a great quarter, 
and I want to say a special thank you to Patrick, who has been our fearless 
CEO from almost seven years and w
ho wrote one of the most heartfelt and 
awesome retirement notes I've ever seen. If you have read it, you'll know 
that he was inspired to move on after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. I've since 
then traveled to Kilimanjaro for all Googlers recommending local d
eals near 
their homes.
 
Patrick, you will be dearly missed. We wish you and your wife all the best on 
your new venture. Thank you. And, Ruth, if you are out there listening, we 
can't wait to begin working with you soon. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you
, Omid, and absolutely true for Ruth as well. Candace [ph], why 
don't you give us the instructions to turn on the Q&A?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of 
Carlos Kirjner of Bern
stein. Your line is now open.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. First, our research 
has suggested that many or maybe most mobile websites and mobile apps 
are still in pretty bad shape when it comes to user experience a
nd 
conversion. I think one can expect these to improve over time. The question 
is, is an improvement in conversion rate and experiences within mobile 
apps, where users transact good or bad for Google? One could argue that 
people are going to spend more tim
e in apps, transacting apps and not 
search. How should we think about that? Secondly, it's been more than two 
years since when we've seen the capital intensity very high. It continues to 
be quite high with $2.9 billion of CapEx. Is this the new normal? Is 
that what 
should we expect going forward? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Omid, do you want to take the first one? I'll take the second one.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Sure. Thank you, Carlos, for the question. We are actually very excited 
about improvements of 
these mobile websites. And we really are happy to 
see where we can deliver the best answers to our users whether it be 
through an app or whether we find it on the web. We're working with 
developers, webmasters, publishers really serve their content to user
s in the 
format they feel best and we also recently introduced this install app, Install 
Carousel, which is evidence of that effort. So it's really about delivering the 
right results for the users and the less friction you have there and the more 
targeted 
you are, we'll see the benefits and monetization.
 
On the other side, Carlos, on the CapEx side. We are far from surprised from 
these numbers internally. Part of our plan, we are shifting as you know, 
we've been building a lot of data centers over the last 
18 months. And so 
that is actually giving us the opportunity to put in new equipment in. And we 
are jumping on the opportunity. Thinking through the total cost of ownership 
of these things and the much more higher efficiency of these new machines. 
Having s
aid that, I won't kind of comment about future, but I just want to 
reemphasize that we are not surprised by these numbers. To us, actually, 
they make sense given our strategy. And they really fuel all the innovations 
that we have going for us. So it's an i
mportant part of our strategy. It's a 
strategic asset.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
Thank you.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thanks, Carlos, for your question. Candace, let's go to our next question, 
please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney of
 
RBC 
Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for all the additional color on the paid clicks and the 
CPCs. So just so we step back a little bit because there are many of us who 
thought it really was driven mostly by mob
ile. Is there a point to your 
assertion that these real major shifts that we've seen over the last two or 
three years in CPC pressure has really largely been driven by you YouTube 
true views in the adoption of that? Is that kind of the point you're making?
 
And if you would 

 
in the past, you always listed the factors that would 
cause the shifts in pay clicks and CPCs. Could you just check off what the 
other items are, and put them in order of priority. What's moving those two 
wheels? Take you.
 
Patrick Piche
tte
 
Yes, Mark. Thank you for your question. And in fact, that's why I made the 
comments I made today. I'm just talking about the situations as we have it 
now. I'm not looking back to prior years, I'm just saying what we have seen 
in this quarter and the la
st quarter. We're just seeing a real acceleration at 
YouTube, and that's why we thought it was important because we saw this 
change.
 
From the fundamental kind of strong performance of YouTube, both in terms 
of its coverage and in terms of the performance, 
like even the TrueView ads, 
right? We tuned these ads to make sure that people want to watch them so 
that they are very effective, and when they do, then people watch a lot more 
of them. And so over the last quarter, over the last couple of quarters, we've
 
seen the real takeoff and then the geographic expansion is kind of giving us 
a lot more coverage.
 
So it's a real positive story for YouTube, because we see it now, we're 
reporting now. So it's not a view back to the last five years at all. I just 
wanted t
o kind of clarify that. So thank you for your question.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Candace? Let's go to our next question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth of 
JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
 
D
ouglas Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the question. Omid, I was hoping you could drill down a 
little bit more on the mobile search changes that are taking place. Talk a 
little bit more about what you think the key factors are here and the key 
differences, and wh
ether that impact is an actual result of actual 
monetization. And then, Patrick, just on the margins and costs in the 
quarter, non
-
GAAP operating margin is basically flat from a year ago, so 
trying to understand how much you think that was a factor of one
-
time 
items a year ago, or a change at all in terms of your view on cost discipline 
within the business? Thanks.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thanks, Douglas. So with mobile phones really becoming such a primary 
way people search the net. Our goal is really to help peop
le search, find the 
content that's not just relevant and timely but also really easy to read and 
interact with on these smaller devices and smaller screens. And it's 
important to note that this is just one of over 200 signals we use to evaluate 
the best re
sults.
 
Non
-
mobile friendly sites won't disappear from the mobile searches. They'll 
still rank high if they hold great content that the user wants. But the lack of 
mobile friendliness is a problem for web publishers, because that is abandon 
the websites and
 
that's a real issue. So really early to speculate exactly how 
the monetization impact of these organic algorithm changes will be. But we 
always start with the user to deliver the right answer, the best answer, be it 
on the mobile web or the app. And that 
we think that ultimately that's good 
for publishers, advertisers and our users and the monetization success will 
follow.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. And so, Douglas, on my side, if you look at it, I mean, we're really 
pleased with Q1. If you look at the operat
ing profit of the company, right? 
Despite from Q4 to Q1 revenue trends that are always seasonal, we 
delivered essentially the same $5.7 billion of non
-
GAAP operating profits for 
the quarter. So we're really focused on our sequential performance rather 
than
 
what happened a year ago, and there was no real specific one
-
time 
items in this quarter. This was a pretty clean quarter. We're very happy with 
it. Thank you, Douglas for your question.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Candice, let's go to 
the next question, please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of 
Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just go back to your comments on 
splitting YouTube out from
 
the CPCs and paid clicks, you mentioned paid 
click growth would be lower excluding YouTube. Would you be willing to help 
us understand that growth rate 

 
what looks like now, what it looked like a 
year ago? And on the CPCs, you mention the search CPCs con
tinue to grow. 
Is that true even including migration into emerging markets where CPCs are 
lower and in the shift towards Mobile?
 
Omid Kordestani
 
So we don't 

 
look, I, what I wanted to do today's clarify the issue between 
YouTube and our kind of.com proper
ties rather than to go into all of the 
details. You've seen in my notes of my comments that the impact of 
TrueView and site CPCs, site CPCs would be growing, a right, if you kind of 
take out the TrueView ad impact. And I've also noted that mobile search is
 
continuing on the path of strength.
 
So from that perspective, what I wanted to make sure of is that you get the 
color that if you just exclude the great growth of YouTube, but it has very 
different kind of fundamental dynamics, that the core of what is ty
pically 
search performance both on Mobile and Desktop, the combined, is doing 
really good, and the CPCs would be growing if you take the effect out. So 
that's really what I want to make sure of, so people don't continue to hound 
on this issue. Is more abou
t mobile that has terrible monetization. In fact, 
there's a good story there, too. Thank you for your question.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of 
Macquarie. Your line is now open.
 
Ben Schachter
 
First, Patrick
, congratulations on a great run at Google and enjoy the future 
bike rides. A couple of questions. Can you talk about how you think Google 
Wallet needs to evolve to better compete with ApplePay and others? Are you 
beginning to see acquisitions in that spac
e or will it be more organic? And 
then Patrick, any updated thoughts on how Google is viewing its cash 
balances? Are you going to return some of that cash before you leave? 
Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
It's all 

 
the easy answer is really for Omid, so let him 
take that one and 
then I will talk about the cash issues.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Sure. On ApplePay, again, I think it's just really great that the industry is 
really opening up here and that the merchants, the banks, consumers, are 
all starting to experience this
. And our focus is really to bring this set of new 
APIs for payments, and call it Android Pay, and that our goal has always 
been to remove much of the friction that our users encounter today on 
everyday shopping experiences. And so we're excited about what
 
the 
industry is doing here and what the user adoption is going to be kind we're 
working with all the partners to put all the pieces together and finally create 
the momentum that we are all looking forward to benefit from.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
And on my side, 
Ben, I have no news on the cash issue. I will just reiterate 
what I've said many times, because I think that not only is it true, but it's 
important, that we do bring this issue to the attention of the audit 
community, the board; there are regular debates 
about this issue. And it's a 
balance between cash being the strategic asset and then the question that 
we ask ourselves also in our conversations and deliberations is do we have a 
pipeline of opportunities that would make us believe that we would actually 
widely invest this kind of money, and in that sense it's very clear that the 
debates we're having will continue, but we have no further updates for you 
on that issue.
 
Ben Schachter
 
Good luck in the future.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Ben. Will go to our ne
xt question, Candace.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you for the question and congratulations, Patrick. I just wanted 
to follow up on your YouTube comments earlier. You talked about the growth 
you've been seeing in particular over the last couple of quarters. I'm just 
wondering when you are talk
ing to advertisers, kind of what's changed over 
the last year or so that you really think has caused this acceleration and kind 
of click volume that you are seeing, and how do you think about that gap 
and the potential for that gap to close over time with 
what you see in just 
traditional site CPCs, if you will? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So I'll take the technical side of it, and then I will let kind of Omid give you 
more on the color of what's exciting at YouTube. Related to the question, 
and the answer I
 
gave you, the comments I gave you today, it's really about 
if you think about it, about coverage rather than the new product, because 
we've done a lot of geographic expansion of YouTube, and that in itself gives 
you a lot more volume out there in terms of
 
eyeballs.
 
And then in addition to that, we've through the great work of the team and 
the AdWords team and the YouTube team, the monetization team, making 
sure that a TrueView is a more efficient product where people, basically they 
actually do watch the e
ntire ad, and so they don't skip the four to five 
seconds. And all you need is given the scale of YouTube today, right, all you 
need is to have a product that people want more and it actually delivers a lot 
more value.
 
So in terms of advertising total reve
nue. The fact that it's at the top of the 
funnel clearly has very different dynamics than when you have a very 
specific performance based ad that is tied to very specific high
-
margin 
query. But that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly useful for advertis
ers, 
because that's where they start is at the top of the funnel. So these are all 
the pieces of the puzzle that we have going for us. And for what's really 
exciting about YouTube, I will let Omid kind of give you more color comment 
on this.
 
Omid Kordestan
i
 
Hi, Heather. First of all, I invite you to come to Grant Cast next week, I'll be 
there in New York, and you'll get a sense of the momentum in YouTube. But 
really the way we look at it is as usual, we first look at the users. One third 
of all people on th
e Internet are everyday watching, hundreds of millions of 
hours on YouTube. This is generating billions of views. And then when we 
look at our advertisers, they want to be there. So we're seeing a strong 
growth in TrueView with new advertisers. The number 
grew 45% in 2014. 
And all of the top 100 global brands have run TrueView ads over the past 
year.
 
And as they are experiencing success, for example, with Google preferred, I 
think I shared this stat earlier, but 95% of the preferred campaigns that we 
studie
d drove a significant lift, an average of 80%. And then more than 30 
brands that were new to advertising on YouTube use Google preferred, and 
then came back and continued to advertise with us afterwards. So just 
having great success.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So, H
eather, it's a good story all
-
around. We are pretty pleased by it, 
obviously. Thank you for your question. Candace, we'll go to our next 
question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of 
UBS. Your line is n
ow open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the questions, and I will echo the sentiment, congrats, 
Patrick on the decision, and best of luck going forward. My questions is more 
around mobile. I appreciate all the color around the clicks and that CPC, but 
may
be you could talk a little bit either qualitatively or quantitatively about 
the way in which mobile advertising, especially search, is evolving overtime 
and whether some of the gaps that we used to talk about one or two years 
ago are starting to close in t
erms of monetization, whether it be dictated by 
screen sizes or people getting more comfortable. Or maybe some of the 
changes you will be making around mobile search with some of the ranking 

get some 
color about how you've seen mobile evolve and how you see it evolving 
going forward. Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Sure. Let me just give you some thoughts, and thank you for this. We are 
very excited about this pivotal mobile and it's really obviously
 
a shift that 
started gradually and it's been very dramatic for us. So if you talked to 
every product manager at Google, and leader at Google, they have it at the 
forefront of their thoughts and how to delight the users, how to improve the 
experience, same
 
thing on our advertising front. I think so one is obviously 
the efforts we're doing for the discovery, the search for information, be it in 
the apps or be it on mobile web. The other aspect of this that is really going 
to help us obviously with the moneti
zation front, is the improvements in 
measurements. Measuring cross devices, measuring in
-
store sales.
 
And as you know, the end of shopping experience becomes more powerful 
because users can find this information, they can find it with local products. 
It do
esn't become just about driving leaps to online retailers, it's about 
driving traffic to off
-
line stores via mobile. And we're seeing great adoption 
from retailers, from Macy's, REI Sears. So what should really 

 
the way 
we're going to talk about this kind
 
and you're going to hear us talk more 
about this is this intent and immediacy that we're so good at, given our 
heritage in search. And we are just applying all of that knowledge and all of 
that experience we have in ads and search to improving this mobile
 
experience and how we monetize. Thank you.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thanks, Eric. Candace, our next question, please?
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Eisner [ph] . Your line 
is now open.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Yes. Can you hear me?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
We can. How are you Anthony.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Okay. How are you, Patrick? Congratulations, and best wishes on your next 
endeavors. A couple of questions. First, I want to ask about Maps and 
Waves. I mean, it seems to me like those are 
very strategic assets and 
businesses where Google has a competitive advantage.
 
So can you just talk about the progress and user experiences with Maps and 
the opportunity going forward for the contribution to the business from those 
platforms? And then seco
ndly, Patrick, given your telecom background, can 
you just please describe for us the strategy around Project Five that was 
announced this week? How does that connect back to the other Google 
Access initiatives like Google Fiber? And maybe just talk about 
the longer
-
term vision there. Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. Do you want to jump in first?
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Yes, sure. This is Omid. Thank you for the question. On Maps, we absolutely 
agree with you 

 
very strategic, very popular, and that there are 
more than 
1 billion active users of the Google Map services. We've mapped the world, 
as you know, 200 countries and territories, including North Korea. 1 billion 
times the app has been downloaded on android and lots and lots of stats to 
go through. I think
 
one of the things we're doing is not only to improve that 
experience and integrate it as much as it make sense throughout the 
services, and whenever users can take advantage of the signals and the 
proper response from Google.
 
But the other side of this is
 
also partnering. One of the things we're really 
actively doing is partnering on our Map service in native formats with as 
many partners out there that can take advantage of it. So it's a scenario 
we're really investing in, we are very excited about it and
 
we have great 
traction, and we're also happy to offer it to our partners, and you will see us 
both in terms of Maps and Waves, you'll see it getting integrated in other 
popular web services out there.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. On my side, look, there's quit
e a different rationale if you think of 
Fiber versus Access, which is really kind of asset
-
based. We've just, as a 
reminder to some of our 

 
you may have heard 

 
we just announced Fiber 
yesterday, so it's still very early days. It's focus on innovating and
 
conductivity and communications but in ""partnership"" with carriers in the 
U.S., hardware makers. And we are trying to see again from users 
perspective and from a service perspective with or without assets what 
should look like the next wave of innovation.
 
So we've always, if you're always looking to make the web faster, cheaper, 
more available, and we wanted to try this new vision, this new idea of fast 
and easy wireless service, and then work with the ecosystem of our carriers, 
so that's why we have T
-
Mob
ile and Sprint as well as large carriers and 
manufacturers and developers to develop this kind of new product, new and 
innovative service. So, different in the sense that Anthony and in the case of 
Fiber or in the case of Loon it's really asset
-
based. This
 
one is really about 
services and how can we use today's platforms to actually just drive for 
more innovation?
 
So that's really the difference, but we're pretty excited. It will be interesting 
to see the take rate and it will be interesting to see how the 
market 
response is to it. But again, very much as usual, kind of focused on 
innovation, focused on pushing the envelope. Thanks for your question.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Cool. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephe
n Ju of 
Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Patrick, bon voyage and best of luck with everything. So I'm trying to get 
some sense of the direction of costs involved in running YouTube? Granted, 
there's the revenue share component, the content 
owners, but then there's 
the everyday operating costs involved in just running the business like 
engineers, bandwidth, et cetera. So I'm wondering at this point what part of 
YouTube's cost base is variable and what part is fixed, because it seems like 
your
 
revenue is now large enough to cover the costs to serve your users and 
the cost in the aggregate is probably not growing as rapidly as revenue.
 
And additionally, even as we adjust for the reclassification, I guess, of the 
double
-
click to network, the Elea
nor line decelerated a bit more than we 
saw, so I'm just wondering if this just due to Play indexing higher against 
those countries, in spite of the highest amount of FX headwinds, or did you 
have some sort of hardware shortage issue this quarter also? Tha
nks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay. So let's start with the last one first, and then I'll come back to 
YouTube. On other revenues, what you have in there is, yes, you're right 
that we have the reclass, and then on the two other factors, clearly Play is 
going reall
y well, but it is also hit by quite strong headwinds. So we are very 
pleased with the performance of Play, but given that it has not quite a large 
international SKU, it also kind of gets hit by headwinds of FX as well.
 
And then on the hardware side, no sho
rtage this quarter so no shortage 
issues versus fixed so that's been performing quite well. But again, when 
you look at year
-
over
-
year comparisons for hardware, then last year, we 
had the new Nexus Seven tablet that was quite popular. Are you have quite 
a 
bit of noise on comparisons year
-
over
-
year. And that's really so you have 
the combination of these three things are flowing through the line. So that's 
why you end up with that kind of performance.
 
But what's most important is FX adjusted, we continue to b
e very, very 
pleased with the Play, the Play growth. On YouTube, I would interestingly, I 
mean, obviously, we don't divulge any of the details of what's fixed and was 
variable, and any of this. What I can tell you is we actually monitor the 
performance of 
YouTube for its profitability to make sure that it continues to 
grow profitably, and we basically kind of manage with Susan to reinvest at 
the right pace, if you will. So fueling the growth where it is showing up and 
keeping tight in areas where we need mo
re efficiencies.
 
So that's where we managed again 

 
I've said this in the past and I will say 
it again 

 
if you just want to make YouTube profitable to more users, very 
easy, right? You put on the brakes on growth, and then it just turns into a 
profitable 
business. We continue to work with attention where Susan has the 
carrot of, hey, as much profitability as I can generate, I can reinvest at a 
certain base, so it creates a great incentive for this growth and disciplined 
behavior that we have there. So we a
re pretty pleased by it. Thank you so 
much for your question, Steven. Candace?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of 
Deutsche Bank. Your line's open.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. I just had two quick follow
-
ups from the la
st question, and then one 
for Nikesh. So, Patrick, on the operating margin question, so given the 
increased discipline you talked about last call, do you think this flat margin is 
sustainable in 2015 and if not, what would cause it to drop back down year
-
o
n
-
year? And then from the prior question, so this new Other Revenue line 
was up like 23% in the quarter. I think it was like 19% or 20% last quarter. 
So surprising that the acceleration is in there given the FX trends. Can you 
just talk about is that Googl
e Play or is that hardware between those two? 
And then for Nikesh, there has been some talk of Google introducing custom 
audience products for AdWords? Is that something you're willing to talk 
about and how big of a targeting future like that could be in t
erms of 
improving our lives and increasing spend and search?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay. So, Ross, on my side, two points. One is on the issue of margin, you 
know we don't give guidance. So I can pronounce myself for the rest of 
2015. But I think that in Q1, yo
u see a good example of what we talked 
about when we had those comments in Q4, which is we drive for that right 
balance. That right balance of you want to fuel as much as possible 
responsibly, the growth of we have the areas where we want to invest, and 
in
 
other areas, right, we may decide we're actually torque for efficiencies all 
the time.
 
And you see that in our Q1 results. In fact, I didn't mention it, but just a 
note on the head count. The vast majority of head count for Q1 is in fact 
engineers and pro
ject managers. It's not G&A. It's not sales. It's really 
focused on engineering, because that's what we wanted to put the 
emphasis. So I'm using this is an example of even though the numbers are 
large in a number of areas, there is actually a lot of scienc
e applied to every 
one of these numbers to make sure that we continue to drive for high 
efficiencies as much as we can.
 
You may have heard that in Q1, we canceled another program that we had, 
which was the Helpouts. So this program did not prove the 
promises that we 
had for it, and so we actually repurposed the team and shut down the entire 
initiative. So again, I'm just giving a signal that this is disciplined 
organization that looks at the facts that actually when it's not working, 
people can sense 
it, and then we have a good conversation about it, and 
then on the other side when we really see something kind of really going 
well, we want to make sure that we push hard for it.
 
In the case of the second piece that you've asked, which was the growth in 
Other Revenue, I think Play is doing very well. We are very happy about 
that. And yes, we're having good results on the Nexus Six, but year
-
over
-
year, it wasn't as strong as it would have given the strength of the Nexus 
Seven last year, so that's really be
en the big driver. And as for Nikesh, 
Nikesh I heard, is on his way to India right now. He was on a plane, but I 
have Omid here who would be delighted to answer your question.
 
Ross Sandler
 

 
Omid Kordestani
 
That's all right. No pr
oblem.
 
Ross Sandler
 
We all do that.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
People confuse us and Nikesh is at Soft right now. So, let's see, on these 
rumors about custom audiences. You know we are very much focused on 
completing the cycle of better targeting and measurement attr
ibution, at all 
points of the funnel with our different products. We are not announcing any 
new products at this point, but we have a great number of targeting options 
interest intent location across all the services from performance to brand. 
And I think 
you will see us innovate here, and continue to innovate here. So 
thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Ross . And I didn't mean to pick on you. We all tripped over on 
occasion all the time. Easiest...
 
Ross Sandler
 
Write down the cash on my notes. Sorry ab
out that.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
No worries. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with 
Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
 
Peter Stabler
 
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking t
he question. Patrick, thanks for all the 
color around the click information. It begs another question now, and given 
the frequency with which a lot of us misinterpret these numbers, and given 
the growing importance of brand advertising and the accompanying
 
expansion of attribution and ROI modeling to measure impact beyond simple 
clicks. Wondering if these metrics have outlived their usefulness and weather 
you guys are considering a way to help us understand your success behind 
brand advertising going forwar
d? Thanks very much.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Well, look, we look at this on a regular basis. I mean, we just happen to see 
on the YouTube side so much change in the last kind of couple of quarters 
that we thought it was worth mentioning. I think it's served as we
ll, and if 
we ever decide to look at different ways to look at the business and want to 
report it that way, we will let you know. For now, we have really no 
difference in changes in the way that we reported. So that's the short 
answer, Peter.
 
Peter Stabler
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I think we have time for one last question. So why don't we take one last 
question before we close to call, Candace?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our last question come from the line of Mark May of Citi. 
Your line is now open.
 
Mark May
 
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. There's a few out there that consumer 
behavior is different on mobile versus desktop in terms of search and web 
usage versus apps. I'm wondering are you seeing that from your users as 
they shift from 
Desktop to mobile devices? I guess in that sense, is the 
growth in Mobile search activity offsetting the weakness that you may be 
seeing in desktop search? And then second question is just on verticals, by 
advertiser verticals. We had heard some data point
s during the quarter 
around potentially some weakness in the e
-
commerce category. Just 
wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe some verticals where 
you saw a particular strength and weakness? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Sure. Thank you, Mark, for
 
the question. So let me just take the vertical one 
first in terms of performance. We definitely saw automotive and travel were 
stronger verticals this quarter. India was a strong performer as far as the 
geo goes for us. And those are really some of the ar
eas that I could 
highlight. And I think in terms of this behavior change, we are really, really 
focused on studying it every day. I mean, the shift is very, very dramatic 
and that we are laser focused on being as good and relevant and fast and 
monetize wel
l. All the things that we did on the desktop and continue to do 
on a desktop to do that on mobile.
 
So I think all I can say on that is that your right, behaviors are different. 
There's an immediacy having this device always with you, using it as your 
assis
tant, using your voice to make commands and getting results, using the 
maps and being in a moment of purchase decision. And as we rely on this 
information source to help you, so all of those things are really, really 
powerful, and we are very excited about
 
it. It's a journey that we're all on 
and looking forward to doing a better job and to monetizing well.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
So thank you, Mark, for your question. Before I close, let me just kind of 10 
seconds. First, Ruth will join us in about a month. We're 
really excited to 
have her. I will be here to help her in transition, but you will hear a much 
better voice in Q2 on the earnings call. So we're really looking forward to 
having her as part of the team. It, obviously, has been a delight to work at 
Google f
or the last seven years. I have kind of obviously three thanks, three 
huge thanks for that. First one is to the Google community, as Omid 
mentioned. All of these Googlers kind of are simply extraordinary individuals 
and people. These men and women, I mean,
 
they just continue to develop 
the stream of innovation that is really changing the world and making it a 
better place. So it's been a real joy to work with every one of them.
 
My colleagues, I mean around this table. The IR team, as well as the 
executive g
roup that I've kind of spent many, many hours over the years, 
and they're mostly friends now so thank you for your friendship and all of 
your warmth over the last few years.
 
And finally, you. I mean, the financial community, our shareholders. I mean, 
you'v
e been kind of supportive, you've been probing, you've had the 
insights, you've been really with us, I mean, for the last seven years through 
kind of thick and thin as we've seen a lot of stuff come and go, and really a 
strong supporter for this a bit craz
y, unconventional company. So I just need 
to thank you as well for all the great times together. With that, yes, I am 
going to grab my backpack and take off for the world. So you may see me 
somewhere in the world, and if you do, just please do stop and say
 
hi. It'll 
be a delight to see you.
 
So with that, I'll let Candace close the call. Thank you so much, and we'll see 
you or Ruth will see you in Q2. Cheers.

Thanks, Ellen.
 
We had a fantastic 2017 with total revenues of $110.9 billion, up 23
% over 
2016 and operating income of $28.9 billion up 22% year
-
on
-
year excluding 
the EC fine. Our momentum reflects the relentless focus on users, 
advertisers and enterprise customers as well as the benefits of our 
commitment to long
-
term investing.
 
For the
 
fourth quarter, revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year
-
on
-
year. 
The ongoing very strong performance in sites revenue in particular reflects 
the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth with mobile search 
again leading the way. Healthy growth
 
in network revenues was again led by 
our programmatic business. Substantial growth in other revenues, mainly 
hardware, cloud and Play continues to highlight the benefits of our 
investments.
 

a consolidated 
basis for Alphabet, focusing on year

over
-
year changes. In order to facilitate 

the tax affected line items, excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation 
enacte
d at the end of 2017. You can see the components in our earnings 
press release.
 
Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. I will then 
conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product 
highlights, after which we wi
ll take your questions.

related expenses, 
specifically, costs associated with our data 
centers and other operations 
including depreciation, hardware

year, in 
particular
, reflecting an increase in marketing spend, given the holiday 
season. Stock

based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the 
end of the quarter was 80,110, up 2,009 people from last quarter. As in 
prior quarters, the majority of new hires were en
gineers and product 
managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions 
were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent 
with the priority we place on this business.
 
Operating income was $7.7 billion, up 1
5% versus last year, and the 
operating margin was 24%. Other income and expense was $354 million. 
We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press 
release.
 
Our provision for income taxes on a reported basis includes $9.9 billion f
or 
items associated with the U.S. tax legislation, resulting in a reported net loss 
of $3 billion and loss per diluted share of $4.35. Excluding the impact of the 
U.S. tax legislation, our effective tax rate was 15%. Our net income was 
$6.8 billion and ear
nings per diluted share were $9.70.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $4.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion with free cash flow of 
$6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities
 
of 
approximately $102 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $31.9 billion, up 24% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter,
 
up 24% year
-
over
-
year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid 
growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
 
Network revenues were $5 billion, up 13% year
-
on
-
year, reflecting the 
ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Othe
r revenues for Google 
were $4.7 billion, up 38% year
-
over
-
year, fueled by hardware, cloud and 
Play. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a 
sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You 
can find the de
tails in our earnings press release.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.5 billion or 24% of total advertising 
revenues and up 33% year
-
over
-
year. The increase in sites TAC as a 
percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of 
net
work revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth 
areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
 
Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year
-
over
-
year, reflecting primarily an increase in the 
sites TAC rate, which was 
modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The 
increase in the sites TAC rate year
-
over
-
year was driven by changes in 
partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher 
TAC becaus
e more mobile searches are channeled through paid access 
points. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year
-
over
-
year 
continues to be the shift to programmatic which carries higher TAC.
 

-
based compensation totaled $1.7 billion f
or the year, up 1% 
year
-
over
-
year. Operating income was $8.8 billion, up 11% versus last year 
and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 
billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data 
center const
ruction.
 

-
year 
2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets 
over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls. Results for the 
quarter are in 
our earnings release.
 
For the full
-
year 2017, Other Bets revenues were $1.2 billion, up 49% 
versus 2016, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss 
was $3.4 billion for the full
-
year 2017 versus an operating loss of $3.6 billion 
in 2016
. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $507 million, down from $1.4 billion 

with our progress across Other Bets.
 
A couple of updates. Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the 
four
th quarter across an expanded family of products in energy, safety and 
security. In 2017, Nest products also became available in 12 new countries, 
more than double the number in 2016. Verily wrapped up its first field study 
seeking to reduce the transmissi
on of the diseases through mosquitoes with 
positive results. And just last week, Onduo, a joint venture between Verily 
and Sanofi began a limited commercial launch of its diabetes management 
platform.
 
At Waymo, progress is accelerating. For example, Waymo 
surpassed 4 
million miles of driving in the real world, taking only six months to achieve 
the last million miles compared to that 18 months for our first million miles. 
And in November, Waymo announced that it is the only company to have a 
fleet of driverl
ess cars on public roads that are completely autonomous 

 
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer term 
outlook. Our 23% revenue growth in 2017 was powered in particular by the 
ongoing extraordinar
y performance of our sites business. Both mobile and 
desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to 
innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to 
enhance the user and advertiser experience.
 

ly emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in 
our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of 
growth within Google over the medium and long
-
term which includes the 
rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google, cloud, hardware and
 

enterprise offering and an expanded go
-
to
-
market team, bringing our 
advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning 
to more customers. And we are ple
ased with the momentum in our 
hardware business in 2017, driven by an expansion in both our product line 
and geographic availability. Finally, as we look further into the future for our 
third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer term potentia
l for 
our Other Bets businesses.
 
Overall, operating income was up 22% year
-
over
-
year in 2017, excluding 
the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the 
rate operating income growth quarter
-
to
-
quarter. Within cost of revenues, 
the
 
biggest component is traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong 
revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries 
higher TAC than our desktop business. While we expect sites TAC to 
continue to increase as a percentage of sites 
revenue, reflecting ongoing 
strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year
-
over
-
year 
growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first 
quarter of 2018.
 
Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in ord
er to optimize the 

-
term growth. As I discussed on last 

in particular supporting hardware but also across cloud and YouTube. For 
2018, we r
emain excited about the investments we are making to drive the 
next phase of growth in our big bets in Google in cloud, hardware and 
YouTube, and our machine learning efforts which are powering innovation 
across our businesses.
 
You will see us continue to 
support our priority areas with increased 
headcount which will remain concentrated in R&D. With the closing of our 


ed the 
transition to a single annual compensation cycle for employees with a full 
year equity refresh grant to employees in the first quarter of 2018. Our 
biannual grant to SVPs will also occur in the first quarter and you will see the 
combined step up in 
our first quarter results. For our Other Bets in 2018, we 
will continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate 
to their individual execution path.
 
Finally, our framework for capital allocation is unchanged from our prior 
discussions.
 
The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic 
growth in the business. We are excited about the significant opportunities 

then layer in a sensitivity analysis regardin
g potential M&A as well as CapEx, 
in particular computing infrastructure, to support the needs of these growing 
businesses. The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute 
power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across
 

YouTube businesses. This framework further considers complimentary uses 
such as the share repurchase. After taking these potential investments into 
account, our Board has decided t
o extend our share repurchase program up 
to an additional 8.6 billion of Class C capital stock.
 
In conclusion, 2017 was another great year and we are very excited about 
the opportunities ahead. I will now turn it over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Ruth.
 

20 years since Google was founded. A lot has changed but our mission 

useful remains the best guide f
or the next 10 years.
 

foundation for the next decade as we pivot to an AI first company, powering 
the next generation of Google products like the Google Assistant. And we 
have been making su
bstantial investments in our three biggest bets, cloud, 
YouTube and hardware. These bets have enormous potential and already 

sharing some of the exciting progress in these three big 
bets.
 
First, Google Cloud. Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and 


Cloud Platform, based
 
on publicly reported data for the 12 months ending 
December 2017, is the fastest growing major public cloud provider in the 
world.
 
We are also increasingly doing larger, more strategic deals with customers. 
In fact, the number of deals worth over a $1 mil
lion across all cloud products 
more than tripled from 2016 to 2017. The strength of our products and the 
value of working with Google is increasingly clear to partners and customers.
 
In the fourth quarter, we forged new and deepened existing partnerships 
w
ith industry leaders including Cisco for open hybrid enrollments, Salesforce 
for customer insights and productivity, and SAP for AI and data insights 
across their products. These collaborations span our entire company from 
engineering integration to market
ing programs to joint sales, and they cover 
Google Cloud Platform, G Suite and Google Analytics.
 
We also saw accelerating customer traction on our wins [ph] included global 
brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, then to Dentsu Aegis Network Aegis 
Network, Keller W
illiams, Mattel and Tyco Retail Solutions. And underscoring 
the increasing importance of Google Cloud to the enterprise, we surpassed 
another new milestone, 4 million paying customers on G Suite.
 
Next, YouTube. Every month more than 1.5 billion people come
 
to YouTube 
to watch their favorite content on channels ranging from the Ellen Show 
which has more than 22 million subscribers to the NBA with over 8 million 
subscribers to SciShow, a really popular educational channel with more than 
4.5 million subscriber
s. In fact, there are over 1 billion learning related video 
views everyday on YouTube. I learned that this week.
 
With all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key 
part of their TV viewing experience. For Tuesday night State of the U
nion, 
more partners used YouTube to live stream the address than ever before, 
generating 5 million live views. And just yesterday, we announced a 

the exclusive home to watch all lo
cally televised English language matches in 
addition to their original programming and content. YouTube TV is now also 
available on Roku.
 
There is great momentum around the world with localized versions of 
YouTube now in 90 countries in 80 different langua
ges. Just this morning, 
we announced that we are expanding the popular YouTube Go app to over 
130 countries around the globe. The app has great data usage transparency 
and controls built in, which is especially useful for people living in regions 
with limi
ted connectivity. In the fourth quarter, we also strengthened our 
relationship with the music industry, signing new licensing deals with Sony 
Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. We also partnered with 
Ticketmaster to help fans by tickets to see 
their favorite artists perform live.
 
Third, our growing hardware business. Our Made by Google hardware 
products were very popular this holiday season. Device shipments in the 
fourth quarter have more than doubled year
-
over
-
year. Our retail partners 
also sa
w strong performance. Our devices are available in stores like Best 

Google devices for the home like the Google Home, Mini, Max and 
Chromecast. In the last year, we have sold tens 
of millions of these devices 
and counting.
 
I want to call out the great work of our marketing and design teams. Our 
hardware is beautiful individually and as a family, and people love 
discovering the unique features like the built
-
in Google Assistant. Earl
ier this 
week, we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to 
drive even more innovation in the years to come.
 
Turning to our efforts in machine learning. Our AI research and innovation 
leads the world. Our mission to better organ

been transformed by these technologies with our Search products and the 
Google Assistant at the heart. There is great momentum around the Google 

on 
more than 400 million devices including speakers like Google Home as 
well as Android phones and tablets, iPhones, headphones, televisions, 
watches and more. People love to use the Assistant on all these devices. 
There was a lot of excitement around the Goo
gle Assistant at CES from 
partners and consumers where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like 
smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo as well as Android Auto 
which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, 
Hyundai and 
Volvo.
 

photography. The Pixel 2 phone is the leader in video rankings by industry 
standards, with smoother and clearer videos, thanks to machine learning 
and our video stabilization technique
. And Google Photos continues to grow 

and videos were uploaded to Google Photos. More broadly, we want 
everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs. We 
recently ga
ve Google Cloud customers, access to AutoML which makes it far 
easier to build complex new enrollments. Since it launched a few weeks ago, 
over 10,000 customers have already signed up to try it.
 

sing platforms. 
First, Android. To provide a better, more tailored experience for our next 
billion users, we made Android Oreo Go edition available for our device 
partners. This year, we expect to see Go devices from dozens of 
manufacturers and with great 
support from mobile operators and app 

smartphones to many more people for the first time.
 
Google Play is also growing well. Just last week, we introduced audiobooks, 
so you can no
w catch up on your favorite books any time on multiple 
devices. And in Latin America, number of unique monthly buyers on Google 
Play grew by over 50% year
-
over
-
year in 2017. Chromebooks also continue 
to gain momentum and traction. Third
-
party research tell
s us that fourth 
quarter sales of consumer Chromebooks in the U.S. grew by over 70% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Moving to our advertising platforms which help large and small businesses. 
As shoppers turned to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, 
Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products 
and find the best deals. We redesigned the mobile shopping experience on 
Google, brining more product information to the forefront like reviews and 
ratings. We are also making the pay
ments experience simpler, safer and 
more consistent. We brought our payments efforts together as a new Google 
Pay, which shoppers can use to pay online, in stores and across Google 
products like Chrome and the Play Store. Companies like Airbnb and 
Instacar
t are using Google Pay to speedup mobile checkout. And 
HotelTonight found that customers using Google Pay are 65% more likely to 
complete their bookings.
 
We also have really strong momentum in app promotion ads. The majority of 
our app promotion campaigns 
are now using Universal App campaigns which 
is part of our focus on simplifying the advertiser experience.
 
Additionally, we introduced a new playable ad format in Google Play that 
allows users to sample games before they install. Ads in Google Play are 
per
forming really well for developers. And our app promotion business on 
YouTube is flourishing. We launched major initiatives such as store visit 
measurement and location
-
based ad formats to drive online to offline 
commerce. We are focused on making sure You
Tube is a great place for 
users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular 
content.
 
In addition to the significant work we are doing to product users and stop 
abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to 
advertis
ing on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual 
reviews for all videos in Google Preferred and simpler controls for marketers. 
The feedback we have received from advertisers and creators so far has 
been really positive.
 
So, as you can 


proud that as Google grows, we are making significant contributions to our 
partners, the economy and our local communities.
 
Our business continues to benefit our partners around the world. This 
includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators, who we 
share revenue with. Over the last four years, our partners have earned over 

are working on new ways to drive even 
more value to our partners. In the U.S. specifically, we have offices and data 
centers across 21 states and we plan to hire thousands of people across the 
U.S. this year.
 
Last year in the U.S., we grew faster outside t
he Bay Area than in the Bay 
Area. To support this growth, we will be making significant investments in 
offices across nine states including Colorado and Michigan. We will also be 
building or opening five big new data centers in the U.S. And with digital 
sk
ills and high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will 
have job seekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help 
them succeed. Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we are 
creating an IT support certification program 
that will give thousands of 
people scholarships and job opportunities. More than 10,000 people have 
already signed up, which is amazing.
 
I want to thank all our employees, Google users, partners and advertisers 


us this year.
 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric 
Sheridan of 
UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, one for Sundar and one for 
Ruth. Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google 
Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on
 
the blog 
post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in 

next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is 
sustained? And then, Ruth, l
ooking at cost of goods sold that came in quite a 
bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping one
-
time charge, if we 
have it right, versus the year
-
ago period. Maybe you could talk a little bit 
about some of the pressures in cost of goods sold that we
re either seasonal 
or maybe a new normal in terms of higher level, going forward? Any color 
there would be really appreciated.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the Google Assistant and Google Home we are very excited about the 
momentum we saw in CES. It actually reflects 

while. Google Assistant in some ways brings together all the technology 

Google Search as well.
 
We are also thinking about our capabilities broadly beyond
 
just one device 


always built ecosystems, be it Android or Chrome or Chromebooks. We work 
with many, many part
ners and scale up things, right. And so we are 
leveraging those best practices and trying to build this in a way in which the 
entire ecosystem can ship products with the Google Assistant and generate 
value. So, I think the framework is great, and long
-
term
, our investments in 
AI will directly manifest its capabilities for users through the Google 

 
Ruth Porat
 
And then, in terms of gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix. 
And as you know well, the TAC rate fo
r each of sites network as a 

strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so 
carry higher TAC. But, as I indicated in my opening comments, we do 
estimate tha
t the year
-
on
-
year increase in the sites TAC rate will slow after 
the first quarter of 2018. And then, the other thing to note, other cost of 
revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the 
number of products and the Made by Goo
gle family as well as continuing to 
expand geographically in western Europe and APAC, you can see that 
reflected here.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your 
line is now open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Two quick questions, o
ne for Ruth, and Sundar. I guess, Ruth, just to follow 
up on your comments there, the partner agreements which you just cited.. 
Is there any color you could give us on how these typically work? And what I 
mean by that is are they typically multiyear deals 
on average? And how do 
we think about these impacting the rate of change in TAC, since you are 
talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it in year two if 
these are multiyear deals? And then, for Sundar, I guess, I wanted to follow 
up a 
little bit with what we saw at CES. But, how do you think about voice? 
And given the significant number of devices in the market, how do you think 
in the future about traffic acquisition strategies on these devices, as you look 
five years down the road? Is
 
there any reason to think that the strategies 
might be different that you are going to follow as you look ahead, than what 

 
Ruth Porat
 
So, on your first question, there is not muc

to add there. I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search 
business, this does continue to be relevant, as you look forward, given 

reflec
ted changes and partnership agreement. So, all factors considered, we 
expect the year
-
on
-


strong position in a rapidly growi
ng market and that momentum does 
continue. I guess, the only other thing to add is that Q4 TAC as a percentage 
of revenue does benefit from the fact that the fourth quarter is a seasonally 
strong quarter for YouTube. So, quarter
-
on
-
quarter changes are less
 

much more to add there. Pass it to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And Heather on voice, we are very excited by voice. We obviously see it 
being adopted strongly in countries like 

of just mobile search queries in general. And things like Google Assistant 
and doing Google Home kind of really accelerates the trend. But, we 
definitely see more multimodality. So, as you saw, we also announced many
 
smart displays at CES. And I think that will be an exciting trend as well. So, 
we will bet on all of that. In general, I think about 
--
 
we want to be there for 
users when they need us and we want to serve everyone. This is why we 
work across the ecosystem
, we do first party devices, we do it globally, and 
so, we are committed to doing that well. So, I think, it will be an extension 
of how we have approached search from day one and trying to serve 

 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line 
is now open.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking 
about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year. So, I 
was hoping 
Ruth, you could just talk to us more about the timing for that 
business and how we should think about the economic model there, as you 
move to operations and deployment phase. And then, secondly, the cash 
now obviously much more accessible in terms of what
 
is held overseas, 
could you just talk more about your plans there? Obviously, the bigger 
buyback there but still not meaningful in terms of the overall size of the 
company.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So, first on Waymo, we do remain very excited about the opportuni
ty 
with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts, in particular the 


-
driving TAC reached a major milestone, b
ecoming the only company to have 
a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous. 
And that builds on our more than 4 million test miles driven in the real world 

-
drivin
g I should 
say, 10,000 miles every day with billions of miles in simulation and robust 
testing at our private facilities. So, to your question, we do continue to 

including ride sharin
g and personal use vehicles, logistics, deliveries and 
working with cities to help them address public transportation objectives. 
That being said, our first commercial application is the ride service that we 
will launch in 2018 that would be open to member
s of the public in Phoenix 
and riders will be able to use the Waymo app to have one of our fully driving 
--
 
self
-
driving cars without a driver at the wheel. So, we are very excited 
about that.
 
And then, in terms of cash, I think the main point as we think 
about it is 
there is no change in our approach to our capital allocation framework. 

-
term investing. We talked a lot 
about that already on this call and our framework has been therefore very 
consistent. The priority, 
the first use is organic, it is investing in the many 
opportunities that we have. And the second is strategic. And we do remain 
active with smaller M&A deals, in particular to support our cloud business 
and hardware. The HTC deal which we just closed is a 
good example of that. 
Third is CapEx. So, we continue to invest in machines to support growth we 
see across Google but in particular supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and 
all that we are doing in machine learning. And then, finally that leads to 
return on 

--
 
have the Board extend share repurchase program which we announced a 
couple of years ago. And we will let you determine what that number 

a modest increase to what we 
have been doing previously.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line 
is now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two. The first one, Ruth, you called out desktop search, I think the 
second straight
 
quarter as being relatively strong. Could you just talk about 
some of the drivers of the strength in desktop? And how do you think about 
the sustainability of continued strong desktop growth in the 2018 and 
beyond? The second one kind of a question on sea
rch query volume. There 
is often speculation and question marks around how consumer behavior is 
changing in ecommerce and weather Google is still capturing as many 
ecommerce searches. Could you just talk to what you are seeing in retail 
search query volume
s and search user growth within ecommerce in the 
United States?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Overall, look, we 
--
 
obviously Search is very broad. And even when you talk 
about commercial thing, we serve across many, many categories including 
things like from travel to hot
els and to services to products and so on. So, 
we are very, very comprehensive. And obviously, ecommerce is evolving a 
lot and we continue to invest there. Google shopping is doing well. And we 
work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, 
which is why 
I said [ph] they were also Search and Assistant we partner with companies 
like Walmart for example to make it much easier to buy products and so on. 
So, we invested a lot there. You are right, consumer behavior is changing 
but we are comfortab
le given the breadth of how we do things and how we 
are focused on user experience there.
 
Ruth Porat
 


that our team goes through and the way they look at innovation, really 
stepping back and recognizing that the way we all use smartphones and 
desktop is continuing to evolve. So, therefore, there is utility and challenging 
assumptions about evolving user be
havior and advertiser preferences, and 
that opens new lines of inquiry which benefits not just mobile but also 
desktop. And desktop did deliver solid revenue growth. It does remain an 
important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning 
va
cations or assessing insurance options. And we are pleased with the 

just view it as yet another valuable form factor and are really pleased with 
the performance there.
 
Operator
 
An
d our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Thanks for taking my questions. One for Sundar and for Ruth. Sundar, on 
YouTube, you mentioned that 1.5 billion people come to YouTube. Any other 
information you can give us 
there on user growth or engagement trends 
would be great, anything on time spent, I mean particularly as YouTube 
becomes more mature and mobile video particularly in North America gets 
more competitive. And then, also on YouTube, anything around new 
produc
ts or features driving the monetization or ad business? And then, 
Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth 
quarter. I think you said that the 4Q was significantly elevated. Should we 
interpret that to mean that the growth rate i

Look, on YouTube, we are continuing to see great momentum. Maybe one 

YouTube on TV, people actually want watching YouTube on the big 
screen, 
our growth has been significant there. And so, increasingly people use 
YouTube for

we see it being used to across every possible use case. And I 
said it earlier in the call. Every day, we get over a 1 billion user on 
educational content alone. P
eople use it to go, catch upon sports, music, 
entertainment. And so, you can think about the breadth of

historically, 
YouTube has been very strong on mobile and continues to strong on mobile. 

. Our growth last 
year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments 
like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now grow well

beyond mobile, 
especially in the leaving room. So, a lot of momentum there.

And then, in terms of sal
es and marketing, as I said, it particularly 
supported hardware but was also supporting Cloud and YouTube. And as 

and we are investing to support growth in the business. The elevate
d levels 
this quarter did reflect both seasonality and strategic decision to invest in 
these brands. And so, view it as a very important part of the overall 

supporting the brand and 
the momentum therefore going into 2018, but this 
is very specific product focus as well.

Good question. I was just in Europe last week, it was exciting to be there. 
There is clearly momentum we feel in terms of 
how Europe is doing. And we

First, Sundar, your comments on Google Cloud were upbeat. And I wonder 
how much of the momentum there is related to machine learning capabilities 
offered as service. If you could frame just how important that is for the 
cl
oud business overall? And then, as a follow
-
up on Google Home or the 
voice
-
based assistant. If there is any update in how you are thinking about 
monetization from a transactional perspective, transactional model with 
perhaps retail partners or do you see a
n ad
-
based model emerging there as 
well?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the first thing calling on cloud, particularly last quarter, we obviously 
brought AutoML to our Google Cloud customers. To me that shows the rate 

 
just a year ago, I 
remember reviewing with the team and they first showed me the AutoML 

And to turn it back around and to provide it for everyone in the world, I 
think that shows th
e power of what we can do with Google Cloud and get our 
state
-
of
-
the
-
art and get it to everyone.
 
I think the momentum there obviously is due to our strength in machine 
learning, the kind of open agile development environment we provide 
security, and then t
he combination with G Suite. But above all, I think what 
--
 

--
 

itself was built on a cloud platform. But where the momentum is really 

t of effort to make 
sure we are enterprise scale ready. So, now we can handle any type of 
enterprise, any kind of regulatory complexity, security complexity and so on. 

customers who 
are very large across
-
the
-

driving a lot of momentum there.
 
On your question on Google Home and voice
-
based assistant and how we 
are thinking about monetization. There are a lot of interesting ideas 
internally. So, teams 
are excited about trying new things. We see a lot of 

user experience. We are really getting started. I think these are going to be 
powerful technologies. But, there are areas whe
re we clearly feel all of us fall 
short for doing right by users and getting their expectations

One for Sundar and one for Ruth, both on YouTube. So, first question was as 
Google Preferred kicks up a little heat on types of qualities that makes the 
cut for your videos. Do you feel you h
ave to take a more active stance and 
looking at what is in Google Preferred 
--
 
sorry YouTube Preferred and how 
are you going to go about that? And then for Ruth, the past year was one 
where we heard a lot about brand safety. And I wonder when you look back
 
at the YouTube results in 2017, is there any noticeable signs of maybe a 
shift in ad spending from some of the brands who were making those 
complaints? So, those are my questions.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

ly want to 
make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and 
advertisers because it supports content creators. And we took a lot of steps 
last year but particularly in December we adopted a new rigorous approach. 

re stringent standard for creators. For example, they 
need 1,000 subscribers to be eligible for monetization. We are manually 
reviewing Google Preferred videos. We obviously use machine learning to 
support that a lot and they both go hand in hand. We have 
provided 
improved controls for marketers and we are also working with trusted third 

to make sure all of this works well. And so, while there have been concerns 
but we are working 
really hard to address them and respond strongly. And 

-
term opportunity here and I think we 
are setting ourselves up well for the years ahead.

Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Wells Fargo Securities. Yo
ur line 
is now open.
 
Ken Sena
 
So, just a question, searches seem to be coming more qualified through 
travel as far as filtering the price that people want to pay, locations, 
amenities et cetera. Is there any trend that goes along with that in terms of 
mayb
e depressing search volume growth to some extent because of the 
more filtered aspect? And then, secondly, does the higher qualification trend 
tie in at all to the shifts towards programmatic and in terms of other parties 
that might be involved or the discu
ssion that we had around TAC? And then, 
maybe two, just as a follow
-
up, if you can provide just a little bit more color 
on Google Pay in terms of what might be different in this round versus 
previous attempts?
 
Sundar Pichai
 

stood all the specifics there. But, at a high 
level, as people are on the go, they are travelling et cetera, if anything, I 
think search is more invaluable than ever before. All the work we do in local 
searches applies incredibly when you travel, the prope
rties we have like 
Google Maps et cetera, go along with it. So, overall, I think they all add up 
to a better user experience and hence a better opportunity for us. Google 
Pay turns out to be an important part of all of this. As we move from just 
answers to
 
helping users complete actions about time including transactions, 
the ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it and which is 
why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as 
possible is a big part of our long
-
term st
rategy.

The next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now 
open.
 
Stephen Ju
 
So, Sundar, I think Ruth cited hardware in the prepared remarks as the 
largest contributor in the fourth quarter for the other revenue line. As 
you 
look at the roadmap going forward, you acquired the HTC engineers to bring 
that team in
-
house. So, looks like for the first time you have an integrated 
hardware and software team under one roof. So, how do you think your 
product development pace and st
rategy will change for smartphones and 
other devices going forward? And also, does it make sense to bring the Nest 
team to be more integrated into core Google as well given the drive to 
increase the touch points for all the Google products to other form fa
ctors?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
You are right that part of the reason we are so excited about being able to 
bring this world
-
class team in
-
house is while we have been working together 
already, we have had to straddle a company boundary to do that. But now, 
having them as Googlers, will r
eally make that integrated development, 
which is so critical for us to do it better. We bring a unique approach to 
hardware, the combination of AI plus software plus hardware. So, being able 
to get those teams working together, I think would really drive t
he pace 
forward. And the best example of that is you see the advances we have 
made with both still and video photography on our phones. And the Nest 
team is very, very closely aligned with the Google hardware team. They 
work hard to realize a lot of synerg
ies there. We already shared a lot of our 
go
-
to

market efforts. And we increasingly are collaborating on product 

possibilities there as well.

year as far as coverage or ad formats? So, I would love to hear your 
thoughts on search innovation pipeline as 
you look at the 2018 and key 
growth drivers going forward? And then, Ruth, in the prepared remarks, 
there was a lot of comments on investment in your medium

term business 

wondering if you 
view 2018 upcoming as an investment year or kind of more 
of the same of what we have seen over the last couple of years?
 
Sundar Pichai
 

think, we think about user journeys. So, a lot 
of the innovation that we are 
doing has gone on to not just an individual query and how we respond but 
how we think about what our user is trying to accomplish over a series of 
successions. Are you trying to plan a trip and how do we do it better; do you 
h
ave a health

related area where you are trying to learn more about it, and 

specific format but understanding context better and bringing you that 
information through a journey. And I

information and act on it. And so, maybe you found something and yo

And that we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support

Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Ellen. In the first quarter, total revenues of $36.3 billion were up 
17% year
-
on
-
year and up 19% in constant currency, following a strong 
2018. Once again our results were driv
en by ongoing strength in mobile 
search, along with important contributions from YouTube, followed by Cloud.
 

consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year
-
over
-
year changes. I 
will 
then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we will include 
with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, 
after which we will take your questions.
 

ncial 
performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $36.3 billion reflect a 
negative currency impact year
-
over
-
year of $1.2 billion or $1 billion after the 
impact of our hedging program.
 
With respect to Alphabet revenues by geography, U.S. revenues we
re $16.5 
billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year. EMEA revenues were $11.8 billion, up 13% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 16% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of 
the euro and the British pound.
 
APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 27% versus last year and up 31% in
 
constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakness of the Australian dollar 
and the Indian rupee.
 
Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 10% year
-
over
-
year and up 
21% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakening of the Brazilian 
real 
and Argentine peso.
 
Turning to profitability, in our earnings press release, we provide a table to 
highlight the impact of the year European Commission fine on operating 
income, net income and EPS results in the first quarter. I will comment on 
resu lts bo
th with and without the impact of the fine as I review the results.
 
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will 
discuss in the Google segment results, were $16 billion, up 19% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a consol
idated basis was $9.2 billion, up 
27% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by Google related expenses. The 
biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other 
operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs 
primari
ly for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but 
also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube 
TV, which have higher TAC as a percentage of revenues.
 
Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine were $
13.7 billion. 
Excluding the impact of the fine, operating expenses were $12 billion, up 
20% year
-
over
-
year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses with 
headcount growth in Cloud as the largest driver. Growth in sales and 
marketing expenses primarily refl
ects additions to headcount. Growth in G&A 
expenses is primarily due to legal matters, including the effect of a legal 
settlement gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the 
quarter
 
was 103,459 up 4,688 from last quarter. Consistent with prior 
quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. 
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in 
Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
 
Operat
ing income was $6.6 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine 
operating income was $8.3 billion, up 9% versus last year for an operating 
margin of 23%.
 
Other income and expense was $1.5 billion. As I trust most of you are 
aware, in 2018 this line item w
as meaningfully elevated because of the 
introduction of a new accounting standard that requires recognition of 
unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. We provide more detail on 
the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
 
Our effecti
ve tax rate was 18.3% for the first quarter reflecting a sizable 
impact from the non
-
deductibility of the EC fine.
 
Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.50. 
Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and 
e
arnings per diluted share were $11.90.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $4.6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. 
Operating cash flow was $12 billion, with free cash flow of $7.4 billion. 
We 
ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately 
$113 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $36.2 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, 
Google Sites revenues were $25.7 billion in the quarter, 
up 17% year
-
over
-
year.
 
In terms of dollar growth results were led again by mobile search, with a 
strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network 
revenues were $5 billion up 8% y
ear
-
on
-
year, continuing to reflect the 
performance of the primary drivers of growth AdMob followed by Google Ad 
Manager.
 
Other revenues for Google were $5.4 billion, up 25% year
-
over
-
year fueled 
by Cloud and Play and partially offset by hardware. Google Cl
oud Platform 
remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet with strong 
customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and 
data analytics products. Strong growth in Play was driven particularly by 
performance in APAC.
 
Hardwa
re results reflect lower year
-
on
-
year sales of Pixel, reflecting in part 
heavy promotional activity industry
-
wide, given some of the recent 
pressures in the premium smartphone market. We provide monetization 
metrics in our earnings press release to give yo
u a sense of the price and 
volume dynamics of our Advertising businesses.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.9 billion or 22% of total Advertising 
revenues and up 9% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
Advertising revenues was down 
year
-
over
-
year, reflecting a favorable 
revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, as well as a decrease in the 
Network TAC rate.
 
The Sites TAC rate was flat year
-
over
-
year, as the impact of the ongoing 
shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC was offset by 
the growth in TAC 
free Sites revenue primarily from YouTube. In Q1, the Network TAC rate 
declined year
-
on
-
year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift.
 
Google stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 
13% year
-
over
-
year, oper
ating income was $9.3 billion, up 11% versus last 
year and the operating margin was 25.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter 
was $4.5 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, servers and office 
facilities.
 
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. 
Revenues were $170 million 
primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $868 million. 
Other Bets accrued CapEx was $59 million.
 
Key recent accomplishments include, Waymo recently announced that it will 
expand its activities in Michigan, open
ing a facility into Detroit that will be 
the first factory dedicated to the production of L4 autonomous vehicles.
 
Last week, there were exciting announcements from two traditional Other 
Bets that were originally incubated within X. Loon announced a long
-
te
rm 
strategic relationship to advance the use of high altitude vehicles to deliver 

$125 million in Loon.
 
Wing became the first drone delivery company to receive air carrier 
certifica
tion from the FAA, an important step toward beginning a commercial 
service delivering goods from local businesses to homes in the U.S.
 
Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer term 
outlook. As we highlighted on our last call, there 
was a significant swing 
year
-
over
-
year in the impact of currency movements on our results this 
quarter, from a big tailwind in the first quarter of 2018 to a headwind in 
2019.
 
These affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our 
expens
es are in the U.S. Based on the continued strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar relative to key currencies, we expect to continue to headwind to our 
revenues and operating income again in the second quarter.
 
In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to 
Sites revenues, as we 
indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can 
have an impact on year
-
on
-
year growth rates. We will continue to make 
changes with a focus on the long
-
term best interest of users and advertisers.
 
We remain co
nfident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the 
advertiser and user experience through our ongoing commitment to product 
innovation, in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads 
products and properties.
 
Turning to the key drivers 
of growth and other revenues. We are pleased 
with the momentum of Google Cloud platform, with balanced growth of both 
new customers and expansion within existing customers driving revenue 
growth.
 
With respect to hardware results, while the first quarter re
sults reflect 
pressures in the premium smartphone industry, we are pleased with the 
ongoing momentum for Assistant
-
enabled Home devices, particularly the 
Home hub and Mini devices and look forward to our May 7th management at 
I/O from the hardware team.
 
Tu
rning to profitability, with regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results 
once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long
-
term. 
You can see that in R&D where we continue to invest in technical talent for 
priority areas like Cloud, s
earch and machine learning.
 
In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a 
timing shift in spend and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second 
quarter. In Other Bets OpEx, we are still early in the life of these companies
 
and do plan to continue to invest meaningfully for the long
-
term 
opportunity.
 
With respect to CapEx, the year
-
on
-
year decline reflects the purchase of a 
building in New York in the first quarter of 2018. As discussed on our call 
last quarter, while we ant
icipate that our full year CapEx investments will 
exceed those in 2018, the growth in investments should be at a 
meaningfully lower rate than in 2018. We continue to expect a sizable 
investment in both compute requirements to support long
-
term growth, as 
w
ell as in office facilities.
 
In conclusion, we feel confident about the opportunities ahead and we 
continue to invest thoughtfully for the long
-
term.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

1 was a very busy quarter 


Conference Google I/O next week and our advertising summit Google 
Marketing Live later
 
in the month. You will hear a lot more from each of 
these teams throughout May, so I hope you can join us.
 

-
term willing to make 

su
cceed as technology continues to evolve. You saw this in the transition to 
mobile computing years ago and we are seeing that today in the shift to AI.
 
We feel very positive about the enormous opportunities ahead involving 
search and assistant, capturing ne
w ad budgets, cloud computing, AI and 

people, businesses and society in countless ways through our products.
 
Today, I will start by talking about our core mission of making informa
tion 
universally accessible and useful, then I will provide an update on our 
computing video and advertising platforms, and finally, I will discuss our 
hardware and cloud efforts.
 
First, an update in our mission to make information accessible and useful is
 
helping people every day. A big focus for us is building products that are 
designed to help people in their day
-
to
-
day lives.
 
Our Duplex technology within Google Assistant can now help you easily book 
a table at your favorite restaurant on all Android and
 
iOS devices in 44 U.S. 
states. Just tell the Assistant where you want to go and when and it will do 
the rest.
 
We have also began testing AI walking navigation in Google Maps, which 

r
elative to the surroundings as you are walking.
 
Just last week, we announced an improved job search experience in the 
U.S., that helps people easily discover quality remote jobs, allowing them to 
work right from home. As part of our Google news initiative,
 
we kicked off 
the local experiments project, working with local publishers to uncover new 
approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue 
bringing great local content to the readers.
 
AI is now spurring a new era of computing, whic
h is more predictive and 
more assistive. We are committed to doing deep research and working to 
advance the space in a responsible way. AI is deeply embedded in our 
products, from Search to Photos to Google Home and we are also expanding 

 
build on our advancements.
 

TensorFlow 2.0, making it easier than ever to build an UCML through 
improvements like TensorFlow Privacy, which helps train models with 
differential privacy, 

 

tremendous momentum across the Android ecosystem and our other 
computing platforms as we head into Google I/O. In the first quarter we 
released 
the beta of Android Q, which brings added privacy protections, new 
tools for developers to engage users and more.
 
Android Go Edition, an optimized version of Android tailored for smartphones 
with one gig or less delivers a powerful fast and secure experien
ce, 
specifically optimized for entry level smartphones. Today roughly 70% of 

Core.
 
We are seeing great momentum in Android Auto as well. At the Chicago Auto 
Show, Toyota announced tha
t it will include Android Auto in upcoming 
vehicles starting in 2020. That means all of the top 10 carmakers now 
support Android Auto, and in Google Play, first
-
time buyers grew by nearly 
50% year
-
over
-
year. I am very pleased with how these platforms are 
g
rowing and creating amazing experiences for users, developers and 
partners.
 
Our newest platform Stadia, which revolutionizes the way gamers access 

infrastructure and open ecosystem appr
oach. With Stadia, you will be able to 
play advanced AAA games on any type of screen instantly without ever 
needing to download the game or install updates. The reception from 
gamers in the industry has been incredible and we look forward to sharing 
more w
hen it launches later this year.
 

one example, earlier this year YouTube announced changes that reduce 
recommendations of content that comes close to violating our guidelines or 
that misinforms in harmful ways. There are a lot more improvements, which 
we will be rolling out in the next few weeks and our work is ongoing.
 
We have also expanded the content offering, availability and the 
functionality on some of our newer YouTube expe
riences. YouTube TV is now 
available nationwide with many new networks and channels added in Q1.
 
YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are now available in 43 countries up 
from five markets at the start of 2018. In mid
-
March, we launched YouTube 
Music in India

YouTube Music app has been downloaded more than 15 million times in the 
country.
 

continues to grow and support our creators. 
In Q1, we again saw how 
YouTube is the go
-
to destination for watching Super Bowl ads before, during 
and after the big game. This year viewership of Super Bowl ads on YouTube 
during the game grows by nearly 60%.
 
More broadly, across our Ads business, our ad
vertising product team led by 
Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers, with more than 
100 enhancements introduced every quarter. We do rigorous testing on each 
of these improvements to ensure that we are creating the best experience 
for use
rs and advertisers.
 
Our focus has always been on investing for the long
-
term rather than 
managing for results quarter
-
to
-
quarter. I feel really positive about the 
opportunities ahead and the innovations that we are bring to marketers, 
many of which are pow
ered by machine learning.
 
Philip on our business teams had done a great job helping advertisers take 
full advantage of these new capabilities. For instance, more than 70% of our 
advertisers are already using automated bit strategies and Google Ads and 
thes
e MO powered technologies help customers get better results for their 
investments.
 
In Q1, we began testing new shoppable ad units and Google Images so 
brands can highlight multiple products available for sale in sponsored image 
results. You have also seen 
us make it easy for people to buy products and 
take action when shopping on Google Assistant and search with a universal 
cart on mobile, desktop and Google Home devices. Since we launched these 
capabilities a year ago, the number of participating merchants
 
has increased 
sevenfold.
 
Lastly, at the Game Developers Conference, we introduce a host of the 
advertising solutions for developers, like app campaigns for engagement, 

properties.
 
Ne
xt, I will give an update on our hardware and Cloud efforts. First 
hardware, I am very proud that in only a few short years, we have built a 
strong foundation in hardware. For example, demand for our Google Home 
family of products remain strong, especially
 
the Home Mini and Home Hub. 
The breadth and depth of our product lines across Pixel, Nest and Home is 
amazing and you will see us continue to develop this incredible lineup.
 
The team has also done a lot of work to scale our operations and we will 
continue
 
to optimize our distribution, branding and points of business. We 
also announced the new campus and engineering hub in Taiwan, largely to 
support our hardware efforts.
 
Not only our features like Night Sight in Pixel winning industry awards, but 
Net Promot
er Scores tell us that many people who use our hardware 
products truly love them, which is particularly important as we move into 
this new era of computing. We are still early in our hardware journey and 
when I look ahead of the portfolio that we have crea
ted across Pixel Home 
and Nest, I feel really good about the range of products that we have.
 
And finally, our growing Cloud business. Thomas has really hit the ground 
running. Just a few weeks ago, I was on stage with him at our Cloud Next 
event, where we 
hosted a sold
-
out crowd of more than 30,000 attendees.
 
As I said at Next, moving to the Cloud should be simple and seamless. I was 
excited to announce and toss, which give customers a very elegant solution 
to both hybrid cloud and multi
-
cloud in a single t
echnology stack. The early 
feedback from analysts, customers and partners has been a really great.
 
We also announced innovations across many of our other products that 
enabled developers to build and deploy AI, help enterprises to better secure 
their data,
 
allow Android users to leverage their phones as a security key 
and much more.
 
We are also deeply committed to becoming the most customer
-
centric Cloud 
provider for enterprise customers and making it easier for companies to do 
business with us. Thanks to n
ew contracting, pricing and more.
 

largest retailers and more than half of the 10 largest companies and 
manufacturing, financial services, communications and software use Google 
Cloud.
 
So
me of the companies that we announced at Next included the American 
Cancer Society and Mekason in health care. Media and entertainment 
companies like USA Today and Viacom, consumer packaged goods brands 
like Unilever, manufacturing and industrial companies
 
like Samsung and 
UPS, and public sector organizations like Australia Post.
 

two new cloud regions in Seoul and Salt Lake City, which we plan to open in 
2020. These new cloud region
s will build on our current footprint of 19 cloud 
regions and 58 data centers around the world.
 
20 years in and over 100,000 employees strong, I am incredibly proud of 
the work that our teams at Google do every day. We have so many bright 
opportunities ahe
ad and seizing those opportunities starts with their 
investment in the communities where we operate around the world and right 
here at home.
 
In the U.S., not only are we expanding our workforce across the country, but 
we are helping people in every state, 
gain the digital skills they need to 

-
year after kicking off our 
collaboration with Goodwill, 250,000 Americans have learned new digital 
skills and 27,000 have found a job.
 
We also feel a deep responsibility to m
ake sure that we 
--
 
that as we grow 
our business, we are doing it with minimal impact on the environment. 
Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data 
center, while delivering seven times more computing power than we did five 
years 
ago.
 
Since 2017, we have matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our 
operations with purchases of renewable energy and I am proud that Google 

been more excited about Google and
 
where we are headed. I want to thank 
every Googler around the world for joining us on that journey.
 
With that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric 
Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of parts on the revenue 
performance in the quarter. Ruth, you would call
ed out potential volatility on 
the Q4 earnings call. I wanted to understand a little bit about what you are 
calling out in Q4 and how that might have manifest itself in Q1 on the 
product side of the equation, so we could just better understand how much 
of 
it was isolated to Q1 or it might be a headwind as we move through the 
year? And as you look at the individual performance of the ad divisions in 
sites, desktop, mobile search, YouTube, it seems like you were still calling 
out strength in mobile search in 
YouTube. So could it be desktop search 
where we actually saw some weakness in the quarter? Thanks so much for 
any granularity and color on that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. Thanks Eric. So I will try to step back and start at the highest level. 
Obviously, on a report
ed GAAP basis revenue growth in Q1 reflects the FX 
headwind that we talked about in contrast to the tailwind last year and as 

delta between fixed and floating growth rates the Alpha
bet level is a good 
proxy for the effect on sites revenue.
 
Beyond that, I tried to draw that the year
-
on
-
year growth rate in part 
reflects our strong 2018. And then more to your question as we indicated 
last quarter, the other item is the timing of product
 
changes in Ads can 
impact year
-
on
-
year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on 
the best interest of users and advertisers over the long
-
term we do not 
manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product 
testing, and that wa
s sort of the overarching color that I was trying to give 
you.
 
And in terms of desktop it was a modest contributor to revenue growth. It 
does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such 
as planning vacations or assessing insurance o
ptions. And as we have talked 
about in prior calls, we continue to see the ongoing importance of desktop 
for many users and many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of 
mobile. So I led with the items that are really driving the growth but that 
was a
 
bit more color on desktop for you.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open. Once, again, Doug Anmuth, your line is now open, 
please check your mute button.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Y

on the revenue growth. Ruth can you just give us a little bit more detail on 
the paid click growth, the decel that we saw that at 39% from the 50%s and 

 
a comp issue or something more specific? And 
then just on the spending side, I want to understand a little more just how 
you are thinking about spending relative to three months ago. I know you 
talked about both CapEx moderating and also headcount moderat
ing three 
months ago. Just curious at least that headcount is still in that camp figure 

under the new Cloud CEO? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Okay. So, starting with clicks and CBCs. As we hav
e discussed on prior calls 
the biggest driver affecting those CBCs and click trends is YouTube 
engagement ads with YouTube Clicks representing the vast majority of total 
clicks. And so while YouTube Clicks continue to grow at a substantial pace in 
the firs
t quarter, the rate of YouTube Click growth decelerated versus what 
was a strong Q1 last year reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, 
which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.
 
And then in terms of your two spending
 
the investment questions, in terms 
of headcount, first, we do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate 
slightly in 2019 from the year
-
on
-
year growth in 2018. And as I indicated in 
opening comments, we are continuing to invest in technical talent for
 
priority 
areas like cloud, search and ML. And so cloud has been and continues to be 
the primary area of headcount growth and as Thomas indicated as well, I 
think Sundar did as well.
 
In terms of CapEx just to fill up the last part I think of your question.
 
Relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 
growth rates for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year
-
on
-

that point either.
 
The first quarter
 
last year obviously included a sizable real estate acquisition 
in New York. But, overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical 
infrastructure given our outlook for compute requirements to support long
-
term growth.
 
Technical infrastructure i
s the biggest driver of CapEx growth, but we do also 
continue to invest in office facilities. In fact, as we announced in the first 
quarter, we expect CapEx of over $13 billion in 2019 just in the U.S. in data 
center construction and offices, with major ex
pansions in 14 states.
 
And more generally, while we are investing aggressively to support our 
outlook for compute requirements, we are also very focused on improving 
efficiency with our technical infrastructure and you can see that through our 
innovations 
and things like custom server hardware and TPUs, which can be 
more cost
-
effective especially for machine learning workloads.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is now 
open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you. Sundar, I had a question about Cloud. You guys are 
obviously talking more and more about it. But when do you think you are 
going to be in a position to share revenue figures or even growth rates 
similar to what the o
thers have been sharing for quite some time? And then, 
I guess, a couple of follow
-
ups to that are what would you say the biggest 
competitive differentiators are of GCP. And what also 
--
 
what changes has 
Thomas implemented for 2019? What are any of the big
 

focused on that maybe are different than what you are doing before? Thank 
you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Heather. Good question. Overall, I would say, I think, you saw it 
--
 
saw the momentum coming out of Next. And I would say, the high level the
 
key differentiators which we are focused on and which we hear from 
customers to the five key things are security and reliability, being really 
open about hybrid multi
-

anyone Cloud provider.
 
We want to be a pla
tform for open source and so we are really working well 
there in enabling options. AI, ML as a capability. And finally, as customers 

to help them through the journey.
 
I think I w
ould say, Thomas is really building upon a strong foundation, but 
we are really accelerating and scaling up go
-
to
-
market both internally and 
through our channel partners has been a huge focus. I am incredibly excited 
that, we just announced a couple of wee
ks ago that Rob Enslin has joined us 
to head go
-
to
-
market and just along with Thomas, both of them bring close 
to three decades of serving enterprise customers, and so that reflects the 
commitment we have. I think we are building a strong business across a
ll 
our verticals, and we are definitely are seeing a strong momentum, and look 
forward to being able to share more at the appropriate time.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of 
Evercore. Your
 
line is now open.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Thank you for taking my question. I have two, one for Ruth, one for Sundar. 
We noticed that large than expected slowdown in the properties TAC in the 
quarter that includes cost of mobile search, while the other cost of
 
revenues 
which includes YouTube content cost seem to maintain an expected growth 
rate despite what you said about more moderate turns in hardware. So just 

performance of mobile search rev
enue versus YouTube from those cost lines 
in the quarter? And then on Waymo, maybe for Sundar, we are hearing 
more and more about collaborations between ridesharing networks and AV 
provider, so the idea of mixed fleets or part human part AV as a means of 
p
otential deployment of AV technology. So can you just comment if that 
mixed lead approach would be something that you think Waymo would 
consider versus its own full ride service network? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of the sites TAC rate, a couple of 
things, we have discussed this 
previous 
--
 
on previous calls. We have expected the year
-
on
-
year growth in 
the TAC rate would begin to slow, starting in the second quarter last year 
and you saw that through the balance of 2018.
 
And this quarter, the constan
t TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing 
growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the 

the most important thing to point to.
 
The other is 
--
 
we 
have previously discussed is, TAC as a percentage of 
revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in 

the first point there.
 
And then, as it relates to Wa
ymo, I guess, a couple of things. We continue to 
be most focused on the ride sharing business here. We are pleased with the 
expansion and the number of Waymo riders that we have added since the 
last quarter. But as we have talked about on prior calls, we d
o continue to 
pursue a number of other opportunities, long
-
haul trucking we have talked 
about, logistics, deliveries, personal use vehicles, last mile solutions for 
cities, and then probably more to your question, licensing our technology 
and we did announ
ced in March that we are making one of our 3D
-
LiDAR 
sensors available to companies outside of the self
-
driving car service, 
beginning with robotics and physical security.
 
In other words in, for warehouse use or for farming and our view was that, 
that can p
rovide further operating leverage to our business. So we are 
actually looking at a number of different ways, but their primary focus 
continues to be on developing the ride hailing business.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And your n
ext question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. 
Your line is now open.
 
Steve Ju
 
Okay. Thanks. So, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on your Stadia 
commentary. How are your conversations with some of the larger PC and 
console publishers going right now? Yo
u obviously offered them an additional 
distribution outlet with billions of users, which is something that they 

getting from publishers if any? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
I mean, I think, t
here genuinely, I mean, I think, we see genuine 
excitement, because I think, they see the opportunity for a shift, a point of 
inflection, but they realized the technical challenge of pulling something like 
this off. And so, but once they get their hands on
 
with the technology and 
then they see the experience, I think, completely wins people over.
 
And so we are having conversations across the Board and I think people are 
definitely engaging in a very committed way and they are investing in it and 

to us to bring it all together and have a compelling service later 

 
But I think, not pushback per se, but they want to see our commitment, 
which is what we demonstrate and they are working hard 
to make the

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my que
stions. I have two. The first one just go back to the 
product changes. Ruth any more color on sort of which products or regions 
are most impacted by these changes? And just so we can understand a little 
bit, can you just help us with the key user experienc
e you are trying to solve 
for and sort of the message to your advertisers who maybe spending 
--
 
or 

long
-
term? And then Sundar just regarding your comment about YouTube, 
you mentio
ned more potential changes coming on YouTube with the next 
couple of mix. Can you just talk to us about that a little bit? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Yeah. Maybe I will start with the YouTube comments. I talked about in the 
area of content responsibility, we ar
e definitely focused on making sure we 
are constantly improving how we are handling both in terms of reducing the 

making sure when we recommend content that we are recommending high
-
quality content as well as reducing harmful content or low
-
quality content 
being recommended.
 
I think we had a set of launch which we have rolled out, but I think there are 
more lunches coming which will constantly improve what you will see in 
YouTube and
 
continues to be the most important area of focus for them.
 
On the first question in terms of products, I think, we are 
--
 
I presume when 
you say it back to product changes, I think, you are talking about the 
advertising experience. I think the main thing 
I would say is, I mean, we 

--
 
I think we have a long
-
term way of thinking about where we want to 
go and we were disciplined framework by which we think and evolve our 
products.
 

-
on
-
quarter basis, though, 
we 
obviously have had consistent performances. We approach our work 
differently and so you are going to have quarter
-
to
-
quarter variations once 
in a while. But we remain confident about the opportunities we see and I am 
looking ahead to that and we are foc
used on that.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar he had reminded us how April and May 
are pretty big months for the 
company with a series of your large annual 
events, and of course, each of them 
--
 
each of those businesses have their 
own goals and targets. But we also hear 
--
 
continue to hear more about your 
teams working together, for example, a large cloud engagement 
leading to 
higher ad spending from an enterprise. Can you talk to us just a little bit 
about how you balance having your leaders grow their own businesses with 
also incentivizing them to work together? And then second, and kind of 
completely differently, w
e would love to just hear your updated views on 
data collection and use. I am sure you have continue to have some 
dialogues with the politicians and regulators. We have seen some reports on 
more potential changes in Chrome or within the advertising platfor
m. We 
would love to hear how maybe your latest discussions are in view 
--
 
are in 
forming both the near and long
-
term view on policies with regards to data 
collection and use. Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks. And you are right, these are a couple of very mo
nths and its 
particularly busy leading up to I/O. And I would say in terms of how we work 
together, first of all, as a company, I think, we take our 
--
 
okay, our process 
extraordinarily serious in a very committed way. And we do right across 
company okay h
ours and it really reinforces ways by which different groups 
can work together, and we measure them and hold people accountable to 

are focus on their product areas our business need
 
to work together.
 



-
à
-

our most important areas. As a company, we have always tried to stay a 
step ahead. User expectations around privacy are constantly evolving and 
we stretch ourselves to meet them, and as part of that through this year, we 
are continuing to do a lot of work 
just with the overall goal of making sure 

 
And as part of that, we will have more changes through the course of this 

-
in
-
class in p
rivacy and security, and we always put user experience first and 
follow through.
 
Through all these changes, we need to be mindful of the content ecosystem 
and the publisher ecosystem. Advertising continues to be an important way 
by, which they create value
 
and they see value and so we are very 
thoughtful about how we approach our work.

Great. Thank you, Sundar.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert 
Baird. Your line is now open.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Thank you. I have a couple, first one follow
-
up on the revenue growth 
dynamics, 
specifically the sequential growth trend. I wonder, if we should 

the increasing mix of shopping and product ad formats. And Sundar, 
question in AI machine learning, since clearly th
is remains an area of 

development you characterize these stools at being today and whether we 
should expect the overall case of advancement from AI to accelerate in 
terms of products and
 
services? Thank you very much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the first question around seasonality and stuff we 
--
 
throughout the 
course of the year, we always deal with many events in a no pattern as. 
There are a few patterns which are consistent year
-
on
-
year, but th
ere are 
always one
-
off events which happen, so there is in
-
built variations 
--
 
so 

what we do.
 

right comm
ercial behavior has seasonality associated with it. But we do deal 
a lot with one
-
off events as well and 
--
 
but we always work our way through 
it.
 
On machine learning, I do think we are at very early days. I am excited that 
over the last three years, takin
g AI first approach we have really 
incorporated machine learning core 
--
 
in a core way across our product to 

 
I think we are in early stages of making it easier for businesses to 
understand what the
y are looking for and us taking care of more and more 

here.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 
Th
ank you. Maybe one for Ruth and one for Sundar. First Ruth, on mobile 
search, can you let us know how that did versus your expectations, I know 

doing and what are the key drivers now
 
for mobile searches, is it queries, is 
it driving higher click
-
through rates, ad format changes, what are the 
drivers, as you think about the next couple of years?
 
And then Sundar, could you just 
--
 
on the hardware business, I think, there 
is some concern

some comparisons to Microsoft 10 years ago. Really, just help us understand 
how that hardware business is important to Google and how you are thinking 
about it long
-
term? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
S

think, the main point, as we have both tried to indicate in opening 
comments is, we view the advertising opportunity is significant, given, in 
particular, the opportunity with machine l
earning, both for users and 
advertisers, as well as our commitments to product innovation and being the 
backdrop of an environment, which nearly half of the budgets in the U.S. are 
still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the U.S. is still offline 
and 
we are focused on digital playing bigger role in that and tapping into other 
marketing budgets, by offering an attractive ROI.
 
And then, apart from people spending more time on digital content, to your 
question, we know the better measurement, better a
d delivery, better user 
experience, all help grow the pie for everyone in the ecosystem.
 
And then more broadly, within YouTube, as we talked about last quarter, we 
do continue to see significant growth in direct response and we remain 
excited about the ups
ide potential there. Brand advertising is still the largest 

direct response given what we see as the upside potential.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Justin, on the hardware business, as I said 
earlier, we are still in our early 
days. But our commitment is very strong. We really see this incredibly 
important to drive the future of computing forward and to make sure our 
services are presented to users in the way that we intended them to be, and 
so
 
overall, we view it as a hugely important opportunity.
 
When we look at the business even for 
--
 
given we are more recent to it, we 
already 
--
 
if you take AES like Google Home and Assistant products, we are 
doing really well. We see strong momentum. I thin
k we are market leaders 
in the category and especially when you take a look at it on a global basis. 
And so for 
--
 
computing will continue to evolve even beyond phones and so 
we want to make sure we are in there and we are very committed to it for 
the long
-
term.
 
Phones, definitely, across as an industry, I think, they are working through a 
phase where there is definite year
-
on
-
year headwinds. But I do think, 
especially, the ecosystem is constantly pushing it forward. I continue to be 
excited about the innov
ations be it, 5G coming or the early look into foldable 
phones, which Android plays a big part in driving.
 
So I do think there is a lot more to come and we are focused on it. When I 

 
Net 
Promoter Scores and the range of lineup that we are working and how our 
products are getting better year
-
on
-
year I remain very excited.
 
Justin Post
 
Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. 
Your line 
is now open.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hey, guys. I guess I will just beat the dead horse on the deceleration 
comment again, but maybe a different way. Ruth so why did Europe and 
U.S. 
--
 
Europe ex
-
FX and U.S. growth rates dropped off much more than 
Asia and are there a
ny comment on why the decel was more pronounced in 
Western markets? And then stepping back we see pretty solid growth rates 
from the digital ad sector broadly in the first quarter and you flagged a lot of 

rprise to you. But how much 
of the deceleration insights ex
-
FX was from maybe advertiser demand issues 
in these markets versus proactive changes that you may have made on your 
end to the product? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of the regions, the 
year
-
on
-
year growth rates reflect the product 
comments that I have made with respect to the first quarter. The 
--
 
I think 
the 
--
 
you had the U.S. and Europe had about the same delta year
-
on
-
year. 
Other Americas was more pronounced. That was really more of 
the impact of 
hardware.
 
And then APAC, I think maybe was guiding some of your question, continues 
to be a very strong performer and continue to deliver in the 30% plus or I 
think 31% on a fixed FX basis. We are well
-
positioned growth throughout 
the regions

big focus on the next billion users and excited about the opportunities across 
the Board there.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

question, a
nd as we said earlier, we work through a set of product 
development pipeline in a very disciplined way focused on user experience 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question will be our final questio
n today from the 
line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thanks. Just a follow
-
up on the last question on EMEA and U.S. Was there 
any go
-
to
-
market changes in terms of the sales force or how you said 
quarter anything that may ha
ve been effectively, a Q1 seasonality issue that 
may see some snapback in Q2?
 
Ruth Porat
 
The opening comments I said that one of the points is that we had a strong 
year last year and we are looking at performance in line with that. I would 
say more broadly
 
overall in terms of go
-
to
-
market, our long
-
term 
investment thesis remains unchanged. We are excited about the 
opportunities ahead. We do continue to invest to ensure we remain well
-
positioned for the long
-
term. That applies across the businesses and so th
at 

made.
 
I think if I could just maybe expand on the investing pace, as we are looking 
at the pace of investing and supporting growth around the globe, what we 
are really looking at is 

-
term revenue and 
earnings growth, the operating margin did benefit, and as I noted in my 
opening comments that, from the fact that Q1 marketing expense, growth 
moderated, but that was the timing issue. We do expect to pick up 
the 
marketing expense in the second quarter and other than that really nothing 
to comment on.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thank you.

Thanks. We had strong performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding 
the continuation of substantial currency headwinds. Key highlights this 
quarter include ongoing momentum in our core search business particularly
 
mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues.
 
In addition, we are increasingly benefiting from the shift towards 
programmatic advertising, particularly among brand advertisers. These 
strong top
-
line results were complemented by ongoing o
perating expense 
discipline in the quarter as reflected in 31% year
-
over
-
year growth in GAAP 
operating income and 16% year
-
over
-
year growth in non
-
GAAP operating 
income. I will first go over a summary of the quarter followed by specific 
financial details a
nd conclude with things for the near
-
term. Omid will then 
cover the business and products highlights of the quarter after which we will 
take your questions.
 
Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was 
$17.7 billion, up an 11%
 
year
-
over
-
year, and up 3% sequentially. As a 
result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative 
currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion, or $1.1 billion after the 
benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constan
t to prior periods, 
our total revenue grew 18% year
-
over
-
year and 4% sequentially.
 
On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.8 billion and the operating margin 
was 27%. On a non
-
GAAP basis, that is excluding stock
-
based 
compensation, operating profit was $6
 
billion and the operating margin was 
34%. GAAP net income was $3.9 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year, and up 
12% versus Q1. Non
-
GAAP net income was $4.8 billion, up 18% year
-
over
-
year, and up 8% versus Q1.
 
GAAP earnings per diluted share for Class A and B sh
ares were $4.93, and 
for Class C were $6.43. Higher EPS for Class C reflects the impact of the 
adjustment payment made in Q2. Non
-
GAAP earnings per diluted share were 
$6.99. As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock
-
based 
compensation tot
aled $1.1 billion, up 29% year
-
over
-
year and down 6% 
sequentially.
 
Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements. Starting with 
our primary revenue sources, Google sites revenue was $12.4 billion, up 
13% year
-
over
-
year, and up 4% sequentially
, notwithstanding currency 
headwinds. Year
-
on
-
year and quarter
-
on
-
quarter growth reflect continued 
strength in search, particularly mobile search. We continue to close the gap 
between mobile and desktop search monetization.
 

eased with our ongoing progress resulting 
from our focus on user experience, ads quality and online to offline 
commerce initiatives. The combination of these efforts improves the 
effectiveness and value of mobile for users and marketers alike. Desktop 
sear
ch delivered solid revenue growth again this quarter. YouTube again 
delivered substantial growth in user engagement globally, particularly on 
mobile, which translated into strong adoption of our TrueView ad format.
 
Growth in watch time on YouTube has accel
erated and is now up over 60% 
year
-
over
-

watch time has more than doubled from a year ago. Network revenue was 
$3.6 billion, up 2% year
-
on
-
year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to 
reflect the d
iversion performance of programatic on the one hand and our 
legacy network businesses on the other.
 
Our programatic business including AdExchange and DoubleClick Bid 
Manager continue to deliver strong year
-
over
-
year and sequential 
performance then more tha
n offset lower results in AdSense for Search. We 
remain committed to policy changes that improve the user experience 
notwithstanding the fact that these policies have a negative impact on 
AdSense for Search revenue. Other revenue was $1.7 billion, up 17% y
ear
-
over
-
year and down 3% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play 
business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year
-
over
-
year and 
sequential movements were driven by substantial growth in Play offset by 
decline in the hardware sales.
 
Next r
evenues by geography. U.S. revenue was up 16% year
-
over
-
year to 
$8 billion and up 4% versus Q1. UK revenue was up 4% year
-
over
-
year to 
$1.7 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 11% year
-
over
-
year and was flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter
, rest of world revenue was up 
8% versus last year to $8 billion and up 2% versus Q1. In fixed FX terms, 
revenues were up 22% year
-
over
-
year, and up 4% sequentially highlighting 
both the strength of our global business as well as the impact of FX.
 
Finally 
revenue monetization; as a reminder, these metrics similarly reflect 
currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 18% year
-
over
-
year and 
7% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year
-
over
-
year and 4% 
sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Goog
le sites paid clicks were up 
30% year
-
over
-
year, and up 10% sequentially in particular reflecting growth 
in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile.
 
Google sites CPCs were down 16% year
-
over
-
year and down 5% 
sequentially. Mobile CPCs continue to strengthen a
nd the gap to desktop 
continues to grow as I previously noted. The decline in CPCs reflects the 
impact of YouTube TrueView, which is a growing percentage of overall sites 
clicks mix and where CPCs remain lower than on our other platforms.
 
Network paid clic
ks were down 9% year
-
over
-
year and down 2% 
sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to 
reduce the lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search consistent with 
our focus on improving user experience. Network CPCs were down 
3% both 
year
-
over
-
year and sequentially.
 
Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.4 billion, or 
21% of total advertising revenue, which was down slightly sequentially. 
Trends within sites and network TAC remains flat, due to mix shift
s in 
partners, products and devices. As a reminder, the sites TAC line includes 
the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for distributing Google 
Search as distinct from their own branded search.
 
Non
-
GAAP other cost of revenues was $3 billion in 
Q2, up 12% year
-
over
-
year, and up 7% versus Q1. Year
-
on
-
year and sequential growth were 
driven by costs associated with operating our data centers including 
deprecation as well as content acquisition cost primarily for YouTube and 
Play. Non
-
GAAP operating 
expenses were $5.4 billion, or 30% of revenue, 
up 11% year
-
over
-
year and down 1% versus Q1.
 
The increase in operating expense versus 2Q 2014 primarily reflects R&D 
expense attributable to increased hiring of engineers and product managers. 
Headcount increa
sed 18% versus last year and 3% versus 1Q 2015 with 
total headcount at quarter
-
end of approximately 57,100. The deceleration in 
year
-
over
-
year growth and decline in quarter
-
over
-
quarter operating 
expenses reflects in part discipline in expense management a
nd in part 
lower legal expenses than in comparable periods; a breakout of individual 
operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides.
 
Other income and expense was $131 million with interest income offset by 
higher expenses from our FX hedging p
rogram. The effective tax rate was 
21% for the second quarter. As noted in our press release, in Q2, we 
identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal 
entities. We revised our income tax expense for the relevant periods 
beginning 
in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative 
amount of $711 million. The income tax adjustments were not material to 
the effected periods; more detail is available on our earnings slides.
 
Turning now to CapEx and cash. CapEx for the quarter 
was $2.5 billion, 
primarily for production equipment and data center construction. CapEx 
spend was lower versus last year and last quarter reflecting a bit of a 
digestion period after an extended period of investments in both data 
centers and the requisite
 
machine deployment. We continue to view our 
computing infrastructure as one of our most strategic assets. Operating cash 
flow was $7 billion with free cash flow of $4.5 billion resulting in a cash 
balance of approximately $70 billion at the end of the qua
rter of which 
approximately $40 billion or 58% is held overseas.
 
Let me close with five topics of focus for the near
-
term, first on revenue 
growth and drivers. Our strong revenue growth in the second quarter, 
notwithstanding the adverse effects of the stro
ng U.S. dollar evidences the 
health of our core search business most notably mobile, complemented by 
growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising. Our earlier stage products 
such as Fiber, Google Life Sciences, and Nest service longer
-
term sources of 
rev
enue. Regarding these areas, we are focused on tight governance to 

these products in greater detail as I get settled in.
 
Second, the sequential deceleration in expense 
growth achieved in the 
second quarter reflects in part the benefit of expense discipline discussed in 
prior calls. A key focus is on the levers within our control to manage the 
pace of expenses while still ensuring and supporting our growth. We will do 
thi
s while we continue to invest in engineering talent to keep us preeminent 
in innovation globally.
 
Third, the pace of growth in capital expenditures over the last several years 
has been significant. Although the vast majority of CapEx to date have been 
to s
upport our core business, growing requirements for newer products 
underscore the increasing importance of optimization across the many 
opportunities ahead of us. Fourth, our cash balance grew again this quarter, 
which of course gives us more strategic flex
ibility. We remain focused on 
judiciously capitalizing on the strategic opportunities that we have, which are 
many. And the key issue is how we prioritize our capital allocation, given the 
breadth of opportunities.
 
Finally, as Larry has frequently noted, G

services that significantly improves the lives of as many people as possible. 
Solving problems for users at scale ultimately results in monetization 
opportunities. How we prioritize and focus on these opportunities rema
ins 
paramount, both for our employees, who remain inspired by the opportunity 
to work on the most cutting edge developments with maximum global 
impact and for our shareholders. I look forward to working with you.
 
I will now turn the call over to Omid, who 
will cover the business details of 
the quarter.

products. To call out just one, the new Photos app is a great exam
ple of how 

design, something that Google is proud to bring together in such a great 
package for our users. Our investments in machine learning have 
applications across the company and ha
ve real potential to improve our 
business. For instance, machine learning helps us to improve and adds visual 

 
I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend
 
more time talking about our progress in what continues to be our two 
biggest focus areas and growth drivers: mobile and video. First, our core 
products continue to do well and users love them. In fact, Google Search, 
YouTube, Android, Chrome and Google Ma
ps, each have over one billion 
users. We also continue to see great partner momentum across the Android 
platform. The Android phone ecosystem started with one device, one carrier 
and one OEM, the T
-
Mobile G1 in 2008 and has grown now to over 400 
OEMs and o
ver 500 carriers, who make over 4,000 distinct devices. This is a 
testament to our great progress on both the tech and partnering fronts.
 
Google Play continues to grow at an impressive clip. Google Play games has 
added more than 180 million new users in th
e past six months and continues 
to be one of the fastest growing mobile gaming platforms in history. In 

with a range of great new features, new major customer announcements like 
HTC and J
DA software and our collaboration with Broad Institute.
 
And on the advertising side as a trend towards programatic ad buying 

-
screen world with our 
DoubleClick platform. We recently expanded cross device m
easurement to 
all of our DoubleClick advertiser products, so marketers can measure these 

announced full DoubleClick support for native ad formats.
 

iving more into the big areas of opportunity 
for us, the shift to mobile and the continued growth of online video. I talked 
last quarter about the shift we see in consumer behavior as people turned to 
their phones throughout the day to decide what to buy o


looking and those moments are increasingly happening on mobile devices.
 
More Google searches now take place on mobile devices than on computers 
in ten countries, includ
ing the U.S. and Japan, two of our largest markets. 

looking for immediacy and action. In fact, 30% of mobile queries are related 
to location and our efforts around local search are helping
 
consumers to find 
relevant information fast.
 

Google products. As Sundar and his teams showed at I/O this year, there is 
a lot to be excited about from now on Tab to Android Pay and muc
h more. 
As I mentioned, one of my favorites is the new photos app, where you can 
keep and organize all of your memories and easily share and save what 

photos on your phone, the photos app
 
makes taking, organizing and finding 

day.
 
In addition, our teams have made great strides to help users find what they 
need within third
-
party apps through indexing. We now have 50 b
illion links 
within apps index and 25% of signed in Google searches on Android now 
return deep links, taking users right to content within an app or to a link so 
they can install it. We also recently started showing such links in search 
results on iOS, dev
elopers like [indiscernible] are really seeing a boost in 
traffic as a result of deep linking. We also added now cards for more than 
100 apps like OpenTable and Spotify and we have extended Google Voice 
actions to third party developers, so we can say thin
gs like, okay Google 
listen to MPR.
 


recently announced universal app campaigns, which will let developers easi
ly 
reach users across Google search, the add mob network, mobile sites, 
YouTube and Google Play. Marketers just tell us what their ad will say, the 
audience they want to reach, and how much they want to spend and our ad 
systems will do the rest to help the
m maximize performance.
 
We introduced new mobile ad formats like automobile ads, which take you 
directly to a carousel of vehicle images important details like estimated MPG, 
and links to nearby dealer listings. And just yesterday, we announced 
purchases o
n Google, which makes it easier for people searching on Google 
to buy things right from their mobile phones.
 
I want to turn now to YouTube, which is showing strong momentum with 
users and advertisers as we reinvent the television experience for the digital
 
age. On mobile alone, YouTube reaches more 18 to 49 year old in the U.S. 
than any U.S. cable network. And the number of users coming to YouTube, 
who start at the Youtube homepage similar to the way they might turn on 
their TV is up over three times year
-
o
n
-
year plus once users are in YouTube, 
they are spending more time per session watching videos, on mobile the 
average viewing session is now more than 40 minutes up more than 50% 
year
-
over
-
year.
 
As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from
 
television to 
digital, brand dollars are flowing 

 

an upfront buying through our Google preferred model. Compared to the 
same period after BrandCast as last year, Google preferred commitments in 
the U.S. were three
 

video ad formats like TrueView and continue to help marketers engage and 
connect the consumers in new ways. The number of advertisers running 
video ad on YouTube is up more than 40% year
-
over
-
year and 
for our top 
100 advertisers, the average spend per advertiser is up over 60% year
-
over
-
year. We recently introduced a new feature for TrueView that allows 
brands to automatically insert product information, images and pricing into 
their video ads.
 
And as a
dvertising increasingly shifts towards programatic buying brands 
can now easily buy TrueView ads programatically through DoubleClick Bid 
Manager. All this is helping our content creators build the next generation of 
media companies doing what they love mak
ing great videos. The number of 
channels earning six figures per year on YouTube is up 50% year
-
over
-
year.
 
One of the key reasons for this success is our Content ID initiative which is 
used by more than 8,000 partners who have claimed over 400 million vide
os 
helping them control their content on YouTube and make money on videos 

successful quarter, we are super focus on our key goals of delivering 
amazing mobile and video experience
s and there is lot more coming in the 
next few months including the Android M release, now on tap Android Pay, 
and YouTube gaming.

Real
ly had build up headcount and data center capabilities. Just where are 
you on capacity and really what was the purpose of this big build up, what 
kind of capabilities does that give Google today? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you for that question. 
First I do want to clarify one thing in my 
comments on CPCs, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and 
desktop continues to narrow obviously an important trend wanted to clarify 
that. So look in terms of headcount in data center capabilities and what
 
that 
does for us. As I said in our view, our infrastructure is one of the most 
strategic assets that we have and as we talk about what happened in the 
second quarter it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the 
cadence of spend and so wh
ile overall capital intensity was lower in Q2 than 

during the year but the main point as we do computing capacity as a 
strategic asset it provides us with the flexibility necessa
ry for growth.
 

were possible and particular given some of the newer opportunities that we 
have. And so we are just beginning the 2016 budgeting process quarter that 
is priorit
ization but it really has been about strategic flexibility and the 
underlying strength of all that we do.

Ross Sandler
 
Great, I just had two questions. Omid, the U.S. reaccelerated looks like from 
12% to 16% in the quarter, can you just give us a little color of what drove 
that was it more a funct
ion of core search and mobile picking up or 

 
for 
YouTube? And then, Ruth did you mentioned in you prepared remarks that a 
lot of the expense deceleration was put in place before you got to Google. So 

, can you talk about 

in place in 2015 before you got there? Thank you.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thank you, Ross. Our performance really reflects the fact that we have a 
diverse set of prod
ucts that are doing well. We have strength in core search 

seeing a lot of strength. We saw a nice pick up in a number of verticals in Q2 
coming off weather
-
related weakness in Q1. And thi

retail and travel being stronger verticals in search. As to the second part of 
the question, I have Ruth to address that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And so with respect to expense management obviously a lot has been done 
on expense discipline has be
en discussed on calls for a number of quarters 



be clear, the 
priority is revenue growth and we have a breadth of opportunity, but 
pursuing revenue growth is obviously not inconsistent with expense 
management.
 

experience the best wa
y to slow the rate of growth in expenses is to work 
closely with business leaders really anchored in data, so together we can 
identify ways to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the 

versations with 
our business leaders, I look forward to this exercise over the next couple of 

question.

much below your
 
capacity. Are there any reasons why Google would not 
want to raise debt, if you had to finance a large acquisition and if yes, could 
you help us understand what these reasons are? And secondly, how do we 
reconcile the strength in mobile search with the fa
ct that distribution pack 
grew only 6% year

So starting with your question about cash which

slightly broadened the question more than what you did, but at the end of 
the day, our focus 

 
my focus is maximizing shareholder value over the

r 
balance sheet where we investing and that could theoretically be a part of 

we need for working capital?
 
What do we need for CapEx? What do we need for M&A? What do we need 
poten
tially for capital return? How does one think about financing the 

be premature to be more specific than that. But given this profitability of our 
business we have many opportuniti
es given the growing mix of our business, 
we have opportunities, I would say allocation decisions are mutually 
exclusive, allocation can obviously change as opportunities evolve. But as we 

premature to 
be more specific on that at this point.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
How about the distribution TAC on growing 6% given the strength of mobile?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So as it relates to distribution TAC, sites TAC dollars are up modestly year
-
over
-
year and 
quarter
-
over
-


thing, because with those TAC dollars comes revenue. As a remainder TAC 
includes payments made to search distribution p
artners is distinct from 
YouTube and Play content acquisition costs, which are in other cost of 
revenue. So looking at this on a percentage of revenue basis, what you are 
seeing is the impact of YouTube revenue growth, sites revenue was up. But 
the associa
ted content acquisition costs are reflected in higher other cost of 
revenue not in sites TAC.

Okay, thanks. So, Omid big picture in the outperformance of programatic in 
YouTube is interesting as it seems to beg the next question as you 

 
your 
current list of advertising products now seems to touch all p
arts of the 
consumer purchasing funnel. So I'm wondering where you are in uniting all 
of the different pieces so that you can walk into a large advertiser and lay 
out the data, so that the 15 second TrueView spot that they ran turn into a 
list in the sales
 
of X percent. Okay, thanks.
 
Omid Kordestani
 


proud of and working well for advertisers and what we l
ike to say internally, 
as we like to have one Google represented to the customers so that in these 
conversations with them we really understand their objectives and really in 
the classic sense of the funnel you know we can start from the brand 
journey from
 
the beginning to purchase across, search display video and 
then as you know we recently brought cross

device measurement to 
DoubleClick.
 

showing how mobile ads are driving actual 
store visits for advertisers and

time how their ads are 
performing, we done over 10,000 Brand Lift studies on YouTube campaigns 
alone. So its we really just excited about having this full suite now and b
eing 
able to have the full coverage of this customer acquisition journey from 
branding all the way to conclusion of a transaction.

Great, thanks. Omid, you gave a lot of great data points on the growth in 

 
on 
the why has YouTube seen this kind of reacceleration resurgence in growth. 
Do you think its part of a broader industry trend, the weakness in the 
upfront, offline is now coming online or is what else specifically, what 
specifically is YouTube doing to 
kind of better capture those dollars and then 
Ruth I know somebody ask you about that, logical follow
-
on question is the 
cash returns and share repurchases and dividends and just I know its early 
days but your thoughts on and your collective thoughts, Goog
le how you 
think about that over the next few years when if ever it make logical sense 
to do that? Thank you.
 
Omid Kordestani
 


 

the strength of YouTube coming together it star
ts with having over a billion 
users nearly almost one
-
third of all people on the internet everyday 
watching hundreds of millions of hours on the services and that creates 
billions of views and as Ruth mentioned the growth in watch time on 
YouTube accelerat
ed in this now up over 60% year
-
over
-
year the fastest 

 
And I think we are doing it also much better job with our products in our 
sales force to not only deliver for the creators on YouTube and do a better 
job of helping them m
onetize their contents and at the same time, then 
highlighting that success to programs like Brandcast where advertisers, 
agencies see that dynamic audience and service and then with the 
advertising products be able to then show them the real benefits of 
a

really all the pieces coming together for us and obviously we have a lot of 
work to do and we see still a lot of opportunity to enhance the service. So, I 
think you will see a lot of 
innovation coming from us both on the service 
front as well as on the advertising products.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Hey, Mark. As you noted, it is early days but the way I view any assessment 
of a return on capital for my prior answer regarding balance sheet efficiency
 
is really in the context of maximizing stakeholder value over the medium to 
long
-
term.
 
And with return of capital it gets into the context of, how do you prioritize 
and allocate cash after an appropriate reserve for working capital amongst 
the CapEx, M&A 
and then potentially that capital return. And as I said, the 
allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, the profitability of our business 
gives us many opportunities, but the main point is to date the weakest 
return on investment here has been in our cor
e search business including 
mobile search as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. Here M&A, we built 
a lot of the growth engines today, YouTube and DoubleClick are great 
examples. Again this underscores the power of smart targeted acquisitions.
 
We 
also have a strong track record of investment in new products as you 
know well and the infrastructure to support explosive growth, our tech 
infrastructure I've already commented on is really unparalleled and we do 

ve invested in it substantially over 


uses.

Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the 
question. Omid, you mentioned retail travel is through 
the stronger verticals advertising front and in the recent past, you guys have 
made a number of announcements around products that align your interest 
or more closely with suppliers, people who try clo
sing the economic loop and 
you might be even moving down the funnel. How do you think about the 
opportunities for Google to sort of move down respective finals and 
industries where you do you already have a fair bit of expertise? Thanks.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Su

retailers to consumers across screens and also reducing this friction involved 
in finding and purchasing products. All including local products and stores. 
So that entire journey and all
 
the aspects of commerce is a great area of 
focus for us. And as users begin to 

 
as they search, start their searches on 
mobile phones, we are continuously trying to find ways to improve their 
mobile shopping experience.
 
And as shopping experiences on the
se smart phones become easier and we 
focus on improving mobile conversion for advertisers. We are seeing great 
benefits from that, we just announced purchases on Google, for example, 
the smartphone only feature of the product listing ads an example. And 
ag
ain all of these are really for us the building blocks to help in reduction of 
that friction and bring the expertise we have and that understanding the 
immediacy, the local nature of these searches and understanding conversion 
and how to kind of put it all
 
together for users, and for advertisers and 
machines.

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is 
now open, please go ahead.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Great thanks. 
Just to follow
-
up a little bit on the last one, Omid can you talk 
more specifically about the cross
-
platform efforts and estimated conversions 

the platform.
 
And then secondly, you 
commented several times that the gap is tightening 
on pricing between mobile and desktop, can you quantify that by any chance 
and can you just talk about what you think drives that to tighten further, go 
forward? Thanks.
 
Omid Kordestani
 

h take that second part. On the first part on this online to 
offline conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are 

products that help bring mobile users to stores.
 

from clients using our tools to bridge this digital and physical world. And 
great adoption of local inventory ads, which help advertisers promote their 

usag
e of smartphones and the immediacy come together.
 

ads on store visits. So just to give you a couple of examples, Target, one of 
our advertisers found that mobile search ads greatly i
nfluence in
-
store store 
sales and using our store visit data they found that a third of their paid 
search ads resulted in a user visiting a target store during 2014 holiday 
season. So we love to continue working with them and other advertisers to 
show the 
results and then build on that.
 
Florida department store working with us found that 63% of their mobile 
influenced sales take place off
-


par
tners, the merchants and finding ways for them to really quantify these 
benefits and just scale these programs for everyone.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then as it relates to the second part of your question there are really 
two good stories here given the 
importance of search. Mobile CPCs up and 
desktop CPCs not declining so the gap is narrowing. On the mobile side as 
Larry said before with respect to desktop it took time to fully develop the 
pricing model and we remain focused on building the mobile ecosys
tem to 
have the right ad formats and measurement to take advantage of all the 
platform ads to offer features like estimated store visits, app install, the 
rengagement ads, cross device conversions are all part of this strategy.
 
And then on desktop, the bus
iness continues to grow. It remains a good 
contributor to overall results as we announced that the AdWords 
performance Summit in May ongoing developments in rich and useful ads 
that work across all screams including desktop, enable us to deliver the right 
answers for our users in the right moment in other words, ads format that 

really narrowing this gap here.

Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Ruth given your background, I just 
want to ask if you thought the 
regulatory backdrop for Google is in anyway 
analogous to the financial services industry and sort of what is your outlook 
for a larger player like Google in an environment of increasing regulatory 
pressure, particularly outside the U.S. and of course speci
fically for Google 
with the EC demanding changes to the search results, just wondering should 
we be concerned that that these regulatory pressures can ultimately have an 
impact on your business. Thanks.

ut as it comes to our business Google 
operates in a very competitive environment, there are many windows on to

dress

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line 
i
s now open. Please go ahead.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two. The first one, Ruth, is going back to your comments on some of 
the earlier stage projects fiber life science that [indiscernible] focused on 
tight governance. Is there anyway you can kind of help us to t
hink about 
OpEx or CapEx related to those projects at this point and how we should 
think about maintenance versus investment in OpEx and CapEx going 
forward? And then the second one just going back to the accelerating U.S. 
revenue growth, it sounds like mo
bile and YouTube are both doing pretty 
well. Can you just help us understand or are you seeing both accelerate 

 
is 
U.S. search accelerating at this point or is it more so being driven by 
YouTube? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure, so let me take your first question
 

 
first part of your question first. In 
terms of overall kind of the framework for thinking about our businesses 
broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry have 
referred to for many years, namely the 70/20/10, 70% resources on
 
the 
core 20% on adjacent areas, one point that included Chrome and Android 
and they are now in the core but it would include things like cloud and then 
10% in additional new exciting opportunities in really sizable markets like 

ith Google Life Sciences.
 
And so in discussing this with Larry its clearest objective has been to instill 
within the culture this mission to drive not just important innovation 
associated with our core business but also to look for as he call them 
revoluti
onary ideas, big solutions that can meaningfully contribute both to 
making peoples life better into the next big revenue and earnings growth 
opportunity for Google.
 
And my take is that Larry gives the 70/20/10 as an instructive framework he 
is also noted h
ow hard is it to reach that 10% on these big new 

new problems and start pursuing incremental change. So human nature sort 
of provides a limit on how big that final bucket would b
e the new 

business continues to deliver strong growth. So to achieve 10% in the big 
new areas means continually trying to reach 10% of an even larger number.
 
And the framework keeps
 
us focused on big ambitions across the company 
but given the success of the core business I think its fair to say the 10% is a 

helps you fill in a bit there. And then the second 
part of your question if you 
could repeat that.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Yes. We just going back to the accelerating overall U.S. revenue. Just 
curious about a little more color on the drivers there were, its sounds like 
both YouTube and mobile search are doing pretty 
well. Is it safe to say that 
U.S. search and YouTube are both accelerating or you seeing YouTube driver 
is proportionate how should we think about the drivers of the U.S. revenue 
acceleration?
 
Ruth Porat
 

growth really reflects the fact we 
have diverse set of products that are doing well, we had strengthen core 
search particularly mobile, we had strengthen YouTube and programatic as 

products that deliver the results that you are talking about, that we are 
talking about here today.

Our next question comes from Heather Bellini fr
om Goldman Sachs. Your 
line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you so much. I just had two quick questions. I was just 
wondering you talked a lot about desktop and mobile CPCs. I was wondering 
if you could share with us if the narro
wing of the gap between the two was 
actually starting to accelerate. And then the other thing I wanted to ask is 
just thinking about the CapEx spending made that companies go through 
and clearly Google been on one on an accelerated spending way for the las
t 
few years, should we then suggest 

 
get from your comments are you were 
in a digestion period that the digestion period could also be a multi
-
year 
trend as well, if there is any thoughts you could share there. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
You know I think with 
respect to the first part of your question, we thought 
it was important to be clear that this gap is narrowing and to give you a 
sense of some of the mix issues within CPCs. So mobile, CPCs strengthening 
desktop not declining, YouTube remains lower, but we



 
And then as it relates to expenses, what I was trying to convey there is that 
we 

 
in the second quarter had
 
a bit of a digestion period here on the back 

of 

 
if you kind of think about the second quarter in that context, there can 
be some variability in the cadences spend.
 
And so a part
 



 
as the 
way you frame the question, this multi
-
period given the sheer scope of 
opportunities that we have. So as I said again
 
with the front
-
ends with 


some context for what was going on in the second quarter.
 
And then as it relates t
o OpEx in terms of the back half of the year, there 
are seasonal fluctuations that do typically impact operating expense as well. 
For example, headcount usually picks up in the third quarter with new grad 
hire starting and our marketing expense also tends 
to be weighted towards 
the second half of the year. So again I was trying to give you a sense of

will actually be additive to sort of the optics of CPC versus where it is right 
now? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So I think there was three parts to that question. In terms of the revenue 
growth in YouTube, Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have 
strong growth there and it really does reflect as he said the sheer volume of 
users we have over a billion users. And those users are spending more time 
watching and watch time growth continues to accelerate now up over 60% 
year
-
over
-
year, the fastest rate
 

watch time as most valuable measure of engagement. And it does reflect the 
ongoing improvement in ads quality with more users also choosing to watch 

y 
engaged, but data points like the fact there are more 18 to 49 year olds on 
mobile YouTubes and watching cable TV today really underscores the 
opportunity here. And our focus is the opportunity to get larger budgets, 
move to YouTube.
 
And then in terms of
 

breakout profit by product and we view our technical infrastructure as a core 
strategic asset that supports products across the company, I have already 
said that on this call that is an important point. It 
is fair to say that much of 

and our ability to serve high quality HD video on demand around the world is 

multi
-
device platform with high usage on both desktop and mobile. We have 
one ad team that works across our various products and when we work with 

 

ngly if you take our top 
advertisers, they all advertise across all our products, not necessarily the 
same rate, but we have a single team working with them to close the 
differential. We do view that as a great opportunity. And the goal, to give 
just a bit
 
more color on how some of our assets and technical infrastructure 
and ad sales team benefit a number of our different products across the 
company. And then I think you slipped a third part in there on the status of 

 
that kind of the CPC trends and YouTub
e TrueView pricing, so I will 
disclose out on that.
 
CPC pricing on YouTube for TrueView ads, ads that users choose not to skip 
is lower than on CPC pricing on desktop and mobile, but YouTube TrueView 
ads represented a larger percentage of our overall click
s, so had a greater 
impact on CPCs. And this is really about the tremendous growth in YouTube 
views. And not 

 
you know again, when we see the real uptake here and the 
extent to which users are choosing to watch more ads given our effort 
around ad relevanc
e and quality, advertisers want to reach these audiences. 
And our focus is on the opportunity to get larger budgets move to YouTube.

Thanks Ellen. Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google. We made several big 
announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast, and Google Marketing Live. 
They're all part of our broader vision to b
uild a more helpful Google for 
everyone. When we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, 
partners, advertisers, and all the customers of our growing cloud business, 
and the communities we call Home.
 
From the beginning, Google's mission has been 
to organize the world's 
information and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the years, 
we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a 
company that helps you get things done. Today, I'll share how we are 
approaching this work
.
 
Building a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information 
mission. In Q2, we have made a number of improvements to our founding 
product, Search. We redesigned our mobile search page and brought our 
popular full coverage feature to search 
to better organize news results.
 
We are also integrating augmented reality into Search. So, if say, you're 
searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even 
superimpose them onto your wardrobe to see if they match.
 
Thanks to advancements
 
in AI, we are making significant improvements to 
the Google Assistant. The next
-
generation Assistant, can process requests 
up to 10 times faster, making it easier to multi
-
task, compose e
-
mails, and 
even work offline. With features like Duplex on the web,
 
that system will 
soon be able to help users book rental cars and buy movie tickets.
 
If you are searching for the fastest way home, Google Maps will now tell you 
when your bus is delayed or how packed your next train will be. We have 
rolled this out to peo
ple in 200 cities worldwide.
 
Google Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis. Last month, we 
added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help 
you understand where the natural disaster is and better anticipate where it
 
may be headed.
 
Building a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be 
able to access and enjoy our products. That's why we are applying the latest 
advancements in AI to dramatically improve experiences for people with 
disabilities. One 
example of this is captions, which make content more 
accessible to the almost 500 million people in the world who are deaf or hard 
of hearing.
 
In Android Q, we can now add automatic live captions to any media playing 
on your phone such as videos, podcasts,
 
and voicemails. We are also 
developing technology for the next billion users coming online in places like 
India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Yesterday, we introduced the gallery Go App. 
It's a way for people living in low connectivity areas to manage their pho
tos 
and videos while offline.
 
Google Photos continues to be one of our most popular and beloved 
products, now with over one billion monthly users, and we are excited by the 
potential of Gallery Go to bring these benefits to the next billion users.
 
Building
 
for everyone also means ensuring that privacy is equally available 
to everyone. In Q2, we announced privacy improvements to give users clear 
choices and more control around their data. We're making privacy controls 
more easily accessible, expanding our po
pular incognito mode to maps and 
adding new auto delete controls.
 
And we continue to challenge the notion that products need more data to be 
more helpful. For example, we invented a new technique called federated 
learning that allows us to train AI models 
and make products smarter 
without raw data leaving your device.
 
To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in 
our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, 
software, and AI. At I/O, we introduced some n
ew additions to our hardware 
lineup including Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. By taking advantage of our leading 
software capabilities, we can offer users a premium phone experience at a 
much lower price point.
 
With the launch of Pixel 3a in May, overall Pixel u
nit sales in Q2 grew more 
than 2x year
-
over
-
year. In addition to Verizon and the Google Store, we 
successfully expanded our distribution to T
-
Mobile, Sprint, U.S. Cellular, 
Spectrum Mobile, and additional partners which has greatly diversified our 
sales fo
otprint in the U.S. Finally, we're also pleased that the Pixel 3a launch 
was met with their highest Net Promoter Score ratings to date.
 
We are also doubling down on creating a helpful Home, bringing all of our 
Home products together under the Nest brand. I
n Q2, we launched the Nest 
Hub in 12 additional countries. Demand across our helpful Home products 
continues to increase as we expand to new markets.
 
Our new Google Nest Hub Max, a voice activated smart display powered by 
the Google Assistant will be avail
able later this summer. Stay tuned for even 
more on hardware this fall.
 
Beyond hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and 
ecosystems that push computing forward such as Android, Google Play, and 
Chrome. At I/O, we showed some exciting improvem
ents to Android Q. It's 
the first operating system to support 5G, includes support for foldable 
phones, and has nearly 50 updates focused on security and privacy, 
including more transparency and control over the location data you share 
with the apps.
 
And w
e continue to feel the excitement from users, developers, and 
publishers following the announcement of our new gaming platform Stadia. 
We recently announced pricing, availability and over 30 games coming to 
Stadia, in time for the consumer launch in Novemb
er.
 
Another area that we are investing deeply is YouTube. Every day, users 
come to YouTube to learn new things. As a result, YouTube has become one 
of the world's most accessible educational platforms. We see strong growth 
in a number of areas. Creators co
ntinue to build engaged fan bases on 
YouTube. Channels with more than 1 million subscribers grew by 75% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Thousands of channels have doubled their total monthly revenue, by using 
new monetization products, like Super Chat, Channel 
Memberships and 
merch. And we are building momentum with our subscription services. 
YouTube Music and YouTube Premium now available in over 60 countries, up 
from five markets at the start of 2018.
 
At Brandcast, we introduced two important changes that help
 
advertisers 
reach new audiences with premium content. First, new YouTube Original 
series, movies and live events will soon be made available for free, 
supported by ads. Second, YouTube TV with its 70
-
plus channels will be 
accessible as a standalone lineup
 
in Google Preferred.
 
As we continue to invest in the platform, responsibility remains our top 
priority. One significant change we made in Q2 was to update our hate 
speech policy. And we continue to be vigilant about removing harmful 
content quickly and at
 
scale. In the first quarter alone, we removed more 
than 8 million videos that violated our community guidelines.
 
The vast majority of those videos were flagged by machines and removed 
before getting a single view. We are also working to raise
-
up high
-
qual
ity 
content and support our creators who are our next generation media 
businesses. These are a few of the many investments we have made to 
protect the community. The work is ongoing and we are committed to it.
 
Moving from YouTube to broader advertising pla
tforms, at Google Marketing 
Live we introduced new ad formats such as Discovery ads, which offer a new 
visually rich mobile
-
first ad experience across Google properties. We also 
announced a unified shopping experience and universal shopping cart, all of 
wh
ich help to make Google more shoppable. We also announced Google 
Travel, a new centralized travel destination where people can plan and 
organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place, from booking flights 
and accommodations to planning activities
.
 
Now on to our Cloud business, Q2 was another strong quarter for Google 
Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and 
continues to grow at a significant pace. Customers are choosing Google 
Cloud for a variety of reasons. Reliabili
ty and uptime are critical. Retailers 
like Lowe's are leveraging the Cloud as one of the important tools to 
transform their customer experience and supply chain.
 
Customers need flexibility to move to cloud in their own way. Anthos, 
announced earlier this y
ear, provides advanced security and open 
architecture to support multi
-
and hybrid Cloud environments. That's 
important to many companies, including financial services customers like 
HSBC and new clients such as KeyBanc.
 
Scalable data management and analyti
cs solutions are another strength of 
Google Cloud. Vodafone is using cloud to drive real
-
time customer and 
network analytics. And BrightInsight, a leading healthcare platform for 
connected devices and drugs, uses are solutions to improve security and 
compl
iance.
 
Finally Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping healthcare 
organizations, like Sanofi, accelerate drug discovery and as such, improve 
the healthcare experience and outcomes. We continue to build our world
-
class cloud team to help support
 
our customers and expand the business 
and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years.
 
Finally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google 
services globally, we broke ground on three data centers and launched our
 
new Osaka Cloud region, the seventh in Asia Pacific. We also announced 
plans for a new Cloud region in Las Vegas, our seventh in the United States.
 
Lastly, beyond investments in products, we are investing significantly in the 
communities where we operate.
 

data center investment in the Netherlands, as well as the opening of our 
Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich Germany.
 
And right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing 
across the Bay
 
Area to help address the chronic shortage of affordable 
housing. Earlier this week, we invested $50 million in Housing Trust Silicon 
Valley's TECH Fund, which furthers our goal to help communities succeed 
over the long
-
term and expands access to housing f
or those who need it 
most.
 
Finally, I'm excited that Google is an official supporter of the Olympic and 
Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020. It's particularly special, since that's where 
we opened our first international office back in 2001. Ahead of the games, 
we
 
are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can 
better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time 
there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.
 
At Google, we feel incredibly privileged to have the opport
unity to help so 
many people everyday in moments big and small. There are many reasons 
to be optimistic about the direction technology is taking, from the 
applications of AI to address disease, to the potential of quantum computing, 
to deepen our understan
ding of the world. I want to thank Googlers around 
the world for another great quarter.
 
With that, I'll hand it over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Sundar. In the second quarter, total revenues of $38.9 billion 
were up 19% year
-
on
-
year and up 22% in consta
nt currency. Once again, 
our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, in particular, 
as well as YouTube and Cloud.
 
I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis 
for Alphabet focusing on year
-
over
-
year change
s. I will then review results 
for Google, followed by Other Bets and we'll include with our outlook. We will 
then take your questions.
 
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial 
performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $38.9
 
billion reflect an 
acceleration in both reported and constant currency revenue growth across 
all regions compared with the first quarter. Details of our results by 
geographic region are available in our earnings press release.
 
Turning to profitability. On
 
a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, 
including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.3 billion, 
up 25% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was 
$10.1 billion, up 35% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by G
oogle
-
related 
expenses.
 
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centres and other 
operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, 
primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising supported content, but 
als
o for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube 
TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line was 
also impacted by growth in hardware costs, associated with the launch of 
our line of mid
-
tier Pixel 3a smartphone
s.
 
Operating expenses were $12.5 billion with headcount growth as the largest 
driver across each of R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A. The biggest 
increase, once again, was in R&D expenses reflecting our focus on product 
innovation. Growth in sales and mar
keting expenses also reflects an increase 
in advertising and promotional expense, primarily for the launch of our Pixel 
3a lineup.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totalled $2.8 billion. Headcount was up 4,187 
from last quarter. And consistent with prior quarters,
 
the majority of new 
hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the 
most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical and 
sales roles.
 
Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 13% year
-
over
-
year, excluding the 
impact of the EC fine in the second quarter of last year for an operating 
margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $3 billion, reflecting sizable 
gains, which are primarily unrealized from investments made by CapitalG, 
GV and more broadly at Alphabet. W
e provide more detail on the line items 
within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $9.9 billion and 
earnings per diluted share were $14.21.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $6.1 billion, which I wi
ll discuss in the Google segment results. 
Operating cash flow was $12.6 billion with free cash flow of $6.5 billion. We 
ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately 
$121 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. S
tarting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $38.8 billion, up 19% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27.3 billion in the quarter, 
up 18% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by 
mobile
 
search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop 
search.
 
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year
-
on
-
year, continuing to 
reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, 
namely Google Ad Manager followed by 
AdMob. Other revenues for Google 
were $6.2 billion, up 40% year
-
over
-
year, fuelled by Cloud with an ongoing 
strong contribution from Play.
 
Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again in the primary driver of 
performance, with strong customer demand for our 
compute and data 
analytics products. G Suite continues to be a valid set of productivity and 
work transformation apps with the results benefiting from both new pricing 
and seed growth.
 
Play's results were driven by strong growth in a number of active 
buyers. 
Hardware benefited from the successful launch of our Pixel 3a smartphones. 
We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a 
sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
 
Total traffic acquisition c
osts were $7.2 billion or 22% of total advertising 
revenues, and up 13% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
advertising revenues was down year
-
over
-
year reflecting primarily a 
favourable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The sites TAC
 
rate 
increased year
-
over
-
year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to 
mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC free sites 
revenues, primarily from YouTube. In Q2, the network TAC rate declined 
year
-
on
-
year, primarily due 
to a favourable product mix shift.
 
Operating income was $10.4 billion, up 16% versus last year and the 
operating margin was 26.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.9 
billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centres followed by 
serv
ice.
 
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $162 million, 
primarily generated by Fiber and Verily with an operating loss of $989 
million. I'll note a couple of key recent accomplishments. Waymo now has 
over 1,000 active writers partici
pating in Waymo One and has reached 10 
billion miles driven in simulation. Waymo also announced that it has entered 
into an exclusive partnership with Renault and Nissan to explore driverless 
mobility services for passengers and deliveries in France and Ja
pan.
 
Loon was once again able to step in and provide connectivity in the 
aftermath of a natural disaster after the recent earthquake in Peru. This 
follows previous deployments of Loon after hurricanes in Puerto Rico and 
floods in Peru.
 
Let me now conclude 
with some comments about our longer
-
term outlook. 
Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to
-
date relative to the third quarter 
of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the third quarter. 
As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues and
 
operating income 
given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S.
 
Turning to revenues. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in our 
revenue growth, especially on a base of nearly $150 billion in revenues over 
the last 12 months.
 
With respect to Sites
 
revenues, the strength in the second quarter again 
reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine 
learning. We remain confident about the ongoing opportunity set. And within 
other revenues, once again Cloud was the largest d
river within other 
revenues and the third largest driver of revenue growth for Alphabet overall.
 
In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run 
rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver 
signific
ant growth. In terms of our hardware business, we were pleased with 
the reception of the Pixel 3a line
-
up of mid
-
tier smartphones in the second 
quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our newest devices, 
some of which we showcased at I/O.
 
Turning to profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses, the 
second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to 
investing for the long
-
term. At this point, we expect that our 2019 
headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018
 
rate, in other words slightly 
higher than we originally forecast for a couple of reasons. Strategically, we 
are increasing our hiring in Cloud and are incorporating the impact of the 
Looker acquisition, which we expect to close before the end of this year
.
 
And operationally, we're taking steps to optimize workforce deployment by 
moving certain customer support functions in
-
house, which is both OpEx 
neutral and enhances operational effectiveness. As a reminder, headcount 
additions tend to be seasonally high
er in Q3, because that is when we bring 
on new graduates.
 
In terms of sales and marketing, consistent with prior years, we expect sales 
and marketing to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year to 
support the holiday season. In Other Bets, we 
continue to invest 
meaningfully for the long
-
term opportunity we see.
 
Turning to CapEx and capital allocation. To give you more insight into our 
investment and capital expenditures, I will discuss the two major 
components of Google CapEx separately. First,
 
the majority of our Google 
CapEx is what we refer to as technical infrastructure, which consists of our 
investments for compute, storage and networking requirements and includes 
data center land and construction, servers and network equipment.
 
The second 
category of CapEx is for our office facilities, including 
acquisitions, ground
-
up development projects and related building 
improvements. In the last couple of years, within Google CapEx, on average 
approximately 70% was for technical infrastructure and 30
% was for office 
facilities.
 
Both, the split between the two components and year
-
on
-
year growth rates, 
can vary significantly from quarter
-
to
-
quarter, due primarily to the timing of 
sizable purchases of office facilities. For example, in Q1, technical 
infr
astructure was about 80% of Google CapEx; whereas in Q2, it accounts 
for about 60% due to the purchases of office facilities we made in the 
quarter.
 
As we discussed on the fourth quarter call, we believe there are two 
important factors when considering our
 
pace of CapEx investing. First, we 
expect the overall growth rate will moderate quite significantly for the full 
year 2019 versus 2018. Second, in terms of the mix within technical 
infrastructure, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center 
investments relative to servers in contrast to the ranking in 2018. Growth in 
technical infrastructure is designed to support, in particular, our efforts in 
machine learning across our businesses as well as to support growth in 
Cloud, Search and YouTube.
 
W
ith respect to capital allocation. Our primary use of capital continues to be 
to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility 
for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with 
a return of capital. As w
e indicated in our press release today, our Board has 
authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $25 billion of our Class C 
Capital Stock. In conclusion, we are confident about the opportunities ahead 
and continue to invest thoughtfully for the long 
term.
 
We will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric 
Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. And really appreci
ate all the additional 
commentary and disclosure in the remarks. I think investors will find that 
really helpful. Sundar maybe could you, one bigger picture question. A lot of 
innovation on the product side in the early part of this year. Now those 
product
s are going to start getting rolled out in the back part of this year 
and into 2020. Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what some 
of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying 
to drive after in terms of pushing
 
the organization to collaborate on product 
launches and leveraging the strength within Google?
 
And then the second part of the question would be, as you lower friction for 
consumers on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on 
the monetiz
ation site about how those product might resonate on the 
monetization piece? Thank you so much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks Eric. On 
--
 
in terms of the key investments, we still continue. We 
have been focused on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind
 
of 
a foundational investment we are making across the board, including getting 
a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques et cetera across the board. 
So it's an important area we are focused on. And making sure, digging 
deeper to push our products to
 
be more helpful is the main theme, by which 
we are evaluating everything we do.
 
Beyond that be it, the focus on cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to 
scale up YouTube including being focused on content responsibility. These 
are all some of the ke
y things we are doing. And of course deep focus on 
Search and Assistant being a core part of everything we do.
 
In terms of the work we are doing on consumers and the impact it has on 
monetization. And I do think they go hand
-
in
-
hand as we are making the 
ex
perience better for customers, including on products like Discover. So just 
getting information to them more seamlessly when they need it, I think they 
all tend to have a commercial aspect at the right intent when users are 
interested in it. And so we alwa
ys see them go hand
-
to
-
hand. And so taking 
a long
-
term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And just building a bit of that question and the impact from some of the 
announcements that you've seen from us. To just 
comment a bit on the 
impact from Google Marketing Live that Sundar referenced at the outset. I 
think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announced new 
changes to products and features and most ads product launches are 
introduced in phases as 
advertisers initially experiment with new formats. 
And so as a result the new products that were announced at GML typically 
are adopted over time.
 
And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the 
new ads products we announced to GM
L last quarter, given they offer great 
new user experiences across new services, we don't view this year's slate of 
launches differently from introductions made in previous years.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes fro
m Douglas Anmuth from 
JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping Ruth, you could just 
talk a bit more about the accelerating growth that you saw in 2Q relative to 
the slowdown that we saw in 1Q.
 
It seems certainly in the previous quarter 
to skew more to the Google Search site than YouTube. I was just hoping you 
could provide little more clarity on maybe how the product changes that 
you've talked about in the past played out across 1Q and 2Q. And 
then just 
Sundar on user privacy and control over data, that was certainly a key 
theme across the multiple events in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you 
balance those initiatives as you're rolling out products going forward? 
Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, starting
 
first with the strength in sites revenue. The strength we talked 
about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we 
discussed previously. And I tried to really call that out in opening comments. 
And part is the benefit from applying machi
ne learning to both the user and 
advertiser experience. And it really just 
--
 
I'm echoing a lot of what we said 
in prior quarters the last quarters where we remain very positive about the 
opportunity set.
 
We introduced product changes only after extensive 
testing, which means 
there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen, but 
are very positive about the opportunity set. And overall as it relates to both 
Search and YouTube strength, I would just to add on YouTube revenue 
growth for Y
ouTube was strong in the first quarter. In fact, we called it out 
as the second largest driver of revenue growth across Alphabet. And in the 
second quarter, YouTube was again the second largest contributor of 
revenue growth. And really pleased with the ong
oing momentum that we're 
seeing here.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On user privacy and control, it's always been a big focus for us in some of 
the things we recently announced. Initiative is underway for example like 
federated learning for almost three years. So, going f
orward, I think you'll 
continue to see us focus on. I think it's one of the most important areas we 
are working on. But I think with AI, we are excited that we can give better 
experiences for users with less data over time. And those are the kind of 
direct
ions we are pushing. We are also 
--
 
you'll see us continue to work hard 
to simplify user understanding of how their data is used and giving them 
better controls and making it more easy for them to manage and making 
sure more users actually exercise those c
ontrols. So, those are all our goals 
and we'll continue focusing on that as we move forward.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Thank you both.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit 
Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Okay. Thank yo
u. So, Ruth in regards to the Cloud $8 billion annual run rate 
commentary, just wondering if we can get some clarifications there. Does 
this include GCP as well as G Suite?
 
And further is this apples
-
to
-
apples to I guess the $1 billion that you 
--
 
I 
think 
Sundar talked about, I think that was during the fourth quarter of 
2017. And any other comments you can add there in terms of the mix 
between I guess the more GCP versus the more traditional G Suite? Thank 
you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. So, it does include the entir
e business that Thomas Kurian is leading. 
Our Cloud business that includes both GCP and G Suite. And it is on an 
apples
-
to
-
apples basis. It continues to be the business the cloud business.
 
We're not breaking out the components of cloud as I tried to indica
te in 
opening comments, pleased with the performance of both GCP and G Suite. 
Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and 
data analytics products and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I 
noted in the opening comments, wi
th the results benefiting from both new 
pricing and [C] [ph] growth.
 
And overall, GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet 
and we're really pleased with how the team is executing on both.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. 
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you very much. And I'll just echo people's comments about the 
new disclosure. That's much appreciated. So thank you so much for sharing
. 
I wanted to ask, Sundar, how you've seen your go
-
to
-
market and 
partnership strategies change under Thomas?
 
It does seem that Google has become the more friendly cloud company, if 
you will, from a 
--
 
when you think about partnering with other software 
com
panies. And I'm wondering if there's any tangible benefits you can point 
to because of this, whether it's in win rates or partner momentum or 
anything else that you can call out.
 
And then, I also wanted to ask, you obviously made the acquisition of Looker 
recently. How are you thinking about organic versus inorganic product 
development? And I'm just wondering, has the thought process there 
changed with Thomas running the business now? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Heather. I appreciate it. Definitely go
-
to
-
market, Thomas has been 
heavily focused on it. Mainly with the realization that we are very 
competitive when we are there in the banks. And so, focusing on how we 
can scale up and really build a customer
-
facing organization.
 
So, we are investing heavily
, be it in sales, service, partner and operational 
teams. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are looking to 
triple the size of our sales force over the next few years. And we are doing it 
aggressively in major markets around the world.
 
Some spec
ifics, we did launch our new partner program Partner Advantage. 
The ASAP relationship has been super important to us. And so, we have 
really focused on that, helping many customers make us care for. Home 
Depot, Cardinal Health, are some examples of that. A
nd a big part of it has 
been really expanding our customer
-
facing bench.
 
Several new senior executive hires in addition to our new Global Head of 
Sales. We recently added a 25
-
year customer experience veteran to build 
out our customer support. So I think, 
you're good to see that focus of being 
--
 
serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to 
building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is what 
we do. And so, that's going to be a focus for us.
 
In terms of the se
cond question about organic and 
--
 
versus inorganic. I 
think we are clearly focused on the areas where we are differentiated. Data 
and business analytics was a key, data management and analytics is a key 
area for us. And as part of that, we looked at gaps 
we have, which would 
help us complete the solution offering we have there for customers.
 
And that's what drove the Looker acquisition. So we'll be customer focused. 
And to the extent we see gaps there 
--
 
gaps anywhere, we'll obviously look 
at doing it in
-
h
ouse, versus whether there's an attractive opportunity outside 
and take it on a case
-
by
-
case basis. But that's where it will come from.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. 
Your line is now 
open.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Can I try two questions, please. Ruth 
-
 
first, Ruth, just any color on that 25 
billion share repurchase authorization, why 25, not 20, not 30, any color 
there. And then, when you think about ad business. We've seen this nice 
acceleration
 
in Q2, but that's kind of back to norm. There's still this question 
about what happened in Q1. Was there something that happened in Q1 that 
you needed to correct in Q2? Is it just the normal rhythms of the search in 
YouTube and advertising businesses? So 
I find Q1 still a little bit of a 
question mark. Q2 seems like very much the norm with the last several 
years. So any color on what could have transpired in Q1 then that required a 
fix in Q2? Thanks a lot.
 
Ruth Porat
 
I'll answer them in reverse order. I tr
ied to comment on that last quarter 
and reiterated again this quarter. We are pleased with the ongoing 
momentum in the business. And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that 
as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business and we've 
t
alked about that, we introduced product changes only after extensive 
testing and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates as 
you've seen.
 
And so we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is 
extremely focused on ensuring
 
we're delivering for users and advertisers. 
And as we're looking out, we talked in the past we have introduced over 100 
enhancements to the user set every quarter and no unchanged drives 
results.
 
And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing varia
bility and our 
view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long
-
term and the quality that we can deliver. So there's really not much more to 
add there.
 
And then on the capital return. I guess, the main point is we went back to 
thi
s year, we're staying with the same capital allocation framework we've 
talked with you about before. The primary thing is we remain focused on 
investing for long
-
term growth and the primary use of capital really is to 
support that growth.
 
And then the seco
nd use is really to support acquisitions and investments as 
we've already been talking about. And given the 
--
 
our outlook on cash, our 
view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our 
program four times since we began the progra
m in 2015, and pleased to 
have the opportunity to announce another increase here today. The $25 
billion and I think the main point is we view the repurchase program as an 
effective use of capital.

Okay. Thanks, Ruth.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And ou
r next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth your color 
on YouTube was really helpful on being the second largest driver this quarter 
and 
last quarter. I guess with that as a backdrop with the overall 
acceleration, can you just give us a couple examples, what types of products 
or advertisers segments or regions resonate particularly well on YouTube 
this quarter versus last quarter?
 
And then 
a question for Sundar or Ruth. This has been recent announcement 
in press about children safety on YouTube. And so I guess I'm just curious to 
hear for advertisers and parents on the call, what steps have you taken to 
really make sure that YouTube is safe 
for kids. And what are the biggest 
areas you're focused on to make sure it stays that way? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given 
your question. I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in 
t
he first quarter and again strong here in the second quarter.
 
To clarify, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last 
quarter, regarding sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy 
enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negli
gible impact on YouTube 
revenues. Just to be a really clear. The revenue growth was strong last 
quarter. And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy 
enforcement in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube 
ecosystem, we do 
remain focus and taking the right steps in line with our 
goals, regardless of impact on the revenues. But an important point is to the 
removal of content that violates our policies have virtually no impact on 
YouTube revenues. I just wanted to make sure th
at was clear. So, consistent 
growth here.
 
Going into your 
--
 
the first part of your question. Where is that growth? 
Again, I'm going to reiterate what we've talked about on prior calls that we 
continue to see substantial growth in direct response. So, bran
d advertising 
is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. But 
really I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see 
substantial growth in direct response.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And on your important question about k
ids' safety, as part of our content 
responsibility work it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will 
see us 
--
 
this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids 
and it's a product you're going to see us focus more and conti
nue to evolve, 
add more curated content there, and make sure it's safe for kids and give 
parents peace of mind.
 
Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family
-
oriented 
content on the main YouTube app as well. So, all the work we are d
oing be it 
the work we are doing to just remove that content raise up authoritative 
content higher quality content and reducing the step of harming content all 
applies everywhere and we're really focused on it. Rewarding trusted 
creators is a big way we ca
n help 
--
 
ensuring greater to produce content 
which is great for children rewinding them. It's also an important goal for us.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO 
Capital Markets. Your line is 
now open.
 
Dan Salmon
 
All right. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe 
that's for Ruth, but Sundar feel free to jump in. The first one here is based 
on a couple of comments you reminded us in your prepared remarks about 
YouTube whic
h was the inclusion of Originals and YouTube TV in the Google 
Preferred inventory.
 
You've given us a little bit of color on direct response growth at YouTube 
over the last little while. Can we assume that those two additions were a bit 
of a boost to the br
and advertising side of the business as that's more 
inventory available for that for that sort of high
-
quality type of brand 
orientation that TV advertisers are looking for?
 
And then just second coming back to Google Marketing Live notwithstanding 
your com
ments Ruth that it take some time for products to be adopted. 
There are maybe one or two out of those announcements there that you 
would highlight as being potentially particularly material over the longer 
term? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the first in ter
ms of YouTube for brand, I would say it's more secular 
across the platform promoting higher
-
quality content, our work on brand 
safety, content, responsibility adds up to it. Also creators just generating 
better content. I think all have played a part and I
 
would say it's more 
crosscutting.
 
On the second thing on Gmail in terms of things we were excited about. To 
me be discovery ads and gallery ads, I mean they're both pushing us 
towards mobile first visually
-
rich immersive ad formats, which also offers a 
re
ally great user experience. So I think I'm excited about changes like that 
and I think they have the potential. There is advertiser excitement. But as 
Ruth mentioned it's early days and I think we rollout now, it takes time to 
play out. But we definitely s
ee excitement there.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Great. Thanks, Sundar.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line 
is now open.
 
Mark May
 
Thank you. Well, first is for Sundar. I think earlier Ruth had mentioned the 
importance of machi
ne learning for driving growth in the quarter, and I'm 
sure in many recent quarters. I believe many have a hard time 
understanding exactly what that means. And I was hoping you might provide 
a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging ma
chine 
learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and 
advertisers?
 
And then secondly for Ruth in terms of the sites TAC, I know there are a lot 
of variables that go in the changes in sites TAC. But when you look at the 
puts and t
akes, how do you see that trending over the next year or two? 
Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
For us, machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user 
experience and part of ads too. Generally using machine learning to simplify 
things for 
advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better 
insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the ad sites. So, for example, 
processing complex datasets and giving back sophisticated real
-
time insights 
really helps make a difference. And also on 
the front end for marketers, 
helping them find the right creator for every moment, helping them manage 
bidding in real
-
time. And so every step in the consumer journey, I think 
machine learning is just making things more efficient, more easier to use 
and dr
iving productivity for them. So that's what plays out through our 
systems.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of the TAC rate. As we've talked about previously, the growth 
in mobile does put upward pressure in the sites TAC rate and that was the 
primary driver of the
 
year
-
on
-
year increase in the second quarter. And we 
do expect the underlying trend to continue given the ongoing growth in 
mobile.
 
Mark May
 
Thanks
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. 
Your line is now open.
 
Coli
n Sebastian
 
Thanks. A couple for me as well. First off, as you embrace more commerce 
and payments on the platform broadly speaking along with the new ad 
formats you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates 
might play in terms of future
 
initiatives and revenue growth?
 
And then secondly on Assistant and Duplex, in terms of near
-
term Search 
innovation, I wonder if you could characterize how important that is in terms 
of the momentum you're seeing and longer term, how this might impact 
plat
form monetization? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the first question, I think it's a good question. There's a lot of discovery 
that happens across Google's properties and including Search and YouTube. 
And so anything we can do to make sure users have a better
 
experience 
when they are interested in transacting will have a big role.
 
So there's a lot more work underway to make sure payments work better. 
Sign in works better. Payments works better. All of that I think will be 
--
 
over the long
-
term will be drivers,
 
because it improves overall user expense 
especially for commercial clicks.
 
In terms of Assistant and Duplex, I mean, for us Assistant is where we can 
clearly see we can really push our goal of being more helpful to users, 
helping them get things done, inc
luding things that matter in the real word. 
And so, that's what we are focused on. And if we get that right, just like with 
the Search, there are many things which users want to get done, which do 
have commercial intent to them. And I think that's the valu
e
-
creation 
opportunity as well. But we are focused on making sure the user experience 
constantly gets better and we are investing to get there.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of 
America
 
Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Thank you. Sundar, there's been a lot of regulatory news lately, 
especially from the DOJ. Just wondering how you think about a more intense 
regulatory environment. Getting a lot of questions and won
dering, if you 
think about that, really affecting Google operations. And then, Ruth, 
definitely nice acceleration across the board. Of course, Europe accelerated 
as well. When you think about GDPR implementation last year and you're 
lapping that, is that h
elping Europe at all? Or was there really no impact 
from GDPR? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the regulatory question, we understand that there will be scrutiny. We 
are 
-
 
we will engage constructively. It's not new to us. We have participated 
in these process
es before. Today we do operate under a lot of regulation, be 
it on privacy, be it on competition, be it on copyright, intellectual property, 
et cetera.
 
And even in the U.S., we have engaged in the process before to the extent 
we have to answer questions, w
e will do so constructively. And to the extent 
there are concerns, we'll address them as well. But I think, for me, it's 
important that we stay focused on building helpful products to users and 
that's the value we ultimately provide our users. And I think 
that's what we'll 
stay focused on as a company.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018. 
We think it's, obviously, a critical area, making sure we get it right. That's at 
the overall impact of regulation on cons
umers and businesses, is it still 
playing out. And we're very focused on making sure we're doing what's best 
for users and ensuring we're compliant with the law, not based on any 
potential revenue impact.
 
Justin Post
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And 
our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from 
Barclays. Your line is now open.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hey guys. If I can squeeze two in real quick. Ruth, the Google segment 
operating profit was up 16%. That's the highest growth rate in about two 
years.
 
So, I guess, how should we think about the cadence of that relative to 
your comments about the headcount growth in the Looker acquisition 
looking forward?
 
And then Sundar, at I/O you mentioned that active Android installed base is 
now over 2.5 billion. Th
at's up about 10% year
-
on
-

coming from emerging markets. So, I guess, just big picture, how do we 
think about the growth rates that you can sustain in mobile search revenue 
relative to that 10% active Android growth rate? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yeah. Thanks for that. I tried to enumerate the things as we're looking 
forward very much to your question. Our overall long
-
term investment thesis 
is unchanged. We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing 
growth we see across Googl
e in particular as we're talking about in Search 
while we're also investing to build new businesses most notably in Cloud as 
we've talked a lot about here today.
 
And across all of Alphabet, we do continue to benefit from machine learning 
that's both OpEx a
nd CapEx. And as we both commented given the 
opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the 
business, we are continuing to invest.
 
Our lens on the pace of investing does have three facets in it. First is 
investing at the appropria
te pace to support long
-
term earnings growth. And 
then we were very focused second on optimizing investments within each 
product area. And finally, as we've talked about investing to support 
operational excellence.
 
But the mega point is that we are excited
 
about the long
-
term opportunity 
and we're continuing to invest which is why in opening comments, I wanted 
to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing 
investments and across the business the increases in headcount and the 
reasons for
 
them at the benefits of those investments as well as sales and 
marketing and the fact that that is back half loaded and 
--
 
back half 
weighted I should say. And so try to lay out the relevant points for you to 
ensure that we make it very clear. We are comm
itted to continue to invest 
for what we see as a long
-
term opportunities.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And on the mobile question, we are definitely investing in Android with a 
focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience 
continues to evol
ve. In terms of the mobile experience, I still think from a 
user standpoint, there's a lot of information overload. So, being helpful to 
users and helping them navigate it be it Search, Assistant, Maps, and 
YouTube I think we are focused on the opportuniti
es there.
 
And in terms of the next billion users there's a lot of headroom there over 
time and we are focused on. That's why we take efforts like Android Go 
seriously. We are constantly working hard to lower the barrier so that more 
people can benefit from
 
being online and participating in the digital economy 
and so it will continue to be a focus for us.

Sundar Pichai
 
Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon.
 
Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven 
by mobile search, YouTube, and Clo
ud. We celebrated Google's 21st birthday 
this quarter. While our mission to organize the world's information and make 
it universally accessible and useful hasn't changed, we've evolved from a 
company that helps people find answers to a company that helps y
ou get 
things done.
 
Since the beginning, we've always invested in tackling deep computer 
science problems that can have a significant impact on society. The chance 
to be part of these fundamental engineering challenges is why so many 
people want to work at
 
Google. In just the last week we have announced 
two significant advances. First, powered by our long
-
term investment in AI, 
we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask 
Google Search. It's the biggest leap forward for search in t
he past five years. 

-
based technique for 
natural language processing called BERT, which recognizes subtle patterns in 
language and provides more relevant results.
 
Second, we recently announced a majo
r quantum computing milestone. I 
was extraordinarily proud to visit our team in Santa Barbara. To 
demonstrate supremacy, Google's 53
-
qubit quantum machine Sycamore, 
successfully performed a test computation in just 200 seconds that would 
have taken the mos
t powerful supercomputers much longer time to 

represents a distinct milestone in our effort to harness the principles of 
quantum mechanics, to solve computational problems.
 
Turning from q
uantum to the quarter. Today, I'll talk about the momentum 
we saw across the business in the last three months. First, Cloud. We saw 

September, we announced a landmark partnership with Ma
yo Clinic. Using 
Google Cloud to secure and store data and understand insights at scale, 
Mayo Clinic will partner with us in many ways. Together, we'll work to 
transform patient and clinician experiences, identify new methods of 
diagnosing diseases, conduc
t clinical research, and find new models for 
delivering patient care.
 
National Australia Bank recently added Google Cloud to its multi
-
cloud 
strategy to help the company better use data and deliver new and improved 
customer experiences. Deutsche Börse Grou
p, the fourth largest stock 
exchange group worldwide relies on Google Cloud to help them navigate the 
twin challenge of modernizing their digital operations and addressing 
significant regulatory requirements.
 
Retailers are also turning to cloud solutions t
o help make the shopping 
experience as seamless and personalized as possible. For example, Macy's 
uses Google Cloud to streamline their operations from the distribution center 
to the shop floor.
 
Public sector customers are modernizing their IT systems with
 
Google Cloud 
with great results. For example, the state of Arizona already has more than 
36,000 employees using our products to increase productivity, efficiency and 
security. And this quarter, it further extended our relationship.
 
We continue to extend o
ur cloud services through partners, including a new 
solution that enables customers to run VMware workloads on GCP for the 
first time. We announced the cloud region in Nevada. When it launches in 
2020, it will be our 7th cloud region in the U.S. We also an
nounced a new 
cloud region in Poland, our 7th in Europe.
 
Turning to Google's product that people use every day. We're excited about 
new features lunched in maps, including detailed voice guidance while 
walking that will make it possible for people who have
 
vision impairments or 
are blind, get around more easily. New tool that will allow users to see all of 
their flight and hotel reservations in one place. And another new feature that 
gives transit riders in 30 countries the ability to see ridesharing and bi
king 
options near their bus or train stop.
 
In Search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users 
to find key moments in videos, easily find products within images via Google 
Lens, and discover new podcast.
 
Our hardware business is still i

build the business and a portfolio of helpful products. Two weeks ago, we 
unveiled our new Made by Google product lineup, bringing together the best 
of hardware, software, and AI.
 
Our new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL a
re the first phones with motion sense. This 
allows users to use natural gestures to get things done without touching 
their phone. The new Google Assistant now gives users the ability to switch 
seamlessly between apps, all by voice. And the new Pixelbook Go
 
provides 
many of the great features of our premium Pixelbook at a more affordable 
price point. We also unveiled a new, more powerful Nest Mini speaker and 
Nest WiFi. Finally, the team is looking forward to launching Pixel Buds, first 
truly wireless headph
ones, as well Stadia, our streaming gaming platform, 
which will soon be available in the U.S., UK, Canada and throughout Europe.
 
We are encouraged by the positive product reviews so far. With the holidays 
coming up, I think that's a gift for everyone on yo
ur list.
 
On to YouTube. Keeping YouTube safe for our users, creatives and partners, 
while preserving the openness of our platform is our top priority. This 
quarter, we continued to update our community guidelines and enforcement 
to protect users from harmf
ul content and will keep doing this work. 
YouTube Music and YouTube Premium continue to expand globally and are 
now available in 71 countries. In September, YouTube launched its new 
fashion and beauty destination called YouTube/Fashion. It's designed to 
me
et the growing demand from consumers for better ways to explore and 
connect with some of YouTube's biggest fashion and beauty creatives.
 
And I want to emphasize that as we build all these helpful products, we are 
committed to giving users more control of t
heir data. This quarter, we 
extended one of our most popular features in Chrome and YouTube, called 
Incognito Mode to Maps. We expanded our auto
-
delete controls to YouTube 
history. These controls already enable people to set their location history 
and web 
and app activity to be deleted automatically after 3 or 18 months. 

It's a new feature that tells users if any of their passwords are weak, if 
they've been reused across multiple sites
, or if they've been compromised 
somewhere on the web.
 
Now, moving on to how we are helping advertisers. We are bringing our 
strengths in machine learning to help advertisers build their ad campaigns. 
Machine learning power tools like search auto bidding a
re gaining traction. In 

auto bidding. We now have more than 1 million advertisers using responsive 
search apps, and ad format, we launched a year ago that uses machine 
learning to 
create the right ad for each search queries. And our new Video 
Reach campaigns allow marketers to upload multiple video ads into a single 
campaign. From there, we use machine learning to serve the most efficient 
combination of these ads to help brands reac
h audiences at scale.
 
This quarter, we expanded inventory for our very popular App Campaigns to 
include new services, including YouTube search, display video ads and the 
Discover feed. We also launched YouTube masthead ads for TV, which 
enable advertisers 
to reach audiences right when they open the YouTube 
app on their connected TVs, one of its fastest
-
growing screens.
 

fair across all media and that delivers insights in a way that f
ully protects 

next generation of Google Analytics unifies web and app measurement 
reporting for the first time to help businesses understand which channel is 
driving the best resul
t.
 
On a personal note, I was in Dallas in October, there I saw firsthand how 
important Google is in helping small and medium
-
sized businesses grow. I 
got to visit Peacock Alley a bedding and bath manufacturer in Dallas with 75 

using Google ads for over 15 years to help drive 
traffic to their stores. Their ecommerce has grown 52% in the past year. 
They credit the guidance Google Analytics provides as well as Google 
Shopping and Product Listing Ads for that growth.
 
This isn't the 
only way we help small businesses grow and thrive. Our Grow 
with Google program has helped train 3 million Americans in digital skills, 
including small business owners and entrepreneurs. Just a few weeks ago, 
we announced that our IT professional support c
ertificate training course will 
expand to 100 community colleges. It's already helped tens of thousands of 
people pursue fast
-
growing, well
-

see more community colleges offer this pathway to students.
 
Finally, to ro
und out a busy quarter. Sustainability has always been a core 
value for us. And I'm proud that we have been carbon neutral since 2007. In 
September, we announced the biggest corporate purchase of renewable 

ting renewable energy 
portfolio by more than 40%. These purchases are happening globally, 
spurring the construction of more than $2 billion in new energy 
infrastructure including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind 
turbines across three continent
s.
 
And at our hardware event, we announced that we're committing to roughly 
$150 million in renewable energy projects in key manufacturing regions. Our 
hope is that this will spur even greater investments in sustainability.
 
So, it's been a really great qua
rter. A personal highlight for me was our Take 
Our Parents to Work Day, which we held in September at our main campus 
in Mountain View. It was great to see thousands of parents take such pride 
in what their kids are building. I feel the same way. None of o
ur work would 
be possible without our Googlers around the world. This quarter was another 
great example of the mission that brings us all together. Thank you.
 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Sundar.
 
In the third quarter, total revenue
s of $40.5 billion were up 20% year
-
on
-
year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven 
by ongoing strength in mobile search, YouTube and Cloud.
 
I will begin with the review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for 
Alphabet, focu
sing on year
-
over
-
year changes. I will then review results for 
Google, followed by other Bets and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I 
will then take your questions.
 

available in our e
arnings press release.
 
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of 
revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was 
$17.6 billion, up 23% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a 
consolidated basis was $
10.1 billion, up 31% year
-
over
-
year, primarily 
driven by Google
-
related expenses. The biggest contributor again this 
quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations 
including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, prim
arily for 
YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our 
newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which 
have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line also includes 
the impact of hardware cost
s, primarily associated with our mid
-
tier Pixel 3a 
smartphones.
 
Operating expenses were $13.8 billion, with headcount growth being the 
largest driver of year
-
on
-
year growth for both R&D and sales and marketing, 
which is reflected in both compensation and f
acilities expenses.
 
With respect to R&D, the growth was again driven by the addition of 
engineering talent, consistent with our focus on product innovation. The 
increase in G&A year
-
over
-
year was primarily due to a $554 million charged 
from our previously 
announced legal settlements in France.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. Headcount was up 6,450 
from the second quarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of 
new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product are
as, 
the most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical 
and sales roles. Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 6% year
-
over
-
year 
for an operating margin up 23%.
 
Other income and expense was a loss of $549 million, which primarily 
re
flects the impact of unrealized losses and marketable equity securities. As 
of September 30, the unrealized equity gain in the combined portfolio of 
marketable and nonmarketable securities was $5.8 billion. We provide more 
detail on the line items within O
I&E in our earnings press release. Net 
income was $7.1 billion and earnings per diluted share were $10.12.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $6.7 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. 
Operat
ing cash flow was $15.5 billion with free cash flow of $8.7 billion. We 
ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately 
$121 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $
40.3 billion, up 20% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $28.6 billion in the quarter, 
up 19% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by 
mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube 
followed by desktop 
search.
 
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 8% year
-
on
-
year, continuing to 
reflect the performance as a primary drivers of growth within network, 
namely, Google Ad manager followed by AdMob. Other revenues for Google 
were $6.4 billio
n, up 39% year
-
over
-
year, once again fueled by Cloud, 
followed by a strong performance from Play. Within Cloud growth in GCP was 
once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand 
for our compute and data analytics products, complemen
ted by ongoing 
growth in G Suite, reflecting both new pricing and seat growth.
 
Within Play, performance was driven once again by growth in the number of 
active buyers. In addition, the line reflects hardware, which continued to 
benefit from the launch of o
ur Pixel 3a mid
-
tier smartphones.
 
We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a 
sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total 
traffic acquisition costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertisin
g 
revenues and up 14% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
advertising revenues was down year
-
over
-
year, reflecting primarily a 
favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites.
 
The sites TAC rate increased year
-
over
-
year, primarily due to t
he impact of 
the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC partially offset by the 
growth in TAC
-
free sites revenues, primarily from YouTube. In Q3, the 
network TAC rate declined year
-
on
-
year, primarily due to a favorable 
product mix shift.
 
Google 
operating income was $10.9 billion, up 14% versus last year and the 
operating margin was 26.9%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was 
$7.2 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers, 
followed by servers. Investments in office 
facilities included the $1 billion 
acquisition of a portfolio of buildings in Sunnyvale, and the purchase of two 
buildings to expand our presence in the Seattle area.
 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. Revenues were $155 million, 
primarily generat
ed by Fiber and Verily. Other Bets had an operating loss of 
$941 million. I'll note a couple of key accomplishments in Other Bets. At 
Waymo, we're extending fully driverless opportunities on a small scale to 
participants in our early rider program in Metro
 
Phoenix. We're also testing 
long
-
haul truck driving on Arizona freeways. And we're continuing to test 
Waymo vehicles in various geographies, the newest of which is heavy rain 
testing in southern Florida. In addition, we have begun 3D mapping in Los 
Angele
s.
 
And two weeks ago, Wing launched its first commercial drone delivery 
service to homes in Virginia in partnership with FedEx, Walgreens, and local 
Virginia retailer Sugar Magnolia. Wing is now operating on three continents 
in early test deliveries.
 
I wil
l sum up with a few observations on the quarter and our longer term 
outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar today relative to the fourth 
quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the fourth 
quarter of 2019. As a reminder, fo
reign exchange headwinds affect both 
revenues and operating income, given the majority of our expenses are in 
the U.S.
 
With respect to revenues, we're pleased with the performance of our 
advertising business. As a reminder, there is variability in year
-
ove
r
-
year 
revenue growth rates from quarter
-
to
-

manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis, and we 
remain very
-
focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and 
advertisers over the long
 
term. Within other revenues, in addition to 
continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from 
data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing 
BigQuery. Cloud continued to see significant growth in each region gl
obally.
 
Our new lineup of Made by Google hardware was announced two weeks ago 
with pixel 4 hitting store shelf late last week. With the introduction of the 
Pixel 3a in the second quarter, we expect the seasonality of our hardware 
business to be moderated s
omewhat.
 
Turning to elements of our profitability. With regard to Google operating 
expenses. While headcount growth on an absolute basis in the third quarter 
was usually high, reflecting the addition of new college hires, we do remain 
on pace for 
headcount growth in 2019 to be in line with growth in 2018. Our 
investments in talent support innovation across our businesses and in 
particular support our ongoing momentum in cloud.
 

, 
these expenses are typically more heavily weighted toward the back half of 
the year and tend to be particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support 
the holiday season. In Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully and 
thoughtfully for the long
-
term opportunities that we see.
 
Turning to capital allocation and CapEx. With respect to capital returns, 
consistent with announcing an increase in our stock buyback authorization 
last quarter to $25 billion, we were pleased to step up repurchase levels by
 
nearly 60% to $5.7 billion in the third quarter. In terms of CapEx, as a 
reminder, over the last couple of years, the split between technical 
infrastructure and office facilities has averaged approximately 70% to 30%. 
Due to the sizable purchases of offic
e facilities we made in Q3, technical 
infrastructure accounted for only about 60% of total CapEx and continued to 
be more heavily weighted to data center construction and servers.
 
Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of CapEx investment will 
c
ontinue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support 
ongoing demand for machine learning across our business as well as for 
Cloud, Search and YouTube. At this scale of investment, we remain very
-
focused on driving efficiency through fle
et optimization and tight 
management of our supply chain.
 
In conclusion, we remain confident about the opportunities ahead. Sundar 
and I will now take your questions.

Operator
 
[Operator instructions] And our first question comes
 
from Eric Sheridan from 
UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. First, Sundar, big 
picture question. It feels like the concept of the ambient computing was sort 
of prevalent at the Made by Google eve
nt recently. It started with sort of a 
bit of a shift in theme, what I could tell at Google I/O earlier this year. Can 
you just talk about what some of the key investments you want to make to 
capitalize on that opportunity into long
-
term? How you think Goo
gle and 
maybe broader Alphabet is positioned to capitalize on that? How it might 
show up at the product services layer? So, I guess, maybe a three
-
part 
question, more of a bigger picture nature.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Eric. We are very excited by the vision
 
of ambient computing and 
evolving that. I think, it's a continuity in the sense that over time computing 
should be more intuitive to users and computing should adapt to users, not 
the other way around. And the foundations of all of this is all the work we
 
have done with our computing platforms till date and under successful 
consumer services and developer platforms we have built. And I think that's 
the most of the investments there. The phones will continue to be at the 
center of ambient computing for the 
future. So, that's another important 
piece where we are already invested in.
 
I think, as we expand beyond and that's what the Made by Google family is 
focused on, products in your home with our Nest family of products, and 
wearables which we do with Wear O
S and so on. So, supporting that 
ecosystem, so whether you're at home or on the go or at work, and making 
sure it works.
 
Our investments in the AI across the Company, I think, will end up playing a 
key role, AI and Assistant. I think, they'll be at the cen
ter of making sure we 
can anticipate what users want and serve them better.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line 
is now open.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Sundar, you talked about the new neural network techniques talking about 
th
e biggest breakthrough in Search in years. Could you just help us 

of the business yet or how that can play out going forward?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Anytime 
--
 

T, which is the name of the technique 

we can better make sense of queries, we can serve users better, our search 

--
 
engage more. So, it
's part 
of a long run sort of things we've been working on, but this is one of our 
bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the search experience and 
search quality. And remember, it will help us in a certain set of queries. 
There are many queries 

capture nuance and help understand human context better. And so, I would 
just characterize this as a big improvement, which improves search quality 
and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage mor
e.
 
Of course, a lot of times, we take the same techniques, and sometimes it 
makes sense on the app side, and down the line, machine learning 
techniques. And we'll deploy it there as well.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldm
an Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini
 
I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you made about 
Cloud, Sundar. I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the 
size of your GCP backlog. And maybe even if you just talk about the 
trajectory, and h
ow that's changed over the course of the last year? And 
then, you mentioned the strength and the uptake of BigQuery, I'm just 
trying to think through how we should think of the margin, level of a service 
like this versus the traditional compute offerings w
here you've seen strength 
to date. And just wondering, if we start to see some positive mix shifts 
benefits, as some of these premium products start to start to ramp more 
aggressively? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Heather. Overall, I know, we gave some
 
visibility into our cloud 
business and we'll continue to do that periodically. And the momentum has 
been great. Obviously, ever since Thomas has come in, he has continued to 

pa
rtner and operational teams. And, it's playing out well. In this business, 
it's important for you to be in as many deal situations as possible and get 
those wins, which accrues over time. And so, we are definitely seeing the 
momentum.
 
Analytics is a huge a
rea of strength for us. And it's an area, which Thomas 
has a lot of expertise in as well. And BigQuery is such a strong product, so 
it's a natural area, we are seeing strength. And my sense is, as we get 
--
 
if I 
look at the TAM, the percentage of TAM for w
hich we were eligible, 
compared to two years ago to last year to now, that number is shifting 
aggressively due to either completing our product feature set or be 
completing some of the certifications we need. And so, I think, there are 
several strong forwa
rd
-
looking indicators and look forward to sharing more 
at the right time.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. 
Your line is now open.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Can I just ask you to draw a little bit more out on Google 
Maps? I know 

stage where it's going to be better integrated into the 
--
 
I don't know, the 
purchase path or whatever, you're making it easier for small businesses to 
tap into what
 
should be really nicely qualified leads. Just talk about the pace 
at which that 
--
 
the monetization of that or just the ad opportunities will be 
offered to small businesses? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
In general, local is an important area for us, and we ar
e continuing to invest 
in building experience that connects merchants, advertisers and users. 
Google My Business has been our major effort there. Today millions of 
businesses are 
--
 
reach and engage, both through Search and Maps. 
Specifically, in GML, we a

presume that's what you're talking about. It's still early. And in general, we 
want to make it easier for advertisers, particularly SMBs to come to Google 
and be able to reach users across our set of owned and 
operated properties. 
So, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps, and that's the 
way we envision that. But, small and medium business is a big area of focus 
and maps represents a big, long
-
term opportunity for us.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And just to add
 
on there, given you referenced back to GML, and I think we 
talked about this last quarter as well. Our view is that the products that were 
introduced to GML, this year, like in previous years, they're rolled out in 
phases, they're adopted over time. And s
o, we don't view the potential 
impact from this year's slate differently than the impact from products that 
were launched at previous events, and so just to kind of keep that in 
perspective.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deu
tsche Bank. 
Your line is now open.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
I wanted to ask another one about new product you guys announced earlier 
this year at GML. And that was really Google Shopping and moving that 
across some of the new different properties like YouTube and Im
age Search 
and Discover. Can you give us a sense for where you are in that migration, 
kind of over what timeframe should we be thinking about that? And then, 
maybe just elaborate a bit on the long
-
term vision of moving shopping 
functionality into propertie
s like YouTube and how you think that experience 
will evolve? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

call commercial user journeys across Google. Obviously Search is an 
important area, Image Sear
ch, YouTube, Maps all great surfaces by which I 
think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest, looking to 

more holistically about what are those experiences and how can 
we make it 
better. That involves helping improve the Discovery experience, but when 
people are interested in it, being able to make it easier to transact. So, the 
equivalent of being signed and being able to pay when you want and then of 
course the fulfill
ment and logistics. So, we're thinking through the end to 
end experience across all our surfaces and are investing. But, I see the user 

ahead.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And again, these are still e

--
 


stages of testing.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now ope
n.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Ruth, I think you mentioned the 
Desktop Search might have been one of the contributors of growth. Can you 

seeing gr
owth? I know desktop search really impressive, given how long has 
this been around. And then, Sundar, with all the exciting changes going on 
with search become more relevant et cetera. Can you just talk about some 
of the KPIs that you monitor or what you'r
e seeing when it comes to query 
volumes, click through rate, overall response time, what are you seeing that 

relevant results for your users? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, in terms of desktop,
 
I described it as a solid contributor to revenue 
growth. And what we see is that desktop does remain an important form 
factor for certain more complex tasks. So, things like planning vacations or 
assessing insurance options, what we see is users continue 
to go back to 
desktop, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. And I think one of 

mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And the
n, in terms of 
--
 

--
 
over time, we've developed 
very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search 
--
 
search 
quality 
--
 
to get a sense of such quality and how user satisfaction is through 
search. But, to give you a sense of 
-
-
 
we continue to take that work deeper, 
we realize users sometimes do searches through sessions understanding 
what is their satisfaction across the session, what is their engagement, are 
they getting at what they are looking for? Those are all some of the 
deeper 
work we are undertaking, and also understanding by vertical how we are 
helping users. There was an earlier question around shopping and 
commerce. That's an example of the kind of vertical and what can we do to 
make that experience better. Health is 
another vertical in which we have a 
whole Google Health team focused on understanding the in
-
depth experience 
that would give better experience overall in search. So, very comprehensive 
effort and we are constantly looking to do it deeper and broader at th
e same 
time.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is 
now open.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
I have two. Sundar, there's clearly a lot of innovation happening at Google. 
But, I'm wondering how do you think about the increase in
 
scrutiny and 
oversight possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new 
markets over time, and ultimately to remain competitive? And second, 
Sundar or Ruth, we don't often ask about the display network, but just 
wondering, given all the conc
erns around privacy, ad blocking and the like, 
how do you view this business strategically, as part of the overall 
ecosystem?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the first part, we consistently want to work and build products that 
benefit users and support the 
ecosystem. And so, our products and services 
benefit consumers, small and medium businesses, advertisers, and overall, 
they help reduce prices and expand choice. And so, that's our underlying 
approach, I think, which is what helps us engage and explain to 
regulators 

opportunities available for us, and in many of these areas we are the new 
entrant and we create competition. And sometimes the competitive 
pressures can lead to concerns fr
om others. And so, that's part of what's 
going on as well. But, the other area is, in addition to developed markets, 
we are investing deeply in our next billion users. So, markets like APAC 
continue to be bit long term opportunities for us as well.
 
Operato
r
 
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Ruth, just, if you rewind the clock a little bit, when we entered this year, you 
had called out how some product changes may cause year
-
over
-
year growth 
rates to fluctuate from tim
e to time. And we haven't heard that in a couple 
of quarters. So, as we look out towards like 2020 and beyond, do you feel 
like a lot of the product queue is in a good place, as far as Search and 
YouTube are concerned, and that these product changes might 
be a little bit 
more subtle going forward, or could we return to having more meaningful 
impact in the future, just any color there? And then, on the third quarter, 
the Asia region, the growth rate was solid but a tad lower than the prior 
trend. So, anythin
g notable to call out on APAC?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, in terms of the first question, I think, as Sundar and I talked about, 
we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again 
in the third quarter. And as we said, since the IPO, we don't m
anage the 
business to maximize quarterly results and we'll always do the right thing for 
the long term. We're very focused on investing for the long term. And I tried 
to make it clear in opening comments that as a result, quarterly growth can 
vary and has 
varied. And I think to your question, our view is that quarterly 
growth around the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year, for us 
underscore the strength and the vibrancy actually in our business. And that's 
particularly true at our size, in the
 
last 12 months we've generated over 
$150 billion in total revenues. That's about $25 billion of growth in the last 
year. And we are continuing to invest in long
-
term opportunities. But, I 
would make the point that we do keep a lens to the long
-
term. In te
rms of 
your question about geographies.
 
When we look at the performance on a fixed FX basis around the globe, 
pleased with the performance again in the third quarter. You aptly point out, 
year
-
on
-
year growth in APAC in the third quarter was a bit lower tha
n the 
second quarter. That primarily reflected slower growth in the network 
business, and that was in part due to policy changes. It also reflected the 
fact that the launch of the Pixel 3a was in the second quarter, which boosted 
the year
-
on
-
year growth ra
te in the second quarter. But, I think also implicit 
in your question, at 26% year
-
on
-
year growth on a fixed FX basis, running it 

the team is doing and the year
-
on
-
year growth r
ate.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Sundar, maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on the Discover 
feed. That's a new product that we featured in the past that I know a lot of 
users are 
getting more use out of. You gave us I think some updates on 
monthly active users or DA use in the past. Any update there would be great 
or maybe any additional color on sort of how the total amounts of usage 
goes on there, that's obviously been featured t
o users a little bit more.
 
And then, second, maybe just a follow
-
up for Ruth. Sundar spoke at length 
about your investments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with 
the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or 
maybe
 
is not helping drive efficiencies across the country 
--
 
across the 
Company and your operating costs overall? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Discover is the product we are very excited about. I think, it completes the 
other half of Search. Search is, we do our miss
ion for our users and be 
helpful when they come to us looking for information, Discover is the other 
half where we are proactively understanding what might be most helpful or 
relevant to them and getting it to them. And we definitely are focused on 
product
 
quality and making sure the product is actually helpful to users, and 
when they engage with it, they find it useful. And it's definitely we are 
making progress. Our investments and machine learning are helping us well. 
We are definitely able to better ant
icipate and give them information 
proactively.
 
So, over time, I see it as important area for us. And it's done and close. It's 
part of our search and knowledge efforts. And as we do that, you can 
imagine, you may have started a query in Search, and it's a 
session, maybe 
you're looking to take a trip somewhere, or you're researching a particular 
topic, we may be able to continue that discussion on the user journey in 
Discover, and that creates a virtuous cycle. So, these are 
--
 
we want to be 
helpful to users
 
in a way that makes sense for them, more continually, and 
the combination of Search and Discover helps us do that.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of your question on sustainability, we're proud of the work that 

of what we do, and we do 
consider the impact on the business and on the financials. It really cuts 


about, wha
t we're doing with our facilities, what we're doing with AI. And I 
think it was about a year ago we talked about how we were applying 
machine learning to energy efficiency in our data centers, and it did have a 
net benefit. It helped us reduce energy consu
mption, not only positive for 
sustainability but was an efficiency effort. Sundar talked about the fact that 
we are investing 
--
 
recently announced that we are purchasing, making an 
equal investment in renewable energy, part of our commitment to offset 
100
% of our electricity use with renewable. And in our view this is catalyzing 
further investment in renewable. That is going to have a modest short
-
term 

in traditional energy. S
o, there are puts and takes and that we're proud of 
the work across everything that we are doing to support sustainability.

And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line

So, Sundar, I was wonderi
ng if you can put the quantum computing 
investment into some sort of perspective. Compute needs for Google have to

increasing compu
te need. 

are for progress. So, can you talk about what kind of products or services 

before? Thanks.
 
Sundar
 
Pichai
 


relied on advances in computing to be able to do what we do. And when we 
look ahead, we 
definitely see being able to drive the pace of change here 
fastest is an important need for us as well as I think source of competitive 

at variety of approach to make sure we can co
ntinue doing what we need to. 
And in that this is an important tool into arsenal. While quantum will take 
many years to really start making a difference, we want to be at the cutting 

 
see a 
lot of interest from cloud customers, particularly in cutting
-
edge verticals 

participate in as a business, and more importantly applying it across other 
verticals we are in, be it h
ealth, as an example, I think we will be where we 
will deliver value in the long run.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And as much as we're extremely excited about the long
-
term implications for 
quantum computing, part of your question there about our near term 
computing requir
ements. Given our outlook in particular across Google, we 
do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our 
growth, particularly for machine learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube. And 
the primary driver of the CapEx does continue to be o
ur expectations for 
compute requirements, so investments in technical infrastructure, as we've 
talked about today.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now 
open.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thanks. I need a Google 
headset. Sundar, just on investments in GCP, 
you're in a really unique situation, having built infrastructure and 
productivity applications. Can you just walk through how you prioritize the 
two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways you can go in GCP
. And just 
want to follow up with Ruth. You alluded to some G Suite pricing changes. 
And I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year. 
And I was just curious if you were referring to that price change or earlier in 
the year or if the
re was something new?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
I mean, you're right. I mean, these are two big buckets and we treat them 
that way. Obviously, we've talked a lot about GCP, but G Suite continues to 
be very differentiated. And, we just announced a new leader Javier Sol
tero 
coming in with lots of experience to turbo
-
charge this area as well.
 
And in general, there are many G Suite customers now with who we are 
having GCP conversations and vice versa. So, I think in general, given we 
have a big go
-
to
-
market effort, the bre
adth you have allows us to have more 
conversations and engage through many different paths into the 
organization. So, it's very synergistic as well.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of the G Suite pricing, I was referencing the pricing that we 
announced back in Apr
il. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was, it was 
the right time to increase prices, given the ongoing functionality and tools 
that are included within G Suite. And as I said, what we're seeing here is in 
addition to the benefit from the price cha
nge. We also continue to have nice 
seat growth.

And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 

gh level 
OTT viewing strategy? Obviously, subscriptions are growing. Maybe give us 
an update on how your YouTube subscription product is doing versus 
expectations? And then, on the paid click growth, it decelerated 18%, 
anything to call out there, especial
ly related to YouTube, any change to 
coverage going on or anything we should know about? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Subscription is an area we are different definitely excited about. We are 
pleased with our options so far across both, YouTube Music and YouTu
be 
Premium. They're now available in 71 countries from five markets at the 
start of 2018. So, we are definitely scaling that up and we're seeing great 
traction. YouTube TV is also doing well. I think, we just announced that PBS 
is coming to YouTube TV in J
uly. Last month, we announced YouTube TV is 
now launching on select Amazon Fire TV devices. So, there's definite 
--
 
the 
user satisfaction on the product is high. And so, we are focused on 
continuing our expansion, building out a great service and building 
awareness for the service. So, overall, I think, engaging users with premium 
offerings on YouTube is the focus for us. And the efforts, while early, are 
definitely showing strong traction.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then, you asked about click growth and the trend the
re, the biggest 
driver affecting the click trends continues to be the growth of YouTube 
engagement ads. As in the first and second quarter, the rate of YouTube 
click growth decelerated in the third quarter. That does continue to reflect 
the changes that we
 
made in early 2018 to really improve the user and 
advertiser experience. And as we've talked about on prior calls, that did 
have an impact on click growth. But as we also talked about, they weren't 
related to those changes in 2018. We're not related to po
licy enforcement 
actions that YouTube, they had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. 
So, not a read through.

And now, 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks, Ellen. We turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, 
notwithstanding continued meaningful currency headwinds. The key 
highlight this quarter was the substantial growth of our mobile search 
reven
ue complemented by ongoing strong contributions from YouTube and 
our programmatic business. I will first give you a summary of the quarter, 
followed by specific financial details and conclude with comments regarding 
our upcoming move to segment reporting. 
Sundar will then review the 
business and product highlights of the quarter, after which we will take your 
questions.
 
Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was 
$18.7 billion up 13% year
-
over
-
year and up 5% sequentially. As a
 
result of 
the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency 
impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion or $1.3 billion after the benefit of our 
hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total 
revenue grew 21%
 
year
-
over
-
year and 7% sequentially.
 
On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.7 billion and the operating margin 
was 25%. On a non
-
GAAP basis, operating profit was $6.1 billion and the 
operating margin was 33%. GAAP operating income was up 26% versus last 
year and GAAP net income from continuing operations was up 36% year
-
over
-
year.
 
As a reminder, the year
-
on
-
year increases reflect a non
-
cash impairment 
charge of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014. Non
-
GAAP operating 
income was up 15% year
-
over
-
year 
and non
-
GAAP net income was up 19% 
year
-
over
-
year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $5.73; non
-
GAAP 
earnings per diluted share were $7.35.
 
As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock
-
based 
compensation totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% year
-
over
-
year and up 27% 
sequentially. With respect to stock
-
based compensation, the increase 
reflects the fact that our annual equity refresh grants were made in the third 
quarter as well as headcount growth.
 
Headcount increased 16% versus last year and 5% ve
rsus 2Q 2015. 
Sequential growth reflects typical seasonality with new grad starting, the 
vast majority of whom are engineers and product managers. Let me now 
turn to key elements of our financial statements, starting with our primary 
revenue sources.
 
Googl
e sites revenue was $13.1 billion, up 16% year
-
over
-
year and up 6% 
sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year
-
on
-
year and 
quarter
-
on
-
quarter growth reflect substantial strength in mobile search due 
to ongoing improvement in ad formats and deliv
ery to better address how 
consumers use their mobile devices.
 
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a significant rate with growth driven 
primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. 
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 4% year
-
on
-
ye
ar and up 2% 
sequentially, continuing to reflect the significant growth of Programmatic, 
offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue was $1.9 billion, 
up 11% year
-
over
-
year and up 11% sequentially.
 
Given the geographic mix of our Play busin
ess, FX also had an impact on 
other revenue. Year
-
over
-
year growth was driven by Google for Work, 
including cloud, as well as continued strong growth in Play. Both were offset 
by the absence of revenues included in 3Q 2014 from a licensing agreement 
and lo
wer hardware sales, as we reached the end of life cycles for certain 
Chromecast and Nexus devices.
 
Next, let me discuss revenues by geography, which will highlight the impact 
currency headwinds continue to have on our non
-
U.S. business. U.S. 
revenue was up
 
19% year
-
over
-
year to $8.8 billion and up 9% versus Q2. 
UK revenue was up 10% year
-
over
-
year to $1.8 billion, and up 7% 
sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 18% year
-
over
-
year, and 7% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 7% versus la
st year to 
$8.1 billion and up 2% versus Q2. In fixed FX terms revenues were up 23% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 5% sequentially. The acceleration in U.S. and UK 
growth in particular reflect the growth in mobile search.
 
Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, th
ese metrics similarly are affected 
by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 23% year
-
over
-
year 
and 6% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year
-
over
-
year and 
1% sequentially. In terms of the drivers, within Google Sites paid clicks were 
up 3
5% year
-
over
-
year and up 7% sequentially. Google site CPCs were 
down 16% year
-
over
-
year and down 2% sequentially.
 
The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the 
continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were down 5
% 
year
-
over
-
year and flat sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing 
policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for 
Search, consistent with our focus on improving the user experience. Network 
CPCs were down 4% year
-
over
-
yea
r and up 1% sequentially.
 
Let me now turn to expenses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion 
or 21% of total advertising revenue, essentially flat as a percentage of 
revenue sequentially and down slightly year
-
over
-
year. As a reminder, the 
Site

for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. 
Non
-
GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.2 billion in Q3, up 16% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by costs ass
ociated with operating our data centers, 
including depreciation, as well as content acquisition costs primarily for 
YouTube and Play.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating expenses were $5.7 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 7% versus Q2. The increase i
n operating expense 
versus comparable periods was primarily driven by R&D expense. A breakout 
of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides. 
Other income and expense was $183 million. The effective tax rate was 19% 
for the third
 
quarter.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was 
$2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center 
construction and facilities. Operating cash flow was $6 billion with free cash 
flow of $3.6 billion.
 
Finally turning to cash, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of 
approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $42 billion or 58% is held 
overseas. As we announced today, our board has authorized us to 
commence a repurchase of our Class C capital 
stock of up to 
$5,099,019,513.59. This decision is consistent with our overall capital 
management framework and complements a disciplined capital allocation 
program. Our primary uses of capital will of course remain CapEx and M&A 
across the breadth of our 
businesses.
 
So now let me conclude, starting in the fourth quarter with our move to 
segment reporting, we intent to provide additional detail for Google on the 
one hand, and all the other Alphabet businesses on the other hand. We refer 
to those other Alpha
bet businesses as Other Bets. We expect Other Bets to 
include among others Access and Energy, Nest, Life Sciences, our 
investment arms and X, which is where driverless cars and certain other 
incubation efforts reside.
 
Specifically, we intend to disclose fo
r both Google and Other Bets revenues 
profitability and CapEx. By doing this we expect that you will be better able 
to understand how we manage the businesses, including the pace and 
allocation of our investments. As Larry said in his CEO letter announcing
 
Alphabet, we are focused on rigorously managing capital allocation and 
working denature each business is executing well.
 
With that preface, let me turn to for key themes. First, in terms of revenues 
are strong revenue growth in Q3 reflects the ongoing mom
entum in Google 
with acceleration in mobile search complemented by the strength of YouTube 
and programmatic. The Other Bets our earlier stage businesses, which we 
believe have significant longer
-
term revenue potential. In the near
-
term, the 
focus there is 
on optimizing our investments. Second, with respect to 
profitability, we remain focused on managing expenses within our control, 
while investing to support the growth areas we have in Google and Other 
Bets. Segment reporting by definition provides greater 
insight into the profit 
dynamics within alphabet.
 
Third as to CapEx, the vast majority to date, of course has been to support 
Google, where we continue to invest given our exciting opportunities 
globally. At the same time CapEx and Other Bets is 
expected to increase 
through next year as we continue to execute on the growth agenda there. In 
particular in Access and Energy, which contains our fiber business, among 
other efforts. Fourth, our growing cash balance remains a powerful tool 
giving us the 
flexibility to invest in the breadth of opportunities we have 
within Google and Other Bets as well as to selectively pursue compelling new 
bets.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar, will go into more detail regarding our 
business trends and products.

we are focused on now and in the future at Google. There is a real sense of 

across our businesses. P
roducts like Search, Android, Maps, Chrome and 
YouTube each have over a billion users already, and Google Play crossed 

just beginning to scratch the surface.
 
We know that computin

revolution to the Internet revolution to the mobile revolution. And 10 years 
from now, everything will be different again in ways no one can predict. Our 
vision is for Google to remain a place of incredib
le creativity and innovation 
that uses a unique technical expertise to tackle big problems and create that 
future. We do this, arm

Today, I want to touch on three key areas that are important for us; first, 
making
 
information accessible and useful; then how we are building 
computing platforms used by billions of people; and lastly, how we are 
driving growth in our core advertising business as well as new emerging 
businesses.
 

s core mission has always been to 

useful. Search continues to be at the center of this with people turning to 
search on mobile every day to find quick answers, in fact search traffic o
n 
mobile phones have now surpassed desktop traffic worldwide.
 
We are also seeing strong mobile momentum in many emerging markets like 
India, which is a number two country for mobile search queries behind the 
U.S. This is the result of a laser focus on help
ing users quickly find the right 
information. People just want to be able to find the information they are 
looking for on mobile without having to worry about whether it lives on the 
mobile web or within apps. Mobile app usage as well as web usage is 
accel
erating significantly.
 
We have now indexed more than hundred billion deep links within third

very important t
hat we help to make the mobile web better and faster for 
users, both through our own products and by partnering with others. 
Working with over 30 publication and technology partners we recently 
announced an open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile 
Pages to make 
it easy for publishers and content creators to build superfast webpages for 
their content. This will help make the mobile web a better more enjoyable 
experience for users.
 
I also want to point out that our investments in machine learning and 
artificial intelligence are a priority for us. Machine learning has long powered 
things like voice search, translation, and much more. And our machine 
learning is hard at work in mobile services like Now on Tap, which quickly 
assist you by providing additi

There are more than 1.4 billion 30

world, and we are beginning to roll out Android Marshma

Working with partners Huawei and LG, we announce the newest devices 
joining our Nexus family. The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. They are beautiful 
and powerful devices that show off the latest and greatest that the a

Android Auto, the Internet of Things platform that we unveiled at I/O Brillo, 
and of course Chrome. Chrome also powers Chromecast, and our recent 
Chromecast upd
ate gave it a refreshed look and faster performance. We also 
introduced Chromecast audio, which lets you stream your favorite music 
from your phone to any set of speakers. To date we have sold over 20 
million Chromecast devices and have seen over 1.5 billi

on these 
calls before, we are seeing a major shift in consumer behavior to its micro
-
moments. These are moments of high intent when consumers are looking to 
find, buy or do something. They happen throughout the day most often on 
mobile devices. The single 
biggest theme throughout our advertising 
business is to help small businesses, large marketers, agencies and content 
creators to take advantage of this mobile opportunity.
 

Donuts and
 
Airbnb are turning to mobile search to capitalize on these key 
moments reach customers, and create engaging local experiences. We also 
recently made search ads in Google Play available to all developers letting 
app developers find new customers for their 
app at a great price where it 
matters.
 
Many smart developers are already taking advantage of this. At Adweek, we 
introduced Customer Match, which lets marketers reach their existing 
customers with customized search ads on Google.com, as well as ads in 
YouT
ube and Gmail. Of course, these are really valuable for reaching key 
customers at moments of high intent on mobile devices.
 
With the holiday season coming up, we are investing in providing great 
shopping experiences on mobile. We are also helping marketers
 
understand 
how Search ads are driving in
-
store sales with products like Store Visits 
which uses our unique mobile location capabilities and is easy for any 
business to implement.
 
Moving to YouTube, everyday people watch hundreds
-
of
-
millions of hours on 
Yo
uTube. You know from the last quarterly call about the amazing 

YouTube app. The growth in mobile watch time also extends to videos 
featuring product reviews and information. People turn to Y
ouTube and they 
want to research, buy or fix a product. For example, mobile watch time for 
apparel videos has doubled this year and videos about toys have also 
doubled.
 
We see the same growth in advertising on the platform too. And we continue 
to invest in
 
building ways for marketers to reach consumers effectively, like 
our recently announced shopping ads for YouTube, which lets people shop 
directly from a video, turning any relevant video into your digital storefront. 
And in programmatic video and display,
 
the strong momentum continues. 
The number of advertisers using our programmatic solutions has nearly 
doubled in the last year

and

Additionally, both mobile and video impressions served o

best programmatic solutions for advertisers and agencies. Before I close, I 
want to
 
touch on a few of our emerging businesses where we see enormous 
opportunities.
 
First, digital content, Google Play continues to be a thriving hub for our 
digital content business, now with over 1 billion users. And just yesterday, I 
was really pleased tha
t we announced YouTube Red, our YouTube 
subscription service for just $9.99 a month. It enables you to see videos on 
YouTube without ads, watch them offline, or keep playing videos when you 
lock your screen or start using another application.
 
Additionally,
 
our Google for Work business is seeing tremendous growth. In 
the third quarter, we crossed 1 million paying active customers using Google 
Drive at Work. Cloud is also a growing area where we see great opportunity 
and we are building a fantastic service th

momentum in the education space continues as well with more than 50 
million Google apps for education users worldwide, and over 10 million 
teachers and students using Google Classroom since it launched a year ago. 
There are 
also 30,000 new Chromebooks activated in schools in the U.S. 

 
So to wrap up, we have tremendous new opportunities in our new and 
existing businesses. We are really excited by the products and pl
atforms that 
we are building for people everywhere in the world. And we are passionate 

the years ahead.
 
Thank you to everyone for your keen interest in our business. And thank you 
to 
all of the Googlers around the world for another great quarter. And with 
that, I will hand it back to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator 
Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark 
Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Great. Thanks. Two questions, could you talk about the sustainability of the 
mobile search revenue growth that you s
ee there? And is that just really 
been driven by finally the gapping up of kind of mobile search pricing versus 
desktop pricing or is there something else going on?
 
And then, Ruth, I was just trying to figure out how you came up with that 
-
 
your repurchase
 


that, how did you come up with that particular amount of share buyback? 
Why not more and why not less? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks, Mark. So starting on the sustainability of mobile revenue growth, as 
I said, in my opening comments, revenue growth really reflects continued 

strong industry
-
wide global g
rowth in mobile usage as you know well. And 
then we regularly adjust the way we present ads. So we expanded ad space 
in some queries with particularly high commercial intent to display more 
relevant mobile friendly ads.
 
And our view is just as we saw consu
mer behavior change on desktop we 
are seeing the same on mobile. And as Sundar said, we continue to believe 

way we approached it. If I take you back to the capital framework that
 
I laid 

working capital and a buffer as well as a potential return of capital.
 
And we remain focused on solving the biggest problems and solving them at 
scale and that presents si
zable potential revenue opportunities. It was a key 
catalyst for creating Alphabet. But these opportunities also require 
investment. And so the focus of our team is on prioritizing these 

modeling it out a number of years. And then working with the Board we 
reviewed our outlook. We reviewed the opportunity set and we concluded 
that layering in this action at this time complements what we view as a very 
disciplined budgeting process, while s
till very importantly providing ample 
capacity to pursue the growth agenda.
 
And then, applying this framework once we had come up with the size that 
we believe fits and consistent with the way we do things around here, we 
decided to come up with some fun m
ath similar to the way we approach 

do view it as the right action at the right time. And it really is anchored in 
the framework.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks, Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks, Ma
rk.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Thanks. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, so back to the mobile 
search question, the bear
-
case on Goo

lack thereof to port the search business model from PC over to mobile. And 
you called out mobile search is the key driver of acceleration in both the U.S. 
and UK. So can you just give us a little bit of more color arou
nd the volume 
trends that you are seeing between desktop and mobile as you cross that 
50% threshold that you talked about last quarter.
 
And then, Sundar, on the platform side, it seems like every few years new 
company crop up as the next big Android OEM. L


to a point where all these OEMs can build successful businesses on the back 
of it? And any update on when Google plans to roll out the Play Store in 
China 
would be helpful. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So starting with mobile and our outlook there, clearly, as I said, mobile 
search revenue was up significantly and it was an important catalyst in the 
quarter. But the very important thing to note, as we discussed als
o last 
quarter, is that desktop remains a solid contributor. And so we continue to 
have a healthy growth there. And when we look, if you step back, overall 

desktop is healthy and
 
continuing to grow. And then you layer on top of it 

continuation of what we talked about last quarter as well.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And on the platform side, look, we continue to see trem
endous momentum 

billion users. So obviously that translates into huge opportunities for OEMs 


s next billion users coming online in emerging markets. 
And businesses, I mean, Enterprises, a whole opportunity for OEMs as well. 
So I think there is a lot of room ahead.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. 
Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
Thank you. I have two questions as well, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. 
Sundar, in two parts, if you take a three
-
year view what are the three main 
milestones you think you need to reach to be succes

And what you think would be the externally observable consequences of 
achieving these milestones?
 
And Ruth, in the last call, you talked about the 70/20/10 framework. Can 
you help us understand what 70/20/10 applies to? Is it 
related to operating 
expenses, or expenses in cost in the P&L, CapEx, R&D, management time? 
And is it an explicit constraint in the budgeting process or am I trying to 

broad guideline? T
hank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Carlos. In terms of how I think about it, I think we are fortunate to 

information turns out to be something that has a lot of room ahead, we are 
still in the
 
early days. Especially with mobile I think you have a computing 

population or on its way to reach the entirety of the human population in 
about five to 10 years.
 
So want to stay focused
 
on that both from information standpoint and a 
computing standpoint, I think of them as two sides of the same coin, and 


 
Ruth Porat
 

 


which for us means, how do we apply effort. And for me, one of the many 
very important statements from the founders that explains t
his framework is 
when they said in the letters some years ago and repeated since, 
incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance and thus innovation is 
critical.
 
And so this mantra is really about pushing people to look at new areas, 
invest in newer are
as, look for things that are adjacent the 20% and even 

financial modeling. I think with our move to segment reporting, we look 
forward to giving you more information next quarter 
which should be helpful 
there, but directionally to talk about philosophically how do we think about 
our approach to the business.
 
Carlos Kirjner
 
Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Gol
dman 
Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you very much. This question is for Ruth. I was just wondering 

share with us the way in which you

how it was done last year? And are there any specifics you can share with us 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Well. I guess a couple of things, there has been a very strong foundation 
he
re on budgeting and the approach and setting an envelope, and working 
very closely with business leaders on what that that envelope should be, and 
we are in the midst of it in. As I said last quarter, but to emphasize our 
priority remains revenue growth an


 
So I think really what was very encouraging for me is there is a framework, 
a very strong approach to financial planning and analysis, and really buildi
ng 
on that to make sure we have reasonable but tight envelope so that we can 
have the right conversations collectively, collaboratively with our business 
leaders to assess how we can look at optimizing all of our resources, and 



going into more of that in as we go through our segment reporting in the 
fourth quarter.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
T
hank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan 
Stanley Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions. One on YouTube, I guess could you talk 
some of the qualitative drivers that are really bring more
 
advertising dollars 

advertisers spend was up 60% year

on

you could update us on that?
 
And the second one, on Search, sounds like mobile is acceleratin
g, where 
you now in the mobile versus desktop monetization gap. And Sundar, how 
do you think about that long
-
term, you see mobile being higher, reaching 
equilibrium, how do you see that trending?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the YouTube one, look I mean to shift to vi
deo is a profound medium 
shift, and especially in the context of mobile. And obviously users are 


respon

see that, they are moving more of their traditional budgets to YouTube and 

 
On mobile search 
-
 
to me 
-
 
increasingly we see 
-
 
we already announced tha
t 
or 50% of our searchers are on mobile. Mobile gives us very unique 
opportunities in terms of better understanding users and over time as we 
use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides. So my 
long
-
term view on this is, it is ask co
mpelling or in fact even better than the 

to be get that.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your 
line is now 
open. Please go ahead.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question with respect to 
media distribution, media consumption and monetizing that you should 

the 

subscription versus advertising versus paper unit like on Google Play. How 
you think about the about the pros and cons and some of those distribution 
models? And do how think about the n
eed to may be source content yourself 
for media distribution? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks. To me, we want to stay focused on the user experience and we 
want to follow what users want, right. So if you take something like 
YouTube, we expect most users to c
onsume, YouTube debate has been and 
advertising has been a strong part of providing the content for free to those 

users, in certain scenarios be it music or gaming or for premium c
ontent to 
experience it in a different way. And we want to make sure we do that. So 

right user experience and follow where it goes, and that applies to Google 
Play as well.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Justin Post
 

in the management philosophy this 
year as far as kind of expense discipline 
into 2Q, also have seen the disclosures and now you get the buyback 
announcement. Could you talk about the change there, if there has been 
one, and how you think about that?
 
And then the second thing, we were prett

probably $8 billion plus run rate, Microsoft over $1.5 billion. Just wondering 

thi
nking about using those really strong data center assets? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So I guess, there were a couple of things, on expenses and expense 
management and clearly a lot of the foundation here has

time ago. I think after a period of b
ig expense buildup, there was an

in

arm to make sure that 

 
have an extraordinary set of opportunities, not just within Google but across 
the Alphabet businesses, and we need to ensure that prioritization is a key 
part of all that that we do.
 

 
expenses is an example. When we look forward to the fourth quarter, in 

Chromecast and Pixel launches, a consistent with prior device launches we 
would expect higher sales and marke


there are also certain patterns to some of these similarly with CapEx, CapEx

in a bit of a digestion period.
 
But when you look forward to 2016, we do see accelerated investment given 

just keep make sure, we can things and perspective. And
 


move to Alphabet it gives us the opportunity to then provide some greater 
insight into the extraordinary operating performance within Google and 
breakouts yo

very tightly as a senior team here as we make that next step into this new 
environment in Alphabet.

JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Great. Thanks for taking my quest
ion. Sundar, I want to ask about mobile. 
You talked about being greater than 50% of queries and want to ask if you 
have a view on whether 
-
 
on when that will pass 50% of clicks. And then 
also your thoughts on what happens to desktop pricing in demand, as t
hat 
happens how do you think about the tail on the desktop business as mobile 
just continues to take share? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

a computing paradigm is eventually going to 
blend with what we think of his 

not just form factors. And so overtime we see all of this is together. What 
matters to us as people evolve they are computing paradigm search 
trans
itions to that world, and we are the best source to provide that 
information.
 
So along that line, I expect all the metrics to follow the trend, and so we 
only see, all the right indicators, and so I think we are position for the long

comment too much on the specifics beyond that.
 
Douglas Anmuth

Ken Sena
 
Thank you. I just have an ad format question, maybe 
just to follow

up on 

can you just maybe talk through the decisioning on that? And if so, is there 
anything we should interpret as far as the other ad formats that have been 
used t
oo? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Well, big picture what we are doing is looking at ways to use the mobile 
screen space to be as useful as possible for users. So this quarter we had 

growing i


same on mobile and the notion of trying to make sure were being as useful 

continue to innovate.
 
Ken Sena
 
And maybe just this one follow

up. Can you see anything then it maybe in 


aroun

Yes. There is probably not much to add there.

is getting in the way, it affects performance, and so we as industry need to 
collectively do al
l that better. And so we are going to work hard to do that.
 
And then, so we want to make sure we transition areas like the mobile web 

seen this for a while overwhelmingly the mod
el works well and we expect 
that to continue.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then, in terms of your M&A question, I talked about how did we think of 

continuing to focus on the biggest problems and so
lving them at scale, and 


capital expenditure and about M&A, and those are really the anchor pillars i
n 
our capital framework. And then beyond that there is working capital and a 
buffer and then the potential return of capital. We talked about the fact that 
we have six products that have over billion users. Three of those were 
through acquisitions, YouTube
, Android and Maps that is not lost on us, and 
then you layer on top of that, double

click that was also through acquisition.
 

everybody that those would end up being the incredibly powe
rful businesses, 
effective businesses for users that they are today. And so it remains a part

as I sa

Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. 
Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
 
Paul Vogel
 
Great. Thanks. Two 
questions, please. First, just when we think about search 
and deep liking. Can you just sort of quantify a little bit how important deep 
linking has been to either click, so ROI or improvements in CPC on mobile? 
And then, the second question is just as we 
think about the more 
transparency going forward in Q4. How should we think about businesses 
that currently are in the Other Bets line that may continue to growing. What 
would be considered to move something from other bets into core Google? 
Thank you.
 
Sund
ar Pichai
 


exciting to us is all of the indication show that when we provide these deep 
links. Users respond to th


 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. Interesting in the way frame the question, so within other bets we have 
a pretty broad array of challenges, opportunities that are be
ing tackled, as 



performing and growing. Bu
t you used a term, when do they move into 


able to address.
 
What we want with Alphabet is to be an extraordina
ry magnet, the best 
magnet for entrepreneurs, and to be an accelerant for their development. 
And to give them that the kind of environment where we can continue to 
thrive, and therefore build great businesses that generate tremendous 
returns as well for ou
r stakeholders on top of solving big problems. But that 

continue to grow and be independent entity. So it is a broader view of what 
is Alphabet.
 
Paul Vogel
 
Got it. So just to be clear, i

Okay. Thanks. Sundar, so I think it was on a conference call about three 
years ago when Larry articulated a vision of a simple and consistent 
consum
er experience from Google, and the same for your advertising 
customers as well. So as this is your first conference call with investors 
where do you think you are in that initiative today? Are you still on the same 
path or do you plan to take that on a dif
ferent direction in your new role?
 
And Ruth, despite the high growth of YouTube and Play presumably, are 
your cost of goods sold where the content cost of these two businesses live 
is not growing as rapidly. So will you give some color on where you might b

constraint for us to focus 

objectives are primarily focused on mobile, and how within the context of 
mobile we get to a better, simpler and a consistent experience for 
consumers and a
dvertisers. And so, that framework is how we are thinking 
about it and I think we are making solid progress.
 
Ruth Porat

over

over

data center 

acquisition costs, as you said primarily YouTube and Play. One thing to note 
as we look forward to the fourth quarter with the launch of Nexus, 
Chromecast and Pixel

in this line.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line 
is now open. Please go ahead.

Thanks. I had two 
questions that are kind of interrelated around mobile 
apps. When you talk about the strength in mobile search are you including 
also searches that are done on some of your mobile apps like search done 
on the Maps app or on the mobile YouTube app? And then,
 
kind of somewhat 
related I guess is, yes, I think it is six apps that have over 1 billion users 

nascent stages. Can you talk about kind of your efforts maybe to monetize 
some of these 
large and actively used apps and maybe identify one or two 

excited about the opportunities? Thanks.

about 
the mobile search experience on Google.com or the Google app, but we are 
seeing the same traction within Maps or YouTube. We are seeing mobile 
usage dramatically grow and in that context people are searching as well. So 

-
the
-
board we are 
seeing strength. In terms of our app such of 
scale, and obviously we take a very long
-
term view. And several of those 
apps today already play huge roles, so for example, take Google Maps, it 
already plays a huge important role in making mobile search bette
r. And so 
these are interrelated.
 
YouTube is obviously a big opportunity. Google Play is one. And even things 
like Gmail are playing a critical role in Google for Work and how we are 
driving big business opportunities as well. And, by the way, because we a
re 
scaling all these apps over 1 billion users, we are building the infrastructure 
which is what will power our cloud platform externally as well. So in many 
ways these are all working for us.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Seba
stian form Robert 
W. Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Great. Thanks. I want to ask about two areas of business mentioned on the 

as a topic and I wond
er if you could mention more specifically the vision that 
you have for some of the core applications and how machine learning can 
make them more useful.
 
And then, just as a follow to the question on the Google Cloud, and 
specifically, the Infrastructure
-
as
-
a
-
Service layer, I wonder there if your 
strategy is more focused on price or if there are other ways that you can 
differentiate the service from the competition? Thank you.

Machine learning is core transformative way by which we are rethinki
ng 

believe we are state
-
of
-
the
-
art here. And the progress particularly in the last 
two years has been pretty dramatic. And so we are 
-
 
we are thoughtfully 
applying it across all our
 
products, be it search, be it ads, be it YouTube and 
Play et cetera. And we are in early days, but you will see us in a systematic 
manner, think about how we can apply machine learning to all these areas.
 
On Cloud, I think the right way to think about it 
over time, for a company or 
for a developer to build stuff on cloud, they need not just basic things like 
computer and storage, they need a whole set of services on top of it. We 
-
 
so there is a lot in the stack. And so I think the way we will differentiat
e over 
time is because we have built large services on top of our infrastructure, we 
understand all the layers which you need to build great application. So you 
would see us increasingly provide value
-
added services on top of compute

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet's second 
quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only 
mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions 
will follow at 
that time. [Operator Instructions]
 
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor 
Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Ellen West
 
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second 
quarter 2017 earnings conference call. 
With us today are Ruth Porat and 
Sundar Pichai.
 
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking, including statements 
regarding our future investments, our long
-
term growth and innovation,
 
the 
expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital 
expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, 
please refer to the risk f
actors discussed in our Form 10
-
K for 2016, filed 
with the SEC. Any forward
-
looking statements that we make are based on 
assumption as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financi
al 
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings 
release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. 
This call is also being webcast fr
om our IR website, where a replay of the call 
will be available later today.
 
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing 
momentum in our businesses with broad
-
based strength 
globally. Revenues 
were up 21% year
-
on
-
year, and up 23% in constant currency. Advertising 
revenues benefitted from the strong performance insights, which was led in 
particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution 
from YouTube.
 
Healthy growth and network revenues was driven by our programmatic 
business. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play 
and hardware. Our outline for today's call is first I'll review the quarter on a 
consolidated basis for Alphabet 
focusing on year
-
over
-
year changes. I will 
review our results on a GAAP basis, which include the impact of stock
-
based 
compensation. The European commission fine of $2.7 billion is reflected in 
our GAAP results with the fine displayed as a separate line it
em for clarity.
 
In order to assist with comparing this quarter's results to prior periods, we 
are also providing operating income, net income and EPS results that 
exclude the impact of the fine. The fine is not reflected in our segment 
results. Second, I w
ill review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, 
I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and 
product highlights for the quarter after which we will take questions.
 
I will start with the summary of Alphabet's conso
lidated financial 
performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $26 billion up 21% year
-
over
-
year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year
-
over
-
year of $364 million or $361 million after the benefits of our hedging 
program. Holding c
urrency constant to the prior period, our total revenues 
grew 23% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our 
performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were up 23% year
-
over
-
year to $12.3 billion. EMEA revenue
s were $8.5 billion up 14% year
-
over
-
year reflecting weakness in the British pound and the euro. Revenues 
were up 21% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.7 billion up 28% 
versus last year and up 27% in fixed FX terms. Other America's revenues 
which in
clude results from Canada and Latin America were $1.4 billion up 
31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms.
 
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll 
discuss in the Google segment results were $10.4 billion up
 
28% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion up 
27% year
-
over
-
year primarily driven by Google related expenses. 
Specifically, costs associated with operating our datacenters including 
depreciation, content acquisition 
costs primarily for YouTube and hardware 
related costs.
 
Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine are $11.5 billion. 
Excluding the impact of the EC fine operating expenses were $8.8 billion up 
18% year
-
over
-
year. Year
-
on
-
year expense growth re
flects the change in 
the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the 
first quarter of each year.
 
As discussed previously, this affects the quarterly pace of stock
-
based 
compensation in 2017, but not the overall size of the expen
se for the year. 
In order to transition to the new timing, we made a one
-
time half year grant 
in Q1 of this year, which is reflected in elevated year
-
on
-
year expense 
growth in Q2. As a result, stock
-
based compensation totaled $2 billion up 
33% year
-
over
-
ye
ar. Headcount at the end of thank you quarter was 75,606 
up 1,614 people from last quarter.
 
Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers 
and product managers. In terms of product areas the most sizable 
headcount additions w
ere once again made in Cloud for both technical and 
sales roles consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating 
income was $4.1 billion, excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating 
income was $6.9 billion up 15% versus last year and th
e operating margin 
was 26%.
 
Other income and expense was $245 million. We provide more detail on the 
line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate 
was 19.5% for the second quarter, net income was $3.5 billion and earnings 
per
 
diluted share were $5.1. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income 
was $6.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $8.90.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash, CapEx for the quarter 
was $2.8 billion. Operating cash flow was $7.4 b
illion with free cash flow of 
$4.6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of 
$94.7 billion of which approximately $57.9 billion or 61% is held overseas.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google 
s
egment. Revenues were $25.8 billion up 21% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $18.4 billion in the quarter 
up 20% year
-
over
-
year. The biggest contributors to growth again this 
quarter were mobile search and YouTube.
 
Network revenues were $4.2 billion up 13% year
-
on
-
year, reflecting the 
ongoing strength of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google 
were $3.1 billion up 42% year
-
over
-
year, we have been talking about our 
bigger investment areas within Google and y
ou can see the momentum here 
reflecting contributions from our newer revenue streams again this quarter 
on top of the ongoing strength in Play.
 
Specifically Cloud continues to benefit from the ongoing investments in our 
go
-
to
-
market and product efforts. Ha
rdware continues to grow at a healthy 
pace year
-
on
-
year with the extension of our product line geographically, 
particularly Google Home and Wi
-
Fi, the dollar impacted growth was more 
muted than in prior quarters reflecting seasonality. Finally, we continue
 
to 
provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume 
dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our 
earnings press release.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.1 billion, or 22% of total advertising 
reve
nues, and up 28% year
-
over
-
year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a 
percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of 
Network revenues, continues reflects the fact that our strongest growth 
areas, namely mobile search and programmati
c, carry higher TAC. Total TAC 
as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year
-
over
-
year as a 
result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, 
which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from 
Netwo
rk to Sites, which carries lower TAC.
 
Google's stock
-
based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 
40% year
-
over
-
year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was 
$7.8 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%.
 
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion, reflecting investments in 
production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
 
A couple of Google reminders for the third quarter. Headcount additions tend 
to be seasonally high in Q3, because tha
t is when we bring on new 
graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are 
typically weighted more heavily toward the back
-
half of the year due to the 
holiday season, particularly as we promote our made
-
by Google line of 
hardware pr
oducts.
 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the second quarter, Other 
Bets revenues were $248 million primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and 
Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $772 million for the 
second quarter. Other Bets
 
accrued CapEx was $152 million, primarily 
reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we 
announced in 3Q 2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets, a 
couple of updates.
 
Nest continues to drive ongoing product expan
sion, such as our recent 
introduction of the indoor security camera, Nest Cam IQ as well as 
geographic expansion both of which support its position as the leading brand 
in the connected home. In life sciences, in addition to our progress at Verily, 
Calico 
has focused its efforts on the basic mechanisms of ageing and three 
ageing related diseases representing the leading causes of death.
 
Calico has established more than 20 active collaborations with other life 
sciences companies and academic institutions. With Loon we recently 
demonstrated the technology in Peru by successful delivering basic internet 
connectivity to tens and thousands of 
people affected by the tragic floods 
there. We worked in partnership with the Peruvian government and 
Telefonica.
 
And our progress with Waymo continues nicely, as it is reflected in the writer 
program in Phoenix and our recently announced partnerships with
 
Lift and 
Avis.
 
Let me wrap up, almost two years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the 
benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the 
opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth. We are 
obviously very h
appy with the ongoing strength in ads revenue, particularly 
in Search. Our compelling secular trends continue to drive user adoption and 
engagement with mobile devices. Our engineering and machine learning 
acumen enables us to build better experiences for 
users and advertisers.
 
We continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non
-
ads 
revenue businesses, Play continues to be a strong contributor, in addition we 
have been making big Bets within Google focused on Cloud, hardware and 
subscription bu
sinesses in YouTube in order to better serve customers, while 
also building additional and differentiated revenue streams.
 
These businesses are consistent with and complementary to our core 
capabilities and leverage our infrastructure, distribution and eng
ineering. We 
believe we have a compelling runway here. Longer
-
term we see great 
opportunity in the businesses we are building in Other Bets. These 
businesses reflect the incredible engineering talent across Alphabet most 
notably in machine learning.
 
Our re
venue growth and Alphabet structure give us both the opportunity and 
confidence to invest in our businesses for the long
-
term. We are doing that, 
while being very deliberate about the focus, scale and pace of investment 
and remain committed to being consci
ences in our use of all resources. 
We're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential 
scaling back and others and sharpening our organizational effectiveness to 
make the most of the resources available.
 
Thank you. And let me now turn the 
call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks Ruth. We had a phenomenal quarter. Google continues to lead the 
shift to AI driven computing. We are working to make this incredible 
technology available to everyone around the world. It's our focus on infusing 
our
 
products and platforms with power of machine learning and AI that's 
driving our success. Today, I'll spend time talking about the areas where we 
are confidently investing for the future. First the incredible momentum we 
are seeing in some of our core prod
ucts followed by machine learning.
 
Next an update on three of our most promising bets, YouTube, Cloud and 
our Hardware businesses. And I will conclude the strong performance of our 
computing and advertising platforms. To start our core products and the AI 
powering them. Google has always been about using deep computer science 
and insights to solve some of the world's most complex problems.
 
People are no longer only using a keyboard, mouse and multi
-
touch, but are 
also using emerging inputs like voice and ca
mera to ask questions and get 
things done in the real world. We are seeing this in the way people interact 
with the Google Assistant, which is already now available on more than 100 
million devices since launching last year and there is more to come. Since
 
we released an Assistant SDK that will enable a wide range of new hardware 
devices, which will include the Google Assistant.
 
We now have more than 70 home automation partners on the Assistant on 
Google Home and Phones, including Honeywell, Logitech and LG
. So you can 
do everyday things around the house using your voice.
 
At Google IO, we announced Google Lens available later this year. Lens is a 
set of vision
-
based computing capabilities that can understand what you're 
looking at and help you take action ba
sed on that information. So for 
example, if you saw a poster for your favorite band, you would be able to 
take a picture and get relevant information and buy tickets to their next 
concert.
 
In Search, a great feature we launched this quarter in the U.S. is 
job search. 
To make looking for a job easier for everyone, no matter what line of work 
you are in. Many of these products that make people's lives easier are being 
powered by machine learning.
 
One focus area for us this quarter has been enabling our machin
e learning 
algorithms to learn and improve our products much faster. One such 
research initiative auto ML enables us to pursue approaches to automate the 
design of machine learning models. Our ability to rapidly deploy the best 
machine learning in all of o
ur products enabled us this quarter to launch all 
sorts of new smart features, to help moderate comments, suggest smart 
replies in Gmail and improved translations.
 
We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, 
Gmail and Google Photos
, which now has more than 500 million monthly 
users who backup 1.2 billion photos and videos every day. I was also 
pleased that deep minds AlphaGo team was in Beijing for the Future of Go 
Summit where AlphaGo played against the number one world player Ke J
ie.
 
Since playing AlphaGo Ke Jie has been on a 20 game winning streak. He has 
said playing AlphaGo as fundamentally changed his understanding of the 

world's oldest most strategic gam
es. It can have the same impact in so 
many fields from medicine to science to energy usage and more.
 
Now let's move to some of our biggest Bets. First YouTube. YouTube now 
has 1.5 billion monthly viewers and people watch on average 60 minutes a 
day on thei
r phones and tablets. That's incredible and it helps 1000s of 
passionate video creators make money. The fastest growing stream for 
YouTube is in the living room. YouTube watch time on TV screens has nearly 
doubled year
-
on
-
year. This quarter we unveiled six
 
new ad supported 
YouTube originals from celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart, 
and YouTube creators like Rhett & Link.
 
Advertiser feedback on these new shows has been extremely positive. Last 
week our Live TV service YouTube TV had a ten ne
w metro areas across 

our next big Bet with great momentum Google Cloud.
 
Google Cloud Platform, GCP continues to experience impressive growth 
across products, sectors and geograph
ies and increasingly with large 
enterprise customers in regulated sectors. To be more specific about our 
momentum with big customers, in Q2 the number of new deals we closed 
worth more than $0.5 million is three times what it was last year.
 
Responding to t
he growth in existing and new customers around the world, 
we continue to invest in datacenters to provide them the fastest most 
reliable service. We opened new Google Cloud regions in Northern Virginia, 
Singapore, Sydney and London.
 
We also continue to bui
ld out our partnerships, in Q2 we announced an 
expansion of our partnership at SAP and a new partnership with Nutanix to 
integrate their products with GCP. So customers can run workloads in hybrid 
environments, On
-
Prem and in the Cloud using containers and
 
Kubernetes.
 
Now let's talk about our Hardware business. Sales of our new family of 
hardware continue to be encouraging and we are making good progress 
bringing these devices to more people. Google Home is now available in four 
countries, the U.S., Canada,
 
Australia and the UK and we have announced 
its coming to France and Germany in early August.
 
The Pixel phone continues to be really popular and Google Wi
-
Fi just 
launched in Canada, Germany and France to glowing reviews. Every day, I 
hear of people who lo
ve this product and how it has made Wi
-
Fi work much 
better in their homes. Shifting gears, our computing and advertising 
platforms are driving great results for our partners.
 
There are now more than $2 billion monthly active Android devices around 
the worl
d. It's really humbling so many choose Android. We're seeing a 
number of hardware makers launching devices to positive reviews, including 
the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6. At Google IO this quarter, we gave 
developers early access to Android O, which will f
ocus on vitals like battery 
life and performance.
 
And Google Play continues to be a vital distribution platform for developers. 
An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last 
year alone. That's 11 apps for every person on earth.
 
We continue to work 
on the next generation of computing platforms, virtual and augmented 
realty. By the end of this year, there will be 11 Daydream ready devices on 
the market from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and Asus.
 
Turning to our advertis
ing platforms. Here to machine learning is critical to 
helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time to reach 
consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness. At 
Google Marketing Next this quarter we launched Google Att
ribution, a 
comprehensive measurement tool that allows marketers to measure the 
impact of their campaigns across devices and channels all in one place with 
no additional cost.
 
We also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal App 
Campaigns 
to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, 
Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network. At Google IO in 2016, we 
announced we had driven 2 billion app installs, today that number is more 
than 5 billion that's amazing growth.
 
With 90% 
of transactions still happening offline, we want to help consumers 
find what they are looking for in brick and mortar stores. Our store visits 
technology is instrumental and understanding customer behavior that starts 
online and ends in store. Today, our s
tore visits measurement is the largest 
program of its kind and we have now measured over 5 billion store visits in 
17 countries.
 
This quarter it also brought local ads and store visits measurement to video. 
Speaking of video, we are seeing continued succes
s with bumper ads, our 
six seconds ad format. Both brands and viewers love the format as it's the 
ideal length to capture attention. L'Oréal, Hasbro, Xbox, Clinique and 
Neutrogena have all seen great success with bumpers.
 
And Google Preferred continues to 
grow, we now have 100s of brands 
buying Google Preferred in the U.S. nearly triple the number since it 
launched three years ago. We are now just helping large brands, we are also 
helping millions of small businesses get to online and grow. Every month 
Goog
le helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites and creates more 
than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers. 
These interactions drive huge economic opportunities and growth for small 
businesses.
 
Last month to increase t
hese opportunities, we launched an easy way for 
millions of small businesses to create a free simple mobile optimized 
website. Small businesses can do it on a mobile phone in under 10 minutes, 
using the listing information already available on Google Searc
h and Maps. 
And finally helping publishers grow their revenues remains a huge focus for 
us. We're using the power of automation and machine learning to improve 
our auction algorithms for publishers.
 
The 50 improvements we have made since 2016 are generatin
g 15% more 
revenue for publishers using double click ad exchange. Those are the 
highlights from the second quarter. This week will be another highlight for 
me, I'm going to Africa for a Google for Nigeria event to announce new 
products for Nigeria and Sub
-
Saharan Africa.
 
I'm looking forward to seeing first time how technology and Google's 
products can make a real difference in people's lives. I want to express a 
very sincere thank you to every Googler who work tirelessly this quarter to 
bring all of our tec
hnology and products to the world.
 
And to everyone listening thank you, and I hope you are enjoying starting 
the week off with us. And now back to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Op
erator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of 
UBS Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question directed to 
Sundar. As you think about the Google Assistant and what i
t can do 
medium
-
to
-
long term, maybe talk a little bit about how the Assistant as a 
product could now roll the gap between consumption and utility inside your 
products versus monetization over time with this specific focus I would love 
to hear about local i
n particular? Thank you so much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
It's a good question, when I think about, we have, we are very focused over 
the long
-
term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get 
things done in the real world. And so obviously when you thin
k about it from 
that standpoint local becomes important. Over time, just like when the 
transition happened from desktop to mobile, people's bar for what they 
expect increased. They wanted more answers, they wanted more immediate 
gratification, right and th
at's a continuum and I think you'll see the trends. 
And so over time we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver 
against those experiences, and I think local and their particular strength 
over time both in terms of, the expertise we have built in lo
cal as well as our 
investment in Maps is hopefully paying off.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.
 
Q 

 
Doug Anmuth
 
Great, thanks for taking my question. First one for Ruth, I was just hoping 
you could help us under
stand at least qualitatively how core margins for the 
advertising business are trending within the Google segment? And then 
Sundar just on the Cloud business, I know you talked about four new 
regions being built out. Can you just talk about your strategy i
n building out 
that Cloud infrastructure, how we should think about it in terms of building 
out extra capacity or whether it's more in line with near
-
term demand? 
Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks. So starting with your margin question like as we've often said, we
're 
focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on 
operating margins. We have strong positions in healthy growing areas and 
are adding really exciting additional growth areas and that's what we mean 
when we discussed driving long
-
term rev
enue and earnings growth. To get a 
little more specific, the gross margin, this quarter obviously reflects our 
product mix shift and although the cost of sales is higher as a percentage of 
revenues, these costs are associated with high growth product areas
 
that 
enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then on the OpEx 
side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors, first I think really to 
your question on an overtime point, you can see the impact of the timing 
shift in the equity re
fresh which we discussed previously. Now as a reminder 
that does abate in the back
-
half of the year, but you can see it here in the 
second quarter.
 
And then what you are also seeing an OpEx growth is the investments in 
areas that we've spilled out. So for 
example in R&D you can see the impact 
of the headcount increases in our priority areas particularly Cloud and 
machine learning and marketing spend similarly reflects the strategic priority 
areas we've delineated particularly hardware and YouTube subscripti
on. But 
as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas 
where we see the most potential, we are scaling it back in others, we're 
focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our 
resources and all of that really 
underpins the goal to sustain both revenue 
and earnings growth over the longer term.
 
Q 

 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thanks that's helpful.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Thank you very much. I was just wondering Sundar, you mentioned some of 
the strength your seeing in GCP. Now I was just wondering if you could 
share with us, when you do win is there any commonality around the type of 
workloads that people are choosing you
 
for? And can you share with us any 
updates on the go
-
to
-
market and kind of how you see all about where 
you've come over the last year, but even more importantly what you need to 
do to get it where you needed to be over the next 12 months? Thank you.
 
Sunda
r Pichai
 
All right, thanks, I would also take Doug's question on the infrastructure too 
and do it together, since they are related to Cloud. Overall, when we think 
about our infrastructure obviously we are serving Cloud as well as our 
internal products whi
ch are seeing tremendous growth as well. In terms of 
serving Cloud customers, we are world
-
class and available being reliable and 
those are things we want to stay best
-
in
-
class. So, we are clearly planning 
for that and planning ahead of our infrastructure 
and we have been 
consistently doing that.
 
And Heather in terms of your question about workloads and stuff, we are 
actually seeing quite a diverse set of used cases across sectors and 
industries and geographies and so, I would say the breadth of what we hav
e 
seen it's really surprised me. In terms of go
-
to
-
market, I shared an update 
on last, on that last quarter not sure there is much more interesting to add, 
we are continuing to do it well, we are scaling up and all the teams and the 
structure Diana has put
 
in place is beginning to work well. And we are 
continuing to hire and scale all of this up, as quickly as we can.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
M
ark Mahaney
 
Yes, I have two questions please. First, one on TAC, Ruth the factors that 
cause, have been causing characterizing relatively structural the outsize 
growth of mobile and the rise of programmatic. So there is no particular 
reason to think that, 
we should see anything other than gradual increase in 
TAC as a percentage of both O&O and network revenue going forward. So 
are there any reasons why that wouldn't be the case, next year or two? And 
then Sundar, another one more interesting innovations, th
at was, that kind 
of came out of Google IO was Visual Search, and can you just talk about, 
maybe a little bit roadmap for that or to the extent that which, how long it 
will take us actually see that broadly in the market, and what you think the 
appetite or
 
how do you think that will change the way people search for 
products in the future they build need to also search visually through your 
phone? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on the first question, there are obviously a number of factors that affect 
Sites TAC we
've talked about them over time. The primary driver again this 
quarter, as you noted in question was the strong growth in mobile and the 
fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. But the increase in Sites 
TAC year
-
over
-
year, I think what I would s
tress is it really provides another 
lens on just how strong our mobile business is. There are other factors that 
affect the TAC rate including the mix of paid versus organic traffic as well as 
changes in partner mix and agreement terms. But I think at the,
 
main point 
of your question here is we do continue to expect Sites TAC to increase, but 
our focus remains on growing profit dollars and I go back to my comment 
which is really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is 
benefiting profit do
llars even as the TAC percentage increases. And 
programmatic, kind of a very similar answer which is we're pleased to have 
a strong position in the growing area.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And questions around Visual Search, when we think about Google Lens, we 
think ab
out it as a set of capabilities which will roll out across many different 
products. But we will mainly start getting it in the hands of our users in Q4. I 
think early days we want to make sure works well for used cases where it 
can and bet on the long
-
term
 
trends in computer vision as we make 
progress there. I also think, there are cases where pulling out your phone 
and looking at it is a bit cumbersome and so over time as form factors 
emerge, there its more natural for you to look at and input that into 
co
mputing you will get used more.
 
Overall, for humans the way they see, visual input is a very high bandwidth 
way of communicating and so, it's important that we bring that in 
computing. So, long
-
run I'm very bullish on it, but we're going to roll this 
out s
lowly and thoughtfully.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thank you, Sundar. Thank you, Ruth.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo 
Securities. Your line is now open.
 
Peter Stabler
 
Thanks so much for the question. One for Sundar, at 
Marketing Next your 
team unveiled new ways that Google is leveraging consumer intense signals 
across your billion user plus platforms. It seems that some of the walls 
between product data silos are being lowered a bit, one of the obvious gains 
that [Street
 
Harp] [ph] highlighted was search personalization. Wondering if 
you could speak broadly to the opportunity and looking at data from a 
targeting perspective more holistically across platforms? Thanks so much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
I think it's important we have al
ways felt as marketers when they spend and 
try to reach users, the more we can give them visibility about how their 
spend is working and they can attribute across all the stages of the funnel. I 
think that will really help make everything work well. So, we
 
have always 
taken the long
-
term view. And everything we do be it store versus which we 
did a while ago or more recently at Google Marketing Next we talked about 
Google Attribution as well. So, all that starts adding up and I think pushes in 
this right lon
g
-
term deduction. And there is more work to be done. But, I 
think as users use our 
--
 
use everything across multiple products and 
devices in a thoughtful way, I think making all of this work well, we see it as 
an opportunity ahead of us.
 
Peter Stabler
 
Than
ks Sundar.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions today. I have two. The first one you talked 
about micro moments throughout the course of the 
year and micro moments 
on mobile. I was wondering, could you give us a couple of examples of micro 
moments or searching verticals where you have really seen an increase in 
your monetization over the last year.
 
And Sundar, as you look out across all the sea
rch verticals, what are the two 
biggest one or two used cases you still see to improve the overall relevancy 
of search results and potential monetization?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the first one, I would probably be rather than be very specific, any time 
people are
 
looking to buy, find, go do things, you could be looking for a local 
pizza or you could be buying 
--
 
we see craze like jeans near me and people 
are looking for jeans next to them. So these are all very, very specific things 
and in all of these cases, we h
ave found we have been able to impact the 
experience for both users and advertisers.
 
So, I think that applies generally broadly, in terms of all the verticals, I think 
there are a lot of opportunities local has been an area of strength for us. We 
have seen
 
a lot of traction and continue to think as a vertical given the 
assets we have built over the years we can continue to invest more and do 
better for our users.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barcla
ys. 
Your line is now open.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. I have two questions for Sundar. First is, as you mentioned 15% yield 
improvement on publisher yield for [indiscernible] from machine learning, is 
there a comparable step inside of Google owned and operated se
arch or 
YouTube after implementing machine learning you saw yield improvement of 
x, be curious hear to that.
 
And then, the second question is, if you look out into the future, you guys 
mentioned 2 billion Android actives I/O and you mentioned 11 apps per u
ser 
in your prepared remarks. Is Google forced to unbundle their own apps from 
Android in the future. What's the strategy to ensure that maps and YouTube 
and search get distribution and Android doesn't kind of go the way of China 
and other markets, be curi
ous to hear that? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Let me take the first one first. On machine learning, we definitely machine 
learning we have been using it on search, Rank Brain has become one of the 
important signals in addition to the many other signals and se
arch. And so, 
definitely that's had an impact same on YouTube across the board. I don't 
have any specific metrics to give but we definitely are seeing impact and we 
think we are in early days of the impact we can see.
 
In terms of Android, we are obviously 
thoughtfully building Android out and 
scaling it out and we offer our apps as part of it. OEMs get to distribute other 
apps as well. We think it's a very open market, open ecosystem works well 
for everyone involved and I expect that to continue. And a lot 
of our 
products which are successful on Android happen to be successful outside of 
Android as well including on the web. These are products generally used by 
billions of users and by now we have worked hard to earn that trust and 
scale and so I'm confident
 
we can continue scaling this up.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Hey, good afternoon everyone. Sundar, I think the last update we heard 
publicly on promoted places o
n maps was in December when you announced 
that you would be beginning some limited tests. I don't think there has been 
any public comment from the company since then quite frankly haven't 
heard a whole lot anecdotally about it either. So, I was just hoping
 
for a 
quick update on that product? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Overall, I mean it's in the area where we are still like really focused on 
improving the consumer experience I think. We are evolving maps to be a 
lot more beyond just driving directions and use
rs are responding to it. And I 
think we are in the process of making all that work better. And also, we've 
also focused in terms of what we see as local opportunity within search as 
well. But, we will continue testing and evolving, I think we want to make 
sure we get the consumer experience right before we invest before on 
promoter opportunities on maps.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. 
Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. A few fo
r Ruth. First, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on 
the cloud business profitability, medium or long
-
term, how you are thinking 
about that. Second, I would go ahead and take a short at the EC decision 
lately, clearly it is material for financials. 
How are you thinking about 
approaching that decision, and does that impact any of your other 
advertising businesses as far as innovation? And then finally, any thoughts 
on verticals that were strong this quarter that supported the organic revenue 
growth? T
hank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, on 
--
 
as you know, we don't break out by product, just adding a bit more 
color on cloud. We are clearly excited about the opportunity we have here 
and it does continue to drive sizable revenue growth as I said in my opening 
comments as did Sundar and w
e are seeing momentum in the business. I 
think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over 
500,000 increasing 3x year
-
on
-
year gives you an indication of the 
momentum in the business. It's obviously not a financial forecast but it does 
d
isplay the traction we are having with cloud in the market and GCP remains 
one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet, G
-
suite continues to 
have strong growth.
 
So, we are really pleased with what that means for both the longer term 
trends in the
 
profitability. We do believe that from 
--
 
the many years of 
investment we have already made and things like technical infrastructure 
and security which operate with tremendous efficiency that provides us with 
a benefit, but near term we are investing mean
ingfully in sales and 
engineering service support 
--
 
continuing to expand out regions to make 
sure that we are delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers 
and that's what we are really focused on.
 
In terms of I think your second question wa
s the EC there was really not 
much of an update there, we are still early in our analysis of the decision in 
the right next steps and we do have time to notify the commission of 
proposed remedies as well as implement changes. The main thing is, we are 
very
 
focused on helping users and advertisers and our reviewing our options 
it's an ongoing matter. So, there is not much more to comment on that one.
 
And then, the third question 
--
 
Justin Post
 
On verticals that were strong?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes. In terms of 
--
 
I t
hink that what you are trying to get out here on what 
are seeing in particular with sites revenue and there is not anyone thing to 
call out whether it's by vertical or steps that we are taking. And that's really 
what I would point you to more. I think it's
 
an important point that we are 
very excited about the opportunities here given both the underlying secular 
trends broadly with mobile. Sundar talked a lot about that. But, also all that 
we are able to layer on top of it just given the engineering acumen h
ere and 
we talked about this on prior calls, it's true again here this quarter that one 
change has been driving the results and so what you are seeing is the 
combined benefit of a number of changes we have made. It's really this 
maniacal focus on all eleme
nts of the user and advertiser experience and 
nothing to call out by vertical.
 
Justin Post
 
Thank you, Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is 
now open.
 
Mark May
 
Thanks for taking my 
questions. I think this first one is for Sundar. Data of 
course is a key differentiator and there is a lot of advertising, so maybe you 
could talk about how you've changed your use of Google search data and 
recently in areas outside of search and how that 
is or might impact the 
effectiveness of advertising on channels like YouTube and others outside of 
search?
 
And then, Ruth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned tremendous 
growth in mobile search in the quarter, I think that's a more emphatic 
statement in
 
recent quarters, hoping that maybe you could provide more 
color on some of the areas where you are seeing the change and quite 
trajectory coming from within mobile search? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On your first question, obviously, we do these things with th
e foremost thing 
being making sure, we do the right things for user privacy. But, within our 
own products we are trying to help users get a better experience across on 
the consumer side and the advertising side and I think there is opportunity 
there. And s
o, we will be thoughtful as we move forward.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then on mobile search, I think what you are hearing is, we are really 
pleased with the ongoing efforts there and as I just said there was not one 
change that really drove this, what extraordinary 
about the team is, with the 
focus on users and advertisers, what is it that is most useful Sundar has 
spoke about some of them with local, but it's really again 
--
 
it's a lot of small 
incremental efforts that in the aggregate continue to enable us to benef
it 

are seeing in the results again.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from 
--
 
Mark May
 
Nothing around, are you listening to this? It's something around like 
geography
 

 
Ruth Porat
 
Not sure, if that was directed to me or but in terms of geography I think 
hopefully one of the benefits the way we recast the data here last quarter 
was, so you can actually get a bit more insight into what's going on around 
th
e globe. And that's why I made the comment that we are having a really 
broad strength globally. You can see it in each one of the regions here. U.S. 
continues to deliver strong growth engagement across products, if you look 
at EMEA on a fixed FX basis up 2
1%, you can see the same in APAC, the 
same in other Americas. So, yes, there is broad based strength across 
geographies and I think 
--
 
I'm not calling out one particular area because 
the 
--
 
what you are seeing here is the secular trend I have used that ter
m a 
couple of times now. And we are continuing to benefit from that around the 
globe. And we are continuing to benefit from on top of that the efforts of our 
team.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse. 
Your 
line is now open.
 
Steven Ju
 
Okay. Thank you. Sundar, I was just wondering if you could give us some 
sense of advertiser option particularly among your retail appliance the store 
visit product, as it seems like there has been a large opportunity to drive 
of
fline purchasing. And Ruth, can you give us some sense of any headwinds 
you might be seeing in your streams of your revenue away from Play or GCP 
in the LNO revenue line as we have just knocked that across and just seeing 
a sequentially flat revenue line t
here. Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
I think I spoke about it in my opening remarks. But, since [indiscernible] 
measurement was announced three years ago advertisers have mentioned 
over 5 billion store visits globally. And I think we are just doing 
--
 
we have 
just 
badly scratched the surface. But, our marketing next in May we 
announced that the store visit measurement will also rollout for YouTube 
TrueView campaigns and we will be rolling out store sales measurement in 
the coming months. So, advertisers can actually
 
measure in
-
store revenue, 
store visits delivered by search and shopping apps.
 
So, we have had good proof points advertisers who have used it, for 
example, Virgin Holidays used it, factored in store sales measurements and 
they realized their search campaig
ns generate double the profit 
comparatively looking at online KPIs alone. So, I think there is a lot of 
opportunity there. And so, we will do more by over time.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then, you asked on the other revenue line it was up nicely again this 
quarter 42
% year
-
on
-
year and that obviously includes the impact of FX. It's 
obviously a mix of businesses including some of our bigger investment 
areas, most notably cloud and hardware and as I said at the outset Play 
continues to perform really well.
 
I think if you
 
are asking about the quarter
-
on
-
quarter sequentially you 
noted, we are talking about a mix of businesses that have different 
characteristics and just state the obvious Play is more hit driven. It's highly 
seasonal, hardware is also seasonal. So, the year
-
on
-
year provides a better 
sense to the dynamics of the business and that's where you can see in this 
line up year
-
on
-
year really nicely this quarter.
 
Steven Ju
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Coli
n Sebastian of Robert 
Baird. Your line is now open.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Thank you. Maybe just one question for Sundar. I wonder if you could 
update us on your thoughts regarding the conversions of Chrome and 
Android operating systems. And in particular I'm cur
ious whether the 
emergence of Google Assistant and Voice as a corollary across devices is a 
reason to move forward more integration between the two platforms. 
Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Look I'm 
--
 
I mean we have been thoughtfully doing it in putting users firs
t 
and I'm excited at how Android apps are coming to Chromebooks and we 
see that as a great opportunity and I think that will help us deliver a very 
compelling experience. And we just have started doing at this year and I 
expected to really get momentum as 
we go through to the next year.
 
So, that's an example of conversions and I think that will work really well 
and so. And in terms of products like Google Assistant and Voice, I think we 
will make sure for users it doesn't matter and they work across every 
p
latform they use including our platforms as well as other people's platform. 
So, we think about making sure our services free as many users as possible 
and so we are working on that as well.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our final ques
tion comes from the line of John Blackledge of 
Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
 
John Blackledge
 
Great. Two questions, so for Sundar or Ruth, within cloud could you talk 
about your view of G Suites enterprise penetration right now, kind of key 
driver
s of the adoption longer term. And if you view it as a potential 
differentiator for Google Cloud versus other large competitors. And then, 
within YouTube 60 minutes per day of viewing on phones and tablets 
obviously incredible at that scale. Any thoughts o
n kind of what could drive 
further material viewing or engagement growth over time? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And maybe on YouTube I would say, YouTube is one of those products which 
is scaling really well globally just like search did and we are seeing rea
l 
strong growth on mobile. And we are seeing real strong growth for YouTube 
on emerging markets as well. And we are seeing real strong growth on 
television.
 
So, if I look at YouTube on mobile on emerging markets on larger screens, 
they all look like 
newer opportunities and so I think there is a lot more 
growth ahead.
 
And on cloud, I think we have kind of answered it. Obviously, we see 
differentiated strengths and machine learning, data analytics, security and 
reliability. And the combination of not ju
st GCP, G Suite working together 
with GCP, we are seeing increasing win rates and option across enterprise 
customers. And I also think all the investments we are doing in terms of 
broadening our ecosystem including the newer partnerships with the 
companies
 
I mentioned earlier that should begin to payoff.
 
And overall, the return on investment from the hiring and region expansion 
we are doing. So, I think we are set
-
up incredibly well and look forward to 
the momentum ahead.

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third 
quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today 
are Ruth Porat and 
Sundar Pichai. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.
 
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward
-
looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long
-
term growth and innovation, the expected
 
performance of our businesses 
and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a 
number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
materially.
 
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discuss
ed in our Form 
10
-
K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Any forward
-
looking statements that we 
make are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation 
to update them.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A 
reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release.
 
As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor 
Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast 
from our IR websi
te where a replay of the call will be available later today.
 
And now, I'll hand the call over to Ruth.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thanks, Ellen. We had a terrific quarter. Revenues of 27.8 billion were up 
24% year
-
on
-
year, and also up 24% in constant curr
ency. Advertising 
revenues benefited from strong performance in sites, which was powered by 
tremendous results in mobile search. Healthy growth in network revenues 
was again led by our programmatic business. We also benefited from 
substantial growth in oth
er revenues from cloud, play and hardware.
 
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll view the quarter on a consolidated 
basis for Alphabet, focusing on year
-
over
-
year changes. Next, I will review 
results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will c
onclude with our 
outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the 
quarter, after which we will take your questions.
 
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial 
performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $
27.8 billion, up 24% 
year
-
over
-
year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues 
year
-
over
-
year of $255 million or $64 million after the impact of our hedging 
program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues 
grew 24% ye
ar
-
over
-
year.
 
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography; performance was strong in all 
regions. U.S. revenues were $12.9 billion, up 21% year
-
over
-
year. EMEA 
revenues were $9.1 billion, up 23% year
-
over
-
year in both reported and 
fixed FX terms. APAC revenu
es were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year 
and up 31% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues were $1.5 billion, 
up 33% year
-
over
-
year and up 32% in fixed FX terms.
 
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll 
discuss in
 
the Google segment results, were $11.1 billion, up 28% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 
25% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses. 
Specifically, costs associated with operating our dat
a centers, including 
depreciation, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware
-
related costs.
 
Operating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year
-
over
-
year. The year
-
on
-
year expense growth in part reflects the change in the timing of our ann
ual 
equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. 
As discussed previously, this change in SBC grant timing affects the 
quarterly pace of stock
-
based compensation in 2017, with elevated year
-
on
-
year expense growth in the fir
st half of the year, but benefits the year
-
on
-
year comparisons for Q3 and Q4.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the 
quarter was 78,101, up 2,495 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, 
the vast majority of new h
ires were engineers and product managers. In 
terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions were once 
again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the 
priority we place on this business.
 
Operating income was $7.8 b
illion, up 35% versus last year, and the 
operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was $197 million. 
We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press 
release. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the third quarter. Net in
come 
was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.57.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $3.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion with free cash flow of 
$6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with 
cash and marketable securities of 
$100.1 billion, of which approximately $60.5 billion or 60% is held overseas.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $27.5 billion, up 23% year
-
over
-
year. In terms
 
of 
the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, 
up 23% year
-
over
-
year, led again by mobile search, complemented by 
desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
 
Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year
-
on
-
year,
 
reflecting the 
ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google 
were $3.4 billion, up 40% year
-
over
-
year, fueled by cloud, play and 
hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a 
sense of the price and vo
lume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You 
can find the details in our earnings press release.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising 
revenues and up 32% year
-
over
-
year. The increase in sites TAC as a 
percentage
 
of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of 
network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth 
areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
 
Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues,
 
was up year
-
over
-
year, reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset 
by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the 
sites TAC rate year
-
over
-
year was driven by changes in partner agreements 
and the on
going shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more 
mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.
 
Google's stock
-
based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 
2% year
-
over
-
year. Operating income including the impact of SB
C was $8.7 
billion, up 29% versus last year and the operating margin was 32%. Accrued 
CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production 
equipment, facilities and data center construction.
 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets
. For the third quarter, Other Bets 
revenues were $302 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. 
Operating loss including the impact of SBC was $812 million for the third 
quarter.
 
Other Bets accrued CapEx was $77 million, primarily reflectin
g a reduced 
investment in Fiber, due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 
2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets.
 
A couple of updates; Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with 
a number of notable launches including th
e Nest Thermostat E, which is 
offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest also 
announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm 
system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera 
and 
corresponding software and services.
 
Waymo continues to expand its geographic presence and announced this 
morning that it will commence winter testing in Michigan to build on our 
progress to
-
date addressing the challenge of autonomous driving in cold 
weather, particularly with snow, sleet and ice. Michigan is the sixth state 
where Waymo is testing its self
-
driving vehicles. Over the last eight years, 
Waymo's cars have self
-
driven in more than 20 cities.
 
With Loon, we were pleased to announce just last 
week that the team is 
collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency Internet service to the hardest 
hit parts of Puerto Rico.
 
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer
-
term 
outlook. First, in terms of revenues, results this quarter a
gain reflect our 
relentless focus on innovation, which is growing our advertising revenues. I 
frequently highlight our culture of innovation.
 
In that regard, the most important point is that we are data driven with an 
extraordinary team of engineers, produ
ct managers and designers, who 
constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments 
annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences. This approach enables 
us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information 
continues
 
to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to 
the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware.
 
Further, our culture of innovation is building our non
-
advertising revenue 
streams in cloud, play and hardware. Earlier this month,
 
for example, we 
launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI 
software and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made 
by Google products we introduced last year. Longer
-
term, we remain excited 
about the opportun
ities in our Other Bets with ongoing progress.
 
Second, with respect to profitability, we continue to remain focused on long
-
term dollar growth versus margins. Pressure in our total cost of revenues 
reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher
 
growth businesses 
also carrying higher cost of revenues. In our advertising businesses, TAC 
continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and 
programmatic, carry higher TAC.
 
We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of
 
sites 
revenue. As we've frequently stated, we remain focused on profit dollar 
growth, and these areas are additive to our growth.
 
The other cost of revenues associated with our non
-
advertising businesses is 
also affected by product mix. In the fourth quar
ter in particular, the impact 
of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage 
of this business and holiday seasonality.
 
On operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our 
growing product areas. The more modes
t OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both 
the timing of stock
-
based compensation and the timing of sales and 
marketing spend, with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a 
single calendar quarter.
 
In particular, we're committed to sales and marketin
g investments in Q4 for 
the important holiday season. The most significant uptick in marketing will 
be to support our new expanded hardware line, which was just announced at 
the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, we are investing to support 
YouT
ube and our other platforms.
 
Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, 
including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset 
across Alphabet as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.
 
In concl
usion, a great quarter. Thank you. And let me now turn the call over 
to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thank you, Ruth. We had another great quarter. I've been really proud of 
the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing
 
to 
grow our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our 
early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to 
something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day.
 
Even though we are in the early 
days of AI, we are already rethinking how to 
build products around machine learning. It's a new paradigm compared to 
mobile
-
first software, and I'm thrilled how Google is leading the way.
 
Consumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with
 
computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to 
people rather than people needing to adapt to computers.
 
Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and our Assistant. We 
introduced Assistant last year and it continues to get bett
er every day, 
helping people get things done in the real world. Walmart and Target have 
recently integrated with Google Home, which means you can order everyday 
items from them much more easily.
 
500 million people now use the machine learning smarts of Goo
gle Photos to 
manage and share their memories. That billion plus people using Google 
Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking 
where they are going. And businesses are seeing how AI can help them 
grow.
 
Our open
-
source softwa
re, TensorFlow, is allowing anyone to use machine 
learning to solve problems even in industries like agriculture. Researches 
recently use TensorFlow to make smartphones able to identify disease in 
cassava plants, a major food source in the developing world
.
 
We made TensorFlow open
-
source and free because we fundamentally 
believe in creating computing platforms that developers can customize and 
build on. I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like 
Android and Chrome, have continued to grow,
 
enabling great experiences for 
people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands 
worldwide.
 
This quarter, we released the latest operating system, Android 8.0, and 
released a preview of ARCore, which brings augmented reality to exi
sting 
Android phones. Last week, we announced a partnership with Samsung to 
bring ARCore to all Galaxy devices.
 
Even though it's been an incredible busy few years and technology is moving 
rapidly, at our core, we remain an information company. Our mission 
to 
provide useful information to people in every corner of the world is 
unchanged. We care deeply about the quality of information we provide and 
constantly work to get this right. As technology evolves, we have to evolve 
with it to ensure quality informat
ion can flourish.
 
Our teams are making a big effort to support journalists and other people 
who produce high
-
quality information around the world. We are supporting 
publishers as they decide the right approach to free articles and subscription 
content. We 
are moving away from first click free to a more flexible model of 
content sampling. And we are working with publishers to build a frictionless 
payment solutions for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and 
find new readers.
 
As new threats arise, 
we are committed to protecting journalists and media 
organizations from hacking and denial
-
of
-
service attacks. For example, we 
just launched the advanced production program for Google accounts, which 
is designed to protect the accounts of those most at ris
k of targeted attacks, 
including journalists and other public figures. To wrap up my overview, I'm 
thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that 
billions of people use every day.
 
Now let's review our three big bets, starting wit
h YouTube. YouTube 
continues to see phenomenal growth as the premier global destination where 
people go to watch video. Three of the key areas we are focused on are; 
strengthening the existing community, continuing to drive growth and 
expanding our subscri
ptions business.
 
On the community side, we are helping create meaningfully interactions that 
bring creators and fans closer together. This quarter, we launched a new 
feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app. So the minute you 
see a video 
from a creator you love, you can share the fun with friends and 
family. We're also seeing significant growth in other areas.
 
As I mentioned in the last earnings call, YouTube now has over 1.5 billion 
users. On average, these users spend 60 minutes a day on
 
mobile. But this 
growth isn't just happening on desktop and mobile. YouTube now gets over 
100 million hours of watch time in the living room every day, and that's up 
70% in the past year alone.
 
We are continuing to invest in new subscription based monetiz
ation models. 
YouTube Red, our first foray into the subscription market, is on track to 
release over 40 original shows this year and YouTube TV, our live TV 
subscription service, continues to expand into new markets. It now covers 
two
-
thirds of U.S. househ
olds and is available in 15 metro areas.
 
Now on to Google Cloud; we continue to make progress winning over 
enterprise customers. Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud 
Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine 
learning, our 
commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which 
runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security.
 
Just yesterday we announced a new partnership at Cisco. We are 
collaborating on an open solution
 
that gives customers an easy approach to 
the cloud, enabling them to run apps that span both on
-
prem environments 
and Google Cloud Platform. G Suites, our collaboration and productivity 
applications are leading the industry. We have made improvements to d
rive, 
docs and Gmail launching new features to help teams work better together.
 
Nielsen recently moved to G Suite and said it's a great productivity and 
collaboration tool for their modern workforce. All of these things are driving 
momentum with customers 
and partners. Companies like Kohls, PayPal, 
Rolls
-
Royce Marine in Europe and popular messaging app, Hike in India, 
moved to Google Cloud. We also announced a new partnership with Marketo 
and expanded our relationship with Pivotal and VMware. To support our
 
growing global customer base, we introduced two new regions in the quarter 
in São Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go
-
to
-
market team.
 
Next, our hardware business. Earlier this month, we launched our second
-
generation family of Made by Google h
ardware products built with AI at the 
core. Last year, we focused on building the foundation to launch a line of 
devices Made by Google. This year, we are focused on bringing together the 
best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience
.
 
For example, the new Google Home Max is a smart speaker powered by the 
Assistant. It has AI
-
based smart sound, which adapts the audio experience 
to the user's environment context and preferences.
 
The new Pixel 2 has the world's best smartphone camera and
 
a useful 
feature where you can summon the Google Assistant by just squeezing the 
phone. To get these devices in people's hands, we are also focused on 
scaling our go
-
to
-
market strategy. We are investing more in marketing. 
We're launching in more countries
 
and we are offering these devices in more 
retailers, and we are already seeing results. Pre
-
orders of Pixel on day one 
this year were more than double what they were last.
 
Also this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help 
accelerate ou
r hardware business by bringing on a team of talented 
engineers. This deal lays the foundation for our continued efforts next year. 
And our advertising platforms continue to drive great results for our 
partners. While mobile has given rise to an unpreceden
ted amount of data 
and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it 
make 

 
will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers. But even 
as we give advertisers incredible scale and reach across our ad platforms, 
we know c
onsumer attention is scarce. That's why we are pleased YouTube 
ads continue to deliver the highest viewability rates in the industry.
 
YouTube now has a 95% ad viewability rate, which is significantly higher 
than the average 66% viewability rate of other vi
deo ads. We continue to 
see the industry shift to six second bumper ads and so greater adoption this 
quarter from brands like Bear, Ben & Jerry's, Louis Vuitton and Volvo. And 
Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners 
get 
online and grow their business.
 
On our last earnings call, I mentioned a free website builder for small 
businesses. During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it 
to build up websites, helping many of them get online for the first time. W
e 
also introduced local post, which allows small business owners to easily post 
their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals, 
right on Google Search in Maps.
 
Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we buil
d 
products that all businesses can succeed in. That mission also has a 
geographical dimension, and I wanted to say a word about the momentum 
we are seeing in Asia.
 
Our revenues are up significantly in the region, driven by great results we 
are driving for 
existing and new advertisers. That holds true across 
developed markets like Japan and emerging markets like the Philippines and 
Vietnam, all of which have seen the number of active advertisers grow by 
25% or more in the past 12 months. And this growth is b
ringing tremendous 
benefits to our partners there.
 
In the past three years, we have paid out more than $24 billion to our 
publisher, creator and app developer partners in Asia Pacific. And to help 
millions of people, we are building products specifically d
esigned for local 
markets in Asia.
 
In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce 
app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 
30 million transactions. I'm really excited about the potential this brings for
 
India's mostly cash

based economy.
 
As I said at the start, it's been a great quarter for Google. Just two weeks 
ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, 
which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opport
unity 
to countless businesses. It was amazing to see firsthand the transformative 
impact that information is having in schools, in the workplace and for local 
business.
 
As I said then, I remain a technology optimist, not only because I believe in 
technolog
y, but because I believe in people. I want to thank all the Googlers 
who continue to work so hard to advance our mission and to help people 
everywhere. Thank you.

And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line

Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One, we've seen a lot of 
partnership announcem
ents intra
-
quarter on the e
-
commerce side with 
Google Express and voice assisted shopping on Google Home. Wanted to 
understand better your ambitions in e
-
commerce as a marketplace or a 
platform and how that might also feed back into the advertising busines
s?
 
Second question would be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of 
how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either 
shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today? 
Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet,

Maybe I'll take the first question and give it to Ruth on the cash question. 
We are very excited about the partnerships we are getting here with large 
retailers, and we are seeing traction globally. We've obviously partnered 
with them through our adv
ertising products.
 
But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more 
seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I 
think there's tremendous interest here.
 
So we are just getting started. And I think you will se
e us make a lot more 
progress and have a lot more announcements. And I think we are going to 
be relentlessly focused on making the buying experience much more 
seamless for users. So there's a lot more to come.
 
Ruth Porat

Alphabet, Inc.
 
So in terms of 
your second question. There was really no change from the 
approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation. 
The priority is organic, as you said in your question. We have a host of really 
exciting opportunities and ensuring that 
we're investing to support long
-
term 
growth remains number one.
 
The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're 
pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been 
an important part of our history. And then
 
the third is the return of capital 
and no change or update there in terms of how we think about that.

Great, thanks. Two questions, please. Sundar, you talked about APAC. You 
called out Asia. And we noticed that too, that that year
-
over
-
year growth 
rate was higher than 

 
it was the highest, at least since you
've been 
disclosing that. And you provided some of whats, but any whys behind why 
that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally 
reached the tipping point? Is there something different that Alphabet/Google 
has done in Asia to accele
rate that growth?
 
And then, Ruth, can I ask you. You talked about the factors driving TAC and 
you mentioned changes in partner agreements. Is there any way you could 
give us any more color? Did you just renew some major partner agreements 
and there's nothi
ng of that magnitude into next year? Or should we just 
assume that this is just part of operations, there was nothing major recent, 
you could have major ones coming up? Just something to help us qualify 

 
I 
don't you think you'd used that language before 

 
what that indicated? 
Thanks a lot.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet, Inc.
 
The Asia question, largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, 
very long time. Our products are very heavily used there. And so we've 
worked hard to build a user base and th
en the mobile transformation is a 
secular shift there. That's definitely driving accelerated growth. And it 
creates a virtuous cycle. We see new advertisers coming on.
 
We are investing more in Asia as well in addition to our go
-
to
-
market teams. 
We are buil
ding out great product and engineering teams. That's what has 
led us to improve core products like Search, Maps, YouTube, et cetera, to 
work better in those regions. And also launched region
-
specific products like 
Google Tez in India. So I think, overall, 
that's creating a good virtuous cycle 
and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And on your TAC question, as I indicated in the opening comments. There 
are a couple of drivers here. One is changes in partner agreeme
nts. And I 
think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships 
across the mobile ecosystem. And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, 
which we've talked about a lot and the fact that it carries higher TAC 
because more mobile search
es are channeled through paid access points.
 
I think the most important point is that what you're seeing is we have a very 
healthy mobile business, search business and it is growing substantially and 
our focus remains on long
-
term revenue and profit dollar
 
growth.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. I had two. 
First, Ruth, you talked about the 
ongoing advertising innovation, and it's pretty clear that that's happening in 
mobile, which seems like it probably accelerated in the quarter. So I was 
hoping if you could comment on that. But then also, how do you think 
about 
where you are in terms of optimization on mobile relative to desktop? And 
then just second on YouTube. I was hoping you could comment on the 
extent to which you're seeing marketers return to the platform post the 
brand safety issues of 2Q and for a f
ew of those who may not be back on 
yet, what are they looking for to fully return? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So it felt like a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one 
item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites reve
nue, and that 
was the point of giving you a bit more color here. We are really pleased with 
the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have 
given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you 
more color on what d
o we mean by a culture of innovation, and that's really 
why I tried to get into a bit more about the rigor of the process.
 
And one of the key points is that we do have the opportunity, and we anchor 
this indeed, that we're constantly challenging assumption
s. We're running a 
lot of experiments to enhance user and advertiser experience. And the 
approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry 
evolves as user behavior evolves. And so what users wanted in the earlier 
days of smartphon
es when screens were smaller is obviously, very different 
from expectations users have today. Each quarter, the ads team introduces 
more than 100 enhancements out of a much larger pool of assumptions that 
they've tested. Machine learning is at the center o
f our processes and 
systems. And we do remain excited about the potential.
 
Desktop, I commented on. We are pleased with the ongoing strength of the 
business. It delivered solid revenue growth that remains an important form 
factor for certain more complex t
asks. We've talked about that in prior 
quarters. Things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And 
so I think with the strength here underscores the importance of desktop for 
many users in many task, notwithstanding, the growing utility of
 
mobile for 
users.
 
And then in terms of YouTube, I think you asked it. Well, we've been doing a 
lot to protect the ecosystems and do the right things for advertisers and 
users and content creators and the overwhelming majority of advertisers 
never left and
 
those who did, many are already back on the platform.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman

Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Thank you so much. Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us 
your thoughts on voice search. And I guess, in particular, how do you think 
about maintaining Google fleet as the way we search changes, and as we 
see increasing 
adoption of these voice
-
enabled digital assistance in the 
home? And part of it, I guess, I'm also wondering about is how do you think 
about your relationships with the partners? And if the device base broadens 
out, does your leverage with the partners chan
ge? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
It's a good question, Heather. Voice, it's important to remember, voice is 
one input. When you look at how customers interact, they obviously are 
interacting more and more naturally, seamlessly across a set of 
screens, 
computing works and context for them. And even then when they asked 
voice queries, the response always what they need is not voice alone. Think 
about walking into a store and if you could only ask using voice and the 
person has to reply in voice w
hat all is in the store. So that model applies.
 
So we expect a lot of continual experiences across screens, across 
modalities. So it's a big opportunity. I think it's opening up newer ways in 
which we are working with partners. I spoke earlier about the ki
nd of 
experiences we are now able to drive at Walmart and Target, which we could 
have done a year before. Thanks to voice, how we are using it in the Google 
Assistant and how we are driving these partnerships.
 
So there's a lot of excitement about how we ca
n do all of this differently. So 
we are using this as a good way to rethink everything we are doing with the 
caveat that voice still, overall, is an emerging category compared to how 
users use our products. So there's a lot of room ahead.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Hey, I like to 

 
maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses. Fir
st, on 
cloud. Maybe you could talk about some of the wins you're seeing and why 
people are necessarily choosing Google and the momentum there?
 
And then, secondly, on the hardware business. It feels a little confusing on 
what your real goal is there. Is tha
t to build a real independent separate 
hardware business? And how the Android relationships are going around 
that? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
First on cloud. Effectively, we are seeing strong momentum. And we already 
hear from customers that
 
we have outstanding technology. So the reason 
we win deals in many cases is because we have superior technology and 
people also see the room ahead, thanks to a lead in machine learning. And 
that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage. T
he main 
area where we need to get better is to scale our go
-
to
-
market and be in 
more places to effectively get more customers. And we are doing that a few 
different ways, Diane and team have really skilled our global sales force. But 
more importantly, I th
ink we are striking a lot of important partnerships with 
leading technology vendors to scale and reach more customers.
 
And so be the partnership at Cisco that we announced or, in this quarter, we 
also teamed up with Pivotal and VMware. And earlier the year
, you saw us 
partner with SAP. And all of this help customers more easily run their apps, 
both on
-
prem and in the cloud. And we are doing this all in a open way with 
Kubernetes. So that's the overall strategy, and I think that's really beginning 
to pay off
. And you will see us scale across all these dimensions for cloud in 
the year ahead.
 
In terms of hardware, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. 
Few reasons. Hardware is 

 
the intersection of hardware and software is how 
you drive computing f
orward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a 
single device business. For a long while, it was PCs then maybe plus 
smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you going to have 
different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and
 
to stitch it 
all together across, I think it's important we thoughtfully put our opinion 
forward. We're equally committed to working with the ecosystems and we 
provide the same basis on both sides, be it Android or Chrome. And it's 
going really well.
 
Our 
close partnership this quarter across a set of Android partners. You see 
great momentum at the recently launched Samsung Note 8. We announced 
ARCore on Samsung devices. So we have strong momentum there as well. 
So we're committed to pushing forward hard on
 
all these areas.

Your line is now open.
 
Ross Sandler

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Hi. I had a question for either Sundar or R
uth. It's just a philosophical 
question on TAC. So as the mobile search market matures, particularly in 
the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to 
pay any TAC to partners at all? Is the lesson learned from the Firefox, 
desk
top partner loss a couple of years ago was that you didn't lose any 
revenue and you stopped paying TAC on that agreement, why wouldn't the 
same logic apply to mobile search? If not now, at some point in the future?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, I me
an, first of all, we have a lot of experience in this area. We've 
been doing distribution deals for our search for well over a decade and I 
personally been involved all the way from the toolbar in the Chrome days. 
So by now, first of all, we want to constr
uct a win
-
win construct. So we 
always want to construct in which we do better when our partners to better. 
And so doing TAC well aligns us in that way and, historically, it has driven a 
lot of growth. And so it's a model we understand. We understand the ke
y 
economics behind it. And so we are very thoughtful about how we drive it 
forward. So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to 
give strong both revenue and earnings growth. And so I think we are pretty 
comfortable with how we are 
approaching it and so we'll continue to do that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the 
first one, a little bit on 
growing Alphabet's multi
-
app ecosystem. Sundar, how do you think about 
the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs 
and user growth on non
-
Android mobile platforms? Maybe talk about how 
you evaluate,
 
how you're doing there so far?
 
And then bigger picture. You've made large and exciting investment in 
growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets. I'd be curious to hear 
philosophically, how do you evaluate these opportunities and talk about 
some of 
the ROI thought processes or evaluation you make when making 
large capital allocation decisions?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So, on the first one. One of the unique things about how we approach 
product development is we've always, at Google, care about 
building our 
products for everyone. And be it Search or Gmail or Google Photos or 
Chrome, we work hard to drive it across all platforms.
 
Obviously, some products, their ability to make it work well on other 
platforms versus our native platforms, there are 
differences and so we 
understand that. It's partly why we are very committed to driving success on 
our platforms, both through the ecosystem and our hardware efforts as well.
 
So we think about it holistically. But you'll continue to see us put a lot of 
eff
ort into other platforms as well. For example, over the past couple of 
years, I think we've meaningfully improved our products on iOS, as an 
example.
 
On the other part, maybe Ruth, do you want to give color. I would just say, 
at a high level, we drive our 
investments because we think about it from a 
user perspective first. We see areas where there are clear user problems and 
we think about whether we can use computer science and our technology 
advantage as Google and Alphabet to give a differentiated offeri
ng for users. 
And we do that and then we think long
-
term. But that's how we do about it. 
Maybe Ruth can give more color there, too.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And then the numbers flow out of that, which is we look over a multi
-
year 
period. A lot of the t
hings that we're doing are multi
-
year investments, and 
that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long
-
term 
needs and opportunities that we could be addressing, if we're doing that 
well, we're delivering long
-
term revenue and earnin
gs growth. And those 
investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and 
flourish around the globe. Whether that responds to the first question on 
what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly, we take a multi
-
year look. We look 
at the business, technical, financial milestones along the 
way, and we allocate resources in order to make sure we're maximizing the 
long
-
term potential to deliver as we see is appropriate.

Thank you. I have two for Sundar, one on HTC. It's kind of interesting thing 
that you didn't buy the company, but yo
u bought talent. And I wonder, what 
does that move directly give you? And what did you think was lacking, I 
guess, from the product side before you made that move? Then I had one on 
YouTube.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On HTC, as we were working on our hardware efforts, we've been working 
with HTC very closely on the Pixel phones. So across the two companies, we 
saw a win
-
win construct, by which we could bring the team and the IP and 
other assets related to the Pixel bus
iness in
-
house. And it also allows HTC to 
focus better on their phones and the other products they're working on.
 
So it just made a lot of sense to do it. And I would also think about the 
overall capability we are getting, not just to make phones, but as w
e get into 
other product categories, like Google Home, VR and so on, right? And so it's 
important to continue to build that out. And the talent we saw there is 
definitely best
-
in
-
class.
 
Michael B. Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson LLC
 
Okay. And then on DIRECTV 

 
sorry, YouTube TV. It's clear that you guys 
have pretty good momentum, 50 markets already. I wonder, what has 
surprised you about the early consumer engagements? Anything you could 
share about early findings on the rollout of YouTube TV?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Yeah, main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's 
always been this promise on being able to, just like today on Google Search 
when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it. Bringing 
that kind of a seamle
ss experience on to TV, when you think about 
something you want to watch, making it seamless. And so, improving that 
process, I think, is really what people positively comment on.
 
Other things are being able to personalize it, bringing our machine learning
-
based recommendations over time. So that's how people notice. They get 
content, in which they are interested in, surfaced much better. So I think 
given where we are, I'm really excited at the initial reception. And we are 
gathering a lot of feedback, brin
ging it to more markets, and I'm going to 
work hard at making the product better.

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I'd like to just follow
-
up on an earlier 
question about e
-
commerce and specifically, a trend we see growing across 
the ecosystem of applying e
-
commerce data to 
targeting advertising. Maybe 
if you could describe how you view that at a high level and whether that's 
important to you, and growing that opportunity across all of your platforms. 
And perhaps, shed some light on areas where you may be able to tap into 
tha
t. You discussed partnerships with retailers, Android Pay. You're tracking 
off
-
line conversions more, even a product like Customer Match would seem 
like it'd be an opportunity to have your advertisers bring that type of data to 
the table. Would love to hea
r a little bit more about your thoughts on that?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
It's a good question, Dan. You kind of partially answered it. So you're 
welcome to come and work on our e
-
commerce team anytime. To us, as a 
vertical, we see huge opportunities
 
there. There's a lot of flywheel effects we 
see. Almost all e
-
commerce providers are really interested in, like, cloud for 
obvious reasons. So we see tremendous traction by which we are 

 
we can 
talk to them about cloud. They're already advertising partne
rs. They're 
beginning to work with us much more closely on driving a seamless 
shopping experience. We're working on payments. And so, it creates a nice 
flywheel effect, and we can do this globally across all the countries we do it 
in. And so, we are treati
ng it more thoughtfully and investing in addressing 
the vertical opportunity we see in front of us, and we'll continue working on 
that.

om Colin Sebastian of Robert

Colin Alan Sebastian

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of follow
-
ups. First on TAC, wondering if 
changes in partner agreements, since those are one of the key drivers of t
he 
increase in TAC, could we then see the rate of TAC growth moderate as you 
anniversary those deals?
 
And then, secondly, as it relates to voice and visual search inputs, I know 
it's still early for Google Lens. But overall, I'm wondering what portion of 
t
hose search queries are proving to be incremental to search, the search 
experience, or are they largely substituting for searches on screens? Thank 
you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on. 
We're pleased with our strong partnerships. We continue to stress the 
impact from the shift to mobile. And again, both Sundar and I have said it, 
our focus remains on the profit dollar growth. And we've got a really nice 
position and a strong growth area. 
So that's what you're seeing here. But as 
I also said, we do expect it to increase some from here. And you've got a 
couple of factors going on.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see users' 
informatio
n needs are only going up. And the amount of information they 
deal with are increasing. And as we add new modalities, it really drives a 
better experience for them.
 
Google Lens, there's a long way to go. But today, as humans, visual input is 
really big for
 
us. I mean, it's a lot higher bandwidth than everything else. 
And so bringing back to computing, I think, is a really important step in 
advancing how users can process information. And so I see that as an 
important step. And thanks to machine learning, we
'll be able to do these 
things a lot more powerfully. All of this I think, overall, adds to the search 
experience. And so I view that as all incremental, but it'll play out slowly 
over many years. And so we see this as a big opportunity ahead and we are 
in
vesting for it.

Thanks. Good afternoon. The revenue growth was o
ne of the highest growth 
rates you've seen in five years. I'm just curious if there was something that 
surprised you in the quarter or something that perhaps was an anomaly that 
we should be thinking about modeling going forward?
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc
.
 
So I tried to give you a bit of color going across the major lines. We feel 
we're really pleased with the sites' revenue growth, the performance in 
mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big 
categories, network revenue also was qu
ite strong. I think one thing to add 
there is programmatic continues to be a strong contributor. Generate 
significant growth, we've talked about that on prior calls.
 
Given all the ongoing advertiser adoption of programmatic buying and 
AdMob continues to se
e strength. What you're also seeing here is the 
traditional AdSense businesses. Overall, the pace of advertiser migration to 
programmatic affects this business kind of quarter
-
on
-
quarter as well as the 
policy changes that we've talked about in prior quarte
rs. And those factors 
were less of a drag in the last couple of quarters.
 
So you actually saw nicer revenue growth year
-
on
-
year here as well. It was 
up 16%. And then Sundar's talked a lot about the components of other 
revenues up nicely. We're really pleas
ed with what's going on there and 
then, on top of that, Other Bets. So we've got a couple of components to it 
and tried to give you color on each one.

Stephen Ju

Credit Suisse Securities (

Thank you. So Sundar, can you talk about how Google is positioning in the 
emerging markets over the l
onger term can be different versus what we are 
used to seeing here in the States. I mean, you talked about Tez in India, and 
that's just type of stuff that we're not even seeing here in the States. So is 
there a broader opportunity for you to do a larger l
and grab with more 
products?
 
And Ruth, should we assume that the relative size of the dollar contribution 
to the other revenue growth happened in the order you gave out in the 
prepared remarks, I guess, cloud, play, hardware? And if so, this would 
make it 
the second quarter in a row in which cloud is showing up as the 
largest contributor, I guess, as opposed to the third. So any perspective you 
can share in terms of the relative growth you maybe seeing recently? Thank 
you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On 
emerging markets, we do see a differentiated opportunity there partly 
because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets came mobile 
first, I think, gives rise to different ways users are adopting our products. 
And also, more importantly, the e
cosystem, which is built around, so for 
example, if you take e
-
commerce, the kind of models that are emerging in 
these countries are also a bit different. So I think we see a way to look at 
these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opp
ortunity

Alphabet,
 
Inc.
 
Thanks. Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our 
businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth accelerating 
meaningfully versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of 
mobile search by consumers, benefiting from o
ur ongoing efforts to enhance 
the efficacy of mobile search as well as from the holiday season. In addition, 
results reflect ongoing momentum in YouTube and programmatic 
advertising. There were a number of unusual items in the quarter that I will 
address d
uring the discussion of results.
 
With a move to our new Alphabet structure, we conducted a detailed review 
of business opportunities and investment levels across Google and Other 
Bets. We made some important decisions to prioritize the allocation of 
resour
ces and capital to maximize long
-
term potential within each area. We 
are pleased to be sharing financial results for each of Google and what we 
call the Other Bets and thereby provide more visibility into financial trends in 
each segment.
 
In light of our m
ove to segment reporting, I'm going to present to you in this 
order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, 
review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude 
with key themes for the near term. S
undar will then review our business and 
products highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
 
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial operational 
performance, total revenue was $21.3 billion, up 18% year over y
ear and up 
14% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we 
realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $1.3 
billion, or $1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding 
currency constant to
 
prior periods, our total revenue grew 24% year over 
year and 15% sequentially.
 
Alphabet revenues by geography also highlight both the strength of our 
business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds 
continue to have on our non
-
U.S. b
usiness. U.S. revenue was up 24% year 
over year to $10.3 billion and up 18% versus Q3. UK revenue was up 16% 
year over year to $1.9 billion and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the 
UK grew 20% year over year and 9% quarter over quarter. Rest of world
 
revenue was up 12% versus last year to $9.1 billion and up 12% versus Q3. 
In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year over year and up 14% 
sequentially.
 
Non
-
GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion in Q4, up 24% year over 
year, primarily driven by Go
ogle
-
related expenses, most notably due to 
costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, 
content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs due to 
the launch of our new Nexus, Chromecast, and Pixel devices.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating expenses were $6.6 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% 
year over year and up 15% versus Q3, primarily driven by R&D expense, 
particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other 
Bets established several years ago.
 
On a
 
GAAP basis, operating income was $5.4 billion, up 22% versus last 
year. The operating margin was 25%. Adjusting for stock
-
based 
compensation, our non
-
GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 22% 
versus last year. The operating margin was 32%.
 
With respe
ct to stock
-
based compensation, it totaled $1.4 billion, up 20% 
year over year and flat sequentially, primarily reflecting head count, which 
was up 15% versus last year and 3% versus 3Q 2015. The vast majority of 
new hires continue to be engineers and prod
uct managers.
 
Other income and expense similarly included an unusual item this quarter. 
Specifically, other income and expense was negative $180 million, due 
primarily to the write
-
down of securities received in conjunction with the sale 
of a business, off
setting interest income from the investment portfolio.
 
Finally, taxes also reflect the impact of certain one
-
time items in the quarter 
affecting the U.S. rate. Specifically, taxes reflect the resolution of a 
multiyear audit in the U.S. as well as the full
-
year impact in Q4 of the U.S. 
Congress making the R&D tax credit permanent. Our effective tax rate for 
the full year, including these one
-
time items, was 17%.
 
Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $6 billion on a non
-
GAAP 
basis. Earnings per dilu
ted share were $7.06 on a GAAP basis and $8.67 on 
a non
-
GAAP basis.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was 
$2.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.4 billion, with free cash flow of $4.3 
billion. We ended the quarter with a
 
cash and marketable securities balance 
of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $43 billion, or 59%, is 
held overseas.
 
Our cash balance reflects the impact of seasonal working capital 
requirements and our repurchase during the quarter of appro
ximately 2.4 
million shares of Alphabet Class C stock for a total repurchase amount of 
$1.8 billion. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a modest increase in 
the size of the stock repurchase we announced last quarter. You can find the 
details in our
 
earnings release of the total remaining authorization.
 
Let me now turn for the first time to our segment financial results. In our 
earnings release, we are providing key financial metrics for Google on the 
one hand and the combined Other Bet businesses on
 
the other hand. I will 
review the results for each segment with respect to revenues, operating 
income, and CapEx, which I will discuss. You can also find in the release 
details of stock
-
based compensation as well as depreciation, amortization, 
and impairm
ents for Google and the combined Other Bets.
 
As I go through the Google segment, I'll be providing the same level of 
detail we've presented in prior periods, both to best assist in comparability 
relative to prior periods and given the fact that Google cont
inues to 
represent the overwhelming majority of our results. For Other Bets, I'll be 
discussing revenue, operating income, and CapEx for the full year. Detail on 
a quarterly basis is included in the press release.
 
Keep in mind that Other Bets represents an
 
aggregation of businesses, many 
of which operate in distinct sectors with different business models. Given 
their stages of development, these businesses will have idiosyncrasies with 
respect to the timing of revenue, expenses, and CapEx resulting from 
mil
estones, partnerships, and other factors. You can expect that results for 
the combined Other Bets may be uneven in the near term, so it's likely to be 
more instructive to look at them on an annual or rolling 12
-
month basis to 
assess their trajectory.
 
Start
ing with the Google segment, which includes our Search and Ads 
business as well as related businesses such as Play, Hardware and Cloud and 
Apps, as well as our newer efforts within Google such as Machine Learning 
and Virtual Reality, Google revenue was $21
.2 billion, up 18% year over 
year. This reflects the impact of FX.
 
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.9 billion in the 
quarter, up 20% year over year, and up 14% sequentially, notwithstanding 
currency headwinds. Year
-
on
-
year growt
h reflects substantial strength in 
Mobile Search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery. As I 
mentioned previously, we also saw the benefits of consumers' greater use of 
mobile for shopping during this holiday season.
 
YouTube revenue 
continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven 
primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. 
Network revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year
-
on
-
year and up 12% 
sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of Programmatic,
 
offset 
by the traditional network businesses.
 
Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year over year and up 
20% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also 
had an impact on Other revenue. Year
-
over
-
year performance was d
riven by 
Play as well as continued strong growth in Cloud and Apps.
 
Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected 
by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 31% year over year and 
17% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were
 
down 13% year over year and 5% 
sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Sites, paid clicks were up 40% 
year over year and up 22% sequentially. Site CPCs were down 16% year 
over year and down 8% sequentially.
 
The movement in Google Sites paid clicks an
d CPCs primarily reflects the 
continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were up 2% 
year over year and up 1% sequentially. Network CPCs were down 8% year 
over year and up 7% sequentially. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.1 
billion or 
21% of total advertising revenue, up 14% sequentially and up 12% 
year over year.
 
As a reminder, the sites TAC line in our earnings release includes the TAC 
that we paid to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as 
distinct from their o
wn branded search. Operating income excluding SBC 
was $8 billion, up 28% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. 
Google stock
-
based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 
18% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of
 
SBC was 
$6.8 billion, up 30% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. 
CapEx for the quarter was $1.8 billion, reflecting investments in data center 
construction, production equipment and facilities. Full
-
year 2015 Google 
revenues were $74.5 bil
lion, operating income excluding SBC was $28 
billion; operating income including the impact of SBC was $23.4 billion and 
CapEx was $8.8 billion.
 
Turning to Other Bets' financials, Other Bets includes efforts such as all we 
are doing with Fiber, Verily, Cal
ico, Nest, self
-
driving cars, and our 
incubation activities in X. As discussed previously with respect to Other Bets, 
we're focused on optimizing resources across this portfolio in the near term, 
with the objective of maximizing Alphabet's long
-
term value 
creation. For 
the full
-
year 2015, Other Bets revenue was $448 million, up 37% versus last 
year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, 
Fiber and Verily.
 
As noted previously, the majority of efforts within the Other Bets are pre
-
re
venue. On a full
-
year basis, operating loss excluding SBC was $3.1 billion. 
As previously noted, these results reflect the impact of project milestones 
established several years ago. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss 
was $3.6 billion. Other Bets 
CapEx was $869 million for the full
-
year, 
primarily reflecting investment in our Fiber business.
 
Let me conclude with some comments about our continuing transformation 
of Alphabet. As Larry articulated in the 2013 Founders' Letter, and then, 
again, when an
nouncing the creation of Alphabet, incrementalism in 
technology leads to irrelevance over time, because change tends to be 
revolutionary, not evolutionary. This belief was the impetus for our 
organizational structure, which enhances focus on opportunities 
within 
Google and across Alphabet, while also pushing our leaders to extend the 
frontier that we are addressing.
 
Consistent with the move to Alphabet, we expanded transparency internally 
regarding the expenses and CapEx required in each business, which 
ben
efited our 2016 budgeting process and capital allocation decision
-
making. As part of this process, we established technical and business 
targets for a number of the businesses to set the appropriate pace of 
investment. We made necessary choices to align re
sources with those efforts 
that maximize the potential for long
-
term value creation, prioritizing certain 
efforts, while making tough calls in Others.
 
Given the fact that we are innovating in a number of exciting industries, in 
some areas, the optimal exec
ution path could encourage accelerated 
investment. In Others, we continue to receive interest in exploring 
partnerships or alternate approaches to commercializing our efforts. Verily is 
a great example of where we formed strategic partnerships with compani
es 
like Dexcom, J&J, Novartis, and Sanofi in order to accelerate our efforts. My 
main point here is that we remain on a journey, and it is still early days. We 
are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long
-
term 
revenues, profits an
d value.
 
Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue. As a 
reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally our strongest quarter, 
reflecting the benefit of the holidays. In addition, our GAAP results will 
continue to be affected by ch
anges in the relative strength of the dollar.
 
Second, operating expenses. As I said last quarter, our priority remains 
revenue growth, but that doesn't give us a pass on a rigorous approach to 
expense management. We continue to invest in longer
-
term opport
unities 
within both Google and Other Bets, consistent with our emphasis on pushing 
the frontier to adjacent areas and moon shots. Given the early
-
stage nature 
of a number of these efforts, they are likely to require additional investment 
prior to generatin
g meaningful revenues.
 
Notably, in many ways, some of Alphabet's biggest moon shots are in 
Google itself, from driving the next wave of computing through machine 
learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building 
platforms like virtu
al reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the 
next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to 
continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people.
 
Third, CapEx; as we've indicated previously, the vast majori
ty of CapEx 
supports Google. We view our computing capacity as a core competence and 
will continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, 
secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and 
services globally as well as
 
our Cloud and Apps businesses. In Other Bets, 
the majority of CapEx supports the ongoing deployment of Google Fiber. 
We're still operating in only a few cities, but have announced plans for 
additional cities, which we expect will be reflected in 2016 CapE
x.
 
Forth, our balance sheet. In 2016, we intend to align our capital structure 
with the Alphabet organization so that debt is held at the holding company 
level. That alignment would allow us to have greater flexibility as we 
continue to grow, including the
 
ability to utilize debt financing, if 
appropriate, and consistent with our changing product mix.
 
So my closing comment is that we saw tremendous revenue growth across 
our businesses and are applying discipline as we move to implement the 
Alphabet structur
e.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai

Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Ruth. It's great to be here to talk with you all again.
 
Above all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we 
have in mobile search and across Google's range of
 
businesses. What's most 
exciting is the incredible enthusiasm for our products among consumers and 
our partners.
 
Two things show this. First, on our last call, I shared that six of our 
consumer products, Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and Google 
Play, all have over a billion monthly active users each. I'm pleased to share 
that Gmail now joins those ranks, crossing that number last quarter. Of 
course, all of these products are very popular and continue to grow rapidly 
on mobile.
 
Second, there is in
credible momentum behind the Android ecosystem, and 
the model is working at scale. This is a group of companies with whom we 
have worked really hard to build strong relationships. At the center of this 
are Android phones, and it's exciting to see the lineu
p of flagship devices our 
partners are working on this year. And there are newer areas, which are 
showing a lot of promise.
 
In addition to an Android web partnership with New Balance and a new 
smartwatch from our friends at Casio, over 40 car brands worldw
ide are 
bringing Android Auto to their cars. Dozens of partners are integrating 
Android TV and Google Cast technology into living room products launching 
this year.
 
I want to talk about two main things today. First, some thoughts on the 
approach we are tak
ing to drive the next wave of innovation, and then, 
some thoughts on our advertising business and our newer emerging 
businesses.
 
First, a few words on our approach. At Google, we've always tried to bring 
our unique technical strengths to areas where we thi
nk we can make a big 
difference, like indexing the world's information to make it discoverable. We 
have focused a lot on really improving search in mobile and now we are 
investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in 
smart an
d helpful ways. This comes thanks to our years of investments in 
areas like natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge graph 
and other areas.
 
And the next wave will be powered by big advances in machine learning and 
artificial intelligence, an
 
area where we believe we lead the industry. Just 
last week, DeepMind published an incredible result, the first ever to master 
the game of Go with artificial intelligence. An amazing accomplishment, and 
I'm excited for the world championship in March. And 
in November, we 
open
-
sourced TensorFlow, our new machine learning system, to help 
accelerate discovery and development in the field.
 
Machine learning is making our products smarter and more useful for people 
every day. It powers Smart Reply, in Inbox by Gm
ail, which suggests short 
responses that are relevant to an incoming email. People absolutely love this 
feature. In fact, in just a few months, Smart Reply already makes up 10% of 
all mobile responses in Inbox.
 
From image recognition in photos to eliminati
ng email spam to better 
translation and voice recognition, our machine learning efforts are making a 
huge difference for people every day. In sum, we believe we've only 
scratched the surface of truly being there for our users anytime, anywhere, 
across all 
devices, giving them the assistance they need. We are excited to 
make even more progress on this vision in 2016.
 
The second part of our approach is to make sure we are solving big 
problems for everyone. We believe that someone in Indonesia should get 
the 
same quality email service or search results as someone in New York. This 
quarter I visited Korea, Vietnam, and India to speak with partners, 
developers, and students. It was a very inspiring trip. I even sat down at a 
local coffee shop with Dong Nguye
n, the creator of the popular Flappy Bird 
game, which has inspired Vietnam's growing community of developers and 
startups to think hard about how to create worldwide hits.
 
From providing Internet access in India's railway stations to making 
Chromebooks ava
ilable throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge 
opportunity we have to help the next 1 billion users come online and to have 
great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there. That's why 
creating open platforms that anyone can build on 
is core to Google's DNA, 
from Chrome to Android to Brillo to our latest virtual reality efforts.
 
It's still incredibly early innings for virtual reality as a platform, and 
Cardboard is just the first step, but we are excited by the progress we have 
seen. O
ur partners have shipped over 5 million Google Cardboard viewers, 
and we recently teamed up with The New York Times on a virtual reality 
experience in which over 1 million Times subscribers received Cardboard. 
And since launching in September, the Expediti
ons Pioneer Program has 
helped more than 500,000 students travel to places like the bottom of the 
sea or the surface of Mars. Beyond these early efforts, you'll see a lot more 
from us and our partners in 2016.
 
Now turning to the trends and highlights that 
we are seeing across our 
advertising business as well as some of the newer areas. It's hard to believe 
that AdWords just celebrated its 15th birthday. Just like Google Search and 
the computing devices we all use now, the product is largely unrecognizable 
f
rom the first version that launched in 2000, but the key value proposition 
remains unchanged. Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at 
precisely the right micro
-
moment when they are looking to buy something, 
go somewhere, know something, or do 
something.
 
Mobile is really helping us making these connections for marketers. As Ruth 
mentioned, Mobile Search was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. This 
holiday season, we found that shopping moments replaced shopping 
marathons. Shoppers turned 
to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online 
in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned 
to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers.
 
And people are actively buying products when searching on mobile. Our 
research s
hows that 30% of all online shopping purchases now happen on 
mobile phones. In fact, in the U.S., looking just at product listing ads, 
revenue from mobile phones exceeded desktop on Thanksgiving, Black 
Friday, and through the weekend. Not only were people 
using mobile ads to 
shop online, they also used their phones to find the best products and prices 
in stores around them.
 
Our local inventory ads help people see if a product they are looking for is in 
stock at a retailer nearby. Marketers at Lowe's and Tar
get find them useful 
because they can measure the foot traffic that their search ads drove. In 
fact, thanks to local inventory ads, Target reported millions of incremental 
store visits in the week leading up to Christmas.
 
We also continue to see great succ
ess in driving app downloads. Our app 
promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, which help marketers 
easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search, and across our 
Display Network, are getting great traction and delivering results for 
adverti
sers. We are now seeing a trend of advertisers moving their app 
install budgets to Google.
 
Now moving to video, people watch hundreds of millions of hours on 
YouTube every day, and it continues to be a must
-
have for all brand 
advertisers. Not only does You
Tube on mobile reach more 18 to 49
-
year
-
olds 
than any cable network in the U.S., but the time people spent watching 
YouTube in the living room more than doubled in 2015.
 
Brands turn to YouTube to inspire and engage potential customers. And with 
our recentl
y launched Shoppable TrueView Ads, marketers like Michael Kors 
can connect the dots between inspiration and purchase. And it is brands of 
all sizes. In fact, over the last two years, the number of small and medium
-
sized businesses advertising on YouTube ha
s doubled.
 
We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube 
to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend. In 
addition to our own measurement tools, we recently introduced support for 
third
-
party viewability vend
ors on YouTube.
 
YouTube is also a powerful platform for creators. Today, any creator can 
upload a video to YouTube and get discovered by over 1 billion people 
around the world. That global exposure has allowed YouTube and Google to 
pay out over $3 billion 
to the record industry to date.
 
We are also investing in the future of video. You can now watch the VR 
videos on YouTube, and content creators can now film in new YouTube 
spaces in Paris and Mumbai.
 
Between incredibly strong viewership growth, the move of 
advertising 
budgets to digital video, great new features, as well as the successful 
rollouts of YouTube Music and our YouTube Red subscription offering, I 
couldn't be more excited about the prospects for YouTube in the years 
ahead.
 
In programmatic video an
d display, we continue to see strong momentum. 
More marketers and publishers use programmatic automated ad buying and 
tools through our DoubleClick platform this holiday season than ever before. 
Programmatic video impressions doubled compared to the holida
y season 
last year. And in the week leading up to Black Friday, more than 60% of 
programmatic impressions came from mobile devices.
 
Lastly, I'll discuss some of our newer business areas, where we continue to 
see tremendous potential. Google Play, our hub f
or digital content, continues 
to see great momentum. In 2015, spend per buyer in the Play Store grew by 
more than 30% globally compared to 2014. We had particularly strong 
growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, 
thanks to
 
continued investments in payments capabilities.
 
On Hardware, as you know, last quarter, we launched the Nexus 5X and 
Nexus 6P in more than 30 countries. They are truly great examples of the 
best that Android can offer and have gotten great reviews. And th
e adoption 
of Chromebooks continues to gain a ton of momentum, particularly in 
education.
 
Before I wrap up, I want to share some thoughts on our Cloud and Apps 
group. Public Cloud services are a natural place for us, so we established a 
business unit late 
last year to take full advantage of the opportunity. I'm 
excited that Diane Greene, a highly respected industry vet, joined to lead it. 
As you know, Google pioneered the Cloud at scale. Our data centers have 
handled the workload of Google's own products fr
om Search to YouTube for 
17 years.
 
We are able to take that infrastructure and computing power and optimize it 
for all customers. Our data centers, infrastructure, machine learning, and 
premium data services are leaders in the Cloud space as is our price
-
t
o
-
performance ratio. And we are now able to bring this to bear just as the 
movement to Cloud has reached a tipping point.
 
Businesses now see that the easiest
-
to
-
use, most price
-
effective and secure 
infrastructure can best be obtained through the major publ
ic cloud providers. 
Google cloud platform is already used by more than four million applications. 
And we recently introduced a new way to purchase and use virtual 
machines, called Custom Machine Types, so that clients can tailor their 
purchases based on th
e memory they need to get the best possible cost and 
performance.
 
Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now 
incorporates the best of Google's new technologies like machine learning and 
natural language processing. Our adoption now
 
extends from large 
healthcare providers to retailers, to government. Last quarter, Catholic 
Health Initiatives, the nation's second largest non
-
profit health system with 
more than 100,000 employees, announced its move to Google Apps. There's 
great buzz at
 
Google around this area, and we continue to heavily ramp up 
investment here.
 
I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their 
amazing work, from Cloud computing, digital video, and the mobile 
revolution, to machine learning, virtu
al reality, and helping the next billion 
get online. Google has a front row seat on the trends that will define 
computing in the coming years. There is truly no more exciting place to 
come to work every day.
 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.

Thank you. And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. 
Your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Hello, thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First, Sundar, do 
you believe there is a non
-
trivial chance of Google and the DeepMind team 
achieving strong AI in the next five years or so?
 
And secon
dly, on your revenues, can you tell us what do you feel the drivers 
of Sites revenue growth and what seems to be an acceleration have legs and 
are more like improving this experience in advertiser returns and less like 
increasing ad lows, which one could a
rgue have a limited headway? Thank 
you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Carlos. I'll answer the first, and turn it over to Ruth on the second. 
On AI, we are obviously seeing incredible progress in this field. We make 
great strides, and we start taking
 
it for granted and look to the years ahead. 
It's always tough to predict what happens over a five
-
year timeframe, but I 
do see us making significant strides. Even a year ago, I wouldn't have 
predicted that we would be in a strong position to mount a serio
us challenge 
to the world champion in Go this year. So looking at the pace of progress, I 
think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the 
coming years, but I still think it's early days, and there's a long
-
term 
investment for us.

And then, on Sites' revenue, what the results reflect is, is product strength, 
geographic breadth, and obviously, the added backdrop of an active holiday 
season with the Sites' revenue up 20% year
-
on
-
year notwithstanding the 
cu
rrency impact. The way we look at it is we've got extraordinary capability 
and strength in Search, and then ongoing innovation across the platform.
 
As we talked about last quarter, we did benefit from a change made in Q3 in 
ad format with respect to mobile
 
search and we do continue to benefit from 
that change. Mobile search growth was the biggest driver again this quarter. 
And then, in terms of YouTube, the momentum continues. The story 
continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and 
Google Preferred as distinct from Display on YouTube. And then, just to 
round it out, desktop search remains a solid contributor as well.

Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two on margins now that we have 
the new disclosure 

 
and thanks for all of th
at information. With core 
Google, we saw a very nice operating margin improvement in 2015 versus 
2014. Wanted to know if we could get a little bit color on what drove that, 
whether it was incremental revenue, pricing, cost efficiency, how you sort of 
think
 
about what drove that? And the opposite for Other Bets, clearly, a 
bigger loss in 2015 versus 2014. Maybe a little bit of color on the volatility 
as you called it out, and how that might develop over time. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Certainly.
 
So starting with Other Bets, as I said in my prepared remarks, 
we're at the beginning of a journey with the creation of Alphabet and 
breaking this out into the segments is a meaningful step. As you look at 
some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more 
instructive to look at 
annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a 
quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses as we 
talked about.
 
So that would explain the 2014/2015 trend here. It just underscores tha
t 
we're investing in the business, we've made some tough choices, and as I 
said, in terms of how we're allocated across the various businesses, but an 
important area for us and tried to give you the sizing here in the segment 
information.
 
And then, in term
s of overall Google, we're continuing to invest there as 
well. We're investing quite meaningfully, as I previously said, the 70
-
20
-
10 
model is an instructive framework that Larry's articulated for a long time. 
And as I tried to stress in my opening comment
s, we're looking to push the 
frontier both within Google and Other Bets. So ongoing innovation is key to 
all that we're doing in Google, and it's benefiting users and the ecosystem 
broadly. So you're continuing to see us invest there, and notwithstanding, 
that you see the results that you have here today.

Great, thank you. Sundar, thank y
ou for the color on your initiatives with the 
Cloud, and we're all very excited about Diane Greene's hiring. I was 
wondering if you could share with us when you were having conversations 
with corporate customers over the last 12 months, what were the bigge
st 
areas of change or things that they said Google needed to work on in order 
to win over their Cloud business versus, say, them choosing to go with an 
AWS or an Azure? And can you talk to us about how that change might 
progress and how we might see that f
ilter through in 2016? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Heather. I'm very excited to have Diane here as well. We are 
already getting significant traction. It's a strongly growing business for us. 
And we plan to invest significantly in 2016. 
It'll be one of our major 
investment areas. In terms of talking to customers, first of all, as I said 
earlier, the Cloud platform is now already used and trusted by over four 
million applications. And a lot of it is about making sure we are very 
seriously 
committed to the space, which we are.
 
And in terms of wanting, there's a breadth of feature requirements, and so 
we've been carefully taking customer feedback and addressing all those 
needs. And as time goes by, I think we are getting very competitive. We 
have natural advantages in doing this, but we also need to make sure we 
address all the feature needs, and that's what we've been focused on. And I 
think we are at a point now where the product is ready to be used at scale. 
And so I expect to get significa
nt traction in 2016.

Sundar, could you talk a little bit about 

 
provide any milestones for 
autonomous vehicles and Nest? They're two of the Other Bets that we're 
particularly intrigued by here. I know they're very long
-
term bets, but the 
milestones that you've seen that kind 
of give you confidence in the forward 
direction of those businesses? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So I'll take that. Those are two of the businesses that are, as we call them, 
Other Bets. Look, on the self
-
driving cars, we have an extraordinary t
ech 
team. We've been working on it for many years, and the focus is developing 
technology with a real emphasis on safety and understanding what it takes 
to build and operate fully autonomous vehicles.
 
We continue to make great progress. We've now driven 1.
3 million miles 
with important data regarding the safety and utility, and that's what we're 
really focused on. We've got prototypes on streets in two cities. So we're 
continuing to execute against that and continuing to build it out.
 
And then, on Nest, we 
have now more than 14,000 developers who've joined 
the Works with Nest program, enabling them to connect with Nest products 
through the Cloud. The team refreshed the entire product portfolio in 2015. 
That resulted in very strong year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter 
revenue growth, and again, similarly, they're just executing against that 
business plan.

Thank you. Ruth, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail on 
the U.S. acceleration. It's been pretty strong fou
r quarters in a row. Is that 
YouTube and Search? Any more detail on that would really be helpful if those 
individual businesses have accelerated. And then, on the Other Bets 
business, clearly, and you mentioned milestones a couple of times, the 
losses have
 
really increased over the last two quarters. Could you share any 
of those milestones with us? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Sure. So starting with the U.S., I think the main point is that we've had 
meaningful growth in all geographies, reflecting
 
the product strength and the 
added tailwind of the holiday season. And looking forward, we would expect 
typical seasonal patterns to hold Q4. As you know well, it tends to be our 
strongest quarter. But specifically on the U.S., that as we talked about las
t 
quarter, really reflects the diversity of our products here. Each is doing well. 
Mobile growth, as both Sundar and I talked about, was the key driver yet 
again. But YouTube and programmatic continue to deliver strong growth, 
and that translates into the 
results that you saw for the U.S. We obviously 
had a nice lift from retail, no surprise given the holiday season. But I think 
simply put, it's the diversity of doing a lot across a lot of different products.
 
And then in terms of the milestones and your que
stion regarding Other Bets, 
as I mentioned in the opening comments, results this quarter were affected 
by project milestones. Those milestones were established several years ago. 
And that's why I called out that it could be lumpy on a quarterly basis and 
w
hy we look at it over a year, over rolling 12 months, and I'm not going to 
break it out in more detail than that. As Larry said, when we announced 
Alphabet, it's an exciting new chapter. It is about getting more ambitious 
things done. We're doing that in a
 
framework to ensure we are disciplined 
with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established 
some time ago.

Okay, thank you. Sundar, you just called out Gmail as the latest among your 
products to reach 1
 
billion users. So I guess at this point, you're explicitly 
monetizing Search, YouTube, and Gmail to some degree, while some of the 
other products maybe they're a bit more nascent are still not monetized or 
under
-
monetized, it seems. So big picture as you 
look at the next 1 billion 
users who want to come online and use your products, are you in any hurry 
to begin monetization at all?
 
And, Ruth, I think since you came on board, CapEx is down basically every 
quarter. Granted, fourth quarter of 2014 had the di
scretionary real estate 
purchase in there, but in your budgeting process for 2016, is the nature of 
what you're going to be spending money on changing much at all for core 
Google? And in regards to the CapEx for the Other Bets, being primarily for 
Fiber, i
t seems like there are six upcoming cities and 11 potential cities. 
What is the green
-
lighting process for whether a city gets considered or not? 
Okay, thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
Great. I take a very long
-
term view towards this. When we look at 
the scale 
of mobile for the first time in our lifetime, so I think we have a platform 
which is going to reach one day the entirety of the world's population, so it 
will be over 5 billion users. And from our standpoint, core to our mission, we 
want to be in
 
a position where we are helping users throughout the day. We 
are assisting users with their core information needs across all our products. 
And I think if we do that well, a lot of that information is commercial, and 
hence our monetization works effective
ly as well, as you've seen this year. 
And so very focused on long
-
term building that user experience to be 
assisting users, and that's the framework with which we think about it.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And then in terms of CapEx, you've noted the important difference on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our 
facilities expansion that we called out last year on top of continued 
investment in our technical infrastructur
e. But really to the heart of your 
question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated 
investment in CapEx, and that's to support both Google and Other Bets. As 
we often talk about, we view our technical infrastructure as a key strategic 
asse
t for the company. We have terrific scale and efficiency, and the team 
has done an extraordinary job innovating to achieve efficiencies following a 
period of heavier investment in 2014.
 
So we're now delivering about three times the compute power for the sa
me 
amount of power or dollars we did five years ago. And that's an important 
point because it explains some of the slower CapEx in 2015. But given our 
commitment to have the most potent infrastructure, we do expect to 
increase CapEx in 2016. And for Google
, that is intended to continue to 
support growth in our consumer products and services globally as well as all 
that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked 
about, so CapEx in both areas there.
 
And then, in terms of Fiber and wh
at we're doing more broadly in Other 
Bets, Fiber will continue to be, we expect, the biggest consumer. And again, 
you identified the driver of it. It obviously increases as we execute in a 
growing number of cities. One of the main things that also affected
 
2015 is 
the rollout was really measured as we worked to enhance the construction 
process and efficiency, doing things like developing relationships with cities 
and establishing protocol with construction partners, but we have more cities 
announced. And ob
viously, as we execute on those, that takes more CapEx 
as well.

Thanks for taking the questions, two things. First, Sundar, if you could, talk 
a little bit about YouTube. It's been several 
quarters now where you've 
talked about the mix shift toward TrueView ads bringing down the average 
CPC for Sites. But can you talk about the trend that you're seeing there 
more on a like
-
for
-
like basis, and whether in theory that should tighten up 
more rel
ative to search ads going forward?
 
And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business, we've seen roughly 
300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so. I know 
you're talking obviously about the investments around cloud and machine 
learning. Do you think there is still potential there for profitability to improve 
in that segment? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Let me start first on YouTube monetization. There's really no change from 
my comment last quarter. YouTube had very heal
thy revenue growth, again, 
driven by growth in TrueView and other video ads, but the monetization 
story is still evolving. It's still early innings, and we're focused on the 
opportunity to get larger offline budgets moved to YouTube. Given the level 
of use
r engagement globally and the compelling nature of demographics, it 
does remain a very attractive platform. In the near term, given the growth 
in viewership, YouTube TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to 
affect our overall Sites monetization mix.
 
And then in terms of Google and margin outlook I think is really what you're 
getting at, I'll go back to my prior comment. What we achieved here by 
pulling out the two pieces is providing, obviously, greater visibility into what 
we're investing within the
 
Other Bets, but want to underscore that we 
continue to invest in Google. We're in early innings in many areas. And I 
already referenced back to the framework we use, which is to continue to 
push the frontier within Google as well to adjacent areas. You na
med one, 
we've talked about it on this call, it's very important, Cloud and Apps, and all 
that we're looking to invest there.
 
But we're doing more than that. It's also the moon shot areas, it's virtual 
reality and other areas, and these are exciting early
-
stage efforts. We do 
expect we'll be in a position to discuss in greater detail over time. I'll let you 
estimate the short
-
term impact, but we believe the investment is really 
important as we're enhancing the long
-
term potential for Google and 
continuing t
o really enrich the ecosystem.

Thanks f
or taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the YouTube 
comments you made and the progress in the living rooms and the progress 
of the YouTube Red, can you just talk a little bit about how you think about 
potentially going into more original scr
ipted longer form content, or even 
licensed longer form content to go after even a larger share of offline ad 
budgets?
 
And then, secondly, the rest of world, can you just talk about what you're 
seeing in the emerging market CPCs on a constant currency basi
s? How big 
is that gap now between the emerging markets in the U.S. and how do you 
think about closing that longer term? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai

Google, Inc.
 
On YouTube, let me answer first on YouTube. On YouTube, obviously, the 
overall momentum has been g
reat. We have over a billion users watching 
hundreds of millions of hours. To me interestingly 

 
sorry. Let me answer 
the YouTube question first. On YouTube, we have great momentum. We 
have over a billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. And i
n fact, 
80% of YouTube's views are from outside of the U.S. It's been an incredible 
year where I feel the team is on fire, focusing on launching YouTube Red, 
YouTube Music. And as you saw at Sundance, a big push on YouTube 
Originals with a focus from our t
op creators to create exclusive content for 
YouTube Red users. And so I'm really excited about all the new investments 
we are doing there, and users are responding very positively. And so I think 
it's going to be an exciting 2016 for YouTube.

And then, in the rest of worlds, it's already growing at a high rate off a large 
base. And we're really pleased with the ongoing progress there. In addition 
to mobile, we benefited from Play and our Universal App Campaigns, as 
Sundar 
said. We're continuing to invest meaningfully in rest of world. We 
view it as a very sizable opportunity, bringing the next four billion online and 
all the opportunities there. So that's really the main focus for us at this 
point, is continuing to build ou
t availability, access, and products for the rest 
of world.

Paul Vogel

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Grea
t. Thanks. Just two questions. One, just going back to CPCs real quickly, 
if we were to normalize out both TrueView and currency, I'm just wondering, 
any comments on how core search is doing and just how core mobile search 
is doing from a pricing standpoin
t.
 
And then second, just on the CapEx side, I'm just curious how you think 
about utilization across all of your products? And you obviously spent a lot in 
the past, are we at a good spot? Do we need to spend ahead? Or is there a 
lot of capacity that isn't 
being utilized right now? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So in terms of CPCs, other than YouTube, I guess, the other comments to 
add are in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format 
changes that we talked about in the third quarte
r. That also increased our 
overall click base. And we believe this click growth is a positive indicator of 
ads that are proving to be more relevant to users. In other words, the CPC 
trend reflects the fact that the denominator's growing faster than the 
num
erator. But we do view that as a long
-
term upside opportunity for both 
CPCs and revenue. So mobile continues to be very healthy as evidenced as I 
tried to indicate in my opening comments and Sundar did as well. And 
similarly, Desktop growth remains very he
althy.
 
In terms of CapEx, I guess, the main point is we do expect it will be 
increasing in 2016. I've already address that. I think part of it's you got in 
the way you asked the question, which is we've achieved efficiencies after 
this heavy spend in 2014.
 
And that's where the team was very focused, is 
we ramped up spend, and then we've been focused on how to extract the 
most efficiency here. And that, as I said, does explain some of the slower 
CapEx in 2015, and the reason we've been very focused on indica
ting that it 
will be increasing to support all that we're doing. It's quite a bit of 
requirements on both the Google side and what we're doing in Other Bets, 
and Fiber specifically. So part of it was the 2014 spend and the digestion in 
2015.

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc

Great. Thanks. I just have two questions for Sundar. Most of them have 
been answered already. But on the UK, Sundar, it's now growing over 20% 
despite a tougher comp. And that's the most mature digital advertising 
economy globally. And we haven't been ov
er 20% at Google for three
-
plus 
years. So is this mostly a function of mobile search hitting its strides?
 
Is there anything else that's driving that growth up? And what do you think 
that says about the maturity or lack thereof of digital advertising global
ly as 
we look at all other regions? And then, you also made the comment during 
the prepared remarks that ARPU for Play, I believe you were referring to 
Play is up 30%. Is that on a like
-
for
-
like geo basis? And is that a function of 
the personalization effo
rts that Google has been doing within Play? Or is that 
more a function of just the overall content flowing through Play evolving and 
maturing? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
On the first half, when I think about growth, you're right. And as Ruth 
m
entioned earlier, too, mobile search, YouTube, they're all working well. But 
I would take into account overall a secular shift to mobile, how users are 
adopting mobile. And on top of that, I think we're working hard to serve our 
users well on mobile. So it
's a combination of all of that, and I think the 
model is working well.
 
On Play, to be very clear, spend per buyer is up 30%, and that's globally. 
And it's a function of, as you pointed out, I think we've made good strides in 
terms of personalizing the exp
erience for each user. And I think that's borne 
fruit. But a lot of it is also improving our ability to handle payments for users 
and developers, and to do that better through time at a global scale.

Thank you. I think they're both for Ruth. I just wanted to make sure I was 
interpreting your comments correctly earlier. You talked about looking at 
the 
trendline on a trailing 12
-
month basis with the Other Bets losses to give a 
sense of the trendline. I think operating losses roughly doubled on a year
-
on
-
year basis on a trailing basis. Is that sort of the trajectory that you're 
wanting us to think abo
ut going forward?
 
And then, more of a housekeeping question around Other Bets, can you just 
describe what you mean by project milestones and maybe provide an 
example of that? And then, on the Search business, can you talk about what 
sort of progress that y
ou've seen in the auction in terms of closing the gap 
between the average mobile CPC and desktop? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So the trend, when I talked about looking at an annual or rolling 12
-
month 
to assess trends, it was really to say that 
there can be idiosyncrasies on a 
quarterly basis that 

 
so it leads to a lumpiness, just again, given how early
-
stage these are, and any particular events in one or more companies can 
affect the overall numbers. It was not intended to, say, take the 2014 o
ver 
2015 and extrapolate, far from it. The budgeting process that we went 
through was a very rigorous process. As I said my opening comments, we 
prioritized some, we made some tough calls, but very much with a view of 
having a very disciplined envelope aro
und the way we are looking at the 
opportunities we have across the Other Bets. And so we look them again 
opportunity by opportunity.
 
In terms of the milestones, they can really vary for a number of things, but 
it would be linked to anything at the company,
 
which, in our view, whether 
it's technically or from a business perspective, advances the development of 
the company, the value of the company, and we're not going to go into 
detail on each one of the specific companies. I think your second question 
was a
round Search in terms of the monetization trends in Search, and I 
think I've already addressed that one as well.
 
When I first provided color on desktop and mobile, the point is really about 
the health of both of them, and as I've already said here on this 
call, mobile 
continues to outperform, desktop growth remains healthy. And with all the 
comments that both Sundar and I made with respect to mobile, it should be 
clear that mobile search revenue was up significantly this quarter.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ellen 
West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Ellen West
 
Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphab
et's 
fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar 
Pichai and Ruth Porat.
 
Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today regarding our business, performance and operations, and our 
expected level
 
of capital expenditures may be considered forward
-
looking 
and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer 
to the risk factors discussed in our most re
cent Form 10
-
K filed with the 
SEC.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of non
-
GAAP to GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the 
public th
rough our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.
 
And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

call as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google after four y
ears as CEO of 

Google a timeless machine, enduring values and an opportunity to have an 

leave plenty
 
of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth.
 

to give greater insight into our business. Search and other Google properties 
continue to drive great results with total rev
enues in 2019 of $98 billion and 

YouTube reached $15 billion in ads revenues in 2019 growing at 36%, 
compared with 2018, and it now has over 20 million music and premium 
paid subscr
ibers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers, ending 
2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other non
-
advertising revenues.
 
Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year
-
on
-
year, driven by signi
ficant growth in GCP. The growth rate of GCP was 

accelerated from 2018 to 2019. Before I talk about the highlights of the 
quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts ab
out my 
approach to managing Alphabet and Other Bets.
 

-
term view investing in deep computer science 
and technology. Important trends like the wider adoption and application of 
artificial intelligence, ambient computing, and the move
 
to the Cloud 
underline our investments across Google and our other Alphabet companies. 
Our work in healthcare is a great example of how our investments in these 
areas allows us to deliver solutions across an entire sector.
 
Google Cloud works with hospital
s and healthcare providers to securely 

than in paper records or on premises. Our AI teams at Google also work with 
partners to apply AI to help them and their patients whether it s d
eveloping 
better health systems or helping with the diagnosis and deduction of 
disease.
 
Among their broader efforts are Other Bets, Verily and Calico, are also 
partnering with industry leaders to use AI and cloud technologies to improve 
clinical trials, re
search, and drug development. Our thesis has always been 
to apply these deep computer science capabilities across Google and our 
Other Bets to grow and develop into new areas. The Alphabet structure 
allows us to have a portfolio of different businesses wit
h different time 
horizons without trying to stretch a single management team across 
different areas.
 

-
term view managing the portfolio with a 
discipline and rigor needed to deliver long
-
term returns. Many of our Other 
Bets are 
getting to the stage where it now makes sense for them to partner 

technological leadership is widely reported. Its cars have driven 20 million 
miles across more than 25 U.S. cities. Waymo is
 
now serving over 1,500 
monthly active riders in Metro Phoenix and continuous scaling fully driver 
less by matching early riders with driver less vehicles and charging for these 
rides.
 

ic 

businesses to build out ride
-
hailing and delivery business lines. And Verily is 
an example of a company in the portfolio that has outside investors, Silver 
Lake and Temasek, as well as 
its own board will consider opportunities for 
some of our Other Bets to take similar steps over time.
 
Now, onto highlights from the quarter. First, Search and related Google 
properties. As I mentioned on our last call, our neural network
-
based 
technique fo
r natural language processing called BERT, is the biggest 
advancement in search in the last five years. It now impacts 10% of 
searches and in Q4; we roll it out in over 70 languages. In Maps, we are 
celebrating our fifteenth anniversary very soon and in th
e past year we 
brought reliable directions to 630 million additional people in locations that 

-
mapped.
 
We added as many buildings to Maps using ML in 2019 as we have added 
using all techniques in the previous decade. With all these i
mprovements 
user growth is strong and the range of things people are doing with Google 
Maps continues to expand as well. The Google Assistant now helps more 
than 500 million monthly users across 90 counties to get things done, across 
smart speakers and sma
rt displays, phones, TVs, cars and more.
 
Shopping and commerce is another exciting area. We are making strong 
leadership hires in this area to help build a thriving business for partners of 
all sizes. Over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday weekend,
 
we had 
the largest number of daily shoppers on Google.com ever in our history. 
Throughout the entire holiday shopping season, we also expanded the 
selection of products on Google due to a 4X uptick in the number of U.S. 
merchants participating in our shop
ping actions program.
 
Second, YouTube. Speaking of shopping, people can now easily buy products 
in YouTube's home feed and search results making it possible for advertisers 
to reach even more audiences. Try searching for Puma shoes review on 
YouTube to see
 
an example. With all the related content on YouTube like 
unboxing and beauty videos, this is the format people love and it delivers a 
simple in
-
video buying experience.
 
A huge focus is continuing our work to keep YouTube safe for users, 
creators, and adve
rtisers. You may have seen a blog post today about our 
work to promote authoritative content and remove misleading information 
about the upcoming 2020 elections. For example, we are applying our 
deceptive content policies to reduce misleading information a
bout voting 
locations or the census process.
 
As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with YouTube's growth in advertising 
and subscriptions and we are also pleased with the early results from other 
revenue options we offer creators, including memberships, b
rand 
integrations, merchandise, and ticket sales. Continuing on now to cloud. We 
are really pleased with the momentum we are seeing in cloud. Year
-
on
-
year, 
the number of deals over $50 million more than doubled.
 

-
to
-
market expa
nsion are resulting in 
customer momentum. Wayfair is one of the many retailers who successfully 
ran holiday operations on Google Cloud. In addition, Lowe's which began 
transitioning of its legacy e
-
commerce system in late 2018 to Google Cloud 
worked with u
s during this year's peak holiday buying season to improve the 
stability of their e
-
commerce site.
 
Worth noting, at the peak time, customers in our Black Friday/Cyber Monday 
program used for 4x to computer resources, compared to previous year and 
our platf
orm experienced 100% uptime. Lufthansa Group is using our AI 
Solutions to develop new tools that will improve air travel operations. The 
U.S. Postal Service also chose Google Cloud AI to improve business 
processes and customer experience. We have recently 
signed a 10
-
year 
agreement with Sabre to help them improve operations and develop new air 
line and hospitality services.
 

announce that over $80 billion has been earned by developers a
round the 
world from Google Play showing the popularity of our platform. There are 
now over 2 billion active monthly users of Google Play. Hardware is still in 
the early stages of delivering on our vision for ambient computing.
 
Our home devices demonstrate
 
how this vision can come to life in creating 
the home of the future with our new Nest Mini and Nest Hub Max selling well 
over the holidays, following on from the Pixel 3a, which sold well last year. 
With Pixel 4, we continue to build out our capabilities 
and are keenly focused 
on execution delivering great user experiences and broadening our 
distribution, and our pending acquisition of Fitbit will give us a foundation in 
variables. I'm excited about our roadmap ahead across our products.
 
Overall, in 2020, 
our teams at Google are focusing on four key things. First, 
creating the most helpful products for everyone. We are really focused on 
ensuring that our products like Search, Maps and Assistant are helping 
people in their daily lives. Second, providing the 
most trusted experiences 

and security, while also keeping harmful content of our systems.
 
Third, executing at scale. This will show up as more seamless products 
across various 
surfaces and platforms like the Google Assistant, deeper 
partnerships and better use of our shared infrastructure. For example, 
Activision Blizzard recently chose Google as a strategic partner using Google 
Cloud's computing infrastructure, YouTube for live
 
streaming, and our AI 
tools. Putting together these multi
-
product partnerships helps us unlock 
great opportunities for our partners.
 
And fourth, creating sustainable value. This means optimizing our usage of 
computing resources and also growing business o
pportunities in areas like 

happening at the company and a real sense of excitement and focus. I want 
to thank our employees for all the great work in 2019.
 

over to Ruth and I look forward to your questions.
 
Ruth Porat
 

alphabet revenues of $162 billion, up 18% year
-
on
-
year or 20% in constant 
currency. In dollar terms, this represents an
 
increase of $25 billion in 
revenues relative to 2018. I will review our quarterly and annual results, 
including our new revenue disclosures and conclude with our outlook. 
Sundar and I will then take your questions.
 
Starting with consolidated Alphabet resu
lts, in the fourth quarter, our total 
revenues were $46.1 billion, up 17% year
-
on
-
year and up 19% in constant 
currency. Our results were driven by ongoing strength in Search, YouTube, 
and Google Cloud offset by a decline in hardware revenues. Details of 
Al
phabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our 
earnings press release.
 
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of 
revenues, including TAC, was 21 billion, up 17% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of 
revenues on
 
a consolidated basis was 12.5 billion, up 19% year
-
over
-
year, 
primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses. The biggest factors here again 
this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other 
operations, including depreciation, and then conte
nt acquisition costs, 
primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content in 
what has been a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our 
newer paid YouTube music and premium subscription services, as well as 
YouTube TV, which
 
have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of 
their revenues. These were partially offset by a decline in cost associated 
with lower hardware sales.
 
Operating expenses were 15.8 billion with headcount growth being the 
largest driver of year
-
on
-
year growth for R&D and sales and marketing 
expenses. Headcount drives both compensation and related facilities 
expenses. After headcount growth, the biggest driver in R&D expenses was 
an increase in valuation
-
based compensation charges in certain Other Be
ts. 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled 2.6 billion; headcount was up 4,803 from 
the third quarter, and up 20% over 2018.
 
Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In 
terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases wer
e again in 
Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the 
Looker acquisition, which closed in December. Operating income was 9.3 
billion, up 13% year
-
over
-
year for an operating margin of 20%.
 
Other income and expense was 1.4 b
illion, which primarily reflects an 
increase in the market value of certain publicly traded equities, as well as a 
non
-
cash gain from a Verily transaction. We provide more detail on the line 
items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective ta
x rate was 
0.3% for the fourth quarter and was 13% for the full
-
year.
 
The fourth quarter ETR reflects the impact of discrete items, including the 
resolution of multi
-
year audits. As you have seen in prior years, ETR can 
vary on a quarterly basis. Net incom
e was 10.7 billion and earnings per 
diluted share were $15.35.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was 6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating 
cash flow was 14.4 billion with free cash f
low of 8.4 billion. We ended the 
quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately 120 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were 45.8 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year and this of 
cou
rse is on a GAAP or floating FX basis. Google Search and other 
advertising revenues were 27.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year
-
over
-
year, reflecting ongoing momentum in mobile and desktop.
 
YouTube advertising revenues were 4.7 billion, up 31% year
-
on
-
ye
ar, driven 
by substantial growth in direct response and ongoing healthy growth and 
brand advertising, which remains the largest component. Network 
advertising revenues were 6 billion, up 8% year
-
on
-
year led by growth in 
Google Ad Manager.
 
Turning to Google
 
Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were 2.6 
billion for the fourth quarter, up 53% year
-
over
-
year, driven by significant 
growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth and G Suite. The growth rate of 
GCP was meaningfully higher than that of cloud overall
. GCP growth was led 
by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics platform.
 
We also saw strong uptake of our multi
-
cloud Anthos offering. Ongoing 
growth in G Suite continued to reflect growth in both SMB and enterprise 
segments and both seat 
count and average revenue per seat. The other 
revenues line now consists of Google Play followed by hardware and 

-
advertising services, mainly at subscription offerings, 
YouTube premium, YouTube music, and YouTube TV.
 
In the fourth quarter, ot
her revenues were 5.3 billion, up 10% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play offset by declines in 
hardware. YouTube's contribution to other revenues benefited from 
subscriber growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app re
venues had 
strong growth driven by an increase in the number of active buyers.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were 8.5 billion or 22% of total advertising 
revenues and up 14% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
advertising revenues was down
 
year
-
over
-
year, reflecting once again a 
favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties. Google 
operating income was 11.5 billion, up 20% versus last year and the 
operating margin was 25%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was 6.6 
billion
, reflecting investments in data centers followed by servers and office 
facilities.
 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the full
-
year 2019, 
revenues were 659 million, up 11% versus 2018, primarily generated by 
Fiber and Verily. Operating loss f
or Other Bets was 4.8 billion for the full
-
year 2019 versus an operating loss of 3.4 billion in 2018.
 
Let me conclude with a few observations on the quarter and our longer
-
term 
outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to date relative to the first
 
quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the first 

about the revenue and investment outlook for each of these newly disclosed 
component parts.
 
First, wit
h respect to search and other advertising. Although we don't report 
search revenues on a fixed FX basis, the delta between fixed and floating 
growth rates at the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on search 
revenues or a headwind of approximatel
y 2 percentage points in 2019. At 
our scale, we are pleased with our rate of growth for 2019 and see ample 
opportunity going forward.
 
What's exciting for us as we look ahead at Search and other Google 
properties is the ongoing opportunity to support users 
and advertisers with 
new ads experiences and improved measurement. Second, with respect to 
YouTube advertising, at a year
-
on
-
year growth rate more than 30% in the 

YouTube.
 
We see sub
stantial continuing opportunity is in direct response, as well as 
with brand advertisers. As Sundar shared earlier, the non
-
advertising 
services at YouTube, mainly from subscriptions reached a $3 billion revenue 
run rate in the fourth quarter. We continue 
to invest across YouTube to grow 
over the long
-
term. In the ad supported proportion of YouTube, we pay out 
a majority of revenues to our creators, reflected in our content acquisition 
costs.
 
On top of that, there are other expenses, including infrastructur
e and 
networking costs, as well as the costs of our content responsibility efforts to 

meaningfully to grow our subscriptions, which have higher content 
acquisition cost ratios.
 
Tu
rning next to Google Cloud. We are very confident that there is an 

with the growth trajectory of GCP, which we see in customer momentum, 
the growing size of the average contract, and
 
of course revenues. The 

-
year 
commitments with us is reflected in our backlog, which ended the year at 
11.4 billion substantially all of which relates to Google Cloud.
 
Given our position as a chal

building out our go
-
to market capabilities, executing against our product 
roadmap and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure focused on 
21 markets and six industries. In terms of hardware, as Su
ndar noted in his 
opening remarks, we remain focused on the long
-
term opportunity with 
ambient computing.
 
We believe our strengths in AI and software give us an advantage in 
providing seamless experiences to users wherever they are across multiple 
surfaces
. We have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in 
hardware engineering, as well as building out supply and physical 

-
dollar revenue business 
in the past three years.
 

 
to our acquisition of Fitbit, which will add strong 
capabilities in wearables and advance our vision of ambient computing for 
the android ecosystem. As we look at the near term product roadmap, we 
continue to execute at a measured pace. In other Bets, we 
are sharpening 
our focus on the metrics and milestones against which capital allocation is 
determined, and we continue to assess where external capital is additive to 
governance and execution.
 

headcount and in CapEx to 
support the growth opportunities we see across Alphabet. With respect to 
headcount, in 2019, Alphabet headcount grew by 20%, reflecting investment 
in key areas such as Cloud. Overall, we expect the growth rate of headcount 
to be s
lightly higher in 2020, due to the combined impact of investment in 
priority areas, plus the decision to move certain vendor functions in
-
house, 
as well as from the planned impact of the Fitbit acquisition.
 
On SBC, as a reminder, our full year equity refre
sh grants are made to 
employees during the first quarter of 2020 and you will see the step
-
up in 
our first quarter results. In terms of CapEx in 2020, we intend to increase 
our investment in both technical infrastructure and office facilities versus 
2019. 
Within technical infrastructure, the investments in particular support 
ongoing demand for machine learning across our business, as well as for 
Cloud, Search, Ads, and YouTube.
 
Relative to 2019, we anticipate relatively more spend on servers then on 
data ce
nter construction. At this scale of investment, we remain very 
focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight 
management of our supply chain.
 
Finally, on capital returns. In the fourth quarter, we repurchase $6.1 billion 
of shares, whic
h was more than double the amount of repurchase in the 
fourth quarter of 2018. As of year
-
end, we had $21 billion remaining in the 
program and our focused on executing on the remaining authorization at a 
pace that is at least consistent with what you saw i
n the fourth quarter.
 
In conclusion, we remain very confident about the opportunities across 
Alphabet and in our ability to continue to deliver at the steady pace we have 
shown. Sundar and I will now take your questions.

Answer Session
 
Operato
r
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from 
Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Hi. Thank you very much Sundar and Ruth and I guess, I'm sure you're 
going to hear this a million times tonigh
t, but thank you so much for the 
enhanced disclosure of, I think this is the best Google call or Alphabet call I 

given us a lot of stuff here. I just wanted to focus a little bit on G
CP and the 
comments that you made and either if you want to think about this for 
Google Cloud collectively or just for GCP, just given the revenue run rate 
that you are at, how do we think about the gross margin profile of this 
business, is it fair to look
 
at some of the other Cloud players when they were 
disclosing similar run rates to get a sense for what their gross margins were? 
Or is there a reason why your business might look slightly different? Thank 
you so much again.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you for those 

pleased with the momentum here. GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in 
the fourth quarter and as we noted is growing at a meaningfully higher pace 
than Google Cloud overall. In terms of your margin questi
on, look, I think 
our view is obviously the competitive dynamics and the Cloud market are 
very different today. We are investing aggressively given the opportunity 
which I tried to make clear in opening comments.
 
Given the opportunity we see and the moment

accelerated our investment in our go
-
to
-


focused on building out our product road map and extending the global 
footprint o
f our infrastructure. And I will leave the forecasting to you.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your 
line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thank you so much. Maybe two parts if I can. Sundar,
 
to you first 

 
a lot of 
innovation that company put on display over the past year, Ruth talked in 
her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and 
outperformance going forward. What are you most excited about when you 
see the comp
any trying to align, what improves consumer utility along with 
what continues to drive growth in the various segments of the business? 
That would be number one, and two, Ruth maybe for you, you had talked 
about variability of revenue last quarter going int
o Q4, but unless I missed 

expecting in terms of variability in Q4 and any color you could give on how 
that played out or how we should be thinking about variability of revenue 
going forw
ard? Thank you so much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Eric, I think overall, I presume you're meaning across everything we do, and 


 

investing on it for a while, but applying it and actually driving u
sed cases to 
users. So, for example, you know using AI to dramatically improve natural 
language processing to make 10% of our search results better is a kind of 

 
When I look at 

 
we do see a lot of commercial experiences across o
ur 
properties, be it Search or YouTube and the opportunity to create a better 

which we see as a big opportunity. And across our businesses be it YouTube, 
Cloud, Play, or hardware in
 
addition to search, you know we are seeing 
strength in a lot of these areas and we share a common technological 
approach across all of them. And so that gives us a synergistic way to 
approach these areas as well.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then on your sec
ond question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate 
of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall and we do see 
ample opportunity ahead. When we talk about variability of revenue, the 
way we've talked about it in the past very much hold
s true, which is where 
we don't manage for any particular quarter. We manage focused on what's 
in the best for users and with a lot of testing that goes around it. And so 
really the point is there will be variability and we're focused on continued 

 
the co
ntinued long
-
term opportunity and we do see that opportunity, the ads 
opportunity to be significant.
 
Apart from the secular shift to digital, we continue to be very focused on the 
benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience,
 
our view is that all helps grow the addressable market, but there will be 
variability over time because we're very focused on what's in the right long
-
term interest.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug 
Anmuth from JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. 
Sundar, first, just hope you could talk more about Google Cloud. Great to 
see the $10 billion run rate. Just curious if you ca
n help gauge the progress 
over the past year, and then where do you think the biggest areas of 
differentiation
-
why in an increasingly competitive space? And then Ruth, can 
you just give some of your latest thoughts on balancing growth and 
profitability acr
oss the Google segment and Other Bets? And as you enter 
this year, do you see additional opportunities to drive increased profitability 
without impacting the long
-
term potential of the businesses? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Doug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few t
houghts on some of the progress we 
made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as 
well. Definitely under Thomas' leadership, I think we have clearly focused on 
six industry verticals across 21 markets and so doubling down on th
ose 
efforts, bringing in a lot of new products and compliance certification, so 
effectively expanding the TAM, which we serve. Ruth mentioned, the team is 
on track to triple our sales force in three years, including bringing in a 
number of senior strategic
 
hires and supplementing it with a channel 
partnership program.
 
I think the progress I've seen in our customer focus 

 
with our customer 
success organization and the contracting framework have all been great 
progress for us. Overall, every time we are, esp
ecially in one of these larger 
deals, they are effectively looking for a technology partner. So, 
differentiation is not just what we bring to table in terms of Cloud, where we 
have differentiated capabilities, but in many cases, it's what we bring as 
Googl
e. So, if you take an area like healthcare, all the investments we are 
making in healthcare across Google, and in some cases, Alphabet.
 
If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our 
experience working in travel verticals as well. So
, I think 

 
and over time, I 
also think the AI
-
based, industry
-
specific solutions we are working on will 
end up being a differentiating factor as well.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of your second question, investing for growth and how we 
balance growth and prof
itability, the approach to capital allocation and the 
pace of investing continues to be guided by the same three drivers that 
we've talked about previously. First and most important is investing to 
support the long
-
term earnings growth and the opportunitie
s that we see 
there. Second, we do remain focused on optimizing investments within each 
product area. And then third, as we've talked about on prior calls, is 
investing to support operational excellence and that includes things like 
driving efficiencies in
 
our technical infrastructure, which I spoke about.
 
When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we, as we've 
talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to 
support the growth that we see. It starts with Search, wh
ile also investing to 
build new businesses and we've talked about a couple of them already 
today. Cloud is clearly an area where we're investing aggressively.
 
In Hardware, we've been investing heavily by developing our capabilities in 
hardware engineering,
 
as well as building out supply and physical 
distribution chains. And then in YouTube, as I mentioned in opening 
comments, we do continue to build out our subscription services. It's still in 
the early days there and we're making a sizable investment to bu
ild it out, 
taking a long
-
term view here.
 
So, we are leaning into investing for long
-
term growth. That's been a core 
principle here and remains such while looking at where can we optimize 
within portfolios and where can operational efficiencies be additive
.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Great. Thank you both.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, Sundar, I thought your 
2020 focal points are real
ly helpful, creating the most helpful products for 
everyone and then the most trusted experience for users. I was curious to 
kind of focus in those comments on payments in YouTube. You've had a lot 
of payment strategies over the last couple of years. So, t
alk about what 
types of investments or products you think you need to really remove 
friction and drive better payment adoption. And then on the YouTube side, if 
you sort of look at how people are using YouTube now from an engagement 
perspective, what types
 
of changes do you foresee you need to make in 
order to really make it a more helpful product to drive engagement even 
higher on the YouTube platform? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Brian thanks. On the payment side, clearly I spoke earlier about the kind of 
experi
ences people see across our properties, including people do come with 
an intent to discover, learn and commercially engage as well, and when 
they're looking to transact, payments ends up playing a critical role. So the 
less friction you have, it tends to w
ork better. So, we've been really focused 
on doing that and getting more of our users set up in the right state.
 
We've had a lot of traction with our payments product over the past 18 
months. We had a tremendously successful launch in India from which we 
l
earnt a lot of features, and we are bringing that and we are revamping our 
payments products globally. And so I'm excited by that rollout, which is 
coming up in 2020. I think that will make the experience better.
 
On the YouTube side, I guess your question 
is about how are users engaging 
with the product. Overall, all our user metrics are very strong. They're global 
in nature and increasingly we see newer verticals beginning to grow as well. 
So, YouTube is working horizontally well at scale. And for us, it's
 
making 
sure, as an ecosystem, it works better so that the content there, the 
experiences there are improving.
 
We take our content responsibility work seriously, which makes more 
content creators engaged and makes it a more valuable product for 
advertisers
 
as well. But also supplementing the content you see there with 
other types of accessorizing things, be it merchandising, ticket sales. When 
we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and search 
ads over time, if we can bring that to You
Tube when we see an opportunity, 
I think that sets us up well for the long term there.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. 
Your line is now open.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thanks. Ruth, in 
North America, was there anything that was abnormally 
unusual? Facebook had cited some weakness in North America. It looks like 
your North America number was relatively weak versus the last four years. 
Is there 

 
was there any anomaly that we should be awa
re of? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks for that. So, the regional breakdown also reflects product mix within 
regions. The U.S. year
-
on
-
year growth rate does reflect a decline in 
Hardware revenues relative to what was a fairly strong Hardware revenue 
growth ra
te in 4Q 2018 and not much more to call out than that.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit 
Suisse. Your line is now open.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Thank you. So, Sundar I guess some of the more cross product line 
synergies are sho
wing up in an integrated software and hardware effort with 
the stuff like the Pixel, but you've come up through the ranks at Google, so 
you're undoubtedly pretty sensitive to the various interests across various 
teams, but we're wondering what you may be l
ooking to do to break down, I 
guess, what might have been more of a siloed effort in Google's history? 
Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
I think 

 
I spoke about execution at scale. And so for us that means, you 
have these product areas, which are focused on their user
s, but we are 
setting up teams which cut across all these areas and make sure they can 
bring their synergies and work at scale. So, last year, we set up a core 
infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey 
work across, what does
 
the shared infrastructure engineers can use so that 
we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy 
AI across all these products? So, I think that's been a good example of 
bringing teams together.
 
Another big area where we invest
ed like that to break down silos is our 
partnerships. We set up a global partnerships team. And our ability to bring 
a common Google perspective to our big global partners has helped us strike 
many new partnerships. I mentioned Activision Blizzard as an ex
ample. And 
they work and they're very synergistic with Cloud as well. To my point 
earlier, when people engage with us on Cloud, they're looking for 

 
they're 
interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board.
 
Google Assistant is a great exampl
e of 

 
because we are focused on the user 
and the experience cuts across several of our product areas. It's been a 
great mechanism, by which we can break down silos as well, but it's a great 
question and I spend a lot of time on it.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Thank you.
 
O
perator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO 
Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I had two questions. One clarifying one for 
Ruth and then maybe a big picture one for Sundar. Ruth, you
 
distinguished 
between the growth of brand advertising and direct response on YouTube. 
Those comments were very clear. I just want to follow up and ask you just, 
how you make that distinction between brand and direct response. Is it 
different pricing model
? Is it the presence of ad revenue share with a creator 
or both? Would just be curious on that distinction? And then to Sundar, the 
big picture one, we have heard others in the ecosystem talk about 
headwinds from targeting growing. Certainly, there are reg
ulatory changes 
that also apply to you. You've made some changes to various Google 
advertising platforms. And of course, you're an owner of two of the largest, 
most important platforms in Chrome and the Android operating system. I 
could ask you a billion t
hings on that last one, but what I'd really like to ask 
is the big picture question, if we roll up these sort of things for your total 
advertising business, how important are changes here to your top line 
growth? Are you seeing notable headwinds from these
 
types of changes in 
the ecosystem as well? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, on the first one, we have again this quarter talked about brand and 
direct response. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, brand is 
growing at a healthy pace and remains the largest 
component of YouTube 
ads. Direct response is growing 

 
continues to grow at a very substantial 
growth. The distinction here is the format for 

 
in direct response, we're 
letting brands insert a tailored call to action in a video ad, such as signing up 
for 
a newsletter or scheduling an appointment or downloading an app or 
booking a trip, things of those sort. That's why it's the direct response 
category.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And on the broader questions about headwinds, it's something we always 
need to take a look 
at. We try to stay focused on users and our partners and 
we realize for these things to scale, you need to make sure the ecosystem is 
working well. And so we are engaged in these issues and we anticipate and 
structurally work on them early on. So, it's how
 
we broadly approach these 
things. And so there's nothing notable to call out other than there will be 
continued changes in these ecosystems and our ability to anticipate and 
adapt is key to the years ahead.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes 
from Justin Post from Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Thank you. I'd like to ask a couple of bigger picture things on the new 
disclosures. So, first on YouTube monetization, assuming you have about 2 
billion users, 
it's about $7 or $8 per user. Just wondering how you feel about 
that monetization level given all the usage you're seeing there, and is there 
significant room to raise that when you compare it to other social networks? 
And then secondly, on the Cloud backl
og, a very strong number at [11.4], 
versus our IaaS/PaaS revenue rates, just wondering about how strong the 
new deals have been that you've signed in the last six months? It sounds 
like really good traction there, and then the profitability of these deals,
 
how 
do you feel about that? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the question on YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. 
You're right; it's a platform working at scale. I think 

 
Ruth spoke a little bit 
about brand and direct response. I think dir
ect response is a huge growth 
area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people 
are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in 
YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big 
opportu
nity for us. So, looking across, I think, there is more room, 
significantly more room, over the mid to long term on monetization levels. 
And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it.
 
On Cloud, definitely we are increasingly doing much larger deals. And these 
deals can sometimes span beyond Cloud as well and they can touch many 
areas. So as an example, if you're an automotive company, we can be 
talking to you across Cloud, Android Auto,
 
in some cases, Waymo, and they 
all happen to be strong platforms 

 
partners on the advertising side as well. 
So, these are large deals, and we do want to build these in a sustainable 
way so that we can serve the partner well, and so profitability has been
 
something we are very focused on as well.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And just to add a little more to that, where the $11.4 billion backlog number 
is for us, we view it as a way to quantify the traction that we're having. And 
as you know well, in the enterprise 
phase, these tend to grow over time, and 
profitability as such comes across the cohorts. However, the point that we 
were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is we 
are investing aggressively in Cloud overall given the opportunity
 
that we see 
and the momentum we're having and we'll continue to do so.
 
Justin Post
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Youssef Squali from 
SunTrust. Your line is now open.
 
Youssef Squali
 
Okay. Great. Thank you. Two quick ones. 
First, Ruth, has the shortened 
holiday season had much of an impact on your Search business in North 
America? And then, Sundar, as you talk about automation, machine 
learning, AI, how much of advertisers' search spend is now on auto bidding? 
And how do you
 
think smart bidding is effective 

 
is affecting spending 
growth and pricing? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, on the holiday shopping season, there is really nothing to highlight 
there. What we find is there are seasonal puts and takes in any given period, 
so re
ally nothing to note.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On 

 
I don't have specific numbers here, but 

 
to add here, but effectively, 
we do see significant traction in these areas and advertisers are leveraging 
the features we have, we are bringing it here, be it smart bidding
, auto 
bidding, there's tremendous traction with our advertisers here.
 
Youssef Squali
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore. 
Your line is now open.
 
Kevin Rippey
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This i
s primarily for Sundar. As you think 
about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in 
healthcare, how do you manage those risks, which likely in a scenario where 
autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having 
those 
in
-
house and perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what 
you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises? I know they're all 
held underneath the Alphabet umbrella, but just sort of big picture how you 
think about managing that r
isk over time? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Kevin. We are 

 
as I spoke earlier in the remarks, part of the reason 
we are making sure we are investing in the proper governance structures so 
that we don't try to scale as a management across these importa
nt areas. 
Some of these are 

 
have regulatory aspects to it. We are, for some of these 
bets as well, and Verily is a great example, we have brought in outside 
investors, people with expertise and setting up proper board structures and 
governance for these.
 
So, I think those all help and we'll continue to evaluate these on a periodic 
basis and bring that rigor and discipline, but I do think Alphabet gives us a 
more flexible framework, if you will, to both have the independence when we 
need, but where we can 
have common shared synergies, like our AI 
investments, bring that to bear as well.
 
Kevin Rippey
 
Thanks.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. 
Your line is now open.
 
Ben Wheeler
 
Hi. This is Ben on for Mark. Thanks for t
aking the question. Ruth, I just kind 
of want to double click on something you said before in terms of Other Bets 
kind of like a sharpening focus on the allocation there. Was that kind of 

 
is 
that kind of signaling more of the same or is that kind of pote
ntially maybe 
prioritizing investments more toward like share buybacks and stuff like that 
as opposed to 

 
like basically I'm trying to ask should we expect greater 
rationalization in the Other Bets segment going forward or is it more of the 
same? Thanks a
 
lot.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, what I was saying is that when we look at the Other Bets and execution, 
we've talked over time about measuring them against specific metrics and 
milestones, operating, business, technology, financial performance. And we 
look at 
that as we calibrate the pace of investment, the approach to 
investments and we are continuing to do that.
 
We're putting a sharper focus on this, as Sundar indicated, looking at where 
does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily a
s an 
example, but the bigger point is, we continue to invest for the long term, 
and when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with 
what we've talked about previously. The primary use of capital continues to 
be to support long
-
term g
rowth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's 
about strategic investments and on top of that return of capital to 
shareholders.
 
Ben Wheeler
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. 
Your line is now open
.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hi. Yes, two questions. The Google segment margin looked really strong in 
the fourth quarter. I think this is the first time that mix shift actually helped 
you guys from a margin perspective. So Ruth, can you just talk about how 
much of that
 
margin increase year
-
on
-
year was from the Hardware business 
dropping off versus improving elsewhere? And then as you look forward, you 
mentioned that headcount is going to accelerate in 2020. So, is this an 
investment year in your view or just kind of mor
e of the steady kind of 
increase? And then second question, on YouTube a lot of discussion here 
about direct response impact and the opportunity there. What percent of 
AdWords advertisers are buying Search only versus buying Search and 
YouTube at this stag
e? And it looks like from your new disclosure that 
YouTube decelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. Any color on what's 
driving that relative to the full year 2019 growth rate? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Okay. So, taking the first part of that. In terms 
of the operating margin in 
the fourth quarter, there were a number of discrete items in the fourth 
quarter last year in 2018. So that did result in a favorable Google op inc 
year
-
on
-
year comparison for this year. And as you said, the other cost of 
sales do
es reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4, in particular, 
versus last year, but I think the main point to leave you with is that we do 
intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that 
we've already talked about quite 
a bit on this call, in Search, in Cloud, in 
Hardware and in YouTube.
 
In terms of headcount, I tried to break it out in my closing comments that it 
starts with those areas 

 
putting headcount behind the areas where we're 
investing for the long term. And the
n we have a couple of additional factors 
that are somewhat expected to boost the year
-
on
-
year growth rate. One is 
bringing some support in
-
house that's OpEx neutral, and the other is the 
Fitbit acquisition. In terms of the third part of your question, I'm 
just trying 
to recall it. The 

 
in terms of the mix, I'm not sure there's much to add 
there.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian 
from Baird. Your line is now open.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Thank you. I guess, first, jus
t given the focus and new leadership team in 
commerce, was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the 
opportunities you see for innovation there at the transactional part of the 
funnel. And then as a quick follow
-
up on the acceleration in GCP,
 
beyond the 
size of the deals, were there particular product areas like BigQuery or 
something else worth calling out that might have inflected to drive that 
acceleration? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Great. On commerce, I'm really excited Bill Ready is here. H
e brings a lot of 
experience. And he mentioned the transactional part of the funnel and I 
think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience given his prior work, 
but we definitely see opportunity to improve the overall user experience in 
terms of how 
we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that 
experience more delightful. And when people are interested in something, 
how do you make it more seamless to complete the transaction and bringing 
in deep partnerships with merchants and retailer
s to making that happen. 
So, excited about the opportunity there and that's where we are investing.
 
On GCP, we did see 

 
it's been a lot to do with bringing to bear all the 
resources we have and engaging well on these deals and the execution there 
has been
 
great. And it's 

 
definitely, we see strong traction in data analytics. 
And so, our strength there as a company is definitely contributing 
significantly, as well as our overall leadership in AI.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet first quarter 
2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. 
Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will 
follow at that 
time.
 
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor 
Relations. Please go ahead.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first 
quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today
 
are Ruth Porat and 
Sundar Pichai. While you were waiting, you were listening to the infectious 
song ""Diggy,"" by Spencer Ludwig. Spencer is a new, exciting artist on 
Warner Bros. Records who is touring Europe this month. You have heard his 
trumpet stylings
 
when he performed with Capital Cities on ""Safe and 
Sound."" Be sure to check out his official ""Diggy"" video on his YouTube 
channel.
 
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking, includi
ng statements 
regarding our future investments, our long
-
term growth and innovation, the 
expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital 
expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
that could cause a
ctual results to differ materially. For more information, 
please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10
-
K for 2016, filed 
with the SEC. Any forward
-
looking statements that we make are based on 
assumption as of today, and we undertake no obligat
ion to update them.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings 
release through our Invest
or Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. 
This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call 
will be available later today.
 
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thank you, Ellen. Our reve
nues of $24.8 billion in the first quarter 
demonstrate our broad
-
based strength globally, with revenues up 22% year 
on year. In constant currency, our consolidated revenues grew 24% versus 
1Q 2016. Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile 
search, 
with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had 
substantial growth in other revenues from Play, hardware, and Cloud.
 
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated 
basis for Alphabet. Given the obvi
ous seasonality in Q4, I will focus on year
-
over
-
year changes in our results. As a reminder, I will review our results on 
a GAAP basis, which includes stock
-
based compensation for operating 
income, net income, and earnings per share. Second, I will review 
results for 
Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar 
will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after 
which we will take questions.
 
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated fina
ncial 
performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $24.8 billion, up 22% year 
over year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year 
over year of $304 million or $87 million after the benefit of our hedging 
program. Holding currency con
stant to the prior period, our total revenues 
grew 24% year over year.
 
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, as you can see in our press 
release, we've enhanced the geographic split to give you more insight into 
our businesses around the world. We are
 
now reporting our revenues in four 
regions: the U.S., EMEA 

 
namely Europe, Middle East, and Africa 

 
APAC or 
Asia Pacific, and Other Americas, which encompasses Canada and Latin 
America. To help you with the transition to our new geographic reporting, 
we
're also sharing the U.K. revenues for this quarter. These groupings align 
more closely with how we manage our businesses and also with the major 
currencies that affect our results.
 
The results by region highlight the strength of our business around the 
gl
obe. U.S. revenues were up 25% year over year to $11.8 billion. EMEA 
revenues were $8.1 billion, up 13% year over year. In fixed FX terms, 
revenues were up 19%. U.K.
-
reported revenues continue to reflect the 
ongoing weakness of the British pound, with reve
nues up 5% year over year 
to $2 billion on a reported basis, yet up 16% in fixed FX terms. APAC 
revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX 
terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen. Other Americas 
revenues,
 
which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 
34% versus last year to $1.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 
29% year over year, with fixed FX growth reflecting strength in the Brazilian 
real.
 
On a consolidated basis, total cost 
of revenues, including TAC, which I'll 
discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year on 
year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 
34% year over year, primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses 

 
spec
ifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including 
depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as 
hardware
-
related costs reflecting the continued strong performance of our 
new Made by Google product line. 
Operating expenses were $8.4 billion in 
the quarter, up 15% year over year.
 
Year
-
on
-
year comparisons in part reflect the change in the timing of our 
annual equity refresh cycle, with a half
-
year grant in Q1, which enables us to 
move to a single annual comp
ensation cycle. As discussed last quarter, this 
affects the timing of stock
-
based compensation but does not affect the 
overall size of the SBC expense for the year. The year
-
on
-
year increase is 
therefore more sizable in Q1 and Q2 compared to previous years
, with less 
of a year
-
on
-
year impact in both Q3 and Q4. More specifically, stock
-
based 
compensation totaled $2 billion, up 34% year over year.
 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 73,992, up 1,939 people from last 
quarter. The growth in consolidated hea
d count was somewhat muted by an 
internal reallocation of people from Fiber to Google. Consistent with prior 
quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product 
managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count growth 
was in 
Cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business.
 
Operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating 
margin was 27%. Other income and expense was $251 million. We provide 
more detail on the line items within OI&E in our 
earnings press release. Our 
effective tax rate was 20% for the first quarter. Net income was $5.4 billion, 
and earnings per diluted share were $7.73.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $2.5 billion. Operating cash 
flow was $9.5 billion, with free cash flow of 
$7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of 
$92.4 billion, of which approximately $55.7 billion or 60% is held overseas.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting wi
th the Google 
segment. Revenues were $24.5 billion, up 22% year over year, which 
includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites 
revenues were $17.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% year over year. The 
biggest contributor to growth ag
ain this quarter was mobile search, 
reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of 
smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously also benefiting from 
our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality. YouTube 
reven
ues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video 
advertising. Network revenues were $4 billion, up 9% year on year, 
reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob. Results 
benefited from a slower rate of decline in the 
traditional Network business 
than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both 
the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy 
efforts. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 49%.
 
Last quarter w
e talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see 
the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, 
hardware, and Cloud. Specifically, Play benefited from both broad
-
based app 
strength but also from all the work we have done i
n areas such as direct 
carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite 
apps and games on Google Play. Hardware continues to have strong growth 
and remains an important area for us, with our family of products extending 
geogr
aphically. Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google 
Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest
-
growing businesses across 
Alphabet. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a 
sense of the price and volume dynamics
 
of our advertising businesses. You 
can find the details in our earnings press release.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion, or 22% of total advertising 
revenues, and up 22% year over year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a 
percentage of Si
tes revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of 
Network revenues, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely 
mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a 
percentage of total advertising revenues was up year over y
ear as a result of 
an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was 
again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, 
which carries lower TAC.
 
Google's stock
-
based compensation totaled $1.9 billion fo
r the quarter, up 
40% year over year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was 
$7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. 
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in 
production equipment
, facilities, and data center construction.
 
Turning to Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $244 
million, primarily generated by Nest, Verily, and Fiber. Operating loss, 
including the impact of SBC, was $855 million for the first qua
rter. Other 
Bets accrued CapEx was $170 million, primarily reflecting a reduced 
investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 
2016.
 
Let me conclude. First, we've benefited from our team's innovations that 
continually enhance our adve
rtising business, as evidenced by the ongoing 
growth of Sites revenues. On a dollar basis, the increase in Sites revenues 
reflects the healthy growth in mobile search. As we discussed in prior calls, 
even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing
 
investment in the 
mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is 
adding meaningfully to profit dollars.
 
Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take 
bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth
 
of additional revenue streams, 
including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings. 
Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities given the scale of 
opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector and the fact that the requirements
 
for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here 
for the long
-
term opportunity. Similarly, hardware remains an exciting 
growth opportunity for us, and you've seen the early indicators again this 
quarter.
 
Finally in Other Bets,
 
we're determining the size and pace of investment 
appropriate to each bet, given their stage of development and achievements 
against milestones. We expect to increase near
-
term investment in certain 
areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investme
nt in others as they 
move along a path to commercialization. For example, as I hope you saw 
earlier this week, Waymo announced it has commenced a trial of its self
-
driving cars in the Phoenix area. Waymo also announced it is expanding its 
fleet of minivans
 
to support this trial. These actions reflect the tremendous 
accomplishment of our team over many years, leading with safety, and now 
beginning to bring the experience to consumers.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thanks, Ruth. It's been a terrific start to the year. This quarter was notable 
for the fantastic momentum across our products. Advances for the Google 
Assistant, the launch of YouTube TV, and lots of new features launched at 
our Google Cloud
 
Next event. In the next few weeks, there's much more to 
come. We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our 
advertising event, Google Marketing Next; and our YouTube upfront, 
Brandcast. I hope you'll join us.
 
Today I'll discuss three things.
 
First, how our continued investments in 
machine learning are fueling innovation across Google, and particularly how 
it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for 
everyone. Second, progress in three of our biggest bets: YouTube
, Cloud, 
and hardware. And, third, our platforms, such as Android and our 
advertising platform, which power businesses and computing experiences 
around the world.
 
Now, turning first to machine learning and access to information. I'm really 
happy with how w
e are transitioning to an AI
-
first company. The Google 
Assistant is one of our first steps towards that future. This quarter, we 
brought the Assistant to your wrist with Android Wear 2.0, announced that 
it'll soon come to Android TV, and began rolling it o
ut to hundreds of millions 
of people with Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow. We also 
continue to announce new integration partners for the Google Assistant, so 
you can now ask it to do things like dim the living room lights. Stay tuned 
for more
 
to come.
 
Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products 
better. One example from this quarter is the launch of parking predictions in 
Google Maps. Beyond that, we continue to set the pace in machine learning 
and AI research. We intr
oduced a new technique for training deep neural 
networks on mobile devices called Federated Learning. This technique 
enables people to run a shared machine learning model while keeping their 
underlying data stored locally on mobile phones. DeepMind is brin
ging 
AlphaGo to China in May, pairing AI with the world's best players at the 
Future of Go Summit. And it's very exciting to see the incredible things that 
developers and researchers are building on the TensorFlow platform. There 
are more than 6,000 GitHub
 
projects and counting.
 
Search remains at the heart of our mission to make information available to 
everyone, and we are laser
-
focused on making Search even better. In 
March, we introduced tappable shortcuts in Google Search to help you easily 
access topic
s you care about, like sports, entertainment, and weather. And, 
earlier this week, to improve our results further, we introduced algorithmic 
ranking improvements, as well as easier ways for people to provide better 
(17:28) feedback in autocomplete and Feat
ured Snippets. Last week, we 
made big improvements to one of our longest
-
standing and most loved 
products, Google Earth. It's really beautiful and easy to use. Now you can 
experience breathtaking locations in virtual reality, like the top of Table 
Mountain
 
in South Africa.
 
Moving on to three of our biggest bets: YouTube, Cloud, and hardware. First, 
YouTube, where we continue to see extraordinary growth and opportunities. 
People around the world are watching more content on YouTube than ever 
before. In 2016,
 
we passed a big milestone that continues to grow. Every 
day, users watch over a billion hours on YouTube. YouTube continues to be 
the most popular destination for online video globally, and we are focused on 
building awesome experiences.
 
This quarter we a
nnounced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major 
broadcast and cable networks, a cloud
-
based DVR without storage limits, 
and streaming on all of your devices. We have launched in five cities so far, 
and the positive feedback from customers has been rea
lly incredible. Our 
destination for family and kids' content, called YouTube Kids, also recently 
celebrated its second birthday. There have been more than 30 billion video 
views in the app to date.
 
Next, our growing Cloud business. Our Google Cloud Next co
nference in 
March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for 
GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest 
cloud availability in 2016, according to CloudHarmony. It was attended by 
five times as man
y people as last year. We also demonstrated new machine 
learning services and announced our acquisition of Kaggle, the largest 
community of data centers focused on machine learning and AI. We 
introduced dozens of new products, including Spanner, a database
 
optimized 
for distributed computing that can reliably update data across multiple data 
centers. And our G Suite team introduced a major expansion of or 
collaboration platform with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. To give you a 
taste of the kinds of large 
enterprise customers and partners we are now 
working with across GCP, we were joined on stage by major companies like 
HSBC, Home Depot, Schlumberger, and SAP, as well as large G Suite 
customers, including Colgate
-
Palmolive.
 
We continue to see tremendous mo
mentum in education, where our 
products are leading the industry, thanks to their simplicity, security, and 
low cost. Chromebooks are now used by more than 20 million teachers and 
students, and more than 70 million people actively use G Suite for 
Education
.
 
Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of 
conversations that Diane and her team are having with customers. 
Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission
-
critical projects and 
full migrations, moving data from on
-
pre
m data centers to the cloud. We are 
seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast
-
growing 
business.
 
On to our next big bet, hardware. Last year, we debuted a beautiful new 
family of hardware devices, including the Pixel, Google Home, 
and Google 
Wifi, bringing together the best of Google across hardware and software. We 
are finding that people who buy products like Pixel and Google Home are not 
only incredibly happy with their purchase but also very likely to recommend 
it to others. Sal
es continues to be strong, and we are actively working to 
bring these great devices to more people around the world. Just a few weeks 
ago, we announced that Google Home and Google Wifi are now available in 
the U.K. Speaking of Google Home, last week we mad
e it possible for up to 
six people to connect their accounts to one Google Home, and thanks to a 
leading voice recognition technology, it can recognize who's speaking to it. 
It's really a game changer.
 
And, finally, we are continuing to invest in our compu
ting and advertising 
platforms. Our platforms have had great success over the years, creating 
incredible user experiences, as well as real opportunities and economic 
success for partners, creators, and developers around the globe. To 
illustrate, in the pas
t three years in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa 
alone, we paid out more than $15 billion to our publisher, creator, and app 
developer partners. That's across AdSense, YouTube, and Google Play, and it 
doesn't even include device sales by many hardware 
partners who build on 
Android. There's tremendous momentum in the Android ecosystem, as 
evidenced by the great reception of the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S8. We'll 
have much more to say at I/O next month.
 
In March, we introduced the first developer preview 
of Android O, featuring 
improvements for battery life, notifications, and picture
-
in
-
picture display. 
The Android platform is also seeing great growth in emerging markets. In 
2016, nearly 300 million new users adopted Android devices from countries 
like In
dia and Brazil. We also announced the public launch of Android Wear 
2.0, with two new flagship watches from LG. And thanks to partnerships with 
major brands like TAG and Fossil, there'll be more than 20 different Android 
Wear watches available this year, d
oubling the number from last year.
 
Our virtual reality platform Daydream, which debuted almost a year ago, 
continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content, like VR 
video. More than 50% of time in Daydream is video consumption, and 
YouTu
be VR is Daydream's number 1 app by time spent.
 
Lastly, I'll talk about the highlights and trends we are seeing across our 
growing advertising business, where there are still enormous opportunities. 
As you can see from our results, we continue to experienc
e remarkable 
growth worldwide. Not only are existing advertisers choosing to spend more 
as they see the value of our ads, but many more businesses around the 
world are just getting started on our ad platforms, from India to Brazil and 
many more. Our moment
um continues to be driven by the shift to mobile. 
Our great properties, like Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play, are the 
prime time for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and 
interested.
 
We have increased our investment in machine lear
ning in our advertising 
business, with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the 
performance of an ad and adjust advertisers' bids in real time to maximize 
their results. Two areas where we are seeing particular strength are retailers 
and a
pp developers. Mobile has transformed the shopping experience. In the 
past year, local shopping queries have increased by 45%, and the number of 
retailers that provide us with their local inventory feeds has doubled. Our 
investments in innovative ad format
s, include targeting and better 
measurement, are really helping retailers, who see us as an ally in their 
corner. Brands like Williams
-
Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile 
sales year over year, with Google mobile shopping ads playing a big part.
 
Secon
dly, developers use us to help their apps stand out from the crowd. 
Thanks to our app install advertising products, developers have already 
driven more than 5 billion app downloads. Our flagship product here, 
Universal App Campaigns, allows developers to e
asily promote their apps 
across Google Search, Play, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. It 
incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results 
for advertisers. We recently announced new innovations at the Game 
Developers Confer
ence, including an interactive playable ad format in 
Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your 
game right in the ad. It's really effective in driving installs from engaged 
users.
 
Now on to our growing video advertising busi
ness. Brands love the reach 
and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness 
of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new bumper ads, which are 
snackable six
-
second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency. We 
recent
ly did research on more than 120 bumper ad campaigns, and the data 
showed that they drove a significant lift in brand awareness and ad recall. 
Under Armour used both bumper ads and TrueView together to promote a 
new product launch recently, resulting in do
uble the lift in product interest 
among people who saw both ads compared to those who only saw the 
TrueView ad. We work incredibly hard to create the best environment for 
brands on YouTube. The cornerstone of our offering is Google Preferred, 
which allow b
rands to advertise against the top 5% of our content.
 
We also announced new safeguards for advertisers through a combination of 
updated ad policies and enforcement, new default settings around where ads 
can appear, improved controls for advertisers, and th
ird
-
party brand safety 
reporting. Brands and agencies understand how hard we work to create the 
safest possible environment. We do this by also being very careful to ensure 
YouTube's innovative creators can earn money to support their unique and 
popular co
ntent. We've been actively engaged in conversations with clients 
about the new tools and controls we are providing, and we are having very 
productive discussions ahead of Brandcast next week.
 
Finally, programmatic advertising. As marketers continue to shif
t towards 
programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to 
effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more 
inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory. For 
instance, we recently 
expanded our Programmatic Guaranteed reservation 
product to advertisers globally, and we made traditional TV inventory 
available to buy in DoubleClick Bid Manager.
 
So that's a run
-
through of some highlights for the quarter. Thanks to every 
Googler for maki
ng Google such an exciting and inspiring place to work 
every day. Over the last few days, we have had Take Your Child to Work Day 
at Google, which is one of my favorite events of the year. We have had 
thousands of excited, screaming kids running around the
 
Googleplex, which 
is how I feel some days, too. What motivates us at Google is building the 
technologies that'll be central to all of their computing experiences, to give 
them opportunities to learn, to be heard, and to succeed.
 
And with that, I will hand
 
it back over to Ruth.

Thank you. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Douglas T.

Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, just, you talked about Cloud 
as a huge strategic priority. Could you just talk more about the go
-
to
-
market 
strategy for GCP and how you plan on building up the reseller chan
nel there 
going forward? And then secondly, Sundar, on Waymo, I was curious on 
some of your thoughts. I know it's early, but on the timing for Waymo to 
become commercially viable. And then what are the key guideposts and 
requirements along the way? Thank y
ou.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet, Inc.
 
On the Cloud stuff, talking about go
-
to
-
market, as Ruth said in Q1, our 
largest growth in head count and CapEx was in Cloud. So we are thrilled with 
the progress we have made there since Diane arrived, building our world
-
class sales, marketing, and engineering teams. The heavy lifting, I would 
say, is around how we meet enterprises in the market. We have reorganized 
so we have one face to the customer. So it's not just sales reps. We've been 
thoughtful about how we have bu
ilt out the entire go
-
to
-
market 
organization.
 
So we created two new areas that customers can now take advantage of. 
One is the office of the CTO, which helps customers solve difficult technical 
problems. And the second is our Advanced Solutions Lab, where 
customers 
can get help from machine learning experts. And on top of that, now we 
have a phenomenal support team that helps keeps customers' applications 
up and running. So I think what we have done 

 
our approach is one Google. 
When a customer sings up for
 
Google Cloud, they get more than GCP and G 
Suite. They have access to the ads and analytics teams, YouTube teams, 
and resources within our organization. So I think it's coming along quite 
well.
 
Ruth Porat

Alphabet, Inc.
 
And then on your question on Waym
o, we view Waymo as a great example 
of a graduate from X that's addressing a sizable problem and builds off of 
tremendous technology here. We started with safety; we remain a leader in 
safety. And we continue to view that as the foundation for success. And
 
at 
this point we're exploring many options enabling ridesharing, personal
-
use 
vehicles, logistics, and deliveries, and we also see opportunities to work with 
cities to address public transportation.
 
So the announcements that we made this week are a contin
uation of the 
progress the team has made. We do have a strong relationship with Fiat 
Chrysler, increased our car order, given the opportunity. They have been our 
primary partner to date, but to note we're in active discussions with others 
around the globe.
 
And then I think, importantly, the trial in the Phoenix area 
is something that's been in the works for some time, and we do look forward 
for that trial. So it's still in the early days, and we're excited about the 
upside from Waymo.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman

Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thank you. I also wanted to ask a question about Cloud a
s a follow
-
up. I was just wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us what's the 
feedback been since Next from your Cloud customers? And could you share 
with us how qualitatively 

 
something so we can gauge just kind of whether 
this business is starting 
to see an inflection in growth or not? Is there 
anything you could give us qualitatively about how the pipeline is building in 
this area? And I guess just what I'm interested in is also the types of 
conversations you're having with customers now versus may
be six years 
ago. I'm sorry 

 
six months ago. Sorry about that. Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Time flies fast. Next was 

 
having done Google I/O many, many times, I was 
surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this 
y
ear. We had five many times as people. I think everyone really appreciated 
seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, 
Colgate
-
Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP. Along 
with Diane, I did follow
-
up lunches w
ith a set of people, and so the feedback 
has been very positive. People sense our commitment to the area. They 
understand the pace at which we are investing. They see that we are 
committed to machine learning and AI at a deep level. They appreciate how 
we 
are open
-
sourcing things. Facetalk was extraordinarily well
-
received. 
They are noticing the acquisitions we are making, Kaggle and AppBridge are 
a couple of acquisitions which happened around that time. So all that, all 
those details, I think clearly made 
an impact. I just spoke about the go
-
to
-
market progress, and I think that's beginning to get traction as well.
 
In general, I think there is a very strong recognition that we are have 
pivoted to being a deep enterprise company, and our conversations are ver
y 
strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies. And so, 
overall, I can see qualitative lead and momentum there. When we are in the 
middle of deals, we find we are very competitive, and there are areas where 
customers perceive us as bes
t
-
in
-
class already. So it's been exciting to see.

Thanks for taking the
 
question. Sundar, you mentioned Google Assistant in 
your remarks. Wanted to know, what have you seen in terms of consumer 
adoption of Google Assistant, whether at the Pixel level or the Google Home 
level? What does it give you in terms of sense of how peo
ple want to interact 
with the Assistant? What it might do in terms of putting artificial intelligence 
capabilities down to the consumer level and improve consumer experiences 
over the next couple years? Thanks so much for the color.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabe
t, Inc.
 
Good question, Eric. Pixel is a good example, because I think it's the place 
where we do the leading work here. And how we presented Google Assistant 
and the Pixel 

 
well
-
received, both qualitatively in terms of consumer 
feedback we get, quantitati
vely in terms of how we see people using voice, 
how we see people interacting with overall Google Assistant and Search 
better. So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works 
overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader l
evel.
 
It's always surprising to us 

 
we always said, even with Search, every single 
day we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the assistant into 
the mix, you start getting even more different tips of queries, and queries 
are more casual, more
 
conversational. And so over time I think it starts 
breaking down the barriers to computing people have, and that's what 
makes it very, very exciting.
 
Now, artificial intelligence will help us push all that further. Just to give an 
example, we will make te
xt to speech much, much better over time. 
Yesterday, we announced our Neural Machine Translation is launching in 
nine new languages. So all that starts accruing to the Assistant, and I think 
we'll overall improve the customer experience pretty dramatically
. We'll talk 
about all this a lot more at Google I/O, so stay tuned.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your 
line is now open.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Great, thanks. Two questions, please. One on YouTube and one on Google 
Maps. Sundar or Ruth, there was some press about some of the pushback or 
some of the controversy around content and advertising and monetization of 
that. Are those technical problems th
at can be solved over time? Or is just 
the magnitude or the volume of content in trying to keep bad content off the 
site, however that's defined, and keep it from being monetized, is that an 
ongoing technology challenge or did you already find a solution? 
Then did 
you see any material impact to advertisers' budget interest with YouTube? 
And then if you could also comment briefly on Google Maps. This is one of 
those massive properties that you've owned that's highly used by almost 
everybody, and I think the 
monetization to date has been really de minimis. 
Is there anything that's changed for you in terms of your thought about the 
ability to monetize Google Maps over time? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On advertising and monetization in YouTube, we
 
talked a bit about it. We 
have taken it pretty seriously, and we are taking significant steps. And 
obviously as part of doing that, we have brought new technical solutions into 
place. Machine learning is a great example of it. It helps us enforce 

 
as we 
improve our policies, it helps us enforce it better. And we are in early days, 
so as machine learning gets better, I think we'll be able to do all of this even 
better and create that virtuous cycle.
 
Overall, I'm pretty confident at the rate at which we hav
e made progress. 
And we're going to continue investing a lot here. It is super important to us 
that this ecosystem works well. It matters for advertisers. It matters for 
content creators. And so we take that responsibility very seriously. I would 
say adver
tisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. 
Our conversations with them are very, very positive, and so I'm pretty 
optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here.
 
On Google Maps, your question is 

 
it's a good question. I get 
surprised at, 
for a property which we had launched many, many years ago, even now it's 
showing strong growth, especially in emerging markets. Maps is an integral 
part of your mobile phone. And users get more interested in the real world 
around them with AR
 
and so on, I think Maps will continue to play a bigger 
role. We take a long
-
term view. It's already impacting monetization very 
significantly for us with local search. So today, when you use Google, a lot of 
the information we are able to do is because of
 
Google Maps. But I'm sure 
you've noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. If you 
open Google Maps, you're traveling or you're out on a Friday evening, we 
start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, 
places 
to eat, and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from 
users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time 
as well.

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on 
Mark's question on the local opportunity. Assuming that you agree 
it's a 
large one, what kind of steps are you taking to educate the smaller 
businesses out there on the opportunities you have? You've mentioned 
increasing take
-
up of local inventory ads. We understand that. But more 
generally, a go
-
to
-
market strategy on ho
w you reach the millions of SMBs 
out there in terms of educating them on the growing opportunities on a local 
basis. Thanks so much.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
It's a great question. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us. Today 
we have many t
ouch points. Obviously people 

 
we reach out to SMBs, they 
want to get listed in Search and in Maps. AdWords Express has been a big 
part of how they want to advertise on our platforms. We obviously provide 
things like Google Apps to SMBs. So we have a lot 
of touch points, and 
internally we are beginning to do a much better job of reaching out and 
having a more thoughtful go
-
to
-
market approach. I think there's a lot more 
work there, but the rate at which we are seeing advertisers 

 
small, medium 
businesses 

 
on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well. 
So indications are that it's already currently working at scale. We have 
millions and millions of SMBs on our platform, and the number continues to 
grow very well. But you'll see us invest a lo
t more here in the years ahead.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for ta
king my question. Could you talk a little bit more about the 
retail search category? Any high
-
level commentary on consumer search
-
query trends in retail, either an area of strength or otherwise? And then you 
talked about the real
-
time local
-
inventory integ
ration, but, Sundar, I'd be 
curious if you could talk about any opportunities or areas of innovation in the 
retail search space that you see to really continue to improve users' retail
-
search experience. Thanks for the color.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
I think obviously when we see what users are looking for in mobile, how 
shopping is evolving, it's an area we're continuously working on. I've been 
happy to see the evolution in our shopping experiences. Retail overall also 
happens to be an amazing catego
ry for us from a Google Cloud standpoint, 
so in some ways we are developing deeper partnerships with retailers 
around the world. And so as we start doing that, and I think as we get a 
better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can transla
te 
all of that into our core experience is a bit of the work ahead. I think that's 
what excites us about the longer term. Shorter term, I think it's a space we 
continue to invest in. We are actually seeing strong trends in that category.

BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two 
questions on YouTube for 
Sundar. First, this morning on the earnings call, WPP's CEO, Sir Martin 
Sorrell, noted that the company is being very responsive, I think were his 
words, to some of the recent concerns that we'd talked about earlier in the 
Q&A. We'
ve also seen some official policy changes, things like that. I'd be 
interested, Sundar, to hear a little bit more about some of the softer 
outreach that you may be doing, thinking of Philipp Schindler's team, maybe 
the agency relations team, and how your p
eople are reaching out and 
connecting with their clients, especially as you go into Brandcast?
 
And then the second follow
-
up on YouTube was, I'd be interested to hear 
your updated thoughts on the role of the YouTube Spaces. I think Ruth's 
prepared comments
 
on CapEx mentioned some investments in production 
equipment. I don't know if that is related to that or something related to 
Cloud, but it does seem that the Spaces remain an important part of 
YouTube and continue to grow. And I'd love to hear an updated 
view on 
them. Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet, Inc.
 
On the first part, (43:20) one of the things I've noticed is the depth of 
relationships we have with our advertisers was very evident to me as we 
went through this over the past few weeks. I would est
imate 

 
I think Philipp 
Schindler's team has probably made literally thousands and thousands of 
calls, in
-
person conversations, and I think that deep relationship is what 
allowed us to respond thoughtfully. And I think the feedback from our 
partners were v
ery positive and constructive, and I think we are evolving 
overall to a better place. And so I think to me that shows the long
-
term 
investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, plays well at times 
like these. And Brandcast is again an important 
touch point, and the 
excitement ahead of Brandcast, both internally and from our partners, all 
has the right indications for us.
 
On YouTube on Spaces, I visited the YouTube Space. I took my family to the 
YouTube Space in New York, and we had a lot of fun. 
Our creators love these 
spaces. They are something we are thoughtfully building out. They have a 
good return on investment for us, but we are very thoughtful about it. And I 
don't think that's a major factor in any of the CapEx we talked about here.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Yeah, Exactly. In the CapEx, when I talked about production equipment, we 
were talking about machines, and that was the primary driver here. We're 
investing more machines given both our growing requirements and the 
higher cost of the 
new generation of machines and accelerators. So that will 
be more expensive in the short term, and we are continuing to build our 
inventory. But it does increase performance, and we believe reduce total 
cost of ownership in the longer term, so just to clar
ify that on CapEx.

Gr
eat. I'm not sure if this is for Sundar or Ruth, but a question about 
regulatory. You guys recently reached an agreement in Russia around the 
Android bundling issue, where you're going to provide options for other 
browsers and search engines and app stores
 
when a new Android phone is 
activated. So I was just wondering if this is the right way to think about 
these kinds of disputes in other areas of the world, where you may be under 
some regulatory pressure around Android bundles, or if that was kind of a 
on
e
-
off, isolated agreement. Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

I think 

 
without getting into specifics, I think when we deal with regulatory 
issues, I mean, the concerns vary differently depending on local laws and 
what the concerns are. I think in 
the case of Russia, I think there were some 
specific issues. And I'm glad we were able to work together with the 
regulatory agencies there, with our partners there, to come to a good 
solution. I'm not sure that's the right template. But as much as we are v
ery 
committed to making sure we work with all the right agencies in all the 
countries we operate in, and I'm confident we'll get to a good place.

Great. Thank you. Sundar, ahead of this advertising conference I was 
thinking about Search innovation. And over the last four years, you've had 
an acceleration with PLAs, a really acceleration with the third ad 
link. And 
I'm just wondering, maybe you could talk about what excites you. Or do you 
think there's still a lot to go on Search monetization or coverage? And then 
from Ruth, obviously so many areas you can invest in. You could cut price 
on Cloud. You could 
really ramp up engineers in the core or Cloud. Just a lot 
you can do. And just how does the management team think about balancing 
profitability versus driving market share and long
-
term growth? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet, Inc.
 
On Search, I continu
e to get surprised by the kind of things users reach out 
to us for and how that keeps evolving and changing. And with the Assistant 
now, too, just exposes a whole new surface area. And so I think there's a lot 
of innovation ahead. In terms of monetization,
 
I think about it 

 
it still looks 
like there is a lot of 

 
for example, if you just look at retail, 90% of retail is 
still offline. So there are many, many secular trends like that, which we look 
at and we see a huge opportunity to help connect users to t
he information 
they are looking for. So, structurally, I do think we still have lots of both 
innovation and growth ahead for the long term, and that's how we think 
about it.
 
Maybe to Ruth on the second part?
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Yeah, and really act
ually building on that, to answer the second part of your 
question. When we look at the ongoing momentum that you've seen here in 
Sites revenue, it really does go to innovation. No one change tends to drive 
results, it's really the combined benefit of all 
that we're doing across the 
franchise, continuing to invest in the business and the benefits that we see 
there. And that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity 
continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there. And 
as
 
we're looking at these newer opportunities, all that we're doing in Cloud, 
in hardware, YouTube subscription businesses, we analyze each one of those 
individually, working very closely with the leaders and the milestones that 
are established there.
 
We do 
very much across the business have an operating principle that too 
many resources and too few can lead to suboptimal decisions and execution. 
And so what we're looking at over a multiyear period is the pace of 
innovation that's appropriate, given the sizab
le opportunity. But the key 
point 

 
and I've said it on so many different calls 

 
is that we remain 
focused on long
-
term value creation. And we're excited about the growth 
opportunities, not just within Google but across Alphabet with all that we're 
doing 
in Other Bets. And so we're looking at these, again, individually, over 
a multiyear period, looking at milestones, and appropriately calibrating the 
pace of investment that is logical. And at the same time, we continue to 
have a focus on enhancing efficien
cies where we can. But overall, as I keep 
saying, our main priority remains revenue and profit dollar growth.

Thanks. I have two for Sundar. The first is, now that you've launched 
YouTube TV, I wonder if you'd tell us about the advertising opportunity 
there. And then what are you 
going to do, given all the assets, to maximize 
an inventory for marketers? And then secondly, I wonder, with that focus on 
brand safety you hear now from agencies and the bigger marketers, what's 
going to be the long
-
term impact, do you think, to YouTube p
rogrammatic 
from a more focused view on finding the right places to advertise?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On your first question about YouTube TV, we're just getting started. I think 
the product is really intended for the YouTube generation. It's reall
y great to 
see a take on how to consume TV, which is mobile first for that generation. 
And I think 

 
I've been using the product and enjoying it. And I think that 
gives 

 
as (50:50) we rethink that experience and make it work better and 
scale it up, I thin
k it's 

 
your question is valid. The delivery of ads on TV has 
also not evolved at the same speed as the delivery of ads and media content 
on the Internet. So I think 

 
we think we have a significant opportunity to 
improve their experience, and especially 
for advertisers to be able to think 
across all these surfaces. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, but I think 
we are very focused on the consumer experience first.
 
On your second question around longer
-
term impact, look, these types of 
issues are not
 
new for us. Over the past many, many years, as we've built 
services, scaled it up on the ramp, (51:37) constantly things evolve. We 
adapt to it, be it from spam in email or how we do search ranking, and all 
the efforts we put into it. These are the classe
s of problems our engineers 
are really, really good at working. These are large
-
scale system problems, 
and especially with machine learning and AI, over time I think we can really 
put in the right systems in place. And our teams work very thoughtfully with
 
the external ecosystem, with our advertisers, agencies, and partners. And I 
think that balance will help us get it right for the very long term.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. 
Ruth, Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue grew sequentially and year over 
year. I totally
 
understand that mobile search is contributing meaningfully to 
the profit dollars, but as we look at the Sites TAC as a percentage, is there a 
quarter or is there a point in time looking forward where that sort of 
elevated TAC growth rate will anniversary 
or fall back into line with Sites 
revenue growth as a growth rate? Is there anything you can do to 
proactively manage that TAC growth?
 
And then for Sundar, on YouTube, as the competition out there for video 
content really intensifies, to what extent is You
Tube providing more 
favorable economics to its content creators in order to ensure that YouTube 
remains the leading platform and, importantly, in a lot of cases, an exclusive 
platform for your most popular channels? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat

Alphabet, Inc.
 
S
o on Sites TAC, as we've often discussed, and as you said in your question, 
there are a number of factors that affect Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites 
revenue, and the primary driver has been the strong growth in mobile and 
the fact that more mobile sear
ches are subject to TAC. The other factors 
include the mix of paid versus organic, as well as changes in partner, mix, or 
agreement terms. And when we look year over year, the primary driver of 
the increase is 

 
very much to your question 

 
the strength in
 
mobile 
search. And we do expect Sites TAC to increase as a percentage of 
revenues. But, again, our focus continues to be on growing profit dollars. 
And I think the main point is we're very pleased to have a very strong 
business in a rapidly growing area. 
And that's benefiting our profit dollars 
even as the TAC percentage increases.

And on YouTube, when I look at it from a content creator standpoint, I think 
there are a lot of factors which are working well. So, for example, w
hen we 
recently invested in original shows, we find that like over half the time 
people spend watching originals is on their mobile phones. We find that 
creators who are featured in originals experience a significant boost in 
YouTube subscribers and watch 
time on their main channels as well, often 
from new fans. So all of this shows us that the enthusiasm which is there for 
the platform, how creators can do unique things which are different from 
what they can do on other platforms. And I think that's what g
ives us the 
differentiation here. And in these areas, we are just getting started, and so 
there's a lot more to come. And I think that will help us provide better 
economics for them, better engagement for them, and I think positions us 
well.

Sundar, w
hen we think about virtual reality and augmented reality, from 
your point of view, what are the key steps that are needed to see more

rea before you expect to see 
a payoff? Thanks.

So I think obviously you're seeing we are very happy with the progress we 
have seen with Daydream. Just like we built Android, we are good at 
building platforms and ecosystems, a
nd I think we are taking the right first 
steps with VR there as well. When I broadly look at VR and AR, I think all of 
us clearly understand the potential, and technically we are making the 
breakthroughs that are needed. And all of it needs to converge, fr
om a 
hardware, software, services standpoint, to a stage where it has mass
-
market appeal. And I think that is still some ways away.
 
The thing which gives me excitement is all these changes start happening 
with a set of early adopters and moves mainstream, 
and so we're engaging 
at that level with the early adopters. And that's where Daydream is working 
well. We are learning how to write great content on top of VR. YouTube, 
Google Earth VR, Tilt Brush 

 
these are all great examples. So underlying 
technology w
ise, be it all the kinds of sensors and tracking you need to do, 
the machine learning and AI you need, things like voice recognition, 
everything 

 
it's just a computing evolution, so everything we are investing 
today in machine learning and AI, as well as 
what we're doing in our 
computing platforms, transitions well. So I think we're already well
-
positioned to play this, and so I think we'll thoughtfully approach it. And 
we'll approach it more holistically.

Thank you. I guess just as a follow

up to the question on voice interfaces 
and personal assistant, something that Larry also c
alled out in his founder's 
letter. It appears there are more tests around monetization, including 
transactions and integration with Shopping Express. I wonder if there's a 
view internally now as to how best to make that transition in a voice

first 
world to
wards monetization, towards voice and less tech spend and video

We are very focused, actually, on the consumer experience now, and it's a 
good question. And we've always had these questions, be it the earl
y days of 
Search or when YouTube was first built out. How do I see (58:09) 
experiences created, like will YouTube ever make money? And so I think if 
you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, 
the monetization will follow. A
nd obviously 

 
and the models will be different 
than what we have today, but I think we are squarely focused right now on 
delivering a world
-
class experience through voice and through Assistant.

Larry Page
 
Thank you. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Google had another 
strong quarter with $14.9 billion in revenue and great product progress. 
We 
are closing in our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience 
regardless of your device.
 
Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the impact of 
technology in the short
-
term, yet underestimate the scale of change longer 
term. For ye

arrived, but on a scale few imagined, people increasingly have more than 
one device and screens are proliferating in the home as well as wearable 
screens like watches and Google Glass.
 
When android
 
was still a (indiscernible) project I used to feel kind of guilty 
visiting the team. We are a search company and building a new operating

evices have now been activated 
worldwide and 1.5 million devices are led off everyday.
 


browser; updates are seaml
ess and frequent improving security and 
usability. It was a great example of technology doing the hard work, so you 
can get all the stuff that matters.
 
Two weeks ago we launched the new HP Chromebook 11. Its beautifully 
designed and light weight and just o
ver 2 pounds and at $279, highly 
affordable. Best of all, it has a high power micro USB charger that can also

August we updated our Youtube apps for android and iOS. You can now 
leave a video playing at the bottom of your screen while you explore other 
content.
 
Our execution in velocity a
nd search from maps is getting better and better 
and from a very high base. A new map app for iOS and android shipped in 
July, but is specifically for downloads to make the most of this larger 

h experience 
of a simple card interface that is easy to read and have designed, that is 
optimized for touch.
 
Our momentum on voice search is tremendous. We added four new 
languages this quarter making available on over 78 languages and accents. 

expanded the quick answers, we can provide just for you. Fast 
Google for your flight details and up here instantly in your search results, no 
digging around in your email required. And the search across Google+ 
photos is extraordinary. Search for sunsets a
nd all the pictures you've ever 
taken of sunsets to appear instantly. If you haven't tried it, prepare to be 
amazed.
 
About two years ago, when I became CEO again, my goal was to ensure that 
Google maintains the passion and soul of a start
-
up as we grow. It
's why 
I've worked so hard to increase the velocity and execution. So we create 
great products people love to use and iterate fast to ensure they get better 
and better. Because great is just never good enough.
 
When you look across the company, it's amazing
 
how well the teams are 
executing. For example, we rolled out Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords 
across all devices for all our advertisers in less than a year. Of course none 
of this would happen without great people and we are so lucky that we have 
them. I'd 
like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make everything 
possible. Keep up that velocity and execution.
 
Before I hand over to Patrick, I want to let you know that going forward, I 
won't be joining every earnings call. Patrick and Nikesh do a great
 
job 
covering our business each quarter and they'll continue to do that great 
work. I know you all would love to have me on, but you are also depending 
on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business. I'm 
very confident you are in go
od hands with Patrick and Nikesh.
 
So now, over to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us 
again. Without further ado why don't we just dive into the details of Google's 
financial performance in Q3?
 
So here we go. Our gross consolidated revenue 
was just shy of $15 billion at $14.9 billion. The overall business was up 6% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter and 12% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Our Google segment, gross revenue grew a healthy 19% year
-
over
-
year to 
$13.8 billion an
d was up 5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter without currency 
fluctuations, Google segment revenue would have actually grown 21% year
-
over
-
year and the currency impact on sequential growth was actually 
immaterial in our case this quarter.
 
Google sites revenue was up 2
2% year
-
over
-
year to $9.4 billion and was up 
6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by the strength in our core search 
advertising business. The advertising policy decisions that we implemented 
earlier this year to ensure good user experience continued to negativ
ely 
impact Google's network revenue in the short term, and therefore our 
network revenue was in fact flat year
-
over
-
year to $3.1 billion and was down 
1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Despite the short
-
term pressures we continue to believe that this is 
clearly 
the right answer for our users and shareholders in the long term. And finally 
to finish Google's segment on a positive note, Google's other revenue grew 
85% year
-
over
-
year to $1.2 billion and was up 18% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. 
Digital sales of apps a
nd content in our Play store drove year
-
over
-
year and 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter growth in this line.
 
Turning to Motorola segment, our gross revenue there was $1.2 billion. As 
Larry mentioned, while it's still the early days, Dennis and the team have 
already tra
nsformed Motorola's product quality and they're working now at 
building marketing and distribution.
 
By the way, some of you may have noticed that our total consolidated 
revenue does not exactly equal to some of our segment revenue this 
quarter. This is dri
ven by new transactions in our Motorola segment resulting 
in intersegment and certain deferred revenues that are eliminated in our 
consolidated results.
 
Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth 
was strong this quarter, up 2
6% year
-
over
-
year, 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. 
Our aggregate cost
-
per
-
click was down 8% year
-
over
-
year and down 12% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And we should note that the currency fluctuations had 
a real minimal impact on Q3 cost
-
per
-
click.
 
Once again, I wish to r
emind everyone that our monetization metrics 
continue to be impacted by a whole set of factors discussed on previous 
calls. They include geographic mix, channel mix, property mix as well as 
product and policy changes.
 
Turning to geographic performance of o
ur Google segment, we continue to 
see steady performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in 
the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our 
Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue 
b
y U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits 
from our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact 
calculation.
 
The U.S. revenue was up 13% year
-
over
-
year to $6.1 billion and it's worth 
noting that network reve
nue that I mentioned a bit earlier which continues 
to be impacted by ongoing policy decisions skew toward the U.S. The U.K. 
was up 14% year
-
over
-
year to $1.4 billion which includes a small $17 million 
benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX the U.K. 
grew 15% year
-
over
-
year.
 
In our non
-
U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. accounted for 46% of total 
revenue or $6.3 billion. This was up 28% year
-
over
-
year which includes a $5 
million benefit from our hedging program and in fixed FX terms, our rest of 
world act
ually grew 32% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our 
non
-
GAAP other cost of revenue was $3.3 billion in Q3 excluding SBC and 
Motorola restructuring. Our non
-
GAAP operating expenses totaled 4.3 billion 
ag
ain excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. For a non
-
GAAP operating 
profit was $4.3 billion in Q3 resulting in non
-
GAAP operating margin for the 
consolidated business of 29%.
 
For Google segment our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 24% of 
tot
al advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $2.3 billion 
excluding $133 million of SBC. Google segment operating expenses were 
$3.9 billion also excluding SBC of $723 million.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense on our property, plant and 
equip
ment for the Google segment was $630 million this quarter. And our 
Google segment operating profit as a result was a strong $4.6 billion in Q3 
resulting in Google segment operating margin of 34%.
 
At Motorola our total segment operating expenses including c
ost of revenue 
were $1.4 billion. That excludes $30 million of stock
-
based compensation 
and $12 million of Motorola restructuring charges. Please keep in mind that 
intangible amortization expense attributed to the Google segment and 
Motorola are in fact in
cluded in these segment measures.
 
Of the $281 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense in the 
quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which 
$116 million was allocated to Google segment and $37 million allocated
 
to 
the Motorola segment. And as a result, the operating loss at Motorola 
segment was $248 million in Q3 and operating margins for that segment 
were negative 21%.
 
Headcount for the consolidated business was roughly 1,500 people, up in 
Q3. The Google segmen
t added just about 2,000 people during the quarter 
and in total the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 
46,000 full
-
time employees. Our effective tax rate was 15% in Q3. Our tax 
rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shif
t of earnings 
between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. Our other income and expense was 
24 million for this quarter. The impact of FAS 133 expense from our hedging 
program and realized losses mostly offset in
terest income in this quarter. 
And as you know we often get questions on quarter
-
to
-
quarter volatility of 
our hedging costs.
 
So to help everyone understand this better, we put together a video tutorial 
on the topic. You can find the new video on our Invest
or Relations website. I 
hope you find it helpful and let us know what you think. For more detail on 
OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR 
website.
 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.1 billi
on. 
CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. This quarter the majority of our 
CapEx was spent on production equipment, data center construction and real 
estate purchases. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we 
continue to invest for the long term
 
and our infrastructure continues to be a 
key strategic area of investment for us.
 
Consequently, our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, very strong again. So 
there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the 
confidence to fund strategic 
growth fully in the opportunities, areas including 
Mobile Business, Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise just to name a few. 

performance in the quarter and after these remarks 

lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned our business had a strong quarter 
with $13.8 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall performance 
was strong in the retail secto
r. We had good growth in Japan, South Korea 
and Australia. There are three key areas I want to talk about today, that are 
big growth drivers for us and our partners. First; our continued efforts to 
make advertising seamless, effective and measurable across
 
multiple 
screens. Second; our progress in bringing bad advertisers online with a 
special emphasis on our efforts that are on Youtube; and third our early 
investments in commerce and shopping to help users, retailers and 
merchants. And last say a few words
 
about newly areas like digital content, 
hardware and enterprise.
 
On seamless advertising; it's been a few months since our advertisers 
moved over to enhanced campaigns and AdWords. Clients are telling us they 
like the new system. Many are still adjusting 
their campaigns and keywords 
and developing their multi
-

seeing advertisers bidding more frequently in mobile keywords because 

how they ca
n use the needed capabilities in mobile and their ads, like 
location Click2Call. Example is discover who has just increased their mobile 
spend and used it to promote their [it card].
 

and analytics. There are three observations here. First; mobile is driving 
higher online conversion. American Apparels found that mobile ads were 
actually driving 16% more conversions than they initially thought and as a 

o drive more sales. Second, mobile drives 
more phone calls. On average there are more than 40 million calls driven by 
Google ads every month, this is twice as much as it was a year ago. Third, 
mobile drives in
-
store traffic.
 
Moving over to brand in YouTube

entertainment clients have moved online at greater speed with our efforts 
that are on brand. Spend by our CPG clients on displaying YouTube has 
grown over 75% over the past two years. For example, the Google YouTube 
campaign 


closely with agencies, we really like integrating our technology, insights and 
media with their creativity and client relatio
nships.
 
For agencies, marketers and Googlers it's a huge win, win, win. All of the top 
10 global agencies now use our DoubleClick products. On the other side 
YouTube continues to do well. Video ads which include CUview now form a 
significant part of our Yo

north of 75% year
-
over
-
year. We found that YouTube is our brand torch 
bearer. It offers brands valuable engaged audiences, terrific reach and 
compelling context. Smart brands are really loving their engagement
 
with 
YouTube.
 
Moving on to commerce and shopping. As Google search moves to provide 


seeing great traction on 
product listing ads both in desktop and mobile. As 

retailers offer better payment solutions to their customers particularly on 
mobile where it's traditionally been difficult. Google 
Wallet InstaBuy helps 
merchants here up implementing instant buy Google (indiscernible) saw that 
from May to August users of Google Wallet on their Android app had a 
purchase conversion rate that was four times higher than other shoppers.
 
Finally I want to
 

emphasis on which is our investment in emerging non
-
ads businesses. As we 
mentioned last quarter, we continue to see acceleration in the new 
businesses such as hardware, digital content and enterprise. As 
Larry 
mentioned Chromecast and Chromebooks are enjoying great success. 
Chromebooks are now available in over 8000 locations around the world and 

also rolling out unified Google exp
erience in more than 750 Best Buy stores 
to showcase Chromebooks, Chromecast and the newest Nexus devices under 
our one Google branded design.
 
On digital apps and content we continue to work hard to roll out Google Play 
in more markets around the world and
 
add content to it. For instance this 
quarter to help students go back to school we added a comprehensive 
catalogue of textbooks to Google Play Books for rental purchase. We brought 
on content partners like HBO and DC Entertainment. This quarter we 
brought
 
Play Music to eight more countries and Play Books to 18 new 
countries. So for example now users in Russia can enjoy music and users in 

look forward to making progress in this area.
 
Another
 
strong area of recovering and growing revenue is our enterprise 
software business, making available the best of Google for work. Some great 
new clients this quarter include whirlpool which is now using Google Apps to 
help 30,000 employees collaborate and 
innovate more quickly. In education, 
apps for education is being used by 30 million students, faculty and staff 
worldwide. Beyond apps, Amtrak uses Google Maps to let people see all the 

 
Google 
Cloud Platform which has over 300,000 customers including Sanmina, a 
Fortune 500 Company using cloud platforms to build internal applications 
that improve their efficiency across their offices globally.
 
Lastly let me call out the efforts of our 
marketing team that continues to roll 
out the Google Welcome Mat to the world. To put on our third annual Google 
Science Fair honoring 15 global finalists from the ages of 13 to 18 from 
around the world where we hosted 400 partners and customers who are at
 
our Annual Site Cast Event, more interestingly to introduce the newest 

more than 50 million special Android KitKat chocolate bars on store shelves 
around the world. And I have 
to give a shout out to the wonderful ad for our 
Nexus devices featuring the great sport of cricket that our marketing team is 

me hand it over to Patrick. Thank you again to all
 
the Googlers for all their 
hard work in getting us here.

Great, two questions please. Could you talk about how long you think it will 
take for advertisers to move over to 
fully embrace the multi
-
screen 
advertising world which enhanced campaign should enable or facilitate. And 


 
it's what enables wearable devices in the future. Can you talk about how far 
along you are in developing a technology to be where you want it to be? 
Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Yeah; thanks Mark for the questions. I think the first part of your question 

 

think we made tremendous progress on voice recognition. Even in period of 
months probably the last couple of months or six months the accuracy has 
gone up quite a bit. If you haven't 

that, it's super fast, on the motor axe, you can say, okay Google now, even 
if your phone is turned off it will turn on and answer your question. So, I 

endous 


usage coming from voice. So Nikesh, in the enhanced campaigns.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Hey, Mark as you know o
n the topic of enhanced campaigns the challenge 
we had as we moved into a multi
-
screen world was, everybody was 
producing solutions where we had to basically run campaigns on different 
devices in a different way because it's this evolution that happened fr
om 
desktop to mobile to video ads et cetera. And effectively what our team 

single interface and one single mechanism to be able to manage our 
campaigns across multiple devices. Now
 



needs to happen on the advertisers side because they have to develop 
beauti
ful experiences for their customers on mobile devices as well as on 




seeing great progress in terms people are already advertising those. But not 

have great experiences on their other screens and other devices so tha
t they 
can truly leverage this. So, I think this is definitely the sort of the first set of 

-
screen devices and multi
-
screen advertising but we think this is the way things are going to keep 
evolving.

Operator
 
We'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Ben Schachter 
-
 
Macquarie Capital Inc.
 
Larry, can you 
discuss Google's overall ecommerce strategy, how the 
Knowledge Graph structure data plays into it and generally how Google can 
improve the users' ecommerce experience? And then Nikesh, you touched 
briefly on the brand efforts and I was looking at some data
 
recently that 
shows that over the past 15 years virtually all the games for online 
advertising has come at the extent of print and radio and none of it has 
come from television budgets. What specifically is happening now that 
makes you think it's more lik
ely for the television dollars to finally begin to 
come online and to Google in particular? And then just a quick housekeeping 
one for Patrick. Can you just give us a bit more detail on how the accounting 
works for the intersegment transactions and how it 
impacts the consolidated 
model? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Like a three
-
way question [indiscernible]. So I think on the ecommerce side, 
I think Google's been used for e
-
commerce for forever and we're really 
excited about doing a better job of that. I think we want
 
to remove friction 
when people are buying online or in the real world. We know people often 
click on an ad in a mobile device and then make their purchase on the laptop 
or they might in fact buy it in the store and we need to really get the 
conversion dat
a there to the advertiser. So I think we've done work across 
all those things, across multi
-
screens, multi
-
devices from online to offline. 
We recently launched cross
-
device measurement in AdWords and we're also 
just trying to make it easier for people to b
uy things in general. It's as 
simple as that's same day shipping in local inventory and search. Like I said, 
we're just looking to reduce friction and we're very excited about that.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes. Hi, Ben. If you look at the last 15 years of history lik
e you talk about, a 
lot of the gains of online advertising have actually come at the expense of 
what we would call performance advertising. Anytime you wanted to interact 
with users, get people to come into your store, get people to buy your 
product, get p
eople to click on your website, all those gains have happened 
in performance which has been great. But what's beginning to happen is as 
the watch time on various online video sites continues to grow, as more and 
more online video begins to be available in 
a nonlinear fashion in television 
screens or recent as Larry talked about Chromecast, that stuff or a bunch of 
the gaming devices, a bunch of other TV solutions, they're beginning to see 
a lot more watch time being expended either on your desktop or on you
r 
multi
-
screen devices or even on your television. As that begins to happen 
that advertising is more addressable, more directly attributable and provides 
more measurement and capabilities. So we believe that that's definitely a 
more superior opportunity fo
r advertisers to be able to attract their brand 
customers and actually know who's at the other end. So I think that trend is 
definitely in the right direction and we're getting upward.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So why don't I take the last question which was the ho
usekeeping item. 
Actually this is pretty straightforward change, Ben. So in Q3 our Motorola 
and Google segments purchased and sold services to each other and these 
transactions are reflected in our Google and Motorola segment revenues. 
The main thing analy
sts need to realize as they update their model this time 
is that the total consolidated revenue will no longer necessarily like in the 
quarters where there is transaction between the two equal the sum of the 
Google and Motorola segment revenues. So analyst
s who currently sum up 
our segment revenues and profits to derive consolidated estimates should 
need to model in elimination lines for the intersegment revenue and profit in 
order to get their consolidated estimates. So that's simple as that.
 
Thanks for 
the questions. So, Jamie, why don't we go 

 
thanks, Ben

next caller.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. Larry, I hope that when you come up with voice recogni
tion, it 
can deal with funny accents. Anyway the perception by people outside the 
company is that Google spends a material amount in long
-
term R&D that will 
not generate revenue in the next two years or so. Larry, can you help us 
understand how you think a
bout funding this project and how much do they 
correspond versus your total R&D budget? And secondly, Patrick, you said in 
the past that CapEx is lumpy and we should expect fluctuations but now we 
have had three quarters of what looks like high CapEx versu
s recent past. 
Have the last few quarters been normal? Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Yes, thanks, Carlos. I think we definitely are working on accents, so I 
appreciate that. I think that on the long
-
term R&D question, I think we don't 
break all this on detail, but
 
I would say that, my stronghold in general is to 
get people to spend money on long
-
term R&D. In most companies I think 
even companies that have significant R&D budgets, if you look at that 
maybe 99% of it ends up being really incremental, which is relativ
ely small 
improvements to kind of your existing businesses, and maybe 1% of that 
ends up being kind of true long
-
term things like Android was when it got 
started. So I think I kind of view my job as the opposite thing is to get 
people to spend on the long
-
term R&D. I do think people have a perception 
that's material. I don't think that 

 
that's not been my experience and so it's 
very hard to actually spend money on long
-
term things in any kind of 
meaningful way. And even the investments we've announced, thi
ngs like 
Calico or rather an absolute dollar number's probably significant amounts, 
they're not significant for Google. And I think you should actually be asking 
me to make more significant investments. I wish I knew how to do that but I 
think it's actuall
y very difficult to spend kind of meaningful amounts of 
money relative to goal scale on things that are speculative.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Larry. Carlos, on the issue of CapEx just to reiterate the fact that 
the majority of the CapEx this quarter was
 
spent on production equipment, 
so like machines, data center construction looking ahead and building the 
capacity ahead of our needs to get the flexibility and real estate purchases, 
so we had a number of kind of really good opportunistic purchases in the
 
portfolio we were targeting and they kind of came online this quarter, so 
pretty pleased with that. I think that overall investors should see this as a 
very positive sign and a positive signal. As I mentioned last quarter during 
my remarks, we continue to
 
invest really for the long term and just a 
conversation we're having with Larry on the topic of R&D. And our 
infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for investment for us. It's 
really important that when we see signals of or opportunities wher
e we need 
capacity, the worst thing for us would be to actually not have it in terms of 
machines and data center capacity. So the strategic value of having it for 
flexibility for our long
-
term positions are really important. That's what you 
see reflected i
n our investments right now.
 
So thank you for your question, Carlos.

up on Ben's question earlier, it seems like you

t
he experience from research search to purchase in the local and 
transactional areas, kind of the closing of the loop if you will. So can you just 
elaborate on the overall strategy and how does the recent cross screen 
conversion estimates enhance play into 
that? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Thanks, Ross. We have all positions available [indiscernible]. I think we 
certainly agree with that. I think it was a pretty good description of me. We 
all account many different pieces of your commercial experiences. I think in 
ge
neral I mean now our experience for users is not that seamless and there 
is lots of different pieces of technology and processes in order to make 
commerce happen and so on. So I think we have got something we

Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My question was for Larry. Since you've come 
back into the CEO's role, one of the things we've noticed with Google is that 
your own advertising spending has moved up and once 
upon a time Google 
was a company that didn't need to advertise and obviously you're in a lot 
more businesses these days from where you started, but maybe just 
philosophically how you view that for Google long term as you do launch into 
more secondary produ
cts other than search. And then just one quick follow
-

pursue unbundling of TV subscriptions; would you ever consider taking 
Google Fiber to a market outside of the U.S?
 
Larry Page
 
Ye
s, Dan thanks for the questions. And I think we saw a lot of advertising 
and we do a modest amount of advertising. I think we find that pretty useful 

good for us to understand 
kind of the advertising perspective from a 

Nikesh to elaborate a little bit on that. In Fiber, I think it's really just early 

 
Nikesh 
Arora
 
Yeah, to follow
-
up on the marketing question, I think we still encourage our 
product teams to go out there and get their products to be used by users, 

they can have. But a
s our products get more and more popular there are 

products and people understand what the capabilities and features are. 

 
other area we 
do a lot of marketing in is in trying to make sure that our advertisers 
understand the advertising opportunity so that they can actually can spend 

primary focus is defini
tely on making sure we create great products that 
users use and the products stand and get (indiscernible) their own merits.

Hi, good afternoon. Question for Larry in terms of, you talked about R&D 

talk specifically about self driving cars that realizes way down the road, 
but 
how real is this as a business and then separately in terms of CPCs how 
should we see these 
--
 
how should we see enhanced campaigns impacting 
CPCs over the next few quarters? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Okay, great questions from Gene; thank you. So I think, I 
guess on self 
driving cars specifically I think for any big innovation I think you 
overestimate short

term and underestimate long
-

summary for self driving cars. I think we made tremendous progress and 

f miles, how we change the business from 



roduct, I 

commercial product. Probably overestimate that in the short

term like I said 
and underestimate that in the long

term. Now for the second part of the 
question.
 
Patrick Pich
ette
 

the question about, what do we expect quarter over the coming quarters. 

user and the advertiser ROI. S
o in general right we attribute CPC trends to a 
combination of those five factors I talked about, FX the three mix effects of 
mobile versus desktop, emerging markets versus developed markets, the 
channel mix between our sites and our network, then a number
 
of products 

pleased as Nikesh mentioned enhanced campaigns is a great platform that 
enables us for a future and as long as we actually have the format that 
delivers the great ROI 
then enhanced campaigns will just accelerate this in 

puzzle and it's important that not only we think about CPCs in the context of 
all the factors I talked about. But what's even more
 
important is the 

actually talks about our growth.

Nikesh can give a sense of where PLAs are going in gene
ral.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah, thanks Patrick. Tim, I think the important part in PLAs since I 
mentioned in the prepared remarks is that we are transitioning from giving 
users answers in terms of links to taking them down to entities and PLAs in a 
product 
listing ads is definitely a big step in that direction because we 

long

on travel. Thank you.

Okay, Nikesh will take the play part there.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah, on Google Play as you know that Google Play has been something that 
our teams have worked really hard on in the last two years to make sure 
because that sort of fills out the Android ecosystem and as a key part of 
making the Android expe
rience a great experience by having great content, 
great apps on the Google Play system. And in terms of economics, the 
economics like you said rightfully are shared between developers, carriers, 
OEMs and us and our key with Google Play is to make sure tha
t there is a 
robust ecosystem. People like Android devices that provides some great 
functionality and we believe anybody who brings value to that ecosystem 
should have economics in that ecosystem once a carrier, OEM or a developer 

 
specifically talk about who keeps what part of the 

economics work out, and the more important part is, it is helping drive the 
ecosystem in the right direction.

ble right through the data connection. So one big 
change in having a high
-
speed data connection is actually the entire kind of 
television experience, cable TV like experience comes straight through your 
data connection, through your gigabit connection. And
 
people I think have 
been pretty excited about that experience being a great experience for 
watching television actually.
 
So our next question.

Great. Tha
nks for the question. I wondered if you can review the content 
strategy at YouTube and the willingness to invest in areas like live sports, 
like the NFL and how the content strategy would play in the evolution of 
YouTube over time. Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Th
ank you, John, for the question. I think I'll also give this one to Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Well, again as we've always said that YouTube is an ecosystem which is a 
combination of great users, great advertisers and great content and we talk 
to content provide
rs all the time because we understand that users come to 
YouTube so that they can enjoy both user
-
generated content, other forms of 
content both short form and long form. So we're pretty comfortable that 
we're making great sort of progress. The number of h
ours that people watch 
YouTube continues to go up, the amount of videos uploaded to YouTube 
continues to go up. And as Larry mentioned, we're seeing a lot of YouTube 
usage coming out of mobiles. So really our content strategy in YouTube is 
working. We're c
onstantly talking to people about content all the time and so 
sure, we will talk to anybody who wants to talk about content. But for now 
we're happy with where we are. In the end our goal is to help make sure 
that our users have a good experience, that the
y get to see the right content 
on there and our advertisers are able to advertise on that platform.

Hi, thanks. A bigger picture question for Larry and components of the 
question have been touched on in the call, but there has been a debate for 
some time about the Internet becoming more vertical and accelerated by the 
transition to mobile and 
if that could serve as a headwind for Google's 
business, yet your core revenue growth has been remarkably stable for 
several quarters now, above 20%. And Larry you've talked about this broad 
topic in prior calls, but I was just wondering if you can give an
 
updated view 
of the landscape as it relates to your efforts to go deeper into the transition 
funnel to offset verticalization as well as if you could share your perception 
of Google's competitive position in a multi
-
device world versus the legacy 
desktop,
 
laptop world? And then secondly, any timeline or thoughts that you 
can give on Project Loon in terms of it becoming a commercial offering? 
Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
All right. Thanks, Scott, for the questions. So I think 

 
so the first topic is 
pretty complex to
pic, I think we're very well positioned in mobile. I've said 
this before where we have the Android. I think we have tremendous services 
on Android. And we have obviously search and things that work across many 
different things. I'm tremendously excited abo
ut the funding. We have the 
potential to really improve people's experience as they move more into 
mobile and spend more time there and to make those experiences much 
more efficient and pleasurable and beautiful for those users. Often as I do 
things with t
hird parties and one thing to keep in mind is we've done a lot of 
effort around the APIs on Android and we're working with top developers in 
and around Google Play as a marketplace for those developers. Those things 
are evolving all the time with the help 
of some users and help of those 
developers. So we have a lot of ideas there and a lot of work going on. So 
I'm actually very, very excited about that. I think we're tremendously well 
positioned to help them [indiscernible] move along and make users' 
experi
ences better and to improve our business from the developers' 
businesses. I think 

 
even I find I'm spending most of my time now on 
mobile and not so much on the old desktop world, because I guess a lot of 
people are going to generally do over time. I thin
k on Project Loon, again it's 
really early for that. So we announced because we had to, because people 
are seeing them and they're flying around and so on. But it's a small team, 
it's very exciting. We've been totally amazed by the positive reaction we've 
gotten across the world and from high speed and telcos and other people 
wanting to work with us, which is tremendous, we want to work with all of 
them. I think I found something important in trying to improve rural Internet 
access, which is something that 
if you're one of the significant number of 
people in a rural area or a place that doesn't have great Internet access 
now, it is something that really matters to your quality of life. So we're 
excited about that.

We have time probably for t
wo more questions, so why don't we jump in on

Great. Thank you taking the question. Larry, I just was wondering with 
advertisers having
 
more choice of broad platforms to use for spending their 
digital ad dollars and in particular on mobile, I'm just wondering do you see 
a big acceleration in dollars moving from offline to online, do you see that 
pace accelerating over the next few years? 
And also how will Google 
continue to differentiate itself here?
 
Larry Page
 
Yes, I guess I'll give that to Nikesh. I'll just say we've always seen a lot of 
choices in advertising. We've always competed a while in that market and I 
think people are definitel
y getting more and more excited about moving 
dollars online. For us I think the measurability of it, the strength of the tools 
that are available and technologies to do that we just see as an amazing 
opportunity and I think people are more and more realizi
ng them. Nikesh?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes, to build on what Larry said I think he's right that we are expecting more 
and more dollars to move towards these platforms for a variety of reasons. 
One, there are more options for some more players in the market which are 

 
that means they are all wo
rking hard towards the same goal of convincing 
advertisers and this is the place where the users are and this is where 
advertisers need to be. Also if you think about what's going on, it's as I said 
earlier in the context of YouTube, we are going to see mo
re and more video 
coming on to the web and online mechanisms is more targetable and more 
addressable. In terms of our differentiation, if you look at what we've done 
over the last many years is we've actually worked in terms of trying to 
provide a comprehe
nsive solution across all digital capability whether it's on 
Google, whether it's off Google, whether it's in our network, whether it's 
with us, whether it's with partners that are on the web, whether it's with 
mobile devices, whether it's on desktop devic
es, whether it's from display 
ads, search ads or video ads, if you look at it what we're trying to do is we're 
trying to make sure that when an advertiser wants to reach users, we can 
provide them a comprehensive solution that they can go ahead and 
adverti
se. And if you couple that with measurement which is what sort of 
makes online so much more compelling that if you are going to look at 
measurement, look at analytics around it, so advertisers get a lot more 
information. They have lot more options and of c
ourse in the end we want to 
make sure that we focus on very high quality ads. So if you combine all of 
those things, we think we can continue to be working towards providing 
them comprehensive solution and we work really hard with all the players in 
the ec
osystem whether it's publishers, agencies or other media property 
owners, so we feel good about this.

Our next question.

We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

Thank you. A couple of
 
things. First, on the rest of world acceleration, could 
you let us know if there was any platforms like mobile or products like 
maybe YouTube that really kind of kicked in the quarter that really help drive 
that, maybe it was Google Play? And then on Moto
rola it's now getting close 
to $1 billion run rate on annual losses. Could you remind us of the synergies 
that you're seeing with that and why you're encouraged by that and maybe 
when that could start to turn the other way? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So clea
rly on international, not only is our kind of core search business 
performing very well, but also as you've seen other revenues which includes 
the Play platform is actually doing pretty well internationally. So those two 
are the big contributors for that o
ne. As we stand on Motorola, I mean Larry 
mentioned it very well at the beginning of the call, right? It is still early days 
for us. I think that we have Dennis and the team have already made a huge 
transformation at Motorola. We have now great product qua
lity, the Moto X, 
the first of the products that have come out and it's actually been very well 
received, a great product. So the team is now really working on building out 
marketing and distribution which is the kind of phase of it. So that's the 
mindset 
that we put in Motorola. This is not a this quarter or next quarter 
but much more 

 
a more fundamental kind of optimistic and recent view of 
the company. So that's how we think of these issues. Thanks, Justin.

We'll take our final question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask 
about. First, just on Enhanced Campaigns, can you give us some se
nse of 
what it meant for overall spending in the quarter and then also how do you 
get advertisers to use the location and time of date, modifiers going forward. 
And then just on the U.S. business there was a [decel] there of about 500 
basis points from las
t quarter? Patrick you mentioned the networks shifts 
there obviously, but was there anything else going on there?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
No, I mean, on your U.S. network it really is as you know there are changes 
in policies. They basically affect dramatically m
ore our network and because 


front end of the question.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes, in terms of enhanced campaign

by what it meant for overall spending in the quarter.
 
Unidentified Analyst
 
Is it positive, I mean, was it incremental to revenue do you think in the 
quarter?
 
Nikesh Arora
 

--
 

actually trying to quantify the effect, because we believe its part of your 
overall experience and its step in the right direction in terms of what you 
want to achieve. In terms of your q
uestion as it relates to location and time 
of day modifiers. I mean these are requests from advertisers, but to give 
you an example usually when a car rental company advertises when 

and 

sitting at the desktop. So the location can be used as a great modifier in 


 
of examples like that where you can actually use 
location very effectively or time of day very effectively, the traditional 


 
not hungry and 

different advertising. People shop more at lunch time, so there is a whole 
bunch of stuff that comes in when you start providing location and time of 
day modifiers. S

 
Larry Page
 
I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with us and turn it over 
to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

all of you that have worked with
 
us, with the investor community group; you 
know that Willa Chalmers who is part of our IR team has been kind of 

announce that Jacob Allen Chalmers is now in the world and has arrived a
 
couple of days ago, mom is doing incredibly well, so Willa is doing great too. 
So just to let you know that she has not disappeared, she is doing great, the 

Googler addition for 

weeks.
 
With that, I will turn it back to Larry to close the call.

Larry Page
 
Hello, everyone and thanks for joining our call this afternoon. Google had a 
great quarter. Over $14 billion of revenue, up 19% year

r, amazing 
performance for a Company that is yet to celebrate its 15th birthday. We 
live in a world of abundant computing, with multiple operating systems and 

when Google started.
 
There was essentially one OS, and one device 

decade, maybe even less are coming. The shift from laptop to mobiles, from 
on screen to multiple screens, create a tremendous opportunity 
for Google. 
With more devices, more information and more activity online than ever, the

at work, and helping you 
share and remember the moments that matter in life.
 

apps, and devices. First, platforms. With hindsight, Android and Chrome 
were no brainers. At the time
, they were big bets. The movements across 
these platforms is tremendous. As you saw in our Annual Average Developer 
Conference in May, I was astounded, we had over 1 million people tuning in 
life just to watch our developer keynote.
 

re than 900 million Android devices worldwide and 

as in the first android phone launched less than five years ago and apps 
usage is increasing fast. Over 50 million apps have bee
n now downloaded 
from the Google Playstore. In fact, we already paid out more money to 
Android developers this year than in the whole of 2012.
 
I love the ability to access your stuff on play anywhere. Take our new music 
subscription service, launched in Ma
y, it has a new fun way to discover new 

seriously. Chrome, even though only four year old, has over 750 million 
users worldwide and growing.
 
The next apps, our goal is to design eve


should just work. This quarter we completely revamped our maps. The map 
is a screen, no clutter quarter around the edges, because more inform
ation 

improved navigation feature. And not execution about incidents, before you 
leave and updates to save time if traffic condition change.
 
First of all, this new maps experience is
 
now available on almost all devices, 

complete redesign to make using the entire screen and that really looks 
consistent to whatever the delays or the platform. In addition, the team 
massi
vely upgraded the photos experience. Making software design for 
professionals automatically available to everyone for fee. There is no need 
for wrinkles anymore.
 
Take a look on Plus, many of your photos will now be marked enhanced and 
improved automaticall
y.
 
Finally we launched a new communication app called Hangouts. You can talk 
to the people you care about across all the major platforms. Video calls from 
your phone are very cool, give them a try.
 
And I'm excited about the progress we've continued to make
 
with Search. 
Our Knowledge Graph is now available in 29 languages and we've expanded 
the range of information available. For example, we just added nutrition 
data. Ask Google how many calories there are in a glass of white wine and 
you'll find out its 123
, or an avocado, 235 calories. It's good to have the 
facts if you want to keep healthy. And we launched Google Now on iOS in 
April.
 
In the same way, we want to make advertising super simple for customers. 
Online advertising have developed in very specific 
ways with separate 
campaigns for desktop and mobile. This made arduous work for advertisers 
and agencies and meant mobile opportunities often got missed.
 
It's why we launched Enhanced Campaigns. Advertisers have upgraded 6 
million campaigns. That's almost 
75% of all their active campaigns. And 
Nikesh will talk in a little more detail about the positive reaction from clients. 
This is the biggest ever change to AdWords and the velocity and execution 
has been great thanks to the hard work of all the teams.
 
Fin
ally, devices; there is so much excitement around new devices today and 
the potential for innovation is tremendous. You can now buy the HTC One 
and the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play editions and enjoy the best of 
Google. There's a ton of momentum around Ch
romebooks, which are 
growing fast and defying the more general decline in PC sales.
 
Finally, I know you're all eagerly anticipating what Motorola is launching 
soon. Having been a tester for a while, I'm really excited. We're very 
optimistic about the oppor
tunities in front of Google today. The potential for 
technology to make people's lives better is tremendous. But to achieve that 
potential we need to stay focused. It's why we continue to invest the vast 
majority of our resources and time in our core produ
cts. But my job as CEO 
is also to think about the future and ensure we continue to bet on new 
technology that can solve big problems in the world.
 
Project Loon, which we launched in June, is a great example. Bringing 
affordable, balloon
-
powered Internet ac
cess to remote areas is an idea that 
Sergey and I had been thinking about for over a decade. It was great to see 
that project literally get off the ground, and give people a bit more hope for 
an improving world.
 
None of this would happen without great peop
le and we are so lucky that we 
have them. I'd like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make 
everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution.
 
Now, I'll hand the call over to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Larry, and good 
afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. 
So why don't we go dive in by reviewing the details of our overall business 
financial performance, so here we go. Our gross total consolidated revenue 
grew 19% year
-
over
-
year to $14.1 billion. The overall busin
ess was up 1% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Google standalone gross revenue grew 20% year
-
over
-
year to 13.1 billion 
and was up 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our Google website revenues was up 
18% year
-
over
-
year to 8.9 billion and was in fact up 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Our Google network revenue grew 7% year
-
over
-
year to 3.2 billion 
and was down 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
You'll remember the advertising policy decisions we implemented during Q4 
and Q1 to ensure the useful and safe user experience continued to have its 
neg
ative impact on network revenue. Other revenue grew 138% year
-
over
-
year to $1 billion and roughly flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Play store digital sales of apps and content drove the year
-
on
-
year and 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter growth and it's worth noting that in Q
1, we included 
some seasonal hardware sales due to overflow from Q4 which skewed the 
Q2 comps somewhat. Finally, please note that without currency fluctuations 
Google standalone revenue growth would in fact have been 22% year
-
over
-
year and 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Turning to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue there was $998 million, just shy 
of a $1 billion and it's clear that we've made a lot of progress at Motorola in 
the past year and that we are especially excited about the future of our 
upcoming product 
lineup, so stay tuned.
 
At Google, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong at 22% year
-
over
-
year, in fact up 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our aggregate cost
-
per
-
paid 
was down 6% year
-
over
-
year and down 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter and 
currency fluctuations
 
in this case had a minimal effect in Q2 CPC growth, 
and yet our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by the usual 
factors that we've discussed many times including geographic mix, channel 
mix, property mix, our product and policy changes as well 
as FX.
 
Turning to the geographic performance of Google standalone business, we 
continued to see a steady performance in the U.S. and rest of world, while 
the UK was negatively impacted by a warm spring, some FX in their case 
and a tough year
-
over
-
year comp
. In our earnings slides which you can find 
on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our 
revenue by U.S., UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the 
benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for
 
the 
exact calculations.
 
U.S. revenue was up 18% year
-
over
-
year to $5.9 billion. The UK was up 
12% year
-
over
-
year to 1.3 billion which included 24 million of benefits from 
our hedging program. It is in fact worth noting that in fixed FX terms, the UK 
grew 
15% year
-
over
-
year. Non
-
U.S. revenue, excluding UK, accounted for 
45% of the total revenue or 5.9 billion and it was up 23% year
-
over
-
year 
which includes 11 million benefits from our hedging program. In fixed FX 
terms, rest of world grew a solid 28%.
 
Comin
g back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our 
other cost of revenue was 2.9 billion in Q2 excluding stock
-
based 
compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non
-
GAAP operating expenses 
totaled 4.2 billion also excluding stock
-
based 
compensation and Motorola 
restructuring and our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2 
resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 
28%.
 
For standalone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 25% of 
tot
al advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was 2.1 billion, again 
excluding 110 of stock
-
based compensation. Non
-
GAAP operating expenses 
were 3.8 billion, excluding stock
-
based compensation of 633 million. And 
non
-
GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion 
in Q2 resulting in non
-
GAAP 
operating margin of 32% for the standalone Google segment.
 
Please note that a reevaluation of our depreciation policy as it relates to our 
real estate portfolio resulted in an additional 121 million in Google segment 
depreciatio
n expenses, about half of which were presented a one
-
time 
charge for assets that are now fully depreciated. With this change in place, 
depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for 
standalone Google was 667 million for this qua
rter.
 
At Motorola Mobility, total non
-
GAAP operating expenses including cost of 
revenue were $1.2 billion. Keep in mind intangible amortization expenses 
attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are in fact, 
included in these non
-
GAAP measu
res. Of the 283 million in intangible 
amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the 
acquisition of Motorola of which 116 million was allocated to Google and 37 
million was allocated to Motorola Mobility.
 
And as a result, the non
-
G
AAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was 218 
million in Q2 and an non
-
GAAP operating margin for that segment of minus 
22%. Headcount for the consolidated business was down roughly 9,000 
people in Q2. Please keep in mind that consolidated headcount now 
excludes 
Motorola Home business. It also reflects the impact of the ongoing mobility 
restructuring. Standalone Google added about a 1,400 people during the 
quarter and in total the consolidated Company ended the quarter with 
around 44,800 full
-
time employe
es. While effective tax rate was 24% in Q2, 
like in Q1 several one
-
time items as well as the continued shift of earnings 
between domestic and international subsidiaries impacted our tax rate this 
quarter and also please remember that in Q1 we also had a si
gnificant lower 
rate in that case due to the 2012 R&D credit which was obviously not applied 
to our Q2 rate.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $247 
million for the quarter which reflects realized gains on investments and 
inte
rest income offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense on 
our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E again please refer to the 
slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
 
We continue to be very pleased with our operating cash flow which
 
is strong 
this quarter at $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.6 billion, and this is 
versus last quarter at $1.2 billion. I want to remind everybody the majority 
of our CapEx spend is related to data center construction, facilities related 
purchase
s and production equipment. CapEx is just inherently lumpy. And as 
I mentioned last quarter during my remarks our infrastructure will continue 
to be a strategic area of investment. It's one of the foundations of our future 
growth. Our free cash flow again 
very strong $3.1 billion for the quarter.
 

opportunities ahead of us as a Company. It's in this spirit of optimism that 
we continue to fully fund strategic growth opportunities with the sa
me 
confidence and discipline we demonstrated while growing our Mobile 
Business, Android, YouTube, Chrome, just to name a few.
 

business performance in the quarter and after his rem

lines for questions.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned our businesses had a strong 
quarter. We had over $13.1 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. 
Overall the performance was particularly strong in the auto
 
sector in Brazil. 
And as Patrick mentioned growth in the U.K. was hampered because of a 


marketing team that co
ntinues to create great Google moments. In May, 
they put on our second annual YouTube brand cast event in New York for 

ability to help marketers connect with highly coveted consumers and
 
ultimately build their brands.
 
At Brandcast, Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks said YouTube is a whole 

the team put on another successful Google I/O Development Conference 
showcasing
 
our incredible momentum across our platforms to over 6000 
developers in San Francisco with over a million people tuning in from around 
the world. We continue to be pleased with how our business is evolving, 
growing and diversifying.
 
There are three key ar
eas where we continue to make investments. First, 
our transformation into a marketing platform that works across the 
connected world Larry described. Second, our systematic move up the 
marketing funnel helped clients more and more with brand building 
campa
igns. Third, our investments in our non
-
ads business such as 
enterprise services, hardware and digital contents for Google Play.
 
First, our message for our constantly connected users. The rapid adoption of 
new devices means that more people are spending mo
re time online and 

a world where people are constantly connected with devices with them all 
the time. As an example you marketers say for the time spent online our 
mobile devices by 
U.S. adults grew 273% from 2009 to 2012. From 2011 to 
2012 alone the time spent connected to mobile devices increased by nearly 
half an hour a day. This means not only a lot of new services and apps 
available for users and also a huge opportunity exists fo
r businesses looking 
to reach mobile users at the right time and location.
 
That brings in enhanced campaigns. As Larry talked about this, enhanced 
campaigns was a big long
-
term bet that is designed to help advertisers more 
easily reach customers across dev
ices with the right message, all within one 
campaign. We already migrated six million of active campaigns to enhanced 
campaigns over the last many months. Our goal is to migrate all of our 
advertisers and campaigns by the end of this month. This effort has
 
been 
executed at breakneck
-
speed and client reaction has been generally positive.
 

using enhanced campaigns. For example Pizza Hut. Social mobile ROI 
increased by 20%. They found tha
t mobile click through rate has increased 
by more than 60% while that cost per order on smartphones is dropped by 
17%. We believe enhanced campaigns does set up our clients and our 
business really well for the long
-
term and the move towards a constantly 
co
nnected world goes far beyond just direct response and transaction of 
marketing.
 
People are spending time watching videos, playing games, consumer news. 
All this creates great new opportunities from brand marketers to engage 
users. In fact powered by a Tru

June of this year was three times what it was at the beginning of the year. 
And to help advertisers reach viewers across more screens we opened up 
our TrueView Formats with all of our ad mob network across 1000s of
 
apps.
 
Turning our attention to brand marketers this is a very, very important area 
for us where we continue to invest broadly. It's important because the 
largest global marketers from CPG companies to film studios all conduct 
large major brand advertising
 
campaigns, of course that referenced in the 
significant budgets that have historically been spent on TV.
 
A good example of this was seen in the Cannes Lions Festival; the Dove real 
beauty sketches campaign that appeared on YouTube won the Titanium 
Grand P
rix award which is considered the best to the highest honor. We 
worked with Burberry to launch Burberry Kisses which allows users to send 
message to loved ones sealed with the digital imprint of their real kiss. This 
campaign runs on YouTube and our networ
k across desktop, tablets and 
mobiles. In the last month we began to integrate our recent acquisition 
Wildfire into the double click platforms so that brands can now manage the 
broader customer journey across search, display, mobile, social, rich media 
and
 
video again all within one platform.
 
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about our investment in emerging non

ad 


ital 
content and enterprise. First hardware, we continue to see great momentum 


mortar stores including Walmart and Staples,
 


Google Play Store from Samsung and HTC.
 
On the digital ads and content front, through Google Play we continue to see 
tremendous amount of growth in 
this area. People from over 190 countries 
now download apps from Google Play everyday. More than 50 billion apps 
have been downloaded so far. In the last year Google Play digital content 
like music and movies has launched in 21 new countries including Indi
a, 
Mexico, Russia, with eight more European countries launching Google Play 
books this week. Publishers like Penguin, Random House, Time Inc. movie 
studies like Disney and NBC Universal, and app developers like King and 
Square Enix are creating terrific ex

collaborated with all the major record labels to launch a new music 
subscription service that users seem to be enjoying really

enjoying a lot.
 

Go
ogle. It comprises productivity apps like Docs and Gmail as well as our 
Cloud infrastructure. Now more than half of the Fortune 500 companies use 
the paid enterprise product from Google, and over 5 million businesses use 
our productivity apps. This means w
e have close long

term relationships 
with our enterprise customers. New customers this quarter includes some of 
our worlds leading businesses, like Federal Express, which has built their 
store locator in Google Maps, Snapchat which runs an application with
 

New Google apps customers include Pearson, Keller Williams Realty and the 


 
initiative to help small businesses called 
SMB IT in a Box.

All right, great. Thanks, guys. Nikesh, I just had one kind of high level 
question on enhanced campaigns and the tra
nsition. So, can you just give us 
a little bit more color about the ROIs that most of your customers are 
seeing? You mentioned a few comments but are there going up? And do you 
see a significant opportunity in providing conversion tracking across different
 
screens? What do you think will happen with search budgets if and when you 
can solve that problem? Thanks.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you for the question. I think it's fair to say that over the last nine 
months, we've had to do a super Herculean task to take mil
lions and millions 
of campaigns, as Larry mentioned, 6 million campaigns that we've had to 
work with our advertising partners to go ahead and convert them towards 
enhanced campaigns. And we've had some amazing insights both working 
with the advertisers and
 
as well as our teams. As many advertisers have 
discovered that there were not addressing the mobile opportunity 
appropriately, they discovered new inventory, they discovered better ROI 
and better conversion. Of course we had disobeyed the conversion analy
tics 
who work across every scheme and be able to be made available to all of 
our advertisers. So, we believe that as we get more and more 

 
as we get 
better in terms of being able to provide more targeting and more 
comprehensive ad solutions for mobility a
nd across all screens that the ROI 
should continue to improve. So, I'm very optimistic in the longer term 
because we believe mobility provides more context to advertisers in terms of 
where the users are, where they've been, which will allow for more accura
te 
advertising which is almost like as good as information for them. So if that 
begins to happen we think the advertising ROI continues to increase and 
hopefully that means good things for search budgets.

One question for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, when you think about 
hardware, are there other hardware categories
 
beyond just phones and 
tablets where you believe Google can potentially build meaningful 
businesses? And then Patrick, in Q1 we didn't really see the usual uptick in 
expenses that you kind of see annually but then now we do see it in Q2. It 
sounds like so
me of that was the accounting issue around depreciation, but 
can you help us understand what happened there more? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Yeah, thanks Ben for the question. I think we've been an early innovator in 
smartphones and we've been really excited about
 
starting Android when no 
one really thought it was going to be interesting. And I think it's always a 
mistake to assume that technology will be static. So I think assuming over 
the long term, we're going to have new kinds of devices and ways of 
interactin
g with computing and the internet. Obviously, we're excited about 
Google Glass and new ways of interacting with hardware and new types of 
hardware. With any technological change you probably overestimate the 
short term and underestimate the long term. So I
 
think we're really excited 
about making those investments. We're making sure we're positioned to live 
the future and that's why I won't be using Glass because I feel like every 
time I'm using Glass, I'm living that future. That's really, really exciting t
o 
me.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Why don't I jump on the next question, so on the issue of expenses, look 
our expenses in Q2 were completely in line with the objectives we set for 
ourselves. In general, we continue to exercise financial discipline and module 
our pro
duct profitability. But it's on that basis that we recognize the 
significant opportunities that are ahead of us. And with the view to the long 
term, we continue to invest significantly and intelligently to fuel these 
opportunities. The fundamental issue is
 
as I've said a number of times on 
previous calls if you want to hire X amount of people you have a target for 
the quarter or for the year. And they come in sometimes a bit over, 
sometimes a bit under but the real question is, are you still on the right 
tr
ajectory for the long
-
term you're shooting for. So that's really the issue 
between Q1 and Q2.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Ben, thank you for your question. Why don't we go to the next question,

Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Great. Two questions, please. First on CPC, Patrick, you mentioned a couple 
of factors behind the deflation there. I don't think you ticked off mobile. I 
don't know if there's any particular 
reason why you didn't or maybe I missed 
it. And then in terms of the employee adds, maybe a question for Larry as 
you think about where you've been able to get employees, the ease or the 
difficulty with which you've been able to hire the employees that you
 
wanted 
to hire. Could you comment on how that has changed, if at all, over the last 
year or two? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So why don't I jump in on the first one. Clearly mobile has some effect of it 
and we've talked about that in the past, so it's jus
t one of the many factors 
that are at work. I just gave the list and the property mix obviously and the 
channel mixes includes a bunch of mobile shifts as well and that's part of the 
equation clearly for sure that drives both sides of the equation. And I j
ust 
want to remind everybody that it's always kind of dangerous to just look at 
CPCs by themselves or just look at paid clicks by themselves, but in fact it's 
a combination of the two that gives you the health of the business and these 
mixes move all over 
the place depending on the number of changes going on 
in any quarter, but overall very pleased with the overall performance. On 
headcount, I'll lend it to Larry to jump in.
 
Larry Page
 
Yeah, Mark, I don't think we've seen any significant change in the short
 
term 
on hiring. I think we're lucky that we have really great people in the 
company and more great people want to work with us. We've been able to 
buy smart companies too where we get great people and I don't see any 
major changes now that's been changing
. I also think retention for the 
company has been great. People are excited to work here. They're excited to 
work on important things and make the world better. We're able to hire 
some of the best people in the world and I think that's been continuing and 
it's pretty stable.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. Two questions. L
arry, I think sometimes you say the technology 
has done only 1% of what you can do suggesting that there's a lot of 
opportunity for Google. If that's the case, why isn't your ROE budget 10%, 
20% or materially higher than today or in other words what limit 
your ability 
to spend more to capture these opportunities? Secondly, Patrick, can you tell 
us in general what specific financial operating metrics you use to evaluate 
the success of Google Fiber as a business? Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Yeah, that's a really gr
eat question, Carlos. I think that's our main job is to 
figure out how to obviously invest more to achieve greater outcomes for the 
world for the company and so on, and I think those opportunities are clearly 
there. You know as we've seen in the past with 
things like Chrome and 
Android and I've talked about them a lot. I think that execution and velocity, 
I talked about a lot too. It's pretty easy to come up with ideas, it's pretty 
hard to make them real and get them to billions of people. And that for me 
i
t's so exciting about being at a company like Google, so we get to do 
technological innovation at scale and get it out to on the scale of the whole 
world, to billions of people. But I wish we can just snap our fingers and 
accomplish that. There's actually 
lot of hard work and it takes a lot of great 
people working really hard to make that happen. We're working every day to 
improve our processes, improve our leadership and improve how we're 
organized, and to make that all go faster, and that's why I'm come i
nto work 
excited every day and I think why we're most proud of it. I wish we could 
snap our fingers and do 

 
just do a tremendous amount more instantly, but 
throughout its hard work to scale and that's what we do.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Carlos, I'll take the sec
ond one related to Google Fiber. Just out of the 
context for everybody, we have been on the record to say that we're running 
Google Fiber and excited about it and we'll always have profitability as one 
of the key criteria for this opportunity. And in terms
 
of kind of metrics, they 
should be just aligned with any sound business that's in that domain of 
access which is a combination. At first actually it was interesting because the 
question was, how successful was going to be the product and then 

 
so 
meaning
 
how many people would kind of want to take it? And then the 
second 

 
we've been obviously very pleased by our results in Kansas City 
and now the announcements of the other two cities we've made since then. 
And then there's all the regular metrics you can 
imagine which have to do 
with cost of infrastructure, cost to serve and then how they grow into a 
profitability model. So there's no real rocket science in the financials of it. 
The real kind of magic occurs with the definition of the product, the 
innovati
on on the technology that the teams are pushing and what makes 
Google Fiber 100 times faster than the next best thing. That's really what 
we're really focused on. So I hope that answers your question.

Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask about the network 
sites deceleration that you saw a 12% growth last quarter and 7% growth 
this quarter. Can you just 
talk about some of the key drivers there and 

sites and quality in everything. And then secondly, can you talk about the 
key drivers that you see in terms of improving conversion r
ates for mobile 
ads, I know you mentioned the conversion analytics, but what else do you 
think gets mobile ad conversion up over the next few years? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

nd 
then Nikesh will answer the second part. Clearly the network deceleration, I 


partners that have through Q1
, Q2 have all been notified and have made the 
changes to their behavior. So these policies are now coming into compliance 
and as a result of it, right that you see the impact. But we really believe that 
this is a really good thing for our users. And into t
he long
-
term it will really 


 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah, thank you Patrick. I think it's important to understand as I sa
id that 
improving convergent rates for us requires us to do a lot of things. One is we 
have to understand the cross device behavior better. We have to understand 
the cross device convergent being build. People can start to search in one 
device and conclude
 
it in another device. These opportunities did not exist in 
the past and would also focus on one screen. In addition to that, as we talk 
about mobility we start to understand the context of the users a lot better as 
I said. Where are they? Where have they 
been? What could their search 



ose 
attributes, all those factors need to go in into creating better targeting, 
better advertising for our end users so that, that actually helps to increase 
our line for advertisers and hopefully ROI for us in the longer term.

Morgan Stanley
 
Hi, I had two questions. First, Larry mentioned some of the new features in 
the maps 
update, I think also the Gmail tab update seems like it's been 

just for the full rollout in the U.S. internationally and any implications you 
foresee that update may have on those 
that are relying on marketing as a 
distribution channel. And then secondly, Larry also spoke about balloon 
deployed internet access. I was wondering if you could talk about another 
initiative that seems like it has significant opportunity long
-
term, the 
au
tomated vehicle opportunity and when you think of that as a commercial 
opportunity at scale. Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Yeah, thanks for that question Scott, I think

I am not sure the detail of 

eally great 




experience that can be improved and 


those have been great very user positive features enrolling out. I think 
in 



nothing has changed about 

hard it's very early stage project obviously. And then there is the last part of 
your question, I mean I think it's hard to predict exactly when these things 
will be commercial. My question I always ask is, wh

today? So we try to reduce whatever roadblocks that we can, take anything 

there.

Barclays
 

ask about CapEx. I think you mentioned in your comments that dat
a centers 
and other network infrastructure was lumpy and responsible for the doubling 
of CapEx. I am just wondering, I am not sure from an accounting 
perspective what the useful light is on some of those investments and 
whether or not the amortization of t
hose assets is part of what's causing a 

about CapEx. And then, Larry as Google continues to invest for future 
growth, I just wanted to ask, how do you as a leader of the Co
mpany ensure 
that the people at Google and your employees keep the kind of small 
entrepreneurial culture that Google had and was known for in its earlier 
days. And thanks a lot for the question.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So let me jump in Anthony on the first part 


by for our assets. But you can imagine that as we build these, the data 
centers and the computers clearly data centers have a long lifetime bec
ause 
if you think of them as land, electricity, power, building shelves, like cooling 
towers, all that technology has much longer useful life. And then the 
computers themselves, the machines, the servers have a much shorter 
lifetime and we track all those 
by categories obviously. And clearly there is a 
relationships between that and our depreciation rates that have been 
--
 

nothing magical about it as well. I mean it's just basical


 
Larry Page
 
Yeah, it's a great question I think. I think I am very, very exited to see. I 
mentioned the Project Loon or the automated cars, I think a lot of us are 
making sure
 
that our employees and Google as a Company has the 
permission to do important things, and those things always start with a 

people and so on, and those people can get a lot of things do
ne. So I think 


way we end up with things like Android and Chrome those were once those 
kind of projects. So,
 
I look at it kind of a portfolio thing. For some number of 
people that like to work on crazy things that are going to really change the 
world and want to deal with 10 other trends and work hard on them and 

ies and growing them into 
things that become Gmail or Android or Chrome, lot of things like that. And

expectation I think starting this quarter that we


that and that adoption and the impact that, that might have on blended 
prices might offset these mix factors that you referenced. I wonder if you 
could h

quarter. And then secondly probably for Patrick, I wonder can you help 
estimate the impact on the network growth in the quarter from the quality 
improvement initiatives and are these issues t
hat might impact future 
quarters or was this mainly a first half of this year kind of impact?
 
Larry Page
 

over to the other guys. I think it's important to keep in mind like enhanc
ed 
campaigns are the largest change we made in AdWords ever, and it was 

that. We changed tremendous amounts for how our teams operate, how our 
advertisers operate, how everyone bu
ys those ads, what the users see, and 



 
Patrick Pichet
te
 

think with the quality 
--
 
the forceful quality around our policies, I mean they 
will take a year to flow through. I mean once you've kind of reset the bar 
then it actually 

 
by the 
time people have kind of adhered to these new 
changes but then you have to actually navigate through the entire year
-
over
-
year effects which will probably take a couple more quarters. And that's 
just a timing issue. Having said that, I just want to remind 
everybody again 
that the fundamental issue that we see is its really important for us to 
actually have a great user experience. And Susan and her team's kind of 
pounded this by making changes on a constant basis to make sure that at 
the end of the day ther
e is that [smart bout], the quality of the user 
experience and the quality of the ads because in the end that's what really 
drives the benefit in the long term. So, when we have to hit 

 
take some hits 
in the short term in order to actually get the right a
nswer in the long term 
for our users and our advertisers, we're always ready to do them and that's 
a great example of it. So, we're actually not too worried about it. We have 
so many other areas that we just talked about enhanced campaigns, CLAs 
and so man
y other areas that offers us kind of opportunities that we just got 
to keep this in balance.

Great. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to follow
-
up on 
enhanced campaigns. One of the questions people are trying to get at is was 
there any impact from enhanced campaigns on paid clicks and CPCs in the 
quarter 
that you can try and help us calibrate? And then I guess the other 
question would be given obviously it is still new and broad roll out this 
quarter, how many quarters do you think this needs to be in place for you to 
have a good sense of the impact that m
ight have on those metrics? And 
then 

 
sorry, then my last question was anything related to the impact on FX 
related to CPCs? I didn't think I heard that. Thank you.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Hi, Heather. This is Nikesh. Thank you for your question. I think and let 
me 
step back and say first of all it's as Larry mentioned and Patrick mentioned, 
it is an existential requirement for us to take out advertisers and move them 
to a campaign strategy which allows us to move them across multiple 
streams. So this wasn't somet
hing that is just a remedy imperative, it's an 
imperative from a simplicity perspective, from an advertiser return 
perspective and also from the way our teams operate. So, we have spent 
the last six months migrating over 6 million campaigns, as I mentioned
, and 
we'll probably be done by the end of this month which is not too far away. 
As you can imagine that we've been focusing and moving these things 
across the board, so we're still looking at the full impact since the impact 
has sort of graduated over the
 
last few months. Now in terms of what the 
impact of this should be in the longer term, as I mentioned earlier the 
impact in the longer term should be that we should be able to provide 
simpler, faster, better ads to our advertisers across multiple streams.
 
In 
terms of when you should be able to see effects of these things, now 
obviously there are effects that we see and we monitor and we take a look 
at, but it's for us to go out and start detailing what the impact these things 
are. But of course in the long
 
term, it should have a positive impact on 
conversions and as a result all resulting metrics that affect conversion.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Heather, I'll just jump on your very last question about FX related to CPCs. 
As I said in my comments, there's actually a 
marginal effect. I mean FX was 
not a big factor this quarter. I mean it has been a little bit for the UK as I 
mentioned but for the rest of the world, it has not been a major impact for 
the CPC issue.

Great. Thank you. Patrick, the gross profit growth has been trailing revenue 
growth. I think it was about 14% this quarter f
or about three quarters 
especially. Can you talk about what's really kind of drove the step down last 
year in 3Q? And is there any way to see that gap close and do you use gross 
profit as a measure or do you look more at revenue growth? Some of the 
drivers
 
of the difference will be really helpful. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, Justin. Again, a topic that's for financial analysts have been always 
kind of top of mind. I just want to kind of reiterate kind of some of the basic 
messages that have not chan
ged and how we think about this. So first of all, 
we care about revenue growth, we care about profitability, we care about 
both. And I've said this before, right, we're not in a business to lose money, 
cross subsidize or any of these things. So regarding m
argins we really look 
at every incremental profit dollar that creates shareholder value and really 
focused on these profit dollars rather than the percentage margins. Many of 
the new opportunities that we may be exploring whether it be hardware, 
whether it
 
be Play, whether it be 

 
many of these will have different margins 
in our core business, but they actually offer great kind of 

 
huge revenue 
pools, huge margin pools in absolute dollars and then create much 
shareholder value and in many cases with Larry 
and the product area leads, 
great synergistic value between the products to create this great 
experiences. So, that's basically the mindset that we apply at it and we track 
them independently and together and make sure that we actually deliver 
continued re
venue growth and profit growth. So that's the mindset which we 
apply. And don't read in my comment that we're not focused on our core 
business. It remains our core business. The core is the core is the core, and 
it continues to give us both revenue and oxy
gen profits to kind of fuel our 
growth as well. So that's the balanced answer to your question.

If I could follow
-
up, is there anything in there that maybe operating right 
now at negative gross margins that is ki
nd of in
-
transitory in nature?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I wouldn't comment on a specific product by product, but it's clear that if 
there are timing issues, if there's a product that actually isn't in investment 
mode, right, and at the beginning of its investment 
curves, you know that 
you're actually investing in it for the timing of future profits. We do that too. 
I mean you can imagine our very first customer in Kansas City, right. The 
P&L for that day was negative, but that's not why we did Kansas City, right. 
W
e did Kansas City because we know as a city was going to be very 
profitable, so there is clearly products that have because of the timing 
investment movements that actually show 

 
will show negative, but not 
because we want them to be negative just because
 
of where they are during 
investment phase. So that's how we think about it.

Thanks. Nikesh, you br
iefly mentioned PLAs. We continue to see that format 
in Search and recently we noticed integrated deals and offers into that 
format, any additional color on the impact from PLAs in the quarter? And 
then Larry, regarding product search, I guess more broadly
, do you think 
users will be able to purchase items without ever leaving the Search results 
page at some point? Thank so much.
 
Larry Page
 
Thanks, Brian. I'll take the second question first. I think to the extent and 
obviously we can streamline the process 
of doing transactions or fulfilling 
any task and that's a good thing. I think in the trial we are doing in the Bay 
Area with [same day] delivery you can buy things very easily and get them 
delivered in a couple of hours. That was a pretty great experience.
 
So we 
definitely look at any ways we can find to really improve our user's 
experience. Nikesh, do you want to take over the PLA part?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
As Larry mentioned, we are trying to get the user experience to be better 
and better. And as we've talked in
 
the past, things are moving from 10 blue 
links to entity level search where people are searching for specific entities 
and they expect a response as a specific entity when doing that search. So 
think about PLA in the broader context, that when people sear
ch for 
something they like to get the answer. And if it's a product they're searching 
for, of course PLA has satisfied that requirement. So we are signing up tens 
of thousands of merchants who want to share that data with us, who want to 
make that data vis
ible as part of Google Search. So we think this is a good 
thing. Again, as we provide more and more PLA information, obviously it has 
an impact on peoples clicking on those links. So in the long term that should 
have a positive impact on fixers on various 
ad formats, but for now it's too 
early to talk about the impact of those with the overall numbers that we 
have.

Thank you for your question, Brian. Jamie, let's go to our next question. We 
have time for a couple more.

We'll go 
next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.

Good afternoon. A question on Motorola X, I know you haven't said a ton 
about it but there has been some talk that you're going to be aggressively 
marketing that. Can you just talk a lit
tle bit about this relationship that you 
have between having the Motorola X phone be enough of a success that you 
make a statement but not enough of a success that you end up corrupting or 
impacting your Android partners, so talk about that relationship? T
hanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Thanks for the question, Gene. I think nothing about what we've said has 
changed and we operate Motorola independently. As you can see in the level 
of work that's going on there to operating that business, I think teams are 
doing a great 
job as we mentioned. I think they're working hard on making a 
great product. And I think we're really excited about it. I think they're 
excited about it and obviously you'll get to try it out pretty soon.

Do you feel that the 

 
I mean the incremental investment, is it going to be 

 
it's been rumored to be $500 million, is it something in that range?
 
Larry Page
 
Are you talking about I guess the people have been speculating about 

re going to 

 

operating Motorola independently, running it much the same way we would 

that business. I think probably too much has been the made over those 
things.
 
Patrick 
Pichette
 
Thanks Gene for your question. Okay, we have time for one more question. 
So Jamie can you give us the last question please?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We will take our final question from Richard Kramer with Arete 
Research.

Thanks. Thanks very much. One for Larry and one for Patrick. For Larry, 
given the recent launch of YouTube subscriptions and also music services, 
how widely do you see Google expanding into subscription base businesses 
in the future and do you see this i
n three to five years is something that 
would be a meaningfully sized segment that would drive all network in size 
for example.
 
And for Patrick, since you had some questions about Motorola being excited 
about, it is nice. But the business has lost nearly a
 
$1 billion on a GAAP basis 
in the last three quarters. So, can you give us some sort of time scale for 



Google services? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 


lly well 
received, I love using it. I think we are always looking for ways to meet our 
users needs better and obviously subscriptions are one way to do that. So 

products in that are

the Motorola question, Patrick you want to take down?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Sure. I think the Motorola question has to be put into context of two things. 
One is while we originally paid for Motorola and a
ll the assets we acquired 

short
-
term financial play that was the number of strategic issues. We are 
very pleased with the divestiture of the home business, which kind of 
generally
 
quite a bit of cash over the last, in Q2. So, I think that you have to 
put this conversation in the context of the entire acquisition for which we 
were really pleased and we also are incredibly proud of what the team has 
accomplished in the last year. And
 
having now kind of create this great 
entity under Dennis, who has now kind of lean and mean with 5,000 
employees focused on the future and that with the pounding away at next 
generation of products. So, I will leave it to the coming quarters to kind of 
re

see that in the coming weeks actually. Larry, any last comments before we 
close?
 
Larry Page
 
I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with us today. And we 
will see you on ne
xt quarter.

h that, I will turn the call over to Larry.
 
Larry Page
 


-
up video. I 
heard they had a great time making it. Okay, we ha
d a really strong start to 
2013, with Q1 revenue up 31% year
-
on
-
year to $14 billion. I want to give a 
big shout
-
out to the sales teams that made this all possible. We tend to 
focus on product and engineering, but our business organization is 
tremendously s

 
Over the last two years, we worked hard to increase our velocity, improve 
our execution, and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the 
world. Take Google now, our goal is to get you the right informati
on at just 
the right time. Launched nine months ago, Now provides boarding passes, 
delivery updates, and traffic conditions without you having to ask first. In 
this quarter, we added movie tickets nicely packaged with directions to the 
theatre. I am also e
xcited about our Voice Search momentum. Looking for 

instantly, no typing needed. And you can now ask conversational questions 
like do I need a jacket this weekend. Voice commands 
are going to be 
increasingly important, it's just much less hassle to talk than type.
 
So in this quarter, we launched Chrome support for Web Speech APIs. 
Developers can now easily add voice recognition into their web apps. We 
expect to see a lot of innovat
ion there. The velocity around Google Play is 

Android ecosystem. In our first year, we assigned partnerships with all major 
movie studios, music labels, and publishers, and our dig
ital content is 
available in over 20 countries globally, seven of which we launched in Q1, 
including India and Mexico.
 
And last week, we released a beautiful new UI with better recommendations, 
bigger images, and a simpler way to buy things. Play is alread
y a great 

really important that our products work seamlessly whatever device you are 
using at the moment. It's why I love Google Play, the ability to buy books, 
apps, movies or song
s and have them instantly available on your Android 
devices even when you buy it on the web. When you switch devices while 
reading, your book opens exactly where you left off. In the same way, we 
need to make advertising across devices really simple for ou
r customers. 
Online advertising has developed in a very device specific ways with 
separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for 
advertisers and agencies, and means mobile opportunities often get missed.
 
So in February, we launched 
Enhanced Campaigns, a significant upgrade to 
AdWords. Nikesh will talk more about that in a moment. But our goal is 
simple; to enable advertisers to focus on their audience and their message 
while we dynamically adapt their campaigns across multiple device
s. I've 
been very pleased with the rate of progress so far. We are smoothly moving 
a huge advertising system and ecosystem on a dime.
 
In today's multi
-
screen world, the opportunities are endless. Think about 
your device. Battery life is a challenge for mos

to carry around a charger with you to make it through the day. If your kids 
spill their drink on their tablet, the screen shouldn't die, and when you drop 
your phone it shouldn't shatter. There is a real potential to invent new
 
and 
better experiences, one that are much faster and more intuitive, so having 

potential there. In just under a year, they have accomplished a lot and have 
impressive velocity and
 
execution.
 
I want to finish up by talking a little bit about the future. We invest the vast 
majority of our resources and time in our core products as well as our big 

to keep focu
sed on the future. Companies tend to get comfortable doing 

to work on other things you know, but incremental improvement is 
guaranteed to be obsolete over time, especially in techn
ology, where history 
has shown that there is a lot of revolutionary change.
 
So a big part of my job is to get people focused on things that are not just 
incremental. Take Gmail, when we released that, we were a search 
company. It was a leap for us to put o
ut an e
-
mail product let alone one that 
gave users 100 times as much storage as anyone else. It was the same with 

projects to you today such as self
-
driving cars.
 
We found that with 
ambitious goals and a committed team you can make 
progress pretty quickly. The best people often want to work on the biggest 

to try.
 
We started Google Fiber because Sergey thought i
t will be great to show 

later, our first homes are live in Kansas City, and in the last two weeks, we 
have announced plans to roll out service in Austin and Provo.
 
And just this week, a
fter three years of development, we started handing 
over Glass devices to developers. I get chills when I use a product that is the 
future, and that happens when I use Glass. Someday, we will all be amazed 
[that computing involved] [ph] fishing around in p
ockets and purses.
 
There are so many opportunities in the world to create technology that 

are really just getting started. And that is why I am so excited to be here 
working hard w
ith Googlers to take our company to the next level. Thank 
you.
 

 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. 
So let me dive in by reviewing the detai
ls of our overall business financial 
performance. So here we go.
 
Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 31% year
-
over
-
year to $14 billion 
in Q1. The overall business was down 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by the 
softness in Motorola Mobility segment sp
ecifically.
 
Were it not for currency fluctuations, our consolidated revenue would have 
grown 33% year
-
over
-
year or an additional $96 million, but the quarter
-
over
-
quarter impact was really immaterial. Google standalone gross revenue 
grew 22% year
-
over
-
year
 
to $13 billion and was flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter. 
Google website revenue was up 18% year
-
over
-
year to $8.6 billion flat 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter with strength across most major geographies and 
industries.
 
Google network revenue grew 12% 
year
-
over
-
year to $3.3 billion and down 
5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. The quarter
-
over
-
quarter impact was largely due 
to the effect of advertising policy decisions implemented during Q4 and in 
Q1 as well. Other revenue grew 150% year
-
year
-
over to $1 billion and
 
27% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by Play store sales, which also includes both 
hardware and digital commerce sales.
 

growth is due to the implementation of an accounting change in our
 
Play app 
revenue recognition policy. Currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact 
of Google standalone revenue both year
-
year
-
over and quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Turning now to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue was $1 billion. We continue 
to be very pleased w
ith the velocity of change at Motorola as Larry 
mentioned. For example, this week we closed our sale of the Home business, 

progress across the board in the transformation of the Motoro
la Mobility. 

from that segment will continue to be variable.
 
At Google, global aggregate paid click growth was strong, was up 20% year
-
over
-
year and, in fact, up 3% quarter
-
over
-
qua
rter. Our aggregate cost
-
per
-
click was down 4% year
-
over
-
year, as well as down 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. And 
similar to last quarter, as I mentioned, the advertising policy change 
affecting networ
k revenue continue to lower the aggregate paid click growth 
and improve CPC growth on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
In addition, our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by the usual 

pr
operty mix and product changes.
 
Turning now to geography and our geographic performance of Google 
standalone business, we continue to see steady performance across the 

find in o

revenue by U.S. U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the 
benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the 
exact calculations.
 
Revenue was up, from t
he U.S., was up 20% year
-
over
-
year to $5.8 billion. 
The U.K. was up 21% year
-
over
-
year to $1.4 billion, which include $20 
million of benefits from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the 
U.K. actually grew 20%.
 
Non
-
U.S. revenue excluding U.K. accou
nted for 44% of our total revenue or 
$5.7 billion, up 24% year
-
over
-
year, which includes a $15 million benefit 
from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world in fact 
grew 27%. So coming back at an aggregate level for total consolidated 
business, other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, excluding stock based 
compensation and Motorola restructuring.
 
Our non
-
GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.9 billion, which also exclude 
our stock based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And our
 
non
-
GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion in Q1 resulting in a non
-
GAAP 
operating margin of 30%.
 
For standalone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 25% of 
total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $2.1 billion excluding 
$99 mi
llion of stock
-
based compensation. The year
-
year
-
over increase was 
primarily driven by equipment cost including costs associated with the 
hardware sales on Play, carrier OEM revenue share driven by the 
implementation of our accounting change in our Play ap
p revenue 
recognition policy that I mentioned a minute ago and content acquisition 
costs.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating expenses were $2.5 billion excluding stock
-
based 
compensation of $556 million in this case and non
-
GAAP operating profit was 
strong at $4.4 billion
 
in Q1 resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin for the 
Google segment of 34% for standalone. Lastly, depreciation and 
amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for standalone 
Google was $520 million for this quarter.
 
At Motorola Mobility, our 
total non
-
GAAP operating expenses including cost 
to revenues were $1.2 billion. And keep in mind that intangible amortization 
of expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are in 
fact, included in these non
-
GAAP measures. Of the $31
5 million in intangible 
amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the 
acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google and 
$37 million was allocated to Motorola Mobility.
 
And as a result, the non
-
GAAP operatin
g loss for Motorola Mobility was $179 
million in Q1 resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin of negative 18% for 
that segment. Let me turn to head count for the consolidated business. In 
fact, it was roughly flat for Q1. Keep in mind, the consolidated head
 
count 
includes the Motorola Home and Home comprise roughly one
-
third of the 
total Motorola head count. Standalone Google added about 1,200 people and 
in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter around 53,900 full
-
time employees. Many of you may h
ave noticed our effective tax rate that 
was very low at 8% in Q1.
 
Please note that this quarter, the rate reflects a recognition for the full
-
year 
benefit of our 2012 federal R&D tax credit, which Congress extended, but 
only retroactively in January of thi
s year, so there was a catchup for the full 
of 2012 in Q1. Additionally, there has been the usual mix shift of earnings 
between domestic and international subsidiaries that continue to impact our 
tax rate.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income a
nd expense was $134 
million, which reflects interest income and realized gains on investments 
offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging 
program. For more details on those or any again, please refer to the slides 
that accompany 
this call on our IR website.
 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $3.6 billion. 
CapEx for the quarter was $1.2 billion versus last quarter at $1 billion and 
the majority of CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data 
cen
ter construction, and facilities related purchases. Our free cash flow was 
also strong at $2.4 billion and please note that cash flow and CapEx both 
include the Home business for now.
 
And before I hand it off now to Nikesh, I want to say a few words about 
investing in our future and preparing for the growth of our businesses. The 
success of our products and our continued strong performance as portrayed 

to continue to funding the strate
gic growth areas. These include not only 
products like Search or YouTube and Android or Chrome, but also our 
infrastructure as well.
 

business performance in the quarter. And after hi

the phone for questions. Nikesh, all yours.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. Our business is continuing to perform well. We had over 
$13 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. Our core business is strong 
across Search and Disp

particularly pleased by the positive growth we have continued to achieve in 

more depth about multi
-
screens, which Larry alluded to 
in bad advertising 
momentum.
 
From a regional perspective, growth was fairly stable across the board this 
quarter. Asia continues to be our fastest growing region, Southern Europe 
remains stable despite the continued economic woes in the region. Auto has 
be
en a strong sector for us globally and the cold spring in the U.K. has lead 
to stronger growth in the retail sector there.
 
Our shopping business continues to expand with over 1 billion products 
listed. This quarter, we rolled out product listing ads in Eur
ope and also 
brought them to mobile devices. I want to mention our policy efforts that 
ensure that we're working with only the highest quality partners, which 
Patrick has already alluded to. We want to make sure we protect users from 
having bad experiences
 

tightened our policies and enforcement in few areas like downloadable 
software applications. While these steps may impact network revenue in the 
short
-
term, they're essential in the long
-
term for a better, safer
 
web 
experience for users and to encourage brands to invest more in online 
marketing and in our network. We strongly believe what we've done benefits 
us in the long
-
term.
 
Shifting gears to our Enterprise business, the Enterprise business continues 
to exper
ience strong growth, across pretty much all products, regions and 
industries. While our SMB segment is growing steadily, we're seeing 
significant increase from large global organizations, in fact 58% of the 
Fortune 500 are now actively using abate enterpri
se cloud product from 
Google.
 
Recent wins include ANA from Japan, the largest airline, Woolworths with 

Places and Street View in their ultimate driving machines and the Country of 
Ma
laysia, they are adopting Google Apps for 10 million students, teachers 
and parents. They are going to deploy Chromebooks to primary and 
secondary schools nationwide.
 
Moving on to our marketing efforts, our marketing team continues to 
execute flawlessly. T
hey have helped Chromebooks increase their footprint 
in the U.S. expanding to more than 1,000 Best Buy stores nationwide, which 
pretty much doubles the previous number of stores we had. The Samsung 
Chromebook has been the top selling laptop in Amazon since
 
it launched. We 
have rolled out Nexus 4 in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and expanded 
in the U.S. to 3,000 T
-
Mobile stores.
 
I want to focus the rest of my remarks on two continuing trends that present 
great opportunities for us. First, the shift to c
onsumers to a multi
-
screen 
lifestyle and second, the ongoing movement of brand dollars online.
 
As Larry has said, consumers are accessing content interchangeably on 
many screens throughout the day. Our clients are hungry to advertise where 
consumers are. I
n fact, 95% of our clients have campaigns that run across 
multiple screens.
 
In February, working with Susan and Sridhar
 
team we rolled out enhanced 
campaigns to make it easier for clients to manage and measure campaigns 
that reach people across devices. Ma
rket dealers will be able to deliver ads 

proximity bidding. And they will be able to do a better job of measuring 
mobile conversions.
 
Enhanced campaigns is an important long
-
term bet that will help market 

invested tremendous amounts of time and effort into making the transition 
as smooth as possible. In the first 
two month since launch, more than 1.5 
million campaigns have already been upgraded to enhanced campaigns. And 
these clients are beginning to see great results.
 
We expect to migrate all campaigns that we manage by the end of the 
current quarter. While this 

focus on flawless execution on behalf of our customers. Now on to brands, 

launch of the air, the Pathfinder featured 13 video ads
 
and a new approach 
to remarketing AdWords of video.
 
Nissan connected their stories of making sure that users who watch their 
videos were shown a new one each time. Newer brand
-
friendly formats like 
our expandable Lifebox ads, our Reserve inventory solutio
n are helping 
clients create beautiful experience with sight, sound, and motion. Over the 
past year, the number of advertisers using our Google Display Network 
Reserve option has increased four
-
fold.
 
Now, we have two
-
thirds of the top 100 Ad Age brands usi
ng those products. 
This is really helpful in developing deep partnership with our clients 

with Adidas in Germany on the new global branding budget. Brands are also 
continuing to see 
the power of YouTube to help them reach consumers 
across the screens.
 
Today, more than a billion people are finding the channels they love on 
YouTube every month. Users are now watching over 50 million more hours a 
day compared to a year ago of 50% increas
e.
 
We had a record year for our Super Bowl Ad Blitz program views, votes, 
watch time and advertiser participation were all up from last year. We saw 
increased engagement across all screens. We had 1.3 million total hours of 
watch time of commercials on Ad 

325,000 Super Bowls. More brands are also using YouTube as a strategic 
part of their campaign to reach the younger generation.
 
For example, Chevrolet built awareness of the Chevy Sonic, but made for 
digital videos 
supported by YouTube and Google Ads, all contributing to 
successful launch of this all
-
new sub
-
compact car.
 
Our work in brands also helps our publisher partners, our Ad Exchange 
supports all formats, all screens, and hundreds of publishers and continuing 
t
o grow well. We are offering new solutions for publishers like Google 
Consumer Surveys and Google Play to help them make money from their 
content.
 
In conclusion, I want to thank all Googlers who helped deliver a great 
quarter into our business. This indust
ry is moving very fast and the 

hardworking employees to help drive Google and our partners in the future. 
With that, thank you Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 



 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Absolutely, thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from 
Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
 
Mark Mahaney 

 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay, two questions please. First, Patrick, you mentioned this accounting 
change that I 

 
could you just give us a little bit more detail on what that 
accounting change was versus Play? And then could you talk about 
the TAC 

moving in different directions on your own sites, continuing to rise pretty 
dramatically, but on your network partner sites, falling off pretty 
significantly. Can you just help 
us think about what that should look like 
going forward for both of those segments? Thanks a lot.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

apps revenue recognition policy, let me explain what happened t
here, and 


 
and the way we did it 
is, we changed the revenue recognition. So if you say, you buy an app for $1 
on the PlayStore, $0.70 of that dollar will be paid to the developer and does 
not impact on
 

changed.
 
In the past though, we would have booked the remaining $0.30 on a net of 
payments to carriers and OEM and then booked that as gross revenue. 
Beginning in Q1, however, the entire $0.
30 is now booked as gross and the 
payments for the carriers and the OEMs are now booked on other cost of 

reason why we did this is as part, we were looking to the second half of 
2012, we
 
were seeing these used to be kind of immaterial numbers for us. 
And then when we saw through the second half of 2012, we decided to kind 



on gross and then as I said on other cost of revenue and then you get the 
net. So on a net basis, it doesn't change.
 

right? If TAC is dropped overall, 
because of the change in our ad policies 

of our ad policies to the benefit of the user, the impact of that is actually 
that it lowered our network revenue, but it also lowered our TAC,
 
which is 
tied to AdSense partners in that role.
 
On Google sites, you have noticed that it continues to grow, and it grows 
because of mobile growth. So the volume of mobile in our mix is driving TAC 
to go up. So, overall TAC is down for the quarter as an a
ggregate basis. The 
ad policy changes have driven them down and then our mobile for our own 


Thanks for 

But I hope that clarifies the point. Thank you, Mark. Sean, to our next 
question please?
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go 
ahead with your questi
on.
 
Ben Schachter 

 
Macquarie Capital Inc.
 
Larry, in your prepared comments, you spent quite a bit of time discussing 
the non
-
core future products. I wonder if you could talk about any changes 
to the amount of resources being invested in Google X and these
 
products? 
And also, can you tell us how you determine the appropriate size of the 
investments in these various teams and products? And then just quickly 
separately, Knowledge Graph, just in general if you can give us an update on 
the progress and sort of 
how you measure that progress internally? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Yeah, thanks, Ben for the questions. I feel like every time I say anything I 
get this question. I think honestly my job as CEO is to get people to do those 
things. If you look at most companies, 
they will never do anything different 



get people 
to do those things.
 
So, we have nothing to say differently about our general philosophy of 80% 


m

able to and as they show success.
 
As an investor, I am 

 





happens in the technology industries.
 

ogress there, 

improving the kind of questions we can answer as I mentioned about 
weather and other things that happens from improvements to our 

bout that. And I think we still have 
big investments there and you still for a long time will continue to see 
improved products there. So can we have our next question?
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please go 
ahead
 
with your question.
 
Anthony DiClemente 

 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 

could give us your thoughts on the impact of Facebook Home for Android 
just given some have talked about the possible
 
impact on engagement with 
other Android apps. And then secondly, and I guess this would be for anyone 
who wants to take it, I think investors are just wondering about Enhanced 
Campaigns that you talked about launching in February. should we expect 
any sor
t of bumpiness or any sort of near
-
term dislocation from your 
advertisers who are starting to become accustomed to Enhanced Campaigns, 
on boarding to that platform with the understanding in the long
-
term 
opportunity of course? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Thanks, An

second one to Nikesh. I think that Google is really focused on building and 
creating great Android experiences within the strong ecosystem that we 

 
really focused on and building 



 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah, thank you, Anthony. As 
Larry just said that, it was very complicated. 
We had to train a sales force around the world and to launch simultaneously 

advertisers is, it is positive, because it basically takes
 
away a lot of work 

enhanced campaigns. we also have some great suggestions from our 


ping that towards the end of this quarter, 
we should have migrated all of the campaigns, which are done separately as 
mobile and separately the desktop as combined and really offer them the

Thank you. My question just is the mobile impact on the business, it looks 
like your top line revenues have somewhat stabilized. But how is the 
transition to mob
ile impacting your kind of high level revenue growth over a 
period of quarters and also your margins, maybe you could give us a little 
help on that? And then maybe, Larry, could you address the concern that 
constantly comes up about people using apps versu
s a Google Search, 

at or above the industry, but are you seeing any pressure from app usage 
versus search usage on mobile? Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Yeah, thank you, Justin. I think, ma

first. You know we always get this question about other apps versus Google 
Search. I think, I am not super concerned about that issue. I think that 
people use lots of apps on the web over many strong sites and so on
. So 

search is an amazing thing for publishers and software developers and 
everybody else and we deliver a lot of traffic and lot of users to things and 
so, I think in general the in

hard to make sure that the user experience is great and that we are 
delivering people into the right places. So I think I feel pretty confident on 
that 

 

the second half 
of your question?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
The first part of the question was about top line Mobile versus other impacts 
on the business and margins. Let me just jump in on this one quickly, and 

he multi

mean, Larry talked about this at length at the last earnings call where the 


are
 
you giving the best answer all the time following me throughout my day.
 


answer at the right time for you
 
to during your day. So I think that rather 
than to ask if you know which small piece part is going to kind of contribute 
plus or minus, the real question is are we growing the pie of your day with 
Google and in the long
-
term are we really kind of contribu
ting to create the 


 
So I think that this trend really presents to us enormous opportunities and 

 
what do you 

way to ask the question. The real right way is the excitement we have about

pie grows fo

Thank you for taking my question. I have two. First on Google Fiber, taking 
aside the user experience for those who get it. How do yo
u expect Fiber to 
have major impact given that you take many billions and several years to 
pass, something like 20 million U.S. homes, and after all of that, time and 
money, you would be at best and mid
-
sized provider in a market that 
accounts for less tha
n half of your current business.
 
Secondly, on the future of Search, Larry you mentioned voice commands in 
your opening remarks. We already get voice output with Jellybean. Put this 
together with Google Now and Knowledge Graph and we see our future 
where yo
u'll get the answer to your question sometimes before you ask it. 
How do ads come into this view? How do you generate revenues in the world 
like this where you guys seem to be going to? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Why don't I jump on the first question and
 
I'll let Larry answer the second 
one. Look, on Fiber, I think it's really simple. It's very early days. We're 
totally excited about delivering a great user experience with faster than 
Internet speed. And Gigabit as Larry said with Sergey's kind of quest a
 
few 
years ago, Gigabit speed over hundred times faster than the average 
American. I mean, that is a great user experience and it's really about 
pushing for speed and writing the new chapter, the next chapter of the 
Internet. So for us I think we really ar
e excited about this and that's really 
where we're focused on. On the second question, I'll let Larry give his 
comments.
 
Larry Page
 
I'm glad you're very ambitious too, because Fiber industry is not big enough 
for you so I applaud that. I think, we would lo
ve to find businesses much 
bigger than our entire current business to invest in, but I think there's only a 
very small number of such companies that even exist. So I think, we look at 
places where we can provide a lot of 

 
on Fiber we look at places where 
we 
can provide products that can make really big difference in peoples' lives and 
we can make a lot of money and resources doing it. And I think it certainly 
meets that criteria, although as Patrick said, it's very early days. On the 
voice pass and knowing
 
what people want before they ask for it and how do 
we make ads on that, how do we make revenue and ads on network.
 


ssfully 
doing advertising is we feel that is another source of information, seeing all 
the search ads that we show has to be very relevant and make sensitive at 
that moment. And the more 

 
the better job we can do in providing you 
information even with [wi

also provide commercial information to you that people are excited about 

are all about making things more efficient, marketing th
e right information 

the kind of world that you are talking about. All right, can we have our next

Hi, thanks. I had two please; the first one for Nikesh. You recently discussed 
the opportunity for online advertising to exceed 50% of total advertising in 
the next five years and
 
you referenced video and Internet connected 

talk about that in a little more depth and the way Google products actually 
service catalyst for that change?
 
And then secondly for L
arry, could you just discuss the transition in Android 
management and what exactly Andy Rubin is going to be doing now that he 
has a new role? Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Okay, Nikesh, you want to take the first one?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Sure. Scott, thanks for your que
stion. I think what I was referring to was the 
fact that I believe in the next few years, we will see connected TVs 

happen, I think the products we have in place, where we can dynam
ically 
serve ads, which are more personalized, which look more like information on 
display platforms or video platforms is going to be very relevant.
 
So I think over time the television industry shifts to a more addressable, 
more personalized, more IP addr

well positioned in that space given our large focus and emphasis on brand, 

video and really getting our sales force working really well w
ith various 
brand advertisers around the world. So, we are preparing for that 
eventuality and we hope it comes sooner than later.

Okay, thanks for taking the questions. Just want to ask two things. Nikesh, 
you talked about Southern Europe be
ing stable in terms of macro. Just 
curious, since over the last three months if you have seen any changes at all 
in macro across the U.S. or Europe? And then secondly, Patrick, if you could 
just talk about how you think about the longer
-
term margins on the
 
Google 
segment, that would be helpful. Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
I think Nikesh seems to spend a lot of time in Europe due to the nice 
weather there.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Nice weather just be more recently, Larry, Q1 was pretty dismal, but 

 
from 
a weather perspective. 
Douglas, thanks for the question. I think, as I said, 
Southern Europe has been stable, because there has been concern at the 
macro level in Southern Europe, but our business has been stable. I think 
the macro conditions have been going on for a while. As f
ar as the U.S. and 
Europe, I don't think there was anything out of the ordinary that we saw as 
it relate to our business results, and our teams continue to execute and we 
continue to engage with advertisers across the board, large and small, and 
we haven't
 
seen any shift in those trends.
 
Larry Page
 
Let me jump on the second part of the question. Look I 

 



nesses. So 
regarding margin, for us what really matters is every incremental profit 

dollars rather than the specific of the average aggregate margin.
 
So if you have business for us,
 
that can be a $20 billion business that has a 
much lower margin than ours, but kind of contribute a couple of billion for 


e, in addition to our 
core business, right, exploring and by the way, they have a great symbiotic 
relationship, right.
 
When you have devices that are kind of magical and that kind of feed within 

lationship as well 
that kind of continues to enhance our offering. So the real trick there is to 
keep focused on dollar margin pools, dollar margin in revenue and then not 

for the shar
eholders.

We shall say, of course, we always look for businesses that are very high

Hi, great. I just had a couple of questions. One, I was just wondering if you 
could talk a little bit about what you guys can do to help prevent Android 
fragmentation if you could kind of give
 
us your views there. And then on 
Fiber, I had a follow
-
up, if maybe you could go beyond the obvious, which is 

to. If you could maybe help us think about the types of services or
 
offering 
that you guys see as being possible as this becomes more broadly deployed.
 
And then lastly, especially given your prior comments on capital light, I was 
just wondering how we should think about your appetite for CapEx for Fiber. 
Thank you.
 
Larry 
Page
 
Yeah, thanks, Heather. I guess I can talk a little bit about the Android in the 

bunch of different Android phones from different manufacturers. The 
experiences are a bit differe
nt. The return, the menu back button is on 

somewhat fragmented. But beyond that, we had a pretty great overall 

ng 

 


 
then the negatives on such fragmentation and the 
positives on such innovation and flexibility for the different users of the 

l. And we 
obviously evolve the ecosystem and make sure 

 
making sure that user got 
a really great experience and making sure, paying attention to the lab and 

job. I think on Fiber,
 
you had some questions on Fiber, I think Patrick can 
address that.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

about today. Speed matters today, right? When you wait for three seconds 
to get to a YouTu
be video today with your current provider, right? That is a 
terrible answer. And we think that Fiber and the services we offer in Kansas 
City today actually can go 

 

frustrations independent of tomorrows.
 
In addi
tion to that, our Kansas City offer that we have, right, is already quite 
differentiated in offering kind of an amazing service, for example, with 
storage with 2 terabytes of storage available and another in the cloud that 
really kind of not only is about 

you should have abundance. And with abundance, then the third piece which 
is kind of I think where you were going is the excitement of what the 
developer community can actually create for a world that is in fact, 
at 
blazing speed and with an abundant of storage.
 

differentiated and it is just laying the path for what should be the next 
change of the Internet. And I think that you see it in 
Kansas City with so 
many developers moving to Kansas City to actually kind of create this 
coming world, just gives you a glimpse of all the opportunities that are out

Stephen Ju

Thanks very much. So Larry, can you give us some sense of how much 

new form factors like Glass, and I guess, Watch, as we look out over the 
next three to five years? And ho
w transportable is Android across these form 
factors and in terms of getting OEMs and other operators beyond just the 
smartphones and tablets to adopt that. And, Nikesh, thanks for a number of 
campaigns on the enhanced campaigns platform. Now wondering lik
e what 
percent of your advertisers do you think have optimized their sites for 

greater ability for attribution across mobile and desktop? Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
I think, Steve, there 
is a lot of questions, I think we got (most of them) 

Glass and so on and watches and things, I think that computers are now 

ng as it gets more 
and more useful. And so the amount of time, you only have 24 hours in a 
day, so there is some limit to that. But I think more importantly, the 
usefulness of your engagement is going to increase. So right now, while you 
are just kind of u
sing your computer or your phone or your tablet or 
whatever and you are kind of bored, maybe you will be less bored and more 
productive or enjoy what you are doing more and seeing more meaningful 
engagements. And I think that can result in much better busi
ness results 
and happier people and all that.
 

across devices, and I think that will continue. I think, Nikesh, do you want to 
address the enhanced campaigns a little bit?
 
Nikesh Aro
ra
 

note is before we launched our enhanced campaigns journey in February, we 
have been very actively working for the last year plus on our grow more 
campaign, which is grow more, beca
use clearly, the first part of anybody 
leveraging the mobile websites just to have one. So we spent a lot of time 
working with our advertisers and partners out there both to get them online 
and also to get them mobile. And I think the enhanced campaigns wi
th them 
was a logical step beyond that. Once you have mobile capability, once you 
have mobile sites and desktops, we want to make sure that you can get best 

the journey. we have
 
a significant number of our early adopters on to 
enhanced campaigns and as I said, we intend to get them all migrated in the 
next few months, another next 10 weeks actually. So should be pretty good.
 
in terms of future, I think we also alluded to the 
fact that some of the things 

about first getting them to leverage, their current capabilities, but then also 
giving more context and more location, which hopefully generates mor
e ROI 
in the future.

Great, thanks for squeezing me in. Larry, could you talk a little bit about 
online/mobile to offline attribution and what Google is doing to help kind of 
bridge that gap and to help our advertisers realize R
OI? And then, Nikesh, 
can you just give us an update as to how far you are through the apps 
changes policy with your network partners? Is that pretty much all done now 
or is there more to go there? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Thanks, Neil, for your question. I thin
k maybe Nikesh, who is the expert on 
both these. I think our business has always been about attributing 
advertising spending and results accurately. And the whole success of our 
company is really based on that one thing. So we are paying a lot of 
attention
 
to those kind of questions. So, Nikesh, take it away.
 
Nikesh Arora
 

the important part is, we have been working, we have hundreds of studies 
now working with our advertisers to actu
ally look at both the offline and 
online impacts? And one of the recent things we did is, online to store as we 
have helped people understand how their online campaigns are driving more 
and more people into store, which is most of an online activity. We al
so look 
at the entire customer journey. We look at across media effectiveness to 
show how you can run a campaign in the off
-
line world, how you can add 
online to it and what kind of attribution that gets you in all off
-
line media as 
well as online media.
 
S
o we do a bunch of stuff like that. So our research teams are working with 
external research organizations. So I think we have a reasonably robust 
practice there working with our advertisers. And in terms of the update, in 
terms of the ads policy changes, 
we have implemented all of our ads 
policies. We obviously have worked with almost all of our network partners. 
They understand our policies. Many of them have made changes. I think we 
should be done with most of the transition, but of course, the effect of
 
this 
policy change will continue to happen throughout the rest of the year.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. Fourth Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like 
to turn the call over to Ms. Willa Lo, Investor Relations Manager. Please go 
ahead, 
ma'am.
 
Willa Lo
 
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's fourth quarter 2011 
earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; 
Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Susan 
Wojcicki, Senior Vice
 
President, Advertising; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice 
President and Chief Business Officer. Also, as you know, we now distribute 
our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at 
investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for

releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany this call. This 
call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will 
be available on our website in a few hours.
 
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. S
ome of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking, including statements 
regarding Google's future investments, our long
-
term growth and 
innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level 
of capital expendit
ures. These statements involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note 
that these forward
-
looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the 
date of this presentation, and we undertake no ob
ligation to revise or 
publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward
-
looking 
statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our 
SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect 
our re
sults. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this 
call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a 
non
-
GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock
-
based compensation. We have also adjust
ed our net cash provided by 
operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer as free 
cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP to GAAP 
measures can be found in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn 
the call
 
over to Larry.
 
Larry Page
 
Good afternoon, everyone, and happy new year. Welcome to our first 
earnings call of 2012. Great to have all of you here.
 
I'm very happy with our results. Google had a very strong quarter with 
revenues up 25% year
-
on
-
year, 9% quar
ter
-
on
-
quarter, and we blew past 
the $10 billion mark for the first time. Pretty exciting.
 
Looking back on 2011, I am most excited by the fact that we significantly 
improved our velocity and execution, my priority when I became CEO in 
April. With Google+, 
we shipped on average a new feature every day since 
we launched in June. That's more than 200 updates in total. And those 
things include a bunch of new Hangout features. In fact, David Beckham just 
did a great Hangout with his fans here this morning. We la
unched circles in 
Gmail and + Pages for businesses and many, many other things.
 
I'm also pleased to announce that there are over 90 million Google+ users, 
well over double what I announced just a quarter ago on our earnings call. 
Engagement on + is also gr
owing tremendously. I have some amazing data 
to share there for the first time. + users are very engaged with our 
products. Over 60% of them engage daily and over 80% weekly.
 
As I said last quarter, Google+ is much more than the individual features 
themsel
ves. It's also about building a meaningful relationship with users so 
that we can dramatically improve the services we offer. Understanding who 
people are, what they care about and the other people that matter to them 
is crucial if we are to give users wha
t they need, when they need it.
 
Take last week's Search announcement, which I'm really excited about. 
We've now included personal results in Search. So you can easily find 
information like photos and + posts that are super relevant to you, as well 
as the p
eople you care about or are interested in. You can even restrict all 
personal results or easily view Google in the world mode just as you would 
have before. I really like it, and I encourage all of you to try it out, too.
 
Each of improved execution and vel
ocity is focus. There are so many 
opportunities for Google today. But to make a real impact in the world, we 
need to make hard choices about where to focus our efforts.
 
Since we last spoke, we've announced that we're closing 12 of our products, 
including B
uzz, Knol and Friend Connect, integrating a whole bunch of others 
into features of existing products. This means that we can double down on 
the really big bets we had made like Android, Chrome, Gmail, Display and 
YouTube. And I'm pleased to say this big be
ts are really paying off. We're 
seeing extraordinary velocity, the kind of velocity we only we can dream 
about. Android is, quite simply, mind
-
boggling. 700,000 phones are lit up 
every day. And I'm pleased to announce 250 million Android devices in total, 
up 50 million since our last announcement just in November. In just 2 days 
over the holiday weekend, 3.7 million Androids were activated. And today, 
we're announcing over 11 billion downloads from Android markets. Wow. Ice 
Cream Sandwich, which is the new 
Android release in October, is by far our 
best build yet. And our exciting new phones. I simply love my Galaxy Nexus. 
Superfast, it's great for photos, has an amazing 720p screen.
 
Chrome is on fire, too. It's a wonderful example of kind of beautifully simp
le, 
intuitive experience that really improves users' lives. People thought we 
were crazy. Who wants another browser? It turns out a lot of people wanted 
to get to web quickly and securely, and we've got an amazing, fast
-
growing 
fan base all around the worl
d.
 
From the start, Gmail had security, accessibility. Get all your emails from 
anywhere on any device. An insane storage. That made it a winner with 
consumers, businesses and education. From an internal beta project 8 years 
ago, I'm proud to tell you today
 
that Google Gmail now has more than 350 
million active users, and it's growing rapidly. That [indiscernible] said, our 
merging high
-
use project 
--
 
products can generate huge new businesses for 
Google in the long run, just like Search, and we have a ton of
 
experience 
monetizing those old [ph] products over time. Take Display. We brought the 
science of search to the art of the Display, creating a business that our latest 
figures show has now reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion.
 
I have some exci
ting new numbers also for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, 
spending is up over 130% year
-
on
-
year, and the number of buyers and 
sellers have both more than doubled over the same period. I'm very pleased 
with the advertising on YouTube. TrueView gives users much
 
more choice 
over what they watch, and advertisers only pay when someone watches 
their ad.
 
It's not just in advertising that we're doing well. Enterprise is doing great 
with over 5,000 new customers signing up every day. In fact, last week, we 
signed our b
iggest ever deal, about 110,000 users at BBDA, one of the 
world's leading banks. All of our experience says that well
-
run technology 
businesses with tremendous consumer research, make a lot of money over 
the long term.
 
Now all of this is made possible by t
he exceptional people that work here. 
I've always believed that you attract the best talent by working on things 
that matter in the world and creating a great workplace environment. People 
want to feel part of the family even when they're at work. So I'm s
uper 
pleased that Google topped Fortune 2012's Best Company to Work For list, 
which was published today. We've taken the #1 spot 3 times now, more 
than any other company. I want to thank everyone at Google for all their 
hard work that has made this possibl
e.
 
Let me finish up by saying that 2012 promises to be a fantastic year. We're 
still at the very, very early stages of what technology can do. By building a 
meaningful relationship with users, we can start to offer them, just what 
they need, exactly when t
hey want it. Everyone here at Google is super 
excited about our work today and what the future holds. It's great to be 
here. Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and I'll now hand over 
to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you very much, Larry, and
 
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you 
for joining us again. Like Larry, I'm also very happy with our results. Google 
had a strong, a really strong quarter, in fact, with revenues up 25% year
-
over
-
year, crowning a year of disciplined investment, strong g
rowth and 
actually great operational and financial performance.
 
Let me go through these financial results, then I'll turn it over to Nikesh and 
Susan for more commentary on our operating performance. So let's jump 
right in.
 
Our gross revenue grew 25% year
-
over
-
year to $10.6 billion, 9% quarter
-
over
-
quarter growth. By the way, it's worth noting that although currency 
rates had an immaterial impact year
-
over
-
year, they, in fact, had a negative 
impact on revenue quarter
-
over
-
quarter. In fact, if we applied las
t quarter's 
exchange rates to our Q4 revenue, these would have been roughly $240 
million higher. So FX is a key component here. Google website revenue was 
up, in fact just shy of 30% year
-
over
-
year to $7.3 billion and 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter with strength 
across most major geographies and verticals. Our 
Google Network revenue was up 15% year
-
over
-
year to $2.9 billion and 
11% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. It's important to note here that the Network 
revenue was again negatively impacted by the search quality improve
ments 
we made early last year, and also that the momentum in our Display 
business continues, something that Susan will talk about in a few minutes. 
Our other revenue was up 50% year
-
over
-
year to $410 million and 6% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our global aggregat
e paid click growth was very 
strong, up 34% year
-
over
-
year and 17% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our 
aggregate cost of click growth was down 8% year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number, which 
includes both google.com
 
and our AdSense properties. On this, it's important 
to look at CPCs and clicks together. There are numbers of factors that affect 
each, again something that Susan will address in the next few minutes.
 
If we turn to our geographic performance, the U.S., U.
K. and rest of worlds 
all were growing at strong pace, reflecting in our result. In our earnings 
slides, which you can find in our Investor website 
--
 
Relations website, you'll 
see we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show 
the i
mpact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please 
refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 22% year
-
over
-
year to $5 billion. Our non
-
U.S. revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue, or $5.6 billion,
 
up 
28% year
-
over
-
year, which includes a modest $25 million benefit from our 
hedgings program. The U.K. was up 21% year
-
over
-
year to $1.1 billion.
 
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 
24.1% of total advertising revenu
e. Other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, 
excluding stock
-
based compensation of $77 million. And finally, operating 
expenses, which excludes stock
-
based compensation, totaled $2.9 billion. 
Our stock
-
based compensation totaled $459 million, and the increas
e year
-
over
-
year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and 
promotional spend and legal and professional services. As a result of all this, 
our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q4, resulting in a non
-
GAAP 
operating margin of
 
38.2%, a strong margin performance that gives us the 
confidence to continue to fully fund our strategic growth areas in Search, 
Display, Mobile and apps.
 
If we turn to headcount, it was up approximately 1,100 for the quarter, and 
we ended the year roughly
 
at 32,500 full
-
time employees. Our effective tax 
rate was 22% in Q4, and this reflects the mix of earnings between our 
domestic and international subsidiaries, but also an impairment charge for 
Clearwire, which is not [ph] deductible for tax purposes.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. In other income and expenses, our 
line was minus 18, which is a large negative variance, in fact over $300 
million quarter
-
over
-
quarter. This reflects a couple of things. First is the 
impact of our significant FAS 133 ex
pense from hedging program, which 
accelerated the expense of our portfolio this quarter now that this portfolio is 
much deeper in the money. In addition, as I mentioned, we took an 
impairment charge for Clearwire. And so for more details on our OI&E, which
 
changed quite a bit this quarter, again please refer to the slides that 
accompany this call on our IR website.
 
Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.9 billion, just shy of $4 
billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $951 million versus last quarter 
at 
$680 million, and remember that the majority of our CapEx spend was 
related to facilities and production equipment. And as a reminder, I wish to 
continue to make 
--
 
we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments, 
and these have shown to be lumpy f
rom quarter to quarter depending on 
when we're able to make these investments. In consequence, we're very 
pleased with our free cash flow, which was $3 billion.
 
So in summary, with such a strong performance, we continue to be 
optimistic about investing in 
our growth agenda. Let me now hand it off to 
Nikesh, who'll cover more of the details of our sales performance for the 
quarter. Nikesh?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. I will now provide an update on our business activities. 
We've had an excellent quarter
, good growth over the holiday season. 
Robust [indiscernible] growth on Black Friday and Cyber Monday has led to 
strong performance across our product portfolio and $10.6 billion in revenue 
this quarter. Let me talk first about how our sales team have driv
en the 
introduction of innovative ad products that delivered impressive results for 
our advertising customers and outline performance by region. And finally, a 
few highlights from our marketing and partnerships teams.
 
First in Search. Our core desktop Sear
ch maintained robust growth as we 
continue to help our customers grow their businesses. Beyond our robust 
core growth supporting online sales, we're increasingly helping our 
advertisers to use Search for branding, as well as something interesting, 
which is
 
driving in
-
store sales for them. For instance, by using the power of 
data insights, we collaborated Carrefour in France to analyze over 2 years' 
worth of data demonstrate how 1 euro invested in online ads helps deliver 
almost EUR 8 of in
-
store sales. We e
xpect to promote these kinds of 
programs further in the coming quarters. Additionally, we saw similar 
success in the study with SFR mobile, France's second largest mobile carrier, 
where we demonstrated a 20% marketing ROI for off
-
line sales resulting 
from 
online advertising. So our Search business continues to be strong.
 
Let's move on to Display. As Larry mentioned, we're continuing to see great 
revenue growth. Our investments have really paid off in the last few years. 
Display has now reached an annualized
 
run rate of over $5 billion as we 
engage with multiple advertisers and get tremendous support from our 
agency partners. What is particularly satisfying is how we're able to drive 
this growth as a consequence as of our continued investment in innovation 
wi
th products like Ad Exchange and new ad formats like TrueView. I'm sure 
Susan will talk a lot more about these. All these are resulting in more 
efficiency and in revenue for both of us and our publisher partners. On the 
sales side, we have continued to ali
gn our teams, now the combined Display 
and Search sales, to help meet the needs of our advertising partners. We 
continue to activate the Display ecosystem of agencies, advertisers and 
other publishers. Advertisers like Ford, GM, Electronic Arts, L'Oreal an
d their 
agencies continue to see the efficiency of online branding and move more 
and more of their marketing spend towards our products, to Google Display 
Network and YouTube. For example, at L'Oreal, we demonstrated that online 
advertising is far more eff
icient than television as our new formats in 
YouTube, which include TrueView in
-
stream, in
-
slate and in
-
search have 
provided significant reach for their branding campaigns with millions of 
impressions, great click
-
through and efficiency gains.
 
Let's move t
o Mobile. We had another record quarter for mobile advertising 
as mobile search continues to surge across all platforms. The number of our 
clients who are using mobile within their campaigns continues to grow 
rapidly. For example, Mali [ph] Hotels of Spain
 
with 350 hotels in 35 
countries, they use mobile search campaigns to support their mobile e
-
commerce activities. As a result, Mali [ph] has experienced a 60% increase 
in visitors for mobile devices, and their mobile
-
driven bookings have 
multiplied by 12 i
n 2011.
 
We also worked hard to develop the Mobile ecosystem. This quarter, we 
kicked out 
--
 
kicked off the go mobile campaign in the city of Mobile, 
Alabama, where we helped hundreds of customers build their mobile sites 
for free, starting a program that w
ill inspire, educate and empower 
businesses to continue to go mobile.
 
Let's move to Enterprise. As Larry mentioned, we are seeing great traction in 
our Enterprise business, both with large partners, who tend to be early 
adopters and future looking, and in 
many small businesses who see Google 
Apps as a comprehensive and quick solution. We now have more than 5,000 
customers signing up to Google Apps every day. As Larry mentioned, BBDA 
was the first major bank to go Google with Apps. Costco, one of the world's
 
largest retailers, has also gone Google. In addition, in Q4, we signed 
government deals with the states of Maryland, Utah and 5 top universities, 
including Berkeley, Harvard and Michigan.
 
Let's move quickly to country performance. From a regional perspect
ive, we 
continue to see strong performance in the Americas. However, generally, 
country growth rates are flat or softened slightly partly due to comparisons 
with a very strong Q4 in 2010. North America saw slight decreases from 
preceding quarters. Year
-
to
-
year growth rates, however, [indiscernible] 
remained robust boosted by a strong holiday season. In particular, Cyber 
Monday led the way as the biggest day of the quarter. Western Europe was 
broadly stable as the U.K., France and Italy held steady, while Sp
ain 
accelerated slightly for the third quarter in a row. However, revenue growth 
in Germany slowed this quarter. Our key emerging countries continued to 
see rapid growth across all of our product areas.
 
Let me switch gears to marketing and partnerships. Ou
r marketing and 
partnerships programs continue to provide strong foundations for the growth 
of our business. You may have seen many of our initiatives on Google+ this 
quarter, in addition to the Hangout with David Beckham Larry mentioned. 
Our sales teams h
ave helped our customers create over 1 million Google+ 
pages, as Larry pointed out, including Global brands such as Toyota, Zaphos 
and The New York Times. Additionally, we continued the momentum of our 
Get Your Business Online program. In 2011, this progra
m has helped bring 
hundreds of thousands of businesses online across the world. And we got 
100,000 businesses to come online in 20 countries in Q4 alone. Last quarter, 
we expanded internationally to India, Sweden and Malaysia, as well as 
domestically to ad
ditional states like Michigan and New York.
 
Our partnership team continues to drive great results with our partners. We 
renewed 35 of our direct search partner deals, and our long
-
standing Search 
distributor deal with Mozilla was renewed as well. These and
 
other efforts 
helped our syndicated Search revenues accelerate in Q4 as we saw the full 
impact of large deals and fast growth of 3 partners.
 
In closing, Q4 was a great quarter for us, finishing a strong 2011. We're 
excited to continue serving our customer
s, partners and users in 2012. And 
before I hand over to Susan, I want to give a shout
-
out to our business 
teams around the world and our partners in product and engineering for 
these great results. I will now turn over to Susan, who will discuss product 
p
erformance this quarter. Thank you.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
Thanks, Nikesh. Larry mentioned last week's launch of Search, plus Your 
World. And I'd like to start by talking about that a bit more.
 
Google Search has always been about finding the best results among 
billions 
of web pages. And until now, those results have been limited to the public 
world of the Internet. What we added last week was the ability to search 
your own world, including Google+ post photos and profiles relevant to you, 
all from the same searc
h box.
 
Let me give you a few examples of how this transformed my searches. Last 
week, I searched on CES, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, to 
find out more details about the show. In addition to the public results, my 
search magically included pi
ctures my friends and colleagues had taken 
while at the show, as well as products they thought were interesting to 
share. In addition to seeing all the standard news for CES, I was able to get 
a much more personalized view of the show. This weekend, I also
 
searched 
on Yosemite since I was thinking about our summer plans. In my results, I 
was able to see pictures my friends had taken while in Yosemite and posts 
about interesting things to do there. There was even an article from my 
mom that she had shared wi
th my family circle, warning us not to get too 
close to the waterfalls.
 
Turning now to ads. We continue to improve ads quality, and we launched 
about 20 improvements this quarter. Patrick mentioned that paid click 
growth was very strong this quarter and th
at CPC has declined. It's 
important to look at clicks and CPC metrics together since more clicks can 
often lead to decreases in average CPC and vice versa. When we make ads 
quality or format changes, CPC and paid clicks may be impacted differently. 
For exa
mple, when we introduced sitelinks, we saw an increase in clicks. But 
the additional clicks were on lower
-
CPC ads, which reduced the average CPC. 
Many of the ads quality changes in Q3 increased paid clicks at lower CPCs, 
and they were revenue positive with
 
good user and good advertiser metrics. 
These ad quality changes from Q3 had a cumulative effect on Q4 metrics. 
Another important and key driver of the change in CPC growth was foreign 
exchange. And lastly, there are mix effects with Mobile and emerging 
ma
rkets.
 
Moving on to new ad formats. These new formats now appear on about 30% 
of queries that show ads. Product Listing Ads, which include prices and 
pictures of products, saw a lot of success over the holiday season. Traffic to 
consumer sites from Product
 
Listing Ads was up over 600% year
-
on
-
year. 
This quarter, we expanded Product Listing Ads so they can show up to 5 
products, which was great for holiday shopping. We are also working to 
make it more efficient for advertisers to use AdWords. Many businesses
 
have 
a large and dynamic catalog of products, and it can be time consuming for 
them to select the keywords and the CPCs for each product. So this quarter, 
we beta
-
launched Dynamic Search Ads, which generates the ads 
automatically based on what's on a cust
omer website. This enables 
businesses to advertise a lot more of their products, and our system can also 
monitor the advertiser's available inventory and show ads only for what is in 
stock. For small local businesses, we ramped up AdWords Express. This 
pro
duct lets businesses get up and running with a campaign in just a few 
minutes. Customer sign
-
ups have more than tripled in the past 6 months. 
We now offer AdWords Express in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France, and 
we are trialing it in several other countr
ies.
 
In Display, which now has reached a $5 billion annualized run rate, as Larry 
mentioned, we're creating a comprehensive solution to buy and sell display 
ads across many types of digital media, such as desktop, video and mobile. 
One key driver of growth
 
has been our success in audience buying. This 
technology enables marketers to deliver ads to specific audiences across the 
web, such as in
-
market hybrid car buyers or adventure travelers. Many 
audience buyers purchase via the Ad Exchange, which now has cu
stomers in 
26 countries and is growing very rapidly. We also expanded to video and 
mobile inventory on the Ad Exchange. And on the Google Display Network, 
we're also growing audience buying. From Q3 to Q4, the number of active 
advertisers using interest ca
tegory marketing increased over 60%. And that 
was from an already large base. By understanding users' interests, we've 
been able to serve much more relevant and useful ads to our users.
 
Our success in Display has also been driven by brand advertisers, with
 
video 
formats being an important factor. Our TrueView in
-
stream ads give users 
the option to skip the ads. This means that users who see the ads are more 
likely to be interested in those products, and advertisers are incented to 
create compelling ads. Vie
w rates range between 15% and 45%, and the 
people who choose to watch those ads are highly engaged. Over 60% of our 
in
-
stream ads are now skippable. It's an increase of over 4x since the 
beginning of the year. We now serve TrueView video ads across the Goo
gle 
Display Network and on YouTube Mobile.
 
I'd also like to give a quick update on Offers, which has been bringing online 
users to off
-
line stores and services. Offers are now live in over 30 cities, 
and we're starting to feature national offers from partn
ers like REI, JetBlue 
and Toys ""R"" Us. We expanded our collection of deals to include offers from 
partners so that users get a wider variety and partners get access to a 
broader user base.
 
And lastly, among the many launches that we did in the quarter, I'd
 
like to 
highlight one project we did called Memories for the Future. This site 
compares before and after Street View photographs of the areas affected by 
last year's tsunami in Japan. We drove thousands of miles so that future 
generations can see what hap
pened. Thanks all for your time. Now back to 
Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Susan. So what we'll do is we'll turn it over to Jamie to set up 
the Q&A session.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first 
question today from Brian 
Pitz with UBS.
 
Brian J. Pitz 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Maybe you could just give us a sense for mobile usage. Did you see a major 
shift in the mobile usage among the consumer during the holiday? And then 
I've got a 
quick follow
-
up.
 
Larry Page
 
This is Larry. Let me give that question to Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Look, we're seeing mobile usage grow with leap 
--
 
by leaps and bounds. It's 
happening by a proliferation of Android devices around the world. It's 
happening by a p
roliferation of tablets around the world. It's happening 
generally by people getting more and more active on their mobile devices as 
they discover the utility and the various apps that allow them to be able to 
go find things, whether they're local searches
, they're product searches or 
they're searches for generic things on Google. So yes, we are seeing 
tremendous mobile usage, and we saw 
--
 
seem to be an uptick during the 
holiday season where people were looking for products and searching for e
-
commerce
-
rel
ated activities during the holiday season.
 
Brian J. Pitz 
-
 
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
So just as a follow
-
up to that, so do you think that the reason for the 
significant decline in the CPC is 
--
 
the down 8%, is a function of the clicks 
going th
rough mobile more so? Or is it more some of the other factors that 
you explained to us? Because I'm just trying to get a sense for the down 8% 
CPC number was, I guess, significantly different than what we were 
expecting. And I understand the trade
-
off with
 
the clicks, but is mobile 
largely responsible for that?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I'm going to pass that question on to my friend Susan here who's going to 
talk about the CPC.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
So there are definitely multiple factors whenever we look at these metrics
 
because these metrics are aggregate. But I would say the 2 biggest factors 
this quarter were FX as well as the changes that we had made, their ad 
quality or format changes, which increased the paid clicks and again were 
revenue positive, advertiser positi
ve, user positive. But those clicks, as I 
explained, may be lower CPC like in the example that I gave in my script 
with sitelinks. So those were the 2 factors. But again, it's always important 
to remember there are many factors that contributed to these ag
gregate 
numbers.
 
Brian J. Pitz

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
Great. Just a quick housekeeping. Patrick, can you just qualify what's in that 
$5 billion Display run rate? Is that comparable to the $2.5 billion you 
provided before?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes, it is exactly the same definition. So you take out all the text ads, and 
then you look at both mobile and desktop. So you go back to the same 
definition.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang

Crédit Suisse AG,

Two quick questions. I guess first for Nikesh. It looks like international, 
excluding the U.K. revenue price load, the most kind of sequentially. I was 
wondering if the macro economy played at all a role? And if so, any sense of 
magnitude
 
there? And then secondly, for Susan, with respect to the $5 
billion Display run rate number, there's obviously a lot of stuff that goes in 
there between YouTube and Mobile and the ad network. I was wondering if 
you could just give us some maybe color of w
hat the blended TAC rate 
would be for that $5 billion.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So I'll take both questions, if you don't mind. So first, we will not 
--
 
we don't 
provide the TAC rate on the blended. And you're right that, I mean, if you 
think of the big properties
 
that are in there, right, so you will have the GDN, 

Display business, which includes the Teracents and then all of the other 
optimizers but also the AdMob on mobile. So that's the
 
kind of key elements 
of it. But we do not 
--
 
we don't kind of comment on the details of the 
blended TAC on them. On the economy, look, we had actually quite a solid 
Q4 performance, and we're really pleased of our revenue growth. I mean, 
even despite the F
X issues 
--
 
so you have to separate the FX issues from the 
economics fundamentals of our business. And performance in Europe was 
actually quite healthy despite the environment that we got there. And that's 
driven by the secular shifts of off
-
line to online
 
continues, and the secular 
shifts of more mobile continues. So from that perspective, right, obviously, 
we don't control the economy, we don't control exchange rates, but we're 
actually quite pleased with the performance that we've had internationally in 
addition to the U.K. and the U.S.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
I just wanted to ask about YouTube. I know that in that Display bucket. 
Could you quantify it at all
? Is the growth you're seeing out of YouTube 
similar to what you're seeing in the overall Display bucket? And specifically, 
are you seeing a sign that TV ad budgets specifically are migrating online 
into assets like YouTube? When you ask advertisers who ar
e spending more 
money in YouTube, where those dollars are coming from? Where are they 
coming from?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So let's do a 1
-
2 punch quickly. YouTube is doing absolutely terrific. And on 
the advertising side, Nikesh will probably be the better 
answer to give the 
details. Or Larry, whichever of the 2.
 
Larry Page
 

about our growth on YouTube. And the amount of success we're having in 
advertising there is very significant. But 
it's not significant compared to the 
overall kind of video advertising space. It's a tiny percentage of that. We 
have a huge amount to grow. But I don't think the advertisers are thinking 
about it as being a significant percentage of their other spend on v
ideo. So 
we don't really see that.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Benjamin A. Schachter

Macquarie Research
 
On Android, the numbers are obviously very, very strong. But can you talk 

nd Search? What has to happen 
with Android for you to actually make money on this? And how are you going 
to do it? And then secondly, the revenue growth did decelerate more than I 
think most people expected. And you had such strong tailwinds with Mobile 
an
d Display. Do you think that some of the deceleration came from people 
going to information directly through apps or going directly through vertical 
search like going to Amazon directly for commerce or Expedia directly for 
travel?
 
Larry Page
 
Yes, I mean, B
en, maybe I'll take the first on there on Android. I think we 
are in a very 
--
 
as I mentioned in my remarks, we're in the early stages of 
monetization for a number of our new products, and Android is one of those. 
I think we do make money from Search on ap
ps. We do make 
--
 
we 
mentioned that we have a very strong advertising business on mobile, which 
we obviously 
--
 
a lot of those people are on Android as well. And I think that 
you also see we announced 11 billion downloads on Android markets. 
Obviously, a l
ot of those are free, but we also are having a lot of people buy 
stuff there, too. We've seen a lot of potential for us to make money on 
Android, and I think you'll see us increase that a lot over time. It's hard to 
give you details about that right now, b
ut I'm very, very optimistic.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
On the second part of the question, let me jump in. If you look at our growth 
--
 
first of all, you're right that FX played a part. You also have to remember 
that last year at this time, right, we had such a st
rong comp. We had such 
an amazing Q4 of 2010. That the year
-
over
-
year comparison in a way 
represents also this really high kind of level on which to start from. And so 
from that perspective 
--
 
and if you also look at our mix between our own 
Google websites
 
versus all of our network, I mean, our core properties 
continue to be actually very strong. So for all these reasons, I wouldn't be 
worried of the way that you've described it. In fact, we've got 
--
 
continue to 
have very strong growth.
 
Operator
 
And we'll 
go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
I just had another follow
-
up on CPC. And kind of as you look out given 
--
 
to 
the first half of the year, and given the metrics that Susan rank
-
orde
red or 
impacting them in Q4, how do we think about how those metrics that you 
rank
-
ordered might impact them in the first half of the year or just even 
looking out over the next quarter? What are the things we should be paying 
attention to?
 
Patrick Pichett
e
 
Yes, I mean, at the highest level and then maybe Susan can jump in if she 
wants to add additional, if you think of the core elements of it, she 
mentioned quality. And we 
--
 
the 
--
 
all of the Panda changes and everything 
we talked about, right, its full y
ear is going to be represented only by the 
next spring. And then FX rate, we don't control ourselves. So obviously, it 
has a significant impact. The rest of it is actually the mix between how the 
innovation that we drive to our products, which is if you ha
ve a great 
product that drives a ton of clicks and it happens to have lower cost or CPC, 
then that's still for the benefit of everybody. So then, that's really about our 
innovation agenda, but we don't give forward guidance on that.
 
Heather Bellini 
-
 
Goldm
an Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Right. But it just looks like those trends that you mentioned that impacted 
Q4 are in existence as we look out, at least initially, into 2012.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I think you have to make the call on the FX yourself. And
 
then on the...
 
Heather Bellini 
-
 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Aside from FX, obviously, right.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes, yes and then the quality, I think will going to 
--
 
flow through the year, 
sometime in the spring.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
I mean,
 
the one thing I would just add is, the way we think about the 
business is we're focused on how do we provide better ads for our users and 
for our advertisers, and we look at all of those metrics combined. And what 
we saw in Q3 was we made a bunch of chang
es. They were small. There was 
no one individually that actually affected things, but it just so happened that 
the changes we made drew more attention and caused an increase in paid 
clicks. And so, as I mentioned, there are many factors. But really, what w
e 
use as a guiding metric are to understand that something is revenue, 
advertiser and user positive.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division
 
Help me 
reconcile the 15% year
-
on
-
year growth in Google partnered 
revenue with the 130% growth in the DoubleClick Exchange and the $5 
billion run rate for Display. I mean, something 
--
 
it seems that something 
must be decreasing. And how do we make these numbers cl
ose?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Look, I think that you have to remember 
--
 
in the highest level, you have to 
remember that sites and network lines in our financials are not good proxies 
for Search and Display revenue, right? I mean, in its most simple term, 
YouTube,
 
which is Display, right, ends up in our Google sites. And yet, AFS 
which is Search, is included in the network. So when people actually do the 
math, right, it's really easy to get confused between these lines. So I would 
kind of caution you to have one wh
ich is growing at 15% obviously being 
--
 
jumping to the conclusion that that's Display. That doesn't work.
 
Carlos Kirjner

So does that mean that a material portion of the $5 billion come from

atrick Pichette
 
All I'm saying is we don't give the breakdown, but you could

I just want to 
make sure that you

caution you that because of these mix issues, right, it 
can lead to interpretations that are wrong.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Doug Anmu

Douglas Anmuth

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
I just wanted to go back to the CPCs for a minute. And it sounds like 
--
 
and 
we can obviously take the FX out, but it sounds like you're saying that the 
improvements in 3Q were perh
aps a much bigger factor than the mix shift 
toward mobile in terms of CPCs. Susan, can you provide any more color 
there in terms of the improvements that you made which could drive sort of 
a meaningful shift like that? And then secondly, TAC as a percentag
e of 
advertising revenues have been down for many straight quarters now, and 
here they ticked back up a little bit. Can you clarify that at all, the reason for 
that?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes, on the latter 
--
 
let me just jump in on the latter and then I'll let
 
Susan 
give a bit more color, commentary. But it's just mix issue between partners. 
So as you have partner mix, it will just affect. But it's not a dramatic 
number, by the way, right? It's still kind of hovering around 24. So it hasn't 
plummeted in any way
 
shape or form.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Is it more partner mix? Or is it possible that it's more mobile mix like 
desktop to mobile?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes is the short answer. But partners mix affects it as well. Like, 
it's not only 
mobile, I guess, is my point. I'll let Susan give you more details on the 
colors of the 
--
 
if any, on the changes that we've done that would have 
impacted the CPC.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
So the 2 biggest factors, as I mentioned, were the FX and al
so the changes 
that we made to 
--
 
in terms of ad quality or format changes that we made. 
And those were changes that we made in Q3. There was no, I think, one 
significant one that drove the metrics. Or like this quarter, we made 20 
different changes. Last 
quarter, we made something similar. And it was the 
combination of those different changes. Now it's important to remember that 
we rolled those out over the course of Q3. And so that meant that if we 
rolled one out at the end of Q3, that you wound up seeing
 
that impact in Q4 
period. And so there was a cumulative effect. But again, there was not any 
one big one. It was the sum of a bunch of other changes. And those changes 
that we wind up making are changes that may make the ads more readable, 
they may be mor
e visible, they're UI treatments or quality changes. They're 
a bunch of different things that make it more visible so that users are 
noticing the ads. And we see those as positive. We measure the metrics, 
how do our users respond, how do our advertisers re
spond. And they are 
revenue positive.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes. Another way to think about this is in many quarters, we would have a 
bunch of them that would actually move down the CPC, a bunch of them 
that would have moved up in [ph] click. It just happens th
at in the latter 
part of this year, they kind of all moved one way, which is not neither good 
nor bad. It just happens that the quality team and the advertising teams 
actually have kind of unearthed these type of opportunities. So it's a bit of 
circumstant
ial as well.

And we'll take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Two questions. First of all, I think, Larry, early on you referred 
--
 
you talked 
about shuttering 
a couple of products and then doubling on key products 
that are showing some quite bit of success. I guess can you speak to are you 
still innovating across new products around the consumer? And anything 
that's not tied to advertising as we look ahead? Seco
nd question, can you 
talk about 
--
 
I guess when you look at mobile distribution costs in general, 
do you envision a scenario where mobile distribution costs stay about where 
they are today? Or how do you think those kind of play out over time as you 
think 
about the development of the mobile market?
 
Larry Page
 
Maybe I'll take the first question and Nikesh can take the second part of the 
question. I think we 
--
 
I didn't mean to imply in any way that we're stopping 
innovating. And I think we will 
continue to launch new products in new areas 
and things that aren't necessarily advertising supported, as we have been 
doing for a while. And I'm very excited about that. But we may not launch 
100 such things. We may launch a few of those such things over 
the next 
few years. I think we'll try to make sure we're more concentrated in our 
efforts to make sure we're producing really amazing products for our users 
and for our customers that are really well thought out and work really well. 
And so, I mean, we've 
put a lot of effort into those things. So we're just 
really just been concentrating our efforts around our innovation and making 
sure we're doing a really great job on the things that we really care about 
and that really matter to the world. And so that's 
very consistent with sort of 

 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes, I think on mobile distribution, it's pretty similar to what happens on 
Search today. Many consumers get their mobile applications from Google 
directly on their devices. Some peopl
e get them through our distribution 
partners, and some people get them through our carriers. And to be honest, 
the distribution costs really depend on the mix of those devices. And you can 
see, traditionally the mix is less and less specific to other distr
ibution 
partners in the middle, and more and more people are organically getting 
access to device and applications that they choose given the large plethora 
of opportunities and options that they have.

A couple of things. Patrick, on the hedging program, you had $134 million 
loss on the expenses of getting the hedges, but you only made $25 million 
and it was a pretty volatile quarter. Do 
you have a lot of backlog saved up 
for next year in profits? And is this working the way you want? And then 
maybe for Larry, obviously CPC growth is really accelerating. Can you 
explain why that's good for Google and why you think you're going in the 
right
 
direction? The mix seems to be a big controversy, but obviously you're 
making these changes. Can you really explain the positive benefit to the 
user experience or to the company?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So on the first question, actually thanks for your question
, Justin, because 
I'm sure a lot of people are thinking about that. Our hedges 
--
 
so the cost 
that we accelerated is actually relative to the entire portfolio of hedges that 
we have that spans over 18 months forward. So what 
--
 
think of it as a 
complete pr
ogram that extends 18 months out and 
--
 
of which think of it like 
a bond ladder, right, with a lot in the short term and 
--
 
less in the long term. 
All of those hedges, right, you have to mark to market. And when you have 
to mark to market, they're so much 
in the money. Then you have to actually 
accelerate your expensing of them. So you're absolutely right that today as 
we stand or as we close our books on the 31st, right, they signaled about 
the weakness of the euro because the euro had lost quite a bit in 
the quarter 
and relative to our portfolio. So we would 
--
 
if things stayed exactly the 
same, right, we wouldn't reap a lot of benefits in the coming quarters and 
wouldn't have those expenses because we took them all in one shot. So I 
hope that makes sense.
 
And it's really tied to FASB 133 that doesn't allow 
you to just do it pretty [ph] early.
 
Larry Page
 
I can take, say, a little bit about CPC from my perspective. I think 
--
 
and I 
don't have the detail here, quarter or whatever, but I do think that CPCs 
--
 
do vary a fair amount, and we're not surprised by that. There are lots of 
product changes that we can make that can increase CPCs or decrease CPCs 
and kind of have a 
--
 
or an inverse effect on the number of clicks and sort of 
not change the actual dollars 
spent, for example. And that's not that 
surprising because we can do things that 
--
 
in product changes that affect 

the conversions that advertises receive. They might receive bett
er quality 
clicks, or they're 
--
 
or those 
--
 
each CPC that they got that's more likely to 
convert into what they care about. And so we are constantly optimizing all 
those things across a number of different product areas and ad placements 
and everything el
se. And our advertisers are doing the same, and the 
algorithms are also doing all that. So I think in any healthy economic 
--
 
economy, like we have of advertising, we're going to see variation in the 
different factors we use to measure it. And I'm not surp
rised by that.

Are you happy with the results in the quarter? Are they going the direction 
you expected based on the changes you made?
 
Larry Page
 
As I said, I'm very happy with our results overall in the 
quarter. And I think 
those are a function of all the metrics that we gave you. So yes, I'm happy 
with our results.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
Yes. I mean, one additional thing I'd like to say about the increase in paid 
clicks is the increase in paid clicks, in a lo
t of ways, is a proxy for where the 
ad is useful. Do the users find interesting enough to click on them? Do we 
have enough advertisers who served ads? So an increase in paid clicks 
shows that our advertising system is working, that we have more 
advertisers
, we have more clicks. And as Larry alluded to, there are many, 
many different variables that go into it, but an increase in paid clicks is 
something that we see as a sign that our advertising system is in demand 
and it's healthy.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take o
ur next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
I'll ask about paid clicks and their relationship to CPCs. There's a third
-
party 
data that suggest that paid clicks continue to grow faster than fre
e clicks. 
And so the 34% paid click growth that you reported, it would seem to make 
that fairly accurate that there's a mix shift that's occurring in favor of paid 
versus free. And with search quality improvements as the driver of this 
potentially, it woul
d seem that advertisers would be paying more for better 
distribution, yet CPC is down. So if you were to look at your business on a 
same distribution basis normalized for mobile and increased ad coverage and 
all the other potential drags on CPC, I'm just 
-
-
 
the question is a simple one. 
If you look at advertisers, are they paying more or less on a unit basis for 
distribution?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I think that 
--
 
let we make 2 statements on this. The first one is that we shy 
from talking about 
--
 
anything about 
specific which is third
-
party data, 
because typically we find there are so much errors and methodology issues 
with them. I think that we're seeing 
--
 
what we have clearly seen this year 
once again, right, is more holiday shopping happened online this year 
again, 
right. Nikesh talked about, right, record Cyber Sundays and Fridays that are 
black. And, I mean, all of these things have hit record year 
--
 
this year 
again, and we're seeing again a transition of off
-
line to online. I think that 
Susan's last point 
is really the critical point, which is as we're moving and 
exploring formats that really work well for both the advertiser and the user, 
you should see a symptom which is more clicking. And that's exactly what 
we see. And if there's a slight pressure on th
e CPC as a consequence of it, 
but overall we get a better result, right, that's actually a pretty healthy 
environment and an innovative one. And then 
--
 
and just again, as we 
mentioned and as Susan said, it happened that in Q3, we had just a number 
of them
 
that just went one way. And I wouldn't read any data points in that 
as saying that that's the future or that it will not revert back to others. It's 
--
 
that's just the nature of experimentation in our systems.

I guess I'll spare you on CPC. I have actually a couple of questions for Larry 
on Google+. Last quarter, I think you referred to it your as social lair. And I 
guess I almost th
ink of it like Google's 
--
 
it's like your social operating 
system, I guess, to a certain extent. So I'd love to get your vision on how 
you think G+ can improve engagement across all your properties. And then 
the second question would be, identities that ar
e on Facebook and Twitter, 
do you think ultimately those firms will open up the data stream and we 
could see even richer results with clearly Facebook
-
 
and Twitter
-
like 
information?
 
Larry Page
 
Yes. I think we see 
--
 
as I mentioned in my opening remarks that we see 
really engaging with users on 
--
 
really deeply understanding who they are by 
getting them the right things that make sense for them and so on. It's 
really, really important. And I thin
k we are at the early stages of that, and 
Google+ is a big part of that effort. If you look at some of the things we've 
done, I think that if you look at in Search, you can do a search now and get 
somebody's name and have that name really appear as a chip 
in the search. 
And that means that it's no longer a string that you're searching for, it's 
actually a real person. That notion of identity is really a deep, deep part of 
what we're doing. And it's an example of how we can make all of our 
products better by
 
really understanding people. So we definitely think about 
that. There's a reason why we called it Google+ in that way. I think 
--
 
and 
so I think you're 
--
 
you've got the right idea in general about that. I think 
that 
--
 
I think with other big companies, o
ther big companies that work on 
social data and so on, I think we've seen very much general tendency to wall 
that data up and to wall the card in and not make the data available. Where 
we have publicly been able to access the data 
--
 
for example, in Search
, 
we've provided a lot of third
-
party social data in Search, and we love doing 
that and we'd love to have more such data. But in general, I would say 
companies generally have been walling that data up, and we'd love to be 
able to use more of it.

Two quick questions, neith
er on CPC. Susan, on Google Offers, quick 

space, it seemed like scale is an advantage in the local and national deals 
area. Is there any reason why Google is only in 30 markets to d
ate? It 
seemed like you've got all the merchant relationships that you need. So is 
there something else that's preventing a broader rollout? And then a follow
-
up for Nikesh on Europe. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that 
Germany was a little weak in
 
the quarter. Can you give us a little color on 
which verticals? Was it travel, retail, finance? A little color on the verticals 
that were weak. Or was it broad
-
based?
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
So right now, we have 30 markets to date, and that's just what we have
 
to 
date. So as there are more markets and as it makes more sense for us over 
time, then we will roll out more markets. But I do think that there is 
--
 
it's 
very important to understand what's working in a specific market and in a 
city and perfecting that 
and really understanding the dynamics that make 
sense for us for the success of that city. And so as we expand, we'll expand 
with that knowledge. And we'll expand as we 
--
 
as it makes sense for us in 
terms of the users, the solution and building all of tho
se learnings that we've 
made in those initial 30 markets.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Nikesh, any comments on your side?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes, I guess in terms of verticals, generally auto has been strong around the 
world. We've seen that. And then in different markets, 
different verticals 
have been special in terms of the 
--
 
the U.S., we had 

 
education, we had 
health. So there have been different vertical performances around the world. 
And Germany has been a market which has been doing really well for us in 
the last few
 
quarters. So part of it is we're running up against some very, 
very tough comps versus last year. But it was general sort of weakness 
across the board. It wasn't specific to any particular vertical that has 
changed.
 
Larry Page
 
I should mention, too, you c
an actually go to Google Insights for Search, 
and you can look at our Search free graph over time for any of these 
verticals yourself. It's some great data.

Just 2 quick questions. First, I remember last year in the fourth quarter 
there was a pretty big change that you guys made on the quality side, which 
I think you mentioned a bit on the prepared remarks. Won
dering if that 
--
 
how much of a headwind that was relative to the fourth quarter of this year. 
If there's a way you could sort of quantify that. And second question is the 
hiring rate that you guys have made, 1,100 people, this quarter. Wondering 
--
 
that's
 
a bit of a slowdown from the previous quarters in the past. 
Wondering if there was something there to look into.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So a 1
-
2 punch on this one, Herman. On the first one, we mentioned it 
because we thought it was material. It was such a big i
mpact last year. We 
don't comment on the specifics, but it was sufficiently material that that's 
--
 
you're absolutely right that it created a headwind for us this year. No doubt 
about it. And that's why we mentioned it. On the second question, you'll 
remem
ber that in Q3, we kind of had a double hitter where Larry had 
already said that we had reached what was kind of tolerable in terms of the 
pace of hiring.
 
Larry Page
 

 
Patrick Pichette
 
The edge of what is manageable. And thank 
you, Larry, for that clarification. 
And we also had at the end of Q3 all of the 
--
 
we had the summer 
--
 
everybody comes 
--
 
leaves 
--
 
comes from school, comes into Q3. So we had 
quite a bit of a bump in Q3. We're really pleased by 
--
 
and you can see in 
our 
results now that actually, it's a good evidence of we're managing 
--
 
we 
have managed down our numbers into Q4, and a good evidence of we are 
managing it to make it digestible for us.

And we'll take our final question from Youssef Squali with 
Jefferies &

Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
So first, one product we didn't talk much about is Google Wallet. So I was 
wondering that based 
--
 
if based on your early test, is that a product that 
you're planning on 
doubling down on? And if so, what is the path to wider 
adoption? And second, on MMI, I know the deal hasn't obviously closed yet. 
But just given the size of that transaction, it certainly has the potential to 
really change Google's growth and margin profil
e pretty significantly, which 
is a big concern to many. So at a very high level, Larry, I was wondering if 
you could maybe just talk about your commitment to be a principal in the 
handset business. And if so, how does 
--
 
how do you avoid channel conflicts 
with the partners?
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
Youssef, this is Susan. So I can talk a little bit about Google Wallet. And so 
as Larry has mentioned a number of times, we want to focus on products 
that people use every day. So products that are core. And all of us u
se our 
wallet every day. And we think that's a big opportunity for us. So we are 
continuing to invest in our Wallet business. And we see a lot of opportunity. 
And for example, there might be opportunities in the future in terms of how 
online and off
-
line a
re linked together, and better opportunities with the way 
different parts of our business wind up working. So we are very excited 
about Wallet, and we will continue to invest in it.
 
Larry Page
 
And I should mention on Motorola obviously we're going to break
 
that out 

think that 
--
 
and able to track the business separately. So that should not be 
an issue. We've been very clear that Motorola's obviously going to remain a 
licensee of Andr
oid, and Android will remain open. And when we announced 
the deal, we really said our strategy is working with different manufacturers 
on lead devices is going to continue. And Motorola will bid with 
--
 
just like 
any other OEM for those devices. So that pr
ocess will be unchanged. And 
obviously, I think we have done a great job managing our partner 
ecosystem. That's a difficult thing to do, and I think we do it quite well. And 
I expect we're going to continue to do that well with Motorola. And 
obviously, it 
shows our commitment to Android in making sure that we have 
the freedom to innovate and as do all of our OEMs.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So even more specifically, we 
--
 
you can expect segmented reporting for 
Motorola. So the Google will continue to be very clear i
n terms of its 
performance and transparency to investors. Motorola will also, on its own, 
be very clear and transparent to investors. And just before we close the call, 
just a reminder to everybody, as the headcount question that was asked a 
minute ago rem
inded me. As we launch into Q1, it's important to remember 
that there's a lot of expenses. As people kind of think of resetting their 
models, it's really 
--
 
I just want to remind everybody because every year we 
go through this, that the employer taxes and 
401(k)s and all of the things 
that launch into Q1 typically get reset. And so I just want to give a friendly 
reminder to all our 
--
 
the people that have financial models out there to 
make sure that 
--
 
to take that into consideration because it surprises 
ev
erybody every year. So rather than get another surprise at the end of Q1, 
I just thought I'd remind everyone. On that note, I think it's really 
--
 
I'd love 
to, once again on behalf of the 4 of us here, thank profusely our Googlers. I 
mean, they do an amazi
ng job and, as we said, landing a great quarter, 
crowning a terrific year and really well set for an absolute exciting year for 
2012 and look forward it. So on that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call.

With th

 
Patrick Pichette
 

remember we mentioned last quarter that Larry will no longer be joining us 
on a regular basis on this call as he focuses his energy 
on running the 
Company. But consistent with our prior calls, Nikesh and I will be here. We 
will cover the performance as well as answer any questions you have about 
the business, including significant ad product launches or other 
developments and in the ca
se that you have a very, very detailed product 
related question, in some cases we may simply take it off line with you. But 

for Q4.
 
Our gross total consolidated revenue for the 
quarter was $16.9 billion and 
the overall business was up 17% year
-
over
-
year and 13% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our Google segment, gross revenue grew a healthy 22% year
-
over
-
year to $15.7 billion and was up 14% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Without 
currency fluctuatio
ns, the Google segment revenue growth would have been 
23% year
-
over
-
year and 13% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Our Google sites revenue was up 22% year
-
over
-
year to $10.6 billion and 
was up 12% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, driven by the strength of our core search 
advert
ising business. Network revenue was up 3% year
-
over
-
year at $3.5 
billion and was up 12% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. This was driven in part by 
each year year
-
over
-
year comparisons as we anniversary some of our ad 
policy changes implemented at the end of 2012. Bu
t we also saw improved 
year
-
over
-
year growth from our ad exchange.
 

-
over
-
year to 
$1.6 billion and it was up 34% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. The digital sales of 
apps and content in our Play store drove
 
the year
-
over
-
year growth in this 
line as did hardware sales and the Play hardware sales drove most 

 
a big 
chunk of the quarter
-
over
-
quarter growth.
 
Turning to Motorola segment, gross revenue was $1.2 billion. As we 
announced yesterday Lenovo plans to ac
quire our Motorola business for 
approximately $2.9 billion. This is great news for Motorola and the Android 
ecosystem. And as Larry noted in our press release, Lenovo will have the 
expertise and the track record to scale Motorola Mobility into a major play
er 
within the Android ecosystem.
 
Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth 
was strong this quarter, up 31% year
-
over
-
year, and up 13% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our aggregate cost
-
per
-
click was down 11% year
-
over
-
year and 
down 2%
 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And please note that currency fluctuations 
had a minimal impact on Q4 on the cost
-
per
-
click.
 
Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors 
discussed on previous calls, including FX, geographic mix, platform 
mix, 
property mix as well as product and policy changes.
 
Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we saw 
improved performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in 
the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, you can find on 
our Investor 
Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., 
U.K. and rest of the world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our 
hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
 
U.S. revenue was
 
up 16% year
-
over
-
year to $6.9 billion. The U.K. was up 
15% year
-
over
-
year to $1.5 billion, which includes a small $2 million benefit 
from our hedging program. So currency fluctuation had minimal impact on 
U.K. revenues in Q4. Our non
-
U.S. revenue excludin
g the U.K. was up 30% 
year
-
over
-
year to $7.3 billion. And this accounted for 46% of our total 
revenue, which included again a very small benefit from our hedging 
program, in fixed FX terms; the rest of world grew a strong 33% year
-
over
-
year.
 

back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business. 
Our non
-
GAAP other cost of revenue was $4 billion in Q4 excluding stock
-
based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non
-
GAAP operating 
expenses totaled $4.8 billion again excluding SBC 
and Motorola 
restructuring. And our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $4.8 billion in Q4, 
resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 
29%.
 
For our Google segments, specifically our traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 
billion or 24
% of total advertising revenue. The other cost of revenue was 
$2.8 billion excluding $127 million of stock
-
based compensation. And our 
Google segment operating expenses were $4.3 billion, again excluding SBC 
of $746 million.
 
Depreciation and amortization e
xpenses on property, plant and equipment 
for the Google segment was $660 million this quarter. And Google segment 
profitability was $5.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a Google segment operating 
margin of 34%.
 
At Motorola, our total segment operating expenses
 
including cost of revenue 
were $1.6 billion, excluding $29 million of SBC and $15 million of 
restructuring charges to Motorola. Keep in mind that intangible amortization 
expenses attributed to Google segment and Motorola segment are included 
in these segm
ent measures.
 
Of the $279 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense this 
quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which 
$116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to the 
Motorola segment. 
As a result, the operating loss for the Motorola segment 
was $384 million in Q4 and the operating margin for that segment was 
negative 31%.
 
Our headcount for the consolidated business was up roughly 1,300 people in 
Q4. The Google segment added 1,700 people
 
during the quarter and in total 
the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 48,000 full
-
time employees. Our effective tax rate was 16% in Q4. Tax rate this quarter 
was impacted by the continuing mix shift of earnings between our domestic
 
and international subsidiaries.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E was 125 million for the 
quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the 
continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For 
more detail on
 
OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on 
our IR website.
 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.2 billion. 
CapEx for the quarter was 2.3 billion and this quarter the majority of our 
CapEx spend was related to
 
production equipment, data center construction 
and real estate purchases.
 
As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for 
the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for 
us to invest. Our free cash fl
ow, in consequence of all this, was $3 billion. So 
there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the 
confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities, including Android, 
Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise just to name a few.
 
Before I wrap up
, I want to cover two quick things. First, I want to remind 
everybody as I do every time at this time of year that as we start a new 
year, things such as employer taxes, 401(k) and all these other related 
accruals tend to be frontloaded in the year. So ple
ase consider this as you 
model your forecast.
 
And second, before I hand it off to Nikesh, I want to give an update on our 
issuance of Class C shares. Our Board of Directors has formally approved the 
Class C dividend and has set March 27 as the record 
date and April 2 of this 
year as the issuance date. So we expect that Class C shares to begin trading 
on April 3.
 
We were excited to announce that the Class C shares will actually trade 
under our original Ticker, that is GOOG, while the Class A shares will
 
trade 
under a new Ticker GOOGL. We're setting up a link on our Investor Relations 
site so that it can give you more information on the Class C dividends.
 
With that, I'll let Nikesh cover the details of our business performance in the 
quarter and after his
 
remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. 
So, here you go, Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned, our business had a strong quarter 
with $15.7 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall performance 
was strong in r
etail and automotive and CPG sectors. We had particularly 
good growth in Asia Pacific including its various emerging countries as well 
as in Southern Europe.
 
I want to talk about three areas that are fueling growth for Google and our 
clients. First, our co
ntinued efforts to help performance marketers reach 
customers and drive action across screens. Second, our continued progress 
in brand advertising. And third, our ad technology platforms used by 
thousands of agencies and publishers. Then I'll say a few wor
ds about new 
areas like digital content, hardware and enterprise.
 
On performance; performance advertising continues to be a mainstay of our 
core business. We're seeing good growth. It's driven primarily by increased 
search activity across all screens. It's
 
driven by new measurement features 
and more sophisticated marketers are aligning their search and display 
advertising strategy.
 
Last year we made the move to Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords, 12
-
months in marketers tell us it helps them get results and reach
 
people 
across screens in a big way. Our internal slogan for this is 'Advertisers ROIs 
don't lie.' We also rolled out estimated total conversion. Marketers can now 
measure results like calls and conversions that take place in different 
devices.
 
For example
, 1
-
800
-
Flowers discovered a 7% increase in overall conversions 
when they figured out that conversions that start on one device then end on 
the other. This is a great example of our vision as it relates to the seamless 
multi
-
screen marketing and something 
that was impetus for us to launch in 
ad campaigns.
 
In the holiday season, one thing has become very clear. The Web has truly 
become the new holiday store window. It's first where people go and it's 
where everyone gets excited about holiday shopping. In the
 
U.S., Walmart 
continues to use Google search more and more. They are investing with us 
more than ever before to drive sales during the holiday season.
 
There's also great momentum in product listing ads and we continue to 
improve the experience for shopper
s and retailers. Last quarter, Google 
Shopping came to eight more countries. We even helped deliver products to 
your doorstep in just a few hours. Google Shopping Express, our same day 
delivery service, has been open to shoppers in the Bay area since last 
year. 
I'm very pleased with the feedback we've gotten from our partners and 
users.
 
Now moving on to brand marketing. Working closer and closer with brand 
advertisers has been a big priority for us and we're making great strides. 
Now you might have seen all
 
the teaser ads running on YouTube ahead of 
the big game Sunday. Given my personal passion for cricket and lack of, 
pretty much any knowledge of American Football, I decided to turn to 
Google Trends and see who is leading. I see that Seahawks have more 
sea
rches than the Bronco, so that's my bet for the Super Bowl. But folks in 
Denver better get searching if they want the Broncos to win.
 
I don't know what that means for the big game on Sunday, but I do know 
that we are becoming a central to the biggest brand
-
building campaigns of 
the world. There are three big areas of focus that brand and our agency 
partners really like. First, building our great content on YouTube. YouTube 
gives brands amazing reach and a passion of unique audience you can't get 
elsewhere. 
YouTube has over 1 billion viewers per month and saw a 50% 
increase in daily watch time last year.
 
Second, the best digital marketing captivates people when it's by the Web, 
for the Web. It's so much more than simply taking television ads and 
transplanting
 
them on YouTube. So we're investing in creative ad formats 
that pivot around user engagement like CUview or engagement ads across 
the Web. Last year for the first time, three videos by brand marketers were 
on YouTube's list of top 10 videos for 2013.
 
Thir
d and importantly, better measurement than enables brand and agencies 
to measure and optimize campaigns based on metrics like reach, recall or 
awareness. Last quarter we enabled advertisers in our Google Display 
Network start buying ads based on viewable i
mpressions, a fancy way of 
saying, ads that people actually saw. In November we began testing Nielsen 
OCR, measurement on our YouTube and our network. There's a lot more to 
come here, but it's an important step to helping brands invest online.
 
We think our
 
efforts are really resonating with major clients and agencies 
from around the world. Our sales team continues to fire on all cylinders. I'm 
really pleased we hired Kirk Perry as our President of Brand Solutions from 
Procter & Gamble. His goal is to help t
he largest brand and agencies in the 
world embrace digital marketing more and more. He speaks their language, 
so we hope that he'll be able to convince them that the future for brands is 
truly digital.
 
We worked with Kraft to build a series of engagement a
ds, showcasing 
brand videos, recipes and coupons for its new Fresh Take brand. That 
campaign was very successful and left an impressive 2.9% engagement rate 
in that average engagement time of 48 seconds.
 
Moving on to our ad technologies platforms, our Doub
leClick buying tools 
continue to be the choice for agencies around the world, and we're really 
benefiting from the growth and programmatic spend. One trend we're seeing 
is the move towards private ad exchanges in which a premium publisher 
uses our technolo
gy to make ad space available to a small number of 
handpicked, high quality and highly qualified advertisers. This could provide 
a very safe, real
-
time environment for both brands and publishers.
 
The volume of compression running through our private exchan
ges as on 
average doubled every quarter over the past year. Overall, our monetization 
solutions like our Ad Exchange, AdSense and AdMob are helping major 
publishers maximize their revenues from digital advertisers. So that's our 
core ad business.
 
Let's tal
k about our trisect of emerging new businesses; Google Play, 
hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to win the hearts and minds 
of people, the latest books, newspapers and magazines, 20 million songs, 
thousands of movies, textbooks, all access musi
c. You can live your lives on 
Google Play. People love it so far. This quarter we introduced a Google Play 
Newsstand that brings together more than 2,000 free and paid news sources 
including newspapers like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financia
l 
Times. We also introduced Google Play for education. It's a design for 
schools and educator proved ads as well as tools to easily set up a classroom 
of tablets in minutes.
 
We have a strong holiday season for our growing suite of hardware products. 
One of
 
the things that has done really well for us is Chromecast. It continues 
to be a living room favorite remaining a best selling product throughout the 

available through Chromecast with ne
w supported apps like Hulu plus, HBO 
Go and Pandora, with more to come.
 
Chromebooks are also seeing great momentum with eight of the top 
manufactures of computers now making Chromebooks, including new 
devices from both Dell and Toshiba. One in four devices
 
sold into K
-
12 

also been seeing strong momentum in Nexus hardware with great reception 

up with the automotive an
d technology leaders Audi, GM, Honda, Hyundai 
and NVIDIA to form the Open Automotive Alliance.
 
Our enterprise business continues to grow steadily as more businesses than 

momentum in th
e retail space. There is supermarket Waitrose, the clothing 

this quarter. On the cloud platform side we announced that Google computer 
engine is now generally available supportin
g additional operating systems at 
new lower prices.
 
But before I close, I also want to give a shout out to our marketing team in 
particular they had really helped to drive the success of Google Play and the 
hardware products over the holidays. They have be
en able to do that 
through great effective advertising and creating awesome retail 
environments. And of course, thanks to all the Googlers and our partners for 
helping us to have a terrific quarter. We are not just embracing the future;

our first question from Carlos Kirjner 
with Bernstein.

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
 
Thank you. Two quick questions, Patrick, if you took your five or six major 
geographies for search and for each of them you plotted separately the 
evolution 
of CPCs for mobile and for PCs and Tablets, and you look at these 
curves from 5,000 feet, would they be mostly going up, down, flat or all over 
the place. And secondly, could you let us know if Google Compute Engine 
and Google App Engine are significant dr
ivers of CapEx, 5% or more of your 
CapEx? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
All right, so let me jump by the second one first, Compute Engine 
-
 
most of 
our CapEx right now is really driven by data center construction and 
machines that are actually driving both t
he core businesses of Google and of 


successful; it's just when you compare it to search or other elements that 
kin
d of use a lot more capacity.
 

breakdown each of these geographies. But the fundamental trends are 
happening across the web, and in the same way. So all this issue of some 
markets are
 
growing much faster which is the emerging markets, so you 
could see that 
--
 
you can infer that from our results obviously.
 

Tablet and Desktop again across the world, so you can infe
r that as well. Our 
sites versus network. The U.S. is a strong network area, everybody knows 
that and so, you can basically kind of from your own inference kind of pick 
and part these kind of elements, but they together move to actually really 
make the eco
system vibrant and growing. And at the end of the day what 


great results for our users that get them exac



next question, Jamie.

Great, thank you. It's actually Jordan for Scott. I guess two quick questions, 

you were primarily interested in their design team or product or somet
hing 
else. And then on the other revenue line what was the contribution to the 
other revenue line from Chromebooks or Chrome otherwise in the 
enterprise?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
All right, thank you for your questions, Scott. In the case of Nest, look Nest 
and Go
ogle share a real common vision. Nest, both of us believe that 
technology should be doing the hard works so that people can get on with 
their lives and do great things. So our goal is really in the case of Nest is to 
help them scale. And bringing the resou
rces of Google to increase their 
investments, reach broader audiences and then scale internationally. So, for 
us it's a terrific opportunity and then bring people like 
--
 
being able to 
attract people like Tony and Matt to the team is actually wonderful. So
, 

 
Your second question; let me just go back to your second question. The 
other revenue line. Well actually as I mentioned in my comments, the other 
revenue it really grew well, like just under a 100% year
-
over
-
year. If yo
u 
look year
-
over
-
year the biggest contribution was actually on the Play apps 
and content. But quarter
-
over
-

hardware, but it's both the combination of Nexus 5 which was very strong 
for us and the Chromecast.
 
You
 
got to remember that most of the Chromebooks are actually sold to

Hi, great, thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, I just want to ask you 
about YouTube in particular. If you cou
ld help us understand the growth that 

just on Nielsen OCR tagging, if you could give us some early market or 

olor 

been doing it internally? Thanks.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah, sure. Look, I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, YouTube 
is one of our core advertising business, so both Search and 
YouTube are 

seeing brand marketers and if you saw us, as I said our strength this quarter 
was not just from retail or automotive also from CPG. And part of our ability 
to get CPG
 
customers to come and advertise with us is our ability to 
convince them that brands can be built on the Internet and YouTube clearly 
is the key player in our brand story, vis
-
à
-
vis advertisers, because they still 
think visually 
--
 
they still video when th
ey think brand advertising not just 
text ads.
 
So I think YouTube is definitely a key part of our brand story, and it 
continues to do well. I think our teams around the world have sort of figured 
out how to pitch YouTube to large customers and customers are
 
paying 
attention. So I think YouTube continues to do well in addition to our core 
Search business and people are seeing the value of YouTube vis
-
à
-
vis 
brands.
 
In terms of the OCR tagging and our decision to do it internally versus 
externally I think look 
in the long
-
term what advertisers want is a third party 
to endorse various media.
 
It's very hard for us to be a media owner to be the person providing 
measurement against our own media. At the same time we believe there is 
tremendous amount of development 
that can be done in the space of 
measurement where traditional measurement has been both sort of after the 
fact and also has been on the very limited set of parameters. We believe we 
as a team can not only increase the parameters that you can measure due 
t
o the digital world we also believe that you can look at different metrics 
simultaneously in the dynamic way and also create new metrics for the 
future.
 
So our metrics efforts internally have been focused towards creating future 
metrics as well as more 
dynamic metrics as opposed to passive or legacy 

third party, parties outside including Nielsen and other players of the 

stry needs 
to go, and eventually we have to work with them to get them to evolve with 
us in that direction.
 
In terms of the early feedback on Nielsen OCR tagging, I think it's sort of 
like, it's table stakes you have to have Nielsen OCR or some metric that
 
is 
common across various media in the market for you to be, for advertisers to 
be able to measure your effectiveness or your relevancies vis
-
à
-
vis 

stakes which is sort of a comfort fa
ctor for advertisers, when they see that 
they can look at Nielsen OCR metrics vis
-
à
-
vis us and other people and get a 
sense that they are not spending their money in an unwise fashion, but I 


to happen in this space.

I

just the App business and Mobile App business in general for Google I

app install type advertising. F
irst, is that true? If so, is that an opportunity 
for Google? And then secondly, it seems like that there is a lot of discussion 
in the market and dollars being put against identity

based ad targeting in 
addition to or in lieu of cookie

based advertising. 
What are your thoughts on 
that? And how is Google, if you think that's a positive trend, how is Google 
taking advantage of those new forms of ad targeting?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks, Mark. This is Nikesh. In terms of your first question in the area of 
app instal
l, yes, clearly it has become a larger market recently with this 
whole mobility factor where everybody is trying to get more and more 
mobile. We have solutions. We have always had solutions as part of our 
AdMob product as well as our AdSense products where
 
advertisers can use 
those forms of advertising towards creating app installs. And we continue to 
work hard to see where else in our various portfolio of services we can 
introduce the idea of app install. So you'll hear more from us in that area in 
the fut
ure. But I think you're right. This is an opportunity and we continue to 
work hard towards making this opportunity real, not just with our existing 
products but also looking at other ways that we can keep driving this.
 
In terms of your question around cook
ies and alternatives for cookies, I 
think it's fair to say that there is a lot of conversation around cookies, there 
is a lot of stuff going on in terms of how do we continue to evolve this area 
of technology and make sure that we give the users more contr
ol and also 
make sure that users have security in terms of what data gets transferred 
for them right and increase the transparency. So, our teams are working on 
this. There are some early concepts in our teams where they're trying to see 
how they can 

 
we 
can evolve this notion in all three parameters that I 
mentioned. But I think it's too early to talk about what those precise 
solutions are likely to be.

Yes, a few question on the Google Wallet initiatives. One, could you just talk 
about generally what are the problems that that group is trying to s
olve? 
Two, can you just tell us a little bit more about the structure of Google 
Wallet? Who runs the group, who do they report to? And then when you're 
talking about the number of credit cards that you actually already have in 
that system, can you give us 
any 

 
can you help understand the quantity 
there? Are you measuring in hundreds of millions, tens of millions? And then 
separately, Nikesh, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on 
initiatives to improve ad attribution and measurement and specif
ically 
measuring sort of the online to offline attribution? Thanks.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you very much for those questions. I think 

 
let me start with Google 
Wallet. I think the best way to think about what Google Wallet is trying to 
achieve is we're consta
ntly trying to reduce the friction from somebody still 
doing a search to trying to actually acquire something. But then that is going 
from online to online, from online to mobile, from mobile to mobile or even 
online to offline like you referred to in your
 
question at the end. So, the 
hope of our team is to make sure we reduce the friction and of course create 
a higher degree of security and comfort vis
-
à
-
vis the end user so they get a 
better experience. Now, Google Wallet is actually a team that is run by 
our 
commerce team, which works with Sridhar, who works with Larry. And I 
think the best way to think about is as people go more and more mobile, 
we're noticing a lot more people are spending time buying apps and digital 
content on their mobile devices and 
they end up signing for Google Wallet as 
part of their Google Play experience. So, we are seeing lot's more 

 
lots and 
lots of users use those services. I leave it to you to infer how many Android 
users there are and how many Google Play users there are an
d what 
proportion of them as buying goods and services from us. So that gives you 
a sense of Google Wallet. It's definitely a number that we are very happy 
with and it continues to grow.

Great. A 
couple of things. We are seeing rest of world revenues accelerate. 
Does that have any benefit from product listing ads or some of the mobile 
changes you made in the platform? And maybe you could talk about how 
those are going? And then sales and marketing 
went up quite a bit in Q4. I 
was just wondering if that was related to Motorola. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So why don't I take the second one and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the 
PLA. Sales and marketing in Q4 was actually just really tied to the holi
day 
season. We had great momentum of the Nexus 5 and the Chromecast. And 
so at that time of the year we decided when we have such winner products, 
we would actually support them in addition to a number of other areas 
where we actually invest. So very, very
 
pleased with the performance of 
both of those as well as Chromebooks, which have been, if you look in the 
press, the feedback you get is number one, number two in so many 
markets. So very, very pleased of actually kind of making that investment in 
these c
ore products. For the PLA, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Hi, Justin. Yes, to break your question down in terms of 

 
there are two or 
three parts to your question. I think in terms of the growth in the rest of the 
world, effectively the growth w
e're seeing in the rest of the world is actually 
on our core search advertising business and it's across the board. It's across 
our various products. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a 
lot of work in Enhanced Campaigns and trying to drive 
solutions from a 
multi
-
screen perspective. What we're really seeing is not a particular screen 
or a particular format, it's actually something which is allowing advertisers to 
come in and say, hey, I'd like to acquire more customers, I'd like more 
people o
n my website, I'd like more people in my store. And effectively them 
spending money and us helping them optimize across multiple screens how 
that money should be effectively spent and them measuring the ROIs and 
saying, this is good, I need to spend more m
oney in this space. So, it's not a 
particular change in our mobile platform or any other platform, it's actually 
really our move towards Enhanced Campaigns, which is helping us and the 
strength in our core business. Vis
-
à
-
vis product listing ads, we've tal
ked 
about this a few quarters ago how we are moving from 10 blue links in 
certain categories to more entity
-
level results. And product listing ads is a 
prime example of how it's happening effectively. We are seeing adoption. As 
I mentioned, we've added eig
ht more countries this quarter. So, this is part 
of a continued evolution and it is adding value to both our end users, 
shoppers as well as store retailers. So it's clearly giving us benefit, our users 
benefit and obviously more relevant results, allowing 
merchants to reach 
specific audiences.

Hi, guys. So I've always
 
thought of Motorola as an asset for Google to push 
the agenda for both hardware and software innovation to the OEMs. So, how 
does the sale to Lenovo affect your ability to do that? Also was your 
ownership with Motorola ever an impediment to having a close
r working 
relationship with any of the other OEMs before? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Well, the short answer is we believe that this is a great transaction where 
everybody wins. I think that Motorola will find in the mature handset a 
terrific partner and we'l
l provide scale and continued really momentum on 
what is now done very well, which is develop world
-
class product. In 
addition to that, Motorola 

 
let's never forget right has really strengthened 
our Android ecosystem and done a terrific job on that. So I 
think that both 
from a perspective of the hardware itself in the handset area as well as for 
the core Android ecosystem, I think that it's a real win
-
win for everybody. In 
addition to that, right, as you know from the Nest acquisition and Glass and 
Wearabl
es, we continue to innovate and we continue to be committed to the 
hardware in areas that are kind of enterprising, promising, new frontiers and 
that's where actually we're focusing on. So I think all in all, quite a great 
story.

Thanks for taking the question. I guess a broader question, the long term 
around your e
-
commerce initiatives, just understandin
g how you envision 
continuing to partner more deeply with offline retailers, how PLAs play into 
that and maybe an update on what you've seen early days from the Google 
Shopping initiative in San Francisco and now it seems to have expanded into 
a second mar
ket? Thank you.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think the best way to think about it is that what is happening is over time, 
people are looking 

 
when they look on the Web, they look for more and 
more bite
-
sized [ph] answers and which was the genesis of why we believe 
that
 
entry level search begins to make more and more sense whether it's in 
travel, whether it's in hotels, whether it's in product listings, people are 
looking for more specific answers. And as you get mobile, you want even 
more bite
-
sized answers so that peop
le can get the information as quickly as 
they want. So that sort of is the genesis of product listing ads. If you take 
that to its logical conclusion, that is people declaring intent that they would 
like something and that gives you a sense and a signal th
at, okay, clearly if 
they're looking for something, they're more than likely wanting to buy it at 
some point in time. So, we see our role as trying to enable the entire 
ecosystem across the board of retailers both online and offline to be able to 
provide t
hose goods and services directly to the end user as quickly as 
possible with the least amount of friction. And friction comes in their ability 
to find it. Friction comes in their ability once they've found it to buy it. That's 
why things like InstaBuy exis
t in Google Wallet where you can have instant 
purchasing capability. And then of course there is the notion of gratification 
or once you've bought it, I want it as quickly as I can get it. So, you can see 
that our product initiatives are sort of triangulat
ed across all of these things 
whether it's PLAs in terms of your ability to find it, whether it's payment 
capabilities to try and close the loop or whether it's delivery, experiments 
where we see how can we get it to you as soon as possible. So it's more o
f 
an open system approach. To be fair where we can help the entire 
ecosystem and our various partners and you can see that our teams are 
working really hard towards enabling this vision, but it takes time and great 
execution.

Thank you. I have two. First on local advertising, I'm curious about Google 
Maps, Google Ways. Monetization of lo

helping local advertisers to drive ROI and what you guys need to do to drive 
that business in terms of advertising real

time locally? Then the second 
question, maybe for you, Nikesh, you mentioned the NFL jokingly, I wo
nder 
with the growth of YouTube as a platform when you look at the birth and the 
growth of Chromecast, why is it that you wouldn't find professional content 
or sports content strategic or useful in terms of driving the next leg or era of 
growth and monetiz
ation for YouTube? Thanks very much.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Let me answer two different parts of it. First is, in terms of your question on 

formats in Google Maps. But I think there is a broader
 
way of thinking about 

interact across multiple screens, you begin to look at location in a whole 

how
 
you can use that as a filter to provide them more precise information 
and hopefully, much more relevant advertising, which requires both ends of 

requires the advertisers to make sure
 
they give us the location of where 
their services are best utilized.
 
So we need location extensions from advertisers, we need locations from 
users, and we have to be able to marry them across not just Google Maps, 
but all across pretty much every experien


-

and allows us to make things more relevant both from advertisi
ng and from 
an organic perspective. In terms of YouTube, I think we are very happy with 
the growth that YouTube is having and has had both from a user perspective 
as well as content provider perspective and as well as from monetization 
perspective.
 
In term
s of content providers, we talk to content providers, large and small 
across the entire spectrum, because we want you to use the platform where 
creators of any size can build an audience. They can build an audience of 
scale; fans can find the content that

Hi. This is Kevin on for Mark. Just wondering, are you guys seeing Nielsen 
OCR measurement pushing more brand advertisers towards YouTube?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks, Mark. Sorry, this is Kevin. Sorry. Th
anks, Kevin. Kevin, as I 

seeing measurement as, table stakes for brand advertisers because they 

in performanc
e advertising because you can see the number of clicks you 
get in your website or you can measure the number of people who walk into 
your store.
 

how many people were you able to reac
h of a certain age, certain gender 

across the various brand media. So its sort of access table stakes and as I 
said earlier, it is the early set of metrics that are sort of basic ent
ry metrics 
into this space.
 
But we hope that this market is going to evolve from a measurement 
perspective over the coming quarters and coming years where we can have 
more sophisticated metrics and metrics that actually allow you to see the 
impact of this 
advertising on your brand.

s like Google 
Fiber needing to make returns and you see acquisitions like Nest getting 

mark in terms of net cash. So do you have any plans this year to address 
this sort of mounting
 
cash pile and as a part of the Google business that that 
needs to generate returns like the other businesses? And then for Nikesh, 
you surely seen the various social network and messaging peers absorb 
some substantial volumes of advertising spend. How doe
s that make you 
think about the evolution of Google+ and YouTube and some of the other 
social platforms you have as a complement to the search based business? 
Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

nd we 
were with our Board yesterday at the Audit Committee reviewing this issue, 
and so it clearly 
--
 
the cash position of Google is seen as a strategic asset. It 
is an important asset to us both in terms of offensive and defensive, given 
the world in whic
h we live in. And in that context, it's been reviewed 
regularly and we make sure that actually we get the best return for our 
investors on that asset as well. So, we have a real strategy for that as well. 
So, for now we have nothing else to announce on it 
but just to give comfort 
to our investors that we do take this issue seriously and it is reviewed on a 
regular basis by both ourselves, management, but also raised to the Board 
for the right answer. So, thanks for the question. Thanks for asking. It is 
alw
ays there. I'll turn it over to Nikesh for the second part of the question.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Richard. Let's see 

 
yes, I guess your point, yes, 
there are other people who are beginning to absorb some amounts of digital 
ad spend. I thin
k the $15.7 billion for this quarter was a majority of this 
being advertising, I still think we have a substantial advertising spend 
coming into us. But again, from a longer term perspective, I think every 
piece of advertising becomes digital. So, we're st
ill at single 

 
I think at low 
double digit numbers in terms of how much ad spend is digital versus non
-
digital. So we need more people in the digital space getting more and more 
advertising to shift from what we call traditional old media. I think over ti
me 
television becomes digital, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital 
because this provides so much efficiency from a measurement perspective 
and a targeting perspective to take out a lot of waste out of the system. So, 
with that in mind, I thi
nk we're still in the very early days of how much 
advertising is going to move over to digital media. And I think you're right to 
identify that, places like Google+, places like YouTube are still very, very 
sort of in their infancy in the amount of adverti
sing they can support vis
-
à
-
vis the amount of usage we're getting. So we continue to work hard. We 
have to strike the right balance between user services, end user service and 
the amount of advertising we have presented them, because this continues 
to be s
ort of evolving space and what you don't want to do is you don't want 
to overrun users with tremendous amounts of advertising, because that 
maybe good in the short term but creates a bad experience with users in the 
long term. So, you will notice that many
 
of our products still do not have 
tremendous amounts of advertising because we still believe those products 
are evolving and the right form of advertising just hasn't been invented for 
those particular areas. So, we remain hopeful in the long term for fin
ding 
more and more ways of enabling advertising for users. And for sure, perhaps 
some of the products may not lend themselves to advertising and users will 
prefer to pay for an ad
-
less product as it relates to certain areas like 
applications or digital con
tent, et cetera. So, those models also exist out 
there. So I think there is tremendous amounts of scope in the future and I 
think you have rightly identified some of the areas where we should be 
concentrating.

Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could share with us your

you think this even matters over the long term? Thank you.

Well, again, Heather, certainly the transaction with 
Motorola continues to 
support the ecosystem. So in that sense, right, I think that we have clear 
objectives of support. We've always had clear objectives to support all of our 
partners. And after this transaction, it's very clear that we'll continue to be 
kind of this impartial supporter of the entire ecosystem. As it relates to the 
detailed fragmentation, we've taken a number of steps. We've talked a lot 
about this already in the past. There is a number of steps taken to make 
sure that in fact there isn't 
fragmentation and I'll just encourage you to kind

market? Whether it's based on pric

low margin competitors already in the market or is this more of a broader

Patrick Pichette
 
Nikesh?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Colin, for your question. I'm still trying to parse y
our question. 
Look, I think we've done really well from an enterprise perspective. We are 
steadily growing revenues on our traditional Google apps business. Outside 
of that on the platform service, the Google Compute Engine, Google App 
Engine stuff, we con
tinue to make progress. I think we should 

 
we have 
more room to work harder over there. We understand there are other 
players out there, but again that is such an early, early stage in that market. 
We think over the long term, almost every business out th
ere, existing and 
new, has to be on a cloud platform, has to be on a large scale industrial 
strength infrastructure platform and there is still few players out there and 
there's lots and lots of room. So I'm not sure if price is the current factor on 
which
 
people need to make a decision. People will make a decision based on 
robustness, based on security, based on availability, based on the breadth of 
services we can offer in that platform and I just think its early days. So, we 
should be working on all thos
e things and you should be hearing more from 
us in the future.

Good day, and welcome, everyone, to the Google Inc. First Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like 
to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead, ma'am.
 
Jane 
Penner
 
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's First Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President 
and Chief Financial Officer; Susan Wojcicki, Senior Vice President, 
Advertising; Jeff Huber, Senior Vic
e President, Commerce and Local; Nikesh 
Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
 
First, Patrick, Susan and Jeff will provide us with their thoughts on the 
quarter, after which Nikesh will join the group to answer your questions. 
Also, as yo
u know, we now distribute our earnings release through our 
Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to 
our IR website for our earnings release, as well as supplementary slides that 
accompany the call. This call is also bei
ng webcast from 
investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a 
few hours.
 
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make 
today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding 
Goog
le's future and investments in our long
-
term growth and innovation, the 
expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital 
expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to dif
fer materially. Please note that these 
forward
-
looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this 
presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release 
results of any revisions to these forward
-
looking statements in li
ght of new 
information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more 
detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
 
Please note that certain financial measures which we use on this call, such 
as operating income and op
erating margin, are all also expressed on a non
-
GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges relating to stock
-
based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by 
operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to
 
as free 
cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP to GAAP 
measures can be found in our earnings press release.
 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon, everybody. We just happ
en to have a 
surprise visit. Larry is joining us for a few minutes at the beginning of the 
call and wanted to make a few comments. So before we start officially our 
call, I just want to welcome Larry. Welcome, Larry.
 
Larry Page
 
Thank you, Patrick. It's gre
at to take just a few minutes with all of you. 
We've had a tremendous quarter, 27% year
-
over
-
year revenue growth in 
Q1. And we're really excited about that, and I think it shows the strength of 
our business and our continuing 
--
 
and the continuing growth r
eally in the 
tech industry. And it's really still at the beginning from a user perspective. 
There's tremendous improvements to be had in our core products and our 
core business, and we're really excited about that.
 
I also wanted to mention a little bit abo
ut the management changes. 
Everything we told you last quarter has happened as we expected. It's all 
working very well, exactly as we planned. I'll just reiterate that quickly. I'm 
managing the day
-
to
-
day operations of Google as the CEO, working very 
close
ly with my team, and I'm really excited about the progress we've had 
there. I think we really hit the ground running. And Eric, of course, is 
focused externally, on the government partnerships, government relations 
and partnership outreaches. And last quar
ter alone, he was in Germany and 
Brazil, Argentina and Spain and has been just doing tremendous things for 
the company. Sergey, as we mentioned, is working very intensively on a few 
emerging projects for us. As I said, this was all exactly as we planned, a
nd 
I'm very, very excited about those changes. I'd also mention we've made a 
number of changes to just simplify our organ, improve our velocity and 
execution and basically, simplify our reporting structures and such.
 
Now I'm very excited about Google and o
ur momentum and very, very 
optimistic about our future. I also just wanted to mention we have Jonathan 
Rosenberg, who's usually done this call, is transitioning out of the company 
as was announced a while ago. And I really wanted to thank him for all of hi
s 
insights and hard work and fine communication with all of you. And so we'll 
clearly miss him, and we really wanted to thank him from the bottom of our 
hearts.
 
So those are the main things I wanted to say. I'm tremendously excited 
about all of the things 
that lay before us as a company. And I also want to 
say you're in very good hands with the team here, and Patrick who now 
should take the call away.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. Thank you, Larry. Thank you for taking a few minutes in the schedule 
to just drop i
n. So what we'll do now is we are back. So we found a phone 
for the last 30 seconds, and we're going to be back now with the rest of the 
team to go back to our regular call.
 
So as an overview, I'll be giving you the regular speech. Susan and Jeff will 
give
 
you color comments as well in the product area, as well as the 
monetization side. And Nikesh is with us so that when we go through Q&A, 
he'll be answer to give you a lot more color commentary in some areas.
 
Look, we're nothing but very, very excited about
 
our reporting 27% year
-
over
-
year revenue growth in Q1. This 27% proves really the logic behind our 
strategy, not only to invest heavily in our core Search business and Ads but 
also in our new emerging businesses like Display, like Mobile, like Enterprise.
 
From an investment perspective, our Q1 results don't only show our 
continued commitment to invest in hiring, in marketing and in the other 
areas, but they also 
--
 
as you can see through our expenses, they reflect, 
for the first time, the full impact of th
e compensation changes we announced 
in Q4, the 10% salary increase. Google is clearly benefiting from and is also 
fueling the unrelenting pace of the digital economy that's around us. And it's 
growth that we believe will benefit both Google but in fact, th
e entire 
ecosystem for a long time to come.
 
So let's turn to the specifics of our performance for the quarter. Gross 
revenue, as we mentioned already, 27% to $8.6 billion and interestingly, 2% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. To put this in context, this is quite rem
arkable if you 
think that Q4 was an amazingly strong quarter. And in fact, it adds also the 
impact of the Nexus One from Q1 of last year and to a lesser extent, the 
events that have occurred in Japan.
 
So Google website's revenue was up 32% year
-
over
-
year, 
$5.9 billion, with 
strength across all major geographies and verticals. The Google Network 
revenue was up 19% year
-
over
-
year to $2.4 billion. That Network revenue 
was negatively impacted by two things, the loss of a Search distribution 
partnership deal and
 
also, what has been broadly communicated, by Search 
quality improvement made during the quarter. Regarding the Search quality 
improvement, remember that we regularly make such trade
-
offs. We really 
believe that the quality improvements that benefit the us
er always serves us 
well both in the short term and in the mid term in terms of revenue. So Jeff 
will cover that in more detail in the coming minutes. Other revenue was 
down 10% year
-
over
-
year to $269 million. And note that in Q1 of 2010 was 
the first quar
ter that we'd booked Nexus One revenues, and this is what 
drives the year
-
over
-
year decline.
 
Global aggregate paid click gross 
--
 
that's my tongue twister for every 
quarter. It was very strong again, up 18% year
-
over
-
year, interestingly, 4% 
up also quarter
-
over
-
quarter and again, reflecting the accelerated shift of 
off
-
line to online. Aggregate cost
-
per
-
click growth was also quite healthy, up 
8% and only 1% down quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And you should all know that 
the FX had a pretty neutral effect on CPC gro
wth year
-
over
-
year and 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Remember too that that's an aggregate number and 
includes both google.com and our AdSense properties.
 
So now turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and the rest of 
world are both growing at a very healt
hy pace, and our results reflect that. 
The U.K. continues to lag a bit because of its global economic recovery, the 
pace of its 
--
 
the recovery. Revenue from the U.S. was up 25% year
-
over
-
year to $4 billion. In our earnings slides you can find on our Inves
tor 
Relations website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by 
U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefit of our 
hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
 
International revenue acco
unted for 53% of our total revenue or $4.6 billion, 
and it was up 28% year
-
over
-
year. It includes a $14 million benefit from our 
hedging program, and that compares to a $10 million benefit of Q1 of last 
year. If we use a fixed exchange rate, our internatio
nal revenue would have 
been roughly $23 million lower year
-
over
-
year. Also, it's worth noting that 
the tragedy in Japan somewhat negatively impacted our international 
revenue in Q1. And as I mentioned earlier, the U.K. was up 15% year
-
over
-
year to $969 mil
lion as the country continues to experience struggling 
economy. But even that 15% is really 17% in FX adjusted basis.
 
Let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $2.0 billion or 25% of 
total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue, $897 
million, including 
stock
-
based compensation of $49 million. And finally, all operating expenses 
totaled $2.8 billion, including approximately $383 million in stock
-
based 
compensation. The increase year
-
over
-
year in OpEx, primarily due to 
payroll, increased
 
advertising and promotional spend and some other 
professional services. So a result of all these expenses, our non
-
GAAP 
operating profit, which excludes the stock
-
based compensation, was $3.2 
billion in Q1 of this year, resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating m
argin of 
37.6%. Headcount was up approximately 1,900 people from Q4, ending the 
quarter with 26,316 full
-
time employees. Our effective tax rate was 21% 
roughly. The exact number is 20.5%.
 
Let we now turn to cash management. Our other income and expenses wa
s 
$96 million for Q1, in fact, a very solid performance from our portfolio 
management. And unfortunately, just masked by the impact of our higher 
hedging expenses associated with our SFAS 133, the accounting of which we 
know is quite volatile from quarter 
to quarter. So for more details on OI&E, 
please again refer to the slides that accompany our call on our IR site.
 
Operating cash flow, very strong, $3.2 billion. CapEx for the quarter, $890 
million, significantly below last quarter of $2.5 billion. And rem
ember that 
last quarter, that increase was largely due to our purchase of the New York 
City office. Majority of CapEx spend in Q1 was related to facilities, expenses 
and data center operations. In the facility space, we spent 
--
 
was really 
driven by the pu
rchase of two buildings, one in Dublin and one in Paris. Just 
as a reminder, we continue to make significant CapEx investments, and 
we've shown those to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when 
we're able to make such investments. Obviously, we'r
e pleased with our free 
cash flow, which was $2.3 billion for the quarter.
 
As I said earlier, our accelerating growth trajectory, it really shows our 
confidence to expand across products and geographies. Roughly 18 months 
ago, we began communicating how we
 
were really optimistic about our 
opportunities, and we had the business confidence to invest heavily in the 
next phase of innovation and revenue generation. Well, our product 
innovation over the last 18 months has been nothing short but 
extraordinary. Let
's take a look at this.
 
We have built from scratch the world's most popular smartphone operating 
system. We've built also from scratch the world's fastest growing browser. 
And in some countries like India, one in four people are now accessing the 
web 
via Chrome. We've reinvented display advertising, creating not only a 
business but an entire ecosystem with a $2.5 billion annual run rate as of Q3 
of last year. We've pushed the frontier of mobile search, creating a whole 
new search segment that is adding
 
to our overall search volume and brand 
new monetization opportunities. We've seen YouTube develop into a 
platform, a win
-
win platform in fact, where partners can generate significant 
revenue from their content and users watch 2 billion views a day.
 
And ou
r revenue growth clearly shows the wisdom of those decisions to fuel 
our growth ahead of the curve. So the facts speak [ph] from the sales really. 
The second half of 2010, we grew roughly 25% year
-
over
-
year. But even 
more telling, this quarter, growth rate
 
of 27% compared to a comp of 23% 
just a year ago. We are building multibillion dollar businesses, and we're 
confident that now is the time to invest. It's with this optimism that we'll 
continue to do so aggressively but with discipline, with strong focus 
on 
fueling the winning products. From an expense point of view, we're taking 
some bold steps but always with good strategic rationale in mind and 
discipline in mind.
 
So as our Q1 results continue to reflect some marketing 
--
 
you've heard of 
our marketing g
oing up. It's a very deliberate choice as an example. We 
have laid, made very specific focus on Chrome, customer and advertiser 
acquisition in the U.S. and international markets. And in both cases, we're 
seeing the fruits of these investments. The same is 
true for our labor 
strategy. And finally, we continue to invest in our long
-
term infrastructure.
 
So now let me turn it over to Jeff and Susan to provide you more details on 
the products that are the engine of both our growth and our optimism. 
They'll also 
provide you more details on where we're deploying some of 
these additional resources as they're coming on board. So with that, I'll turn 
it over to Jeff.
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
Thanks, Patrick, and hi, everyone. In his comments, Patrick mentioned our 
ambitious hiri
ng this quarter, which was by design. We announced in 
January, with a blog post to help energize recruiting, that 2011 will be the 
biggest hiring year in our history, topping the 6,000 people we hired in 
2007. And we ended up hiring 1,900 people this quart
er. We're very happy 
about this, because we feel this is a very good time to invest. We look at the 
factors like our revenue growth and how well our core and growing 
businesses are doing and say to ourselves, ""Who wouldn't want to invest in 
this business?""
 
So that's what we're doing, hiring great people to invest in 
the future. In fact, over half the Newglers who joined this quarter are going 
to be working in high potential and revenue growth areas like YouTube, 
Mobile, Chrome, commerce and local and Enterp
rise.
 
So that's what Susan and I are going to talk about today. We'll give you an 
update on our core business of Search and Ads, as well as these businesses 
where we're investing. Susan will cover our Ads products, Search Ads, 
Mobile Ads, local Ads, Displa
y Ads and YouTube, and I'll talk about Search, 
Android, Chrome and Enterprise.
 
So let's jump in with Search. Search is the most important thing people do 
online, and there's loads of opportunities to make Search more intelligent 
and more personal. Intellig
ent, as in better quality. Our primary focus is to 
always create the best user experience. So this quarter, we launched over 
90 different quality improvements. Most notably, we made an important 
change to our ranking algorithms to promote higher
-
quality si
tes. This 
noticeably impacted about 12% of our 
--
 
of all queries, and it's done a good 
job. We found it addressed over 80% of the sites that users reported as a 
poor experience via a Chrome feature we introduced a while ago. This 
change did have an adverse
 
impact on revenues for some sites in our 
Display Network, but we've continually found improving Search results and 
our users' experience is always the best thing to do in the long run and for 
long
-
term value.
 
Personal, as in building around people. We imp
roved social search this 
quarter, making it easier to find information and recommendations from the 
people that matter to you, whether they're publishing on YouTube or Flickr 
or their own blog or website. We also launched the +1 button, which makes 
it easy
 
to share recommendations with the world via Google Search results. 
And this is just the beginning. We've got lots more useful and relevant social 
search features coming soon.
 
A lot more of our searches are coming from mobile devices. This traffic has 
gone
 
up more than 500% in the last two years. Android is obviously a big 
driver of this. We're activating over 350,000 Android devices every day. 
Android market is taking off too, over 3 billion apps have been installed, up 
50% in just the last quarter. You ca
n now access the market online. Try it at 
market.android.com so you can shop and browse for apps from your 
computer, click the purchase, and they just magically show up in your 
device. We also recently launched In
-
app Billing, which has been very 
enthusias
tically received and which gives developers more ways to make 
money from their hard work.
 
Another product and it's doing very well is Chrome. Chrome users are very 
valuable to Google. And as we've said in past quarters, we're investing in 
Chrome marketing.
 
The payoff is worth it. We have over 120 million daily 
users, over 40% of whom we added in the past year as a result of our 
marketing efforts. The Chrome OS program is also going well, and we look 
forward to launching devices with our partners later this 
year.
 
Our Enterprise business is growing across both businesses and schools. As 
example, this quarter, we deployed Google Apps at InterContinental Hotel 
Groups and RR Donnelley; signed a reseller agreement with Optus, which is 
the largest 
--
 
second largest
 
telco in Australia; and signed up the University 
of Texas and Boston University. We were pleased that our deal with ITA 
Software was approved by the DOJ last week and closed this week. Travel 
searches in the area with lots of potential for innovation, bot
h for end users 
and as a platform for the industry. We're looking forward to bringing the ITA 
team on board and doing great things together.
 
That wraps up my remarks. But before I turn it over to Susan, I just want to 
take a moment to thank Jonathan Rosenb
erg, who has been a regular on 
these calls, for all he's done for Google. Jonathan and I have been friends 
and colleagues for over 15 years. And on behalf of myself and Susan, who 
also worked closely with Jonathan for the last nine years, I can assure all 
of 
you that he will be missed. Over to you, Susan.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Thank you, Jeff. Hi, everyone. So there are a lot of things to be excited 
about in our Ads business, and I'd like to share a few updates from the 
quarter in Search, Display and Mobile Ads.
 
S
earch is still our core business. And even though it's a really large business, 
we see a significant opportunity for growth, as Larry mentioned. One of the 
things that we've been focusing on is thinking about how we can serve the 
most perfect ad for every 
query. A query for a product will require a very 
different kind of ad than a query about a movie. And in order to do this, we 
are enabling new creative types and new ways for advertisers to set up their 
campaigns.
 
One example of this is Product Listing Ads
, which we released to U.S. 
advertisers in Q4. If you're a retailer and have hundreds of thousands of 
SKUs, it's hard to set up the separate creative for each one of those. So 
product listing ads automatically creates ads from product feeds rather than 
fro
m keywords. Then a retailer can run a unique ad for every product 
without doing any extra work. We're seeing great advertiser adoption, and 
about half of the largest retailers in the U.S. are now running these ads.
 
If you do a search for soccer cleats, som
ething I'm thinking about buying for 
my daughter, you can see some of these on the right
-
hand side. The ads 
include pictures and prices. That's something you'd want to see if you're 
going to buy something. The ads are really effective too. They're about tw
ice 
the click
-
through of standard text ads in the same location.
 
This quarter, we also launched a much richer ad format for more brand
-
focused advertisers, and we're calling this format Media Ads, because we're 
starting with the movie and entertainment adv
ertisers, but we think this 
format will work for all types of brand advertisers on Search as well. These 
creatives can include images or videos, and in the case of the movie studios, 
it will include a movie trailer. Again, there are no keywords, and Google
 
figures out the right queries to serve the ad. To see one of these ads, try 
searching for the movie Water for Elephants. If you are searching for a 
movie and the movie 
--
 
and you wind up seeing the movie trailer in the ad, 
we're getting you a lot closer t
o seeing the perfect ad. So as you can see, 
there's a lot of opportunity for more innovation within Search Ads.
 
I'd like to move on to Display right now. I'm very proud of how well our 
Display business has been growing. We bought DoubleClick three years ag
o. 
We've done a lot of integration together. And as a result, we've seen a lot of 
progress. Our Google Display Network is up 5x since acquisition, and we've 
been doubling annually in several of our key markets, like the U.K., Brazil 
and Japan.
 
Now most Dis
play advertisers can be bucketed in one of two categories. 
They can think about themselves as being performance oriented, where they 
value conversions and clicks or more brand oriented, where they're focused 
on raising awareness. Last quarter, we started t
o develop some features for 
brand advertisers. We had launched Google Display Network reserve, which 
gives advertisers ability to buy premium inventory on a guaranteed basis, 
which is how brand advertisers are telling us they want to buy the inventory. 
We 
are also giving advertisers tools that help them measure the impact of 
their campaigns on things like brand lift rather than just clicks and 
conversions.
 
Our Ad Exchange, which we've been focused on building a unified buying 
platform so that advertisers an
d agencies can buy the exact audiences they 
want across the Internet. The transaction volume on the Ad Exchange has 
tripled in the past year, and 2/3 of that inventory is being bought via real
-
time bidding, which is a new technology to enable much more pro
grammatic 
and scientific ad buying. It also results in better ads for users and gets us 
closer again to serving the more perfect ad.
 
YouTube is another part of our Display strategy. Revenue is doubling year
-
over
-
year, and we share that revenue with over 20
,000 content partners. 
We're starting to see a virtuous cycle. The more money we make for our 
content partners, the more engaging content they upload. So as you can 
see, there's been a lot of nice progress in Display due to the results of a lot 
of people a
t Google.
 
Moving on to Mobile, we're seeing growth this year really taking off. AdMob, 
the display network that we acquired last year, has over 150 million iOS and 
Android devices making requests per month. That's up 50% in the past four 
months, which give
s you an idea of how fast Mobile Display advertising is 
growing.
 
Many of our advertisers are starting to run mobile
-
only campaigns as 
opposed to bundling it with their desktop campaigns. It enables advertisers 
to move to much more customized mobile experie
nces. They'll have mobile 
landing pages and campaigns that can incorporate location. For example, 
how far away is the advertiser from where you are standing right now? 
These custom
-
made stations, again, get us to the perfect ad on Mobile, since 
users also 
want to have location, or they want to have phone number. We're 
also seeing Click
-
to
-
Call taking off with more than half a million advertisers 
using these features. As a result, the mobile
-
only campaigns are seeing an 
increase of 11.5% when they run a mobi
le
-
only campaign as opposed to a 
bundled mobile
-
desktop.
 
So these are just a few of the examples and the opportunity that we see in 
Mobile. And this overview is just a few and a small set of the many, many 
projects that we are investing in across that. Now
 
back to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Susan. Thank you, Susan and Jeff for this comprehensive look at 
what's going on our core 
--
 
across our core products. What I suggest we do 
now is we turn it back to Jay to give us the instructions on how to get
 
to the 
Q&A and just jump in right into the Q&A, if you don't mind.
 
Question
-
and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Spencer Wang with Crédit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang

Crédit Suisse AG
 
So question on spending for Patrick. I 
think OpEx, excluding tax, was up 
something like 45% year
-
over
-
year. So is this the type of spending that you 
think will be required to sustain a high
-
20% revenue growth going forward? 
Or is this more reflective of near
-
term investment to support some of t
he 
growth initiative you've talked about and spending tapers off at some point 
in the future?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
But there is clearly the effect of the one
-
time salary change for this quarter 
that is flowing through. And in fact, in the increase in salaries,
 
what you 
have is a triple effect this quarter specifically, right? Everybody at Google 
got a 10% salary increase. In addition to that, because it's the beginning of 
the year, the salary increases flow through to many of the benefits, like the 
401(k)s and 
the vacation accruals. So many of the resets that are done in 
the first quarter are disproportionate in additional kind of flow
-
through costs. 
And then finally, we have new Googlers. And the Newglers, I think Jeff made 
a really good compelling case to expl
ain why we're hiring them and then 
how we distribute them. So on the labor side, you clearly have a one
-
time 
step change, but after that, we're going to continue to be in our regular 
momentum. In other areas, if I take marketing, for example, marketing has
 
increased through last year, because we see the great returns. And so for 
marketing, specifically, we continue to 
--
 
we don't expect to slow down our 
marketing, because it is proving such a kind of attractive set of returns both 
for customer acquisition a
nd for key, key products, like Chrome. So for 
those, we're actually going to continue our momentum on them. In many 
areas of the company, we continue to be 
--
 
in like most areas, continue to 
be incredibly disciplined. People have to show up every 90 days t
o complete 
a OCQ process, where we do quarterly reviews to get your next chance [ph] 
for funding. I mean, the discipline of the company has not changed. We're 
just really bullish on our prospects.

We'll go next to James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs

If I could follow
-
up with a couple of questions around expenses. And I'll say, 
we're having some issues downloading the presentation slides, so it'd be 
great if you could repost them at some point. But first of a
ll, Patrick, you 
mentioned in your discussion of OpEx there were some other professional 
expenses in the first quarter. Was that a reference to legal costs or other 
things? And then secondly, when we look at the substantial marketing 
spending around Chrome
, is that like a short
-
term campaign or more of a 
forever wall? And could you talk about what are the strategic benefits to 
Google of consumers adopting the Chrome browser?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay. So let me start with just the professional services and then
 
I'll let 
Nikesh give you a context of Chrome as well. So for OpEx, it's a number of 
areas. We're pushing 
--
 
right now, we're pushing hard on a few areas 
including the GEO product, where we're doing a lot of the mapping 
worldwide. So at the beginning of th
e year, we just kind of ramped up a 
number in there. We also have a couple of other areas. We do have slightly 
more legal expense as well. But also, real estate is the third component, 
where because of the Googlers coming on board, we just need more servic
es 
to support those Googlers. So that's the highest level answer for professional 
services. And for Chrome, if 
--
 
let me give you just a 10
-
second umbrella 
and then I'll let Nikesh give you more color commentary. There's really a 
two story on Chrome. And t
here's a tactical question, and there's a strategic 
question. Chrome is really pushing the web, and it has a fantastic 
opportunity that when people have adopted Chrome, right, they basically 
--
 
instead of looking for Google and looking for Search, the Omni
box gives 
them immediate access to Google Searches. So from a strategic perspective, 
it has that in Chrome OS. And a tactical basis, right, everybody that uses 
Chrome, right, is a guaranteed locked in user for us in terms of having 
access to Google. So may
be, Nikesh, if you have more additional comments 
on the performance of the marketing.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks, Patrick. Just to add to that, I think as Jeff mentioned we have over 
120 million daily users, and 40% of them were added in the past year as a 
result
 
of our marketing efforts. So we've seen the 30% growth quarter
-
over
-
quarter in our Chrome usage. So I think from all perspectives, the Chrome 
strategy is working. And the way we distribute Chrome is people get it 
organically. Or they get it based on our m
arketing efforts. Or they see our 
marketing, and they choose to download it. Or we work with partners who 
help us promote Chrome to our users and to other users. So in that context, 
we found that marketing very often ends up with an equivalent or better RO
I 
than us having to go do partnership deals. Sometimes you'll see that our tax 
and our marketing around Chrome is fungible, where we spend money in 
marketing we take away from tax as it relates to Chrome. So you can expect 
us to continue to drive Chrome st
rategically, because it has not just a 
Chrome
-
specific benefit for us, but it also impacts many of our other 
products that work as part of Chrome. So the lifetime value of a Chrome 
user is phenomenal.
 
Operator
 
We'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Benjamin Schachter

Macquarie Research
 
I was wondering if you could give us, from a high level, the view of how 
Larry views this company differently today, or how we should view it 
differently given Larry's position. Is it going to change in any meaningf
ul 
way?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
In short, look, I think that the company's position has not changed. Google 
is a technology company focused on users and looking for products that can 
affect billions of people. So the very first lens that you have to think through
 
when you think of Google is are we developing computer science helping 
finding answers to problems where billions of people can be served. If you 
think that way, right, Chrome makes sense. Android makes sense. Search 
makes sense. All these things are the 
fundamentals of the company. From 
there, there's very clear that 
--
 
again, to paraphrase an old saying of ours, 
right, the 70/20/10 is very much alive and well. Search is the next billion
-
dollar business. Never forget it. Every quarter you've heard this ti
me, right? 
90% kind of improvement on one side 40% on the other. And like, that's 
one a day, right? That's a lot of engineering work to keep ahead of the 
--
 
but 
these are the next billion
-
dollar businesses. It's in its infancy and so are two 
or three other
 
of our key products, which include Mobile, Display, Enterprise. 
So 
--
 
and then the 10%, well, it's commerce, right? It's local that we all 
know is nascent. It's social that we know also is nascent. And so the 
strategy the company is continuing to be in th
e same core lenses, building 
same products that serve billions of people and to make multibillion
-
dollar 
businesses in the waist up.
 
Benjamin Schachter 
-
 
Macquarie Research
 
Sure. If I could just follow
-
up briefly. I was really trying to get more at the 
fin
ancial model of the company, if there's any meaningful difference now 
that Larry is in this different position. Do you and does he think about the 
financial model in a different way than we had previously?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
No. Build great products and then
 
same financial discipline.
 
Operator
 
We'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Ross Sandler 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets, LLC
 
Yes. I hate to beat the dead horse on the operating expense, but just one 
more follow
-
up question on that. You guys 
have stated that a lot of the 
operating expense uptick has been related to customer acquisition in 
Chrome, and I know there's some salespeople that have been added to the 
platform. But if you were making these investments, do you feel that your 
high
-
20% ye
ar
-
on
-
year growth rate would be achievable? Or do you think 
these OpEx additions are going to be additive in future periods kind of four, 
six, eight quarters down the road?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I think that you have to look at the strategy. You have to take a 
look at the 
strategy in the context of the last four or five quarters, right? Have 
increased in OpEx, but when you look at our trajectory of revenue growth, 
right, going from 23% to 24% to 25% to 27% this quarter, we are really 
funding and accelerating wit
h discipline our revenue growth. That is the 
fundamental. If we don't see a great ROI, you won't see us spending the 
money. We just happen to have great opportunities to fuel. Why not carpe 
diem now? It's there to take. That's really the mindset we put at 
it.

And just one other follow
-
up on that. So the IV came out and said that the 
display marketplace in the U.S. is around $10 billion. So if we double that 
and say global display is $20 billion, you guys would be a li
ttle bit north of 
10% on a run rate basis of the global display. How big can that business be? 
And can you talk about as Display becomes a bigger percentage of total 
revenue, what that has 
--
 
what impact that has on your overall operating 
margin just from 
that mix shift basis?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay, so let me start with the latter and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the 
former. Clearly, Search is a unique product that has very, very high margin, 
right? Because Display is more complex 
--
 
there's more paperwo
rk involved 
even today with Display. It's a somewhat lower margin. It's still a great 
margin product, and it's a product that because of the 
--
 
it's still a very good 
margin product. And so all those dollars I want from an operating margin 
point of view. S
o there is no way we would let that 
--
 
and there's a great 
symbiotic relationship between Display. As take Susan's example, right? 
What was a pure Display Ad before is now embedded in Search. So the 
symbiotic relationship is very important as well. As to t
he total size of the 
market, I'll let Nikesh give you some color commentary.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks, Patrick. I think it's important to look at the advertising market for 
Display in the context of the overall advertising market, which is a $600 
billion to $70
0 billion market globally. And you can go back and say five 
years ago that Display was sort of stalled around $15 billion to $16 billion as 
the market, because we didn't have video in the mix. Now with video, 
everything changes. We have been recently doing
 
some campaign in the 
U.K., where we tried to do some efficiency, YouTube versus television. And 
we found YouTube helps people reach 20% to 24% more consumers in a 
target segment. And you can do that in a dispersed manner. You don't have 
to buy one ad, whi
ch 20 million people look at. You can do that on a literally 
user by user basis. So you are seeing the efficiency of the web applied to 
video, which is going to change the way the entire display market functions. 
And all of our efforts in the last two or t
hree years have been towards 
targeting that market, whether it's all our acquisition in the technology side, 
whether it's all of our efforts in trying to create a multiproduct sales force 
across 50 different countries around the world. We are getting ourse
lves to 
be able to sell Display with special emphasis on rich media and video, which 
is going to help us sort of make that a relevant space in Google. As far as 
--
 
Patrick answered the margin question. But from my perspective, I'm told 
that every profitabl
e dollar or revenue is good.

Could we talk about Google's access to social data? Obviously, you're not 
running a major social network in some geograp
hies. What's your experience 
there? And do you think having access to social data is going to be important 
for having the best query results on the web when you look out three to five 
years?
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
This is Jeff. We do see social as very important. G
oogle uses well over 200 
signals in terms of how we think about ranking today. And when we think 
about identity and relationships, those are our key signals that can and 
should be integrated in the experience. So it is important, but it's one of the 
many t
hat we use. In terms of assets that apply to that, we do have a very, 
very large number of users coming to our door every day. A considerable 
percentage of them are logged
-
in users that are using multiple of our 
products. So there is a large variety of sig
nals that we'll be able to use with 
user support and users seeing value from it to make the overall experience 
better.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I think it's worth 
--
 
just in closing, you've all heard of the launch of +1 a 
couple of days ago or a couple of weeks ag
o. And it's, again, a commitment 
from us to get every signal we can to give the best answer for the users. So 
you should expect continued focus on social as one of the 200 signals and 
just get this rich as possible of an answer across the board.

Patrick, if I could do a follow
-
up. Does Chrome give you any signals that you 
can use and integrate into your Search results?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Maybe Jeff would know the better answer of that, if Chrome gives us 
additional signals on 
social or other types of signals.
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
So Chrome we think will be part of the story over time. Chrome does have 
features where it is personalized today. And for example, the Chrome 
experience, you can essentially sign into Chrome, and it will sync
hronize all 
of your information across different instances across different computers. So 
that is information that, again, with user engagement and users seeing value 
from it, that could be useful.

Two questions. First, Patrick, you talked about taking bold steps to address 
expenses. It's just not obvious in the P&L results. So can you give us any 
examples of what those bold steps are? And then secondly, I know you're 
talking abo
ut social being one of several hundred signals, but is there any 
way to indicate that 
--
 
evidence you've seen so far that indicates that it's 
materially greater than those other variables or just as important but no 
more important than the other variables?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay. So one 
--
 
on the issue of expenses, what you see is the ramp
-
up on 
one side, but I can guarantee you, because we have gone through the 
planning process for this year, that everybody that has a cost center has to 
demonstrate productivity. So in the case of data centers, there's productivity 
requirements that are actually incredibly steep. In the case of the sales 
force, Nikesh could give you kind of a great set of examples that his 
productivity, right? Is kind of 
-
-
 
think of it as, in his case, cost per revenue 
dollar. In the case of [indiscernible] (43:00), it's cost per bps and cost of 
storage. In the case of all staff functions, whether it be in legal, whether it 
be in real estate, whether it be in cost of food, 
whether it be cost of 
transportation, every one of them are expected to have a productivity curve. 
So in this fast
-
growing business 
--
 
like Google is growing, like, from a base 
of revenue of roughly $8 billion, 25% year
-
over
-
year. That's $2 billion of 
reve
nue. And so from that perspective, you have a tide coming with it. But 
under that tide, I can tell you every element of the company is scrubbed and 
scrutinized. So I would 
--
 
I just want to give comfort to our shareholders 
that there is these quarterly rev
iew processes. And these annual unit cost 
continue to kind of haunt many of my managers that when they come to my 
office. On the signaling portion of it, Jeff probably can give more color 
commentary about social versus others.
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
So as mentioned
, it is one of the signals among many that we have. We are 
very optimistic that we'll be able to do great things with better social signals 
over time. At this point, it's a little early to tell, but we regularly measure 
and tune. So we'll be looking forwar
d to that as the experiments continue.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I know that for our shareholders and many analysts on the call, it is top of 
mind for people, when we grow our expenses in the way we have, to ask 
that question. So Mark, I just want to thank you, bec
ause it lays

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.

Could you provide any color on the impacts to the user experience from the 
recen
t Panda changes? Has it impacted click
-
throughs or CPCs on the paid 
ad side? And then in terms of the overall online display industry, would you 
differentiate between drivers? Do you think more impactful ad units are 
driving growth? Or is it more complex d
ata and algorithms and more 
granular targeting?
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
I'll start with the experience of the changes that we've made to improve 
overall quality and promote high
-
quality sites. I had mentioned in my 
comments that on the order of 12% of queries, we're
 
positively affected in 
our view. And that's in terms of our changes that is a pretty significant 
change that has that scope. And we felt very good or confident in it, because 
we were able to measure against the feedback loop that we had of user
-
reported s
ites that they found that weren't as great of an experience. Just to 
confirm, it was web search only, not ads. It didn't have any material 
measurable impact in search ads in either CPC or CTR. We did mention that 
there was some effect on the display networ
k of sites that were essentially 
the receivers of some of those clicks previously, but our focus is, again, 
overall on the user experience, the best possible user experience and long
-
term value. I'll turn it over to Susan on the balance of the questions ar
ound 
the Display Network.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Can you, Brian, give us 
--
 
repeat the question for the second piece?
 
Brian Pitz

UBS Investment Bank
 
Yes. The second piece was in terms of overall online display industry, would 
you guys differentiate between 
--
 
do you think more impactful ad units will 
be driving growth? Or is it more complex data, more complex algorithms and 
more granular targeting?
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Sure. So this is Susan. I'm happy to answer that one. I think in Display 
--
 
I 
mean, what I see happ
ening right now with Display is that we're really at a 
point where there's ability to buy audiences and to do much more specific 
targeting than there ever was in the past. We also have much better tools in 
order to do that and better formats. So I think th
e combination of all of 
these things over time will enable us to have better ads and have them 
much more targeted at the right users. So that's really a combination across 
all of them. It is important to note that really 
--
 
like one thing that 
distinguishe
s our Display strategy is that we are focused on building an end
-
to
-
end platform to enable buying across the Internet for all advertisers and 
for all publishers. And we believe that if we do that and if we do that 
efficiently, that there will be a lot more
 
dollars that will move over, as Nikesh 
mentioned, from off
-
line to online, which is where the users are moving. And 
so we just need to make sure that the systems and the technology can 
support that.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Just to reemphasize, just that last 
point from Susan, there are properties 
that are going to be kind of tuned to Display, right? It's true for YouTube. 
It's true

but the ecosystem itself of the entire web is so much more 
powerful, and that's why we have the strategy we have.

Two questions, please. The first one, was just wondering if tablet operating 
share is important to Google as smartphone share. And given Apple's 
different lower margin pricing str
ategy on tablets, how Google plans to 
influence market share in that category. And then just one follow up.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Sure. Jeff, comments on tablet versus smartphones versus PCs.
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
Yes. This is Jeff. Tablets are doing very well. There's
 
certainly been a lot of 
growth in that segment. And in terms of its dynamics, there are some 
interesting properties where it's really a hybrid between a mobile device and 
a desktop when you look at user behavior and the kind of things that they're 
doing w
ith it. So it sort of falls between the two of those. We are very 
optimistic. Android has some great products coming along. We have the 
Honeycomb operating system that is developed specifically for tablet 
application. The Motorola XOOM is the first device 
that's come along, runs on 
Motorola now. It was the product of the show at the Consumer Electronics 
Show in January. I think you'll see a lot of other products coming along and 
a lot of innovation in the market around tablets and that format. We have 
also 
introduced, just jumping into Ads for a little bit, recently, a feature 
where we can enable advertisers to specifically target tablet devices, which 
we think will also help that segment.

wanted to signal to the employees that social is clearly a signal that is worth 
investing in, and that's why we've made the decision. But we would

Jeetil Patel

Deutsche Bank AG
 
Two questions. When we talk to a lot of your shareholders, I think the 
general view is that Search is such a grea
t business and a phenomenal 
asset. However, it seems like at the same time, there seems to be kind of a 
growing concern that engagement seems to be a bigger theme that seems 
to be winning out of this industry, whether it be from smaller companies that 
have
 
unique products or just different approaches in the marketplace. I'm 
curious, have you guys looked at the 70/20/10 approach to the business and 
rethought maybe the allocation should be shifted a bit towards building 
greater engagement in the business, try
 
to maybe kind of look at how other 
products and services can be integrated in? I guess, that's question number 
one. I have a quick follow up.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Let me give you a mega answer related to that, which is if you think of the 
web in general and h
ow the platforms are growing, right, we would argue 
that where we're focusing our investment is in areas where 
--
 
yes, 
engagement matters. But if you think of where we're putting emphasis in 
local, for example or in Mobile, for example or for YouTube, for 
example, 
right, all of these areas are all about engagement and their engagement 
between advertisers and small, medium businesses and their customers that 
are walking down the street and then adding more signals to the quality of 
their restaurant experienc
e they had or otherwise. It's true for YouTube, 
with so much more different kind of either lean back, with kind of chatting 
and giving kind of ratings. And every one of our products has just naturally 
evolved. And then with 
--
 
again, with Mobile and same t
hing with Chrome, 
we see many of these areas. Engagement is another element of the strategy 
that's kind of pervasive across, but the technology themselves also fuel that. 
So it's kind of a symbiotic relationship between the two. So at the highest 
level, Se
arch itself is so much more engaged today than it was three years 
ago and will be even more engaged in the coming three years. So it's 
absolutely part of the fabric of the strategy we have.
 
Jeetil Patel

Deutsche Bank AG
 
It sounds like we may be missing i
t in that it's engagement through 
frequency of services utilized through everyday life as a consumer as of the, 
say, engagement through just a share of time over one continuous 
spectrum.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Well, you have it across 
--
 
like, when you're in You
Tube, right, the question 
is are you spending more minutes of your day actually on YouTube, and 
that's opportunities for engagement. When you're with your Android phone 
and you're actually living down the street, and you're now in town, your 
engagement opp
ortunities, both in terms of the product that you use and 
the engagement of the additional signals that you get with sharing with your 
friends or otherwise, right, continue to fuel it. But absolutely, the core 
platforms that we have in place will have that
 
as a core element.

So this Chrome

just a quick question on Chrome. But do you

does that 
give you the potential to create unique products inside of Chrome, such as 
obviously, folding in apps from Google, as well as cre
ating digital content 
services within the Chrome environment?
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
Yes. This is Jeff. There is great opportunity in Chrome. You start to see the 
beginnings of that, in that we launched a capability a while ago called the 
Chrome Web Store, which is
 
bringing the same kind of model that we have 
with Android Market to that platform. And there's a tremendous amount of 
innovation that is happening on the web as a platform that we think Chrome 
will be able to take advantage of and be the best on ramp for.

I have two questions. First, on the Mobile opportunity. What do you think a 
Mobile user is approximately worth today on an annual basis? And 
where do 
you think that can trend as you bring in more local and commerce 
capabilities? And then real quick, second for Patrick, how should investors 
think about the financial parameters around potentially larger acquisitions? 
I'm not talking about the lit
tle tech

--
 
as Google 
maybe contemplates some bigger type of company purchases, if you will.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. Who wants to tackle Mobile? Jeff?
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
Yes. So in terms of the specifically quantifying the value of 
a Mobile user 
today, that's not something that I can comment on specifically as of how 
we're valuing them. That said, if you look at the kind of investment which 
we're making, if you look at the focus of the organization, it is something 
that we're very, v
ery excited about. And I think that there is great potential 
there. And if you look at some of just the monetization side of it, there's 
things that we've done around Click
-
to
-
Call ads, if you think about very 
locally targeted ads that is a capability of o
ur platform. The ability to engage 
users where they're at with commercial opportunities, it's tremendous 
overall. So we think that's great. In terms of where it trends over time, 
increasingly the smartphone is becoming an extension of the person. It 
become
s how they do everything, how they communicate, how they're 
entertained, how they're informed. So we think that there will be 
convergence over time between the phone or mobile device and other 
behavior that people are historically familiar with.

Is there an order of 
--
 
if I can maybe follow up on that. Is there an order of 
magnitude that you think can take place from today versus, say, three years 
from now without maybe giving specific numbers?
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Hi, this is Susan. I'm going to answer that one. I mean, I 
--
 
one way I would 
think about that, if I think we're still very, very early on in what Mobile can 
do. But I do think that Mobile will bring completely new ways that we will be 
interacting with mer
chants, with advertisers, with our friends over time, and 
the value of those transactions can be very valuable. But I think what it will 
actually do is it will grow the overall opportunity, the overall pie and enables 
us to interact in new ways. So it's ha
rd at this point to really estimate how 
that will change over time other than we think it's going to grow a lot and 
that there will be new models that we don't have today.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes. So you 
--
 
to summarize these two thoughts together, without li
ke really 
any radical effort 
--
 
let me take the case for Android. That is the platform 
that enabled so much of it. We already announced at the end of Q3 that this 
was $1 billion run rate business, and we tripped into it with people kind of 
adapting what wa
s desktop onto Mobile that was clunky. And it's growing at 
an amazing, blazingly pace in terms of usage. So what you do know is the 
combination of 
--
 
if you think of the areas of Search, of local, of commerce, 
of entertainment and just on Mobile, just 
--
 
w
e tripped into $1 billion. It just 
gives you the sense of momentum for the opportunities ahead of us, and 
that's why we have the focus areas that we have. So that's why we're so 
optimistic about Mobile. Now Jason, if I circle back to your financial 
paramet
ers for larger acquisitions, we're quite disciplined, and we've made 
that comment many times about acquisitions in general at Google. And we 
have a quadrant in which we operate, where you're looking for the perfect 
mix between intellectual properties of gr
eat code, a great team and great 
products at a price that we can afford that we think makes strategic sense. 
So many of 
--
 
like, you hear of all the stories of the acquisitions we make. 
What you don't hear is all the acquisitions that we actually refuse, b
ecause 
they just don't pass our bar. In the case of large transformative ones, we 
look at them all the time, right? If we had one that actually made sense to 
finally accelerate a big piece of our agenda, we would do it. We just have not 
found one yet. And 
so we'll continue to look at it. We have the position to be 
able to jump and make big acquisitions. We just want to make sure that we 
don't have distractions. We have a very focused agenda, and you have to 
have a really good fit, because big acquisitions c
an be a massive distraction 
for Google. Google has a specific culture. It's quite a unique culture. And in 
that context, we want to make sure that if we were ever to make a large 
acquisition, it would have to pass a double bar of not only strategic, financ
ial 
sense, but in addition to that, that it wouldn't become a distraction to the 
company but in fact, accelerate it. That's a pretty high bar to pass.

Oppenheimer & C

Two questions. One for Susan and then kind of a bigger picture question. So 
when we think about the company's ability to grow into local, how important 
is a local sales force? And are we starting to see the impact of adding local 
sales people on th
e expenses? And then secondly, the reorganization, as far 
as under Larry, based on kind of product would make sense, particularly 
where we all believe the Internet's going, when we think about, however, 
like if I look on your Google products page, right? T
here are just still an 
enormous amount of products the company offers, albeit revenue is 
generally concentrated in a few of those products, do you think we'll see a 
streamlining of products available under the new kind of reorganization?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
S
o I'll let Nikesh talk about the local area, where on the sales side, he's been 
kind of spearheading activities. And then I'll give you a conversation about 
the org issues.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Hi. I guess it's important to understand that with millions of adverti
sers who 
we service through our various advertising products, we are constantly in 
touch with small, medium, large business across the board. And most 
recently we've turned on phone support and on
-
boarding and soft landing for 
all of our small advertisers.
 
We do interact with small business. As we have 
products that work more and more with local advertisers, we anticipate 
having a team that works with those advertisers. Now how we do it is still 
something we are constantly debating. In some cases, it works 
really well 
with our existing call centers or our existing teams, which work from around 
the world. It sometimes requires people on feet on the street, which we also 
have in over 40 countries around the world. So we are going to use a sort of 
combination o
f existing sales teams and sales methods and other sales 
teams and sales methods that might be required to drive some of our 
products whether they're in the commerce area, the local area or in the area 
of providing offers to our customers. But more on that
 
as we continue to 
drive those products to our sales.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
For the issue of broad organization, let me make two comments. The first 
one is we are 
--
 
the realignment that Larry talked about earlier on this call 
has been really about an organizat
ion model that we had, where there was a 
end person and a product person for every core of our product and then 
often also a salesperson. And so if you think of having to have two or three 
products to work together, how you end up with sometimes six or nin
e 
decision makers having to align themselves. Larry made a very specific call 
to say for every one of those core product areas 
--
 
and we have one here in 
the room, in fact two, in the room which is Jeff for Commerce and Local. Jeff 
is now the final arbiter
 
and decision maker 
--
 
and that's to drive velocity. 
And by the way, take comfort also that these are 
--
 
the reorg has been on 
all of the core pillars of the company. So the real core issue that we wanted 
to make sure, that Larry wanted to have in place wh
en he kind of launched 
into as CEO is clear decision makers for velocity, and everybody takes 
comfort about that. And for the rest of the smaller ones, right, too early to 
tell. We're just not there yet. We're really focused on the big areas for now 
and th
en when the time comes, we'll cover the smaller areas. That's the way 
we approached it, and we're really thrilled to see the momentum already.

Two quick questions, please. First, starting with Susan. I know you guys 
won't break out absolute dollar numbers, but if we just look at the non

CPC business, I mean with CPM and CPA, can you just help us 
understand or kind of quantify
 
what kind of revenue growth did you see 
either on a year
-
on
-
year basis or on a sequential basis, just to kind of see 
the magnitude of your success there? And then I guess maybe for Jeff, 
Google has been pretty quiet about its video strategy out of YouTube
's

outside of YouTube's user
-
generated content. Does Google have a video 
strategy for non
-
UGC that you can speak to us about?

--
 
let me talk about the latter one first and then let Susan talk 
about the first one. On the non

UGC content, we have made a number of 
addition to the YouTube team that have very specific expertise in that area. 
So you should kind of consider that we have a focus on it, but we have 
nothing specific to announce. Jeff may have additional comments on th
at.
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
Yes, the

with YouTube, YouTube's roots obviously start with user
-
generated content. There's a tremendous both size and activity in the user 
base there. So there's a great asset that we begin with. We are interested in 
long
-
form premium
 
content in the longer
-
term role of YouTube. Another 
area that we're very excited about and we announced an acquisition this 
quarter, a company called Next New Networks, which is signaling intent for 
developing content that is kind of up volume for this ne
w medium that's 
being created. So I think you'll see a lot more of that as well.

paying for ads across Search and Display. And so we 
--
 
with Search, for 
example, we are enabling our advertisers to bid, for example, with a CPA 
target. Then Google will figure out the CPCs 
and the backgrounds. So that's 
one way that was found, for example, has really grown advertisers' spend on 
Search. The Product Listing Ads that I talked about in the script actually 
works with the CPA model. So in Display, we have advertisers who bid on a 
CPC basis, and when they bought they also bid on a CPM basis. Right now 
--
 
and we see advertisers participating in both. A lot of times it has to do with 
the objective of the advertiser in terms of whether they're more 
performance driven or more brand driv
en. As we release more brand 
features, like I mentioned, like the reserve, that will be a CPM feature. And 
so really, what we see is that the bidding is very important, that we want to 
give advertisers a lot of flexibility and how they actually buy it and 
how 
they're able to optimize depending upon their objective. And there's no one 
right way. There's just 
--
 
there's a series of things that we will offer to make 
sure that we have the right product for the advertiser.

Our next question comes from J
ordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus.

Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
 
Sure. A couple of smaller questions. Can you be a bit more specific about the 
magnitude of the disruption in the Japanese search market that you saw in 
the quarter? And 
second, Android, you mentioned 350,000 devices activated 
per day. Can you give us some understanding of how that breaks down by 
smartphone versus tablet and U.S. versus international?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So on Japan, let me make two comments. One is the event
s really shocked 
us as well at Google. And I just want to kind of let the investors know that 
our first and first response to all the events were really to actually help the 
Japanese community. So it was about people finding people and all the tools 
that w
e have for disaster recovery. We spent a lot of time at Google to 
actually focus on the community rather than trying to optimize anything that 
had to do with revenue. Clearly, the month of March has seen some impact 
from revenue, because all of the communi
ty in Japan was focused on the 
events themselves. Tons of searches, by the way, but not monetizable sort 
of searches. Japan is a great market for us, and it was and continues to be a 
very good performing market. So from that perspective when we look ahead 
into Q2 and Q3, the one thing we do know is we've actually asked 
--
 
we 
made a quick search. We asked Hal Varian, our Chief Economist, to look at 
other events that would have occurred in Japan of say kind of that type of 
magnitude to see the resiliency of J
apan. And he looked, for example, at the 
economic recovery after the Kobe disaster of '95. And Japan is actually a 
first
-
world country with a very good infrastructure. So they bounce back 
fast. So although we don't 
--
 
we can't predict how the Japanese econ
omy is 
going to rebound on advertising and 
--
 
what is very clear is they are a first
-
world economy that will recover. So from right now, all we can do is say it's 
already a strong economy for us and a strong market, right? It has had an 
impact in Q1. We ex
pect some impact in Q2 as they try to recover, but it will 
continue to be a strong market for us. So that's on the first 
--
 
on the second 
question. On the first question, why don't I turn it over to Jeff?
 
Jeffrey Huber
 
Yes. So on Android, as mentioned, ove
r 350,000 devices a day are being 
activated, which is just tremendous growth. In terms of breaking out share 
by device or by market, we don't break out share by device. If you just look 
though at where the distribution relationships and partnerships are, 
o
bviously, we've got a great presence in the U.S., strong partners in Europe, 
Japan, Korea. So international is really growing as a component of the 
overall pie. In terms of phones versus tablets, Android is relatively early on 
with tablets. So we have the 
Honeycomb operating system now, which is 
developed specifically for the devices. We've got some great initial devices 
like the Motorola XOOM. But as I mentioned earlier in one of the questions, 
we're seeing just a tremendous amount of innovation in the mar
kets, but I 
think you're going to see a lot more great Android tablet devices soon.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay, we have time 
--
 
we're over time already, so we'll take one last 
question. I just 
--
 
before we take the last question, can I just say that for 
those o
n the call that may be having trouble accessing our financial slides, 
we're working on this issue right now. And it should have been fixed for 
most of the users and will be done very, very shortly. So just to let you 
know. So Jay, let's take our last quest
ion, please.

Our final question comes from Heath Terry with Canaccord.

Canaccord Genuity
 
Nikesh, you mentioned that video is changing everything in Display. Much of 
the video inventory at YouTube is still going unmonetized. What's li
miting 
that, since clearly, the demand from advertisers is there? And is there a 
roadmap you can talk about or a level that you're thinking of in terms of 
getting YouTube to what you would consider full monetization?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think it's important to 
understand we monetize video not just on YouTube 
but also rich media across the Google Display Network. So our intent and 
our hope is to try and monetize video as a format across the various 
publisher partners that we have. So that's our point number one. 
In terms of 
being able to monetize and continue to grow that, you have to understand 
there is a value chain that goes through this. We have to make sure that we 
have the right advertisers, who are excited about this as a medium. I have 
to make sure that th
e creative agencies adapt their creatives to work with 
sort of multiple users. They don't 
--
 
you can't just create one ad, which is 
going to be used on YouTube with 10 million views. You actually have the 
ability to personalize and target them a bit more. 
So the creative industry 
needs to get involved a little bit more in trying to find creative ways, no pun 
intended, to be able to target all the users that the advertisers would like to 
target. But having said that, it is a process of selling. We have the s
ales 
teams in force. We have the technology in place. We have it integrated 
across the technology chain in terms of through our exchanges, through our 
ad serving platforms, et cetera. So we are going down the path [ph] now. 
We're working with the creative 
agencies and the most important, the 
analysis agencies, who actually can prove that there is value in shifting some 
of the dollars in television towards mediums like YouTube and other video 
sites around the world. So we're very happy with the progress we'r
e making. 
We think also that the ducks are in a row. And we hope as we continue to 
see this trend, this trend is going to shift lots and lots more dollars away 
from what is now traditionally television towards what I call IP
-
based video 
delivery.

Thank you, Nikesh. So with that, let me just take two last comments. The 
first one is, as usual, thank our Googlers. I mean, Jeff and Susan and Nikesh 
and I kind of look good here giving you these great results with 27% year
-
over
-
year growth and so
 
many innovations in so many areas of the 
company. It is really the result of our fantastic Googlers working all the time 
on all of these areas. So I would just want to thank them.
 
And also, my last closing notes on Jonathan. Everybody commented on 
Jonatha
n. He couldn't be here today, because it was already planned that he 
had a vacation with his family. So we're glad to have Susan and Jeff with us. 
Clearly, Jonathan's passion for our product is legendary at Google. I don't 
think that the word is too strong
ly stated. He loved the tension between the 
combination of Search and Search monetization. And just to quote him, from 
one of his last times, he said as Search gets better, it actually creates 
another huge challenge for us, which is the ads need to keep pa
ce to get 
better too. Otherwise, what would happen is people will click on fewer ads 
and well that 
--
 
to quote him, well, that would be bad. So as a Jonathan
-
ism 
to close the call, it's very obvious that we keep 
--
 
we just are immensely 
thankful for Jonath
an's contribution and leadership, and we'll keep focused. I 
know that he's going to be overlooking on us to make sure that we keep that 
balance between Search and Ads and all the other innovations.
 
With that, Jay, I will let you close the call. And thank y
ou, everybody, for 
taking the time this afternoon to listen to the story of Q1. We'll talk to you in 
Q2.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. Third Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to 
turn the conference over to Ms. Jane Penner, Head of Investor Relations. 
Please go ahead, 
ma'am.
 
Jane Penner
 
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's third quarter 2011 
earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; 
Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Susan 
Wojcicki, Senior Vi
ce President, Advertising; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice 
President and Chief Business Officer.
 
First, Larry, Patrick, Nikesh, and Susan, will provide us with their thoughts 
on the quarter. Also, as you know, we now distribute our earnings release 
through our I
nvestor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So 
please refer to our IR website for our earnings release, as well as 
supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast 
from investor.google.com. A replay of the call wi
ll be available on our 
website in a few hours.
 
Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking, including statements 
regarding Google's future investments and our long
-
term growth and 
in
novation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level 
of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
 
Please note that these forward
-
looking sta
tements reflect our opinions only 
as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise 
or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward
-
looking 
statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer 
to our 
SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect 
our results.
 
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as 
operating income and operating margin, are also expressed on a non
-
GAAP 
basis 
and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock
-
based 
compensation. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating 
activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash 
flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of no
n
-
GAAP to GAAP measures 
can be found in our earnings press release.
 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.
 
Larry Page
 
Well, thank you, and it's great to be here, and thanks for taking the time to 
be with us today. When I look back over the last
 
quarter, the word that 
springs to mind is gangbusters. Revenue was up 33% year
-
on
-
year, and our 
quarterly revenue was just short of $10 billion, not bad for a 13
-
year
-
old.
 
I'm also incredibly excited about the progress we've made on the product 
side. Ever
 
since taking over as CEO, I had to focus much of my energy on 
increasing Google's velocity and execution, and we're beginning to see 
results.
 
Look at Google+, we had 100 features launched in 90 days, the team is 
really cranking. We had Hangouts on the pho
ne, Hangouts on air, Will.i.am 
did a Hangout from his concert in Central Park. You can now share Circles. 
You can search Google+ and you can play games in Google+. And far and 
most exciting of all, open sign
-
ups, Google+ for everyone.
 
Looking at the number
s for Google+, I was taken aback. I now want to 
announce that we passed the 40 million user mark on Google+. People are 
flocking into Google+ at an incredible rate and we're just getting started.
 
The engagement we're seeing is phenomenal too. Over 3.4 bill
ion photos 
have already been uploaded in Google+. But it's still incredibly early days for 
Google+ because our goal is actually far bigger than the individual feature 
launches themselves. Our ultimate ambition is to transform the overall 
Google experience,
 
making it beautifully simple, almost automagical because 
we understand what you want and can deliver it instantly.
 
This means baking identity and sharing into all of our products so that we 
build a real relationship with our users. Sharing on the web will
 
be like 
sharing in real
-
life across all your stuff. You'll have better, more relevant 
search results and ads. Think about it this way. Last quarter, we shipped the 
Plus, and now we're going to ship the Google part. The new visual design, 
beautiful, consis
tent UIs for Search, News, Maps, Translate, and lots of other 
features, is only the beginning of that process.
 
Last quarter, I talked about focus, and we've made great progress here too. 
To create products that really change people's lives, that they use e
very 
day, 2x or 3x a day, is really hard. So we have to make tough decisions 
about what to focus on or we end up doing things that don't have the impact 
that we strive for.
 
Since we last spoke, we've begun the process of shutting over 20 different 
products
 
including Sidewiki, Google Pack, Google Notebook, and Fast Flip, 
and we'll continue to simplify and streamline our products going forward. 
This prioritization is crucial if we are to really invest in the extraordinary 
opportunities in front of Google toda
y.
 
Let me give you a few examples. Chrome, usage is going through the roof. 
We have now hit over 200 million users and still growing fast. Turns out that 
people really care about getting to the web quickly and securely and having 
a whole ecosystem of apps 
at their fingertips.
 
I'm super pleased with Google Maps, it's a favorite with our users, especially 
on mobile devices. In August, we launched in 40 new countries, taking our 
total to 130 countries. The growth of Android is mind
-
boggling too. Over 190 
milli
on devices have now been activated globally. I'm super excited about 
the soon
-
to
-
be released new version of Android called Ice Cream Sandwich, 
that's right, Ice Cream Sandwich. You won't believe what we managed to get 
done in this release.
 
We're also seein
g a huge positive revenue impact from Mobile, which has 
grown 2.5x in the last 12 months to a run rate of over $2.5 billion. 
Generally, I found that high usage products will make a lot of money over 
time for well
-
managed technology companies, and that's wh
y it's so 
important to run these businesses for the long term.
 
That said, we must never lose sight of the fact that today's revenues and 
growth serve as the engine that funds all of our future innovation. People 
are a crucial part of Google's long
-
term suc
cess, because great companies 
are no greater than the efforts and ingenuity of their employees. So our goal 
is to hire the best people at every level and keep them at Google. Our hiring 
has to be manageable, if we are to balance our short and long
-
term nee
ds.
 
You may have noticed quite substantial hiring this quarter, driven in part by 
a lot of university graduates. Despite the seasonal effect, the total number 
of people we hired was about the same as last quarter. Our attrition remains 
low, which is great,
 
though obviously it contributes to our overall current 
headcount. As I said previously, I continue to believe that our headcount 
growth is the edge of what's manageable.
 
Let me finish by saying that we are still at the very early stages of what 
technology
 
can deliver. These tools we use online will look very different in 5 
years time. We're building those tools now as Google+, which is why I'm so 
excited to be here.
 
So thank you. And again, we had a great quarter. And now I'll turn it over to 
Patrick.
 
Patr
ick Pichette
 
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let 
me first turn to the specifics of our performance in the quarter from a 
financial perspective. Our gross revenue grew 33% year
-
over
-
year to $9.7 
billion and 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Note that while some currency 
fluctuation boosted our revenue again this quarter a little bit, even in 
constant FX terms, our growth rates remain very strong.
 
Our Google website revenue was up 39% year
-
over
-
year to $6.7 billion and 
8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, which trends across most major geographies and 
verticals in fact. Our Google Network revenue was up 18% year
-
over
-
year to 
$2.6 billion and 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
On the one hand, year
-
over
-
year network revenue growth slowed 
slightly 
due to a few factors, including the Search quality changes that we made 
earlier this year that we already commented on. On the other hand, the 
momentum of our Display business, which comprises only part of the 
network line, continues. And Nikesh w
ill have more to say on this in a few 
minutes.
 
Our other revenue was up also 52% year
-
over
-
year to $385 million, and that 
was up 24% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our global aggregate Paid Click growth 
was very strong, up 28% year
-
over
-
year, and up 13% quarter
-
ove
r
-
quarter. 
The corollary, the aggregate cost
-
per
-
click growth was up 5% year
-
over
-
year and down 5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Remember too that, that's an 
aggregate number, which includes both Google.com and our AdSense 
properties. As usual, there's some variab
ility quarter
-
over
-
quarter in these 
metrics but, overall, we continue to be very pleased with our revenue and 
the performance of our ad system. Again, Susan will give you a few more 
comments in a few minutes.
 
So turning to our geographic performance, the U
.S. and rest of worlds are 
growing at a very healthy pace, and our results clearly reflect that. Even the 
U.K. continues to show some positive momentum. In our earnings slides, 
which you'll find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've 
brok
en down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact 
of FX and the benefits from our hedging program. So please refer to those 
slides for the exact calculations.
 
Our revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year
-
over
-
year to $4.4 billion. Our 
non
-
U.S. revenue accounted for 55% of our total revenue or $5.3 billion, up 
41% year
-
over
-
year, which includes a modest $1 million of benefits from our 
hedging program, and this is compared to $89 million benefit in Q3 of last 
year. The U.K. was up 25% to $1 
billion and year
-
over
-
year growth and 
fixed FX still is pretty healthy and would have been 20% 
--
 
or is 20%.
 
Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition growth and costs were 
$2.2 billion or 23.7% of total advertising revenue. And our other cost o
f 
revenue was $1.1 billion, which exclude stock
-
based compensation of $72 
million.
 
Finally, operating expenses, also excluding SBC, totaled $2.8 billion. And 
SBC, itself, totaled $499 million in Q3. So our increase year
-
over
-
year in 
SBC is primarily due to
 
the annual equity refresh, which we do at this time 
of year. And the increase in year
-
over
-
year for our OpEx was primarily due, 
as usual, in payroll, increased professional services and advertising and 
promotion spend. So as a result of all this, our non
-
GAAP operating profit 
was $3.6 billion in Q3, which exclude SBC, and are resulting in non
-
GAAP 
operating margin of 37.3%.
 
Headcount was approximately up by 2,585 versus Q2, ending the quarter 
with 31,353 full
-
time employees. And as Larry already noted, the
re are 2 
factors at work here. Q3 usually has significant headcount additions and this 
quarter is no exception due to a bumper crop of university hires. In fact, we 
had the second
-
highest number of university hires in Google's history this 
quarter. Additio
nally, acquisitions this quarter added a large number of 
people as well. Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q3, flat with Q2, and the 
lower tax rate is driven by a mix of earnings between domestic and 
international subsidiaries.
 
Now let me turn to cash mana
gement. Other income and expense was $302 
million for Q3. OI&E was driven by a strong portfolio management 
performance and, additionally, we saw lower
-
than
-
expected FX cash flow 
hedging expenses due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in September. 
For
 
more details on OI&E, again, please refer to the slide that accompanies 
this call on our IR website.
 
Operating cash flow was very strong at $4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter, 
down from last quarter, to $680 million, and the majority of the CapEx once 
again in Q3 was related to facilities and production equipment. And as a 
reminder, we continue to make these significant investments in CapEx, and 
these have shown to be lumpy from quarter
-
to
-
quarter depending on where 
we're able to make these investments.
 
We're very pleased with our free cash 
flow and consequence of all this, which was $3.3 billion.
 
So before handing it over to Nikesh, I know that many of you have had 
questions about general economic outlook and have been kind of asking us 
those questions.
 
Look, what we're seeing is not terribly surprising or 
different from what you're all seeing, watching on TV, reading in the press. 
And while, obviously, we don't control the economy or the exchange rates 
that fluctuate so much, we do very much control our
 
own operating agenda. 
And that's why we will, as always, stay focused on what we control, our 
agenda for the long term, with the strategy and investments that are not 
calibrated for quarter
-
to
-
quarter views but really designed to create, as 
Larry said, fa
ntastic products that transform our users lives and create 
significant value for our shareholders.
 
With that, let me now hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more details on 
our sales performance in this quarter. Nikesh?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. I
'll give you an update on our business activities. To 
reiterate what Patrick said, we saw strong performance across our portfolio, 
supported by the strength of our products. Our sales, customer support, 
marketing and partnership activities drove $9.7 billi
on in revenue this 
quarter.
 
First, let me talk about the results for our advertising products, then our 
performance by region, and, finally, some highlights from our amazing 
marketing team. On Search, our core desktop Search business maintained 
its momentu
m. Google.com growth was faster than one year ago. Our 
syndicated Search revenue also accelerated this quarter with new large 
global deals contributing to our growth.
 
We're monetizing clicks better by working closely with our clients to grow 
the value of s
earch advertising. What's interesting is, we're increasingly able 
to link search marketing efforts to both online and off
-
line sales with various 
other media. This quarter, we worked with our clients, such as leading 
apparel retailer, H&M, to promote sales
 
through classic search campaigns. 
Additionally, clients like J&J and Sharpie, use search advertising support 
large online branding campaigns on other media, like YouTube and our 
Google Display Network.
 
Moving on to Display. Growth this quarter was robust,
 
with products like 
YouTube and Google Display Network, we're giving advertisers more options 
to engage with their customers online. What's interesting is, we've seen a 
marked increase in our average spending from 2009. 2009, our top 20 
display deals avera
ged approximately $2 million each. Now, our top deals 
are over 7x larger, averaging approximately $15 million each.
 
Some of our biggest display campaigns this quarter came from DreamWorks 
and Disney. We've launched Space Lab, a partnership between YouTube 
and 
Lenovo. It is a video competition for 14
-
 
to 18
-
year
-
olds, in which winners 
will have the opportunity to send a science experiment to the International 
Space Station. So we keep doing interesting things to try and keep driving 
more usage and more reven
ues for YouTube and our Google Display 
Network.
 
We have equally strong traction with our ad agency partners, with whom 
we're very excited about the partnerships we've developed. Just over the 
past 6 months, we've signed display deals of agencies which tota
l almost 
$600 million to help deliver online advertising options to our shared 
customers, which all form part of our Display initiative.
 
Let's turn to mobile advertising. Larry mentioned $2.5 billion as a run rate. 
Our revenue growth continues to accelerat
e even in Mobile, driven primarily 
by mobile search. This growth, obviously, is driven both by the underlying 
expansion of Android devices and of tablets, as well as stellar performance 
of our sales teams who are working closely with our customers to help 
them 
craft compelling mobile advertising solutions. Many advertisers have greatly 
increased the size and frequency of their mobile campaigns. Mobile is 
becoming a must
-
have. This includes clients like InterContinental Hotels 
Group, which spans pretty much 
across our entire portfolio of properties, 
including Mobile search, Mobile GDN and AdMob.
 
Moving our sights to Enterprise. We see continued revenue acceleration in 
our Enterprise business. More companies are fundamentally going Google. 
Our Apps products co
ntinue strong growth with recent app wins, such as 
people like Goodyear and SOFTBANK of Japan. We're particularly excited, 
obviously, also, that we just deployed apps to 450,000 teachers in Morocco.
 
Finally, Chromebooks have been available for purchase sin
ce mid
-
June, and 
we're beginning to see lots of interest and good uptake, both from the 
businesses and educational institutions.
 
Let's switch gears and look at our country performance. If you look across 
countries, we continue to see strong business growth
 
despite uncertainty in 
the global economy. In particular, North America was broadly stable this 
quarter. U.S. revenues have stayed on their gross trajectory, and Canada 
has actually accelerated. In much of Western Europe, we have seen some 
softness in ad 
sales. However, in markets like Spain, we are seeing that the 
sales execution efforts are continuing to keep our revenue stable and, in 
some cases, accelerate the revenue growth.
 
Of course, across Asia and our key emerging markets, we grew much faster. 
Jap
an's post
-
earthquake recovery has continued and it's been driven 
primarily by large advertisers. We also see revenue growth in Australia, 
India, Brazil. They all are strong and they're continuing their strong growth 
trajectory.
 
Finally, let me spend a few 
minutes on marketing and partnerships. Our 
marketing and partnership programs continue to help scale and grow usage 
of our products. Start, we're very proud of our Get Your Business Online 
program. This is a campaign which, basically, we work with our part
ners, we 
help small businesses and bring their companies online. This is great for the 
business, this is great for the economy, and this is great for future ad 
spending.
 
So during Q3, we helped 7,000 U.S. businesses get online in places like 
Texas, Vermont
, Kansas and Missouri. We also drove multiple customer 
launches this year. Our teams have helped expand the footprint for Google 
Offers, our deals business to about 11 cities in the U.S. after our pilot last 
quarter in Portland.
 
Additionally, we continue t
o grow Chrome user base, which I talked about, 
the penetration continues to grow with our campaign called a Better Web 
campaign. We've laid the foundation for Chromebooks, which I talked about. 
If you haven't had a chance, if you fly Virgin America, you mi
ght have the 
opportunity to surf on a Chromebook in
-
flight.
 
Finally, we've been supporting the growth of Google+, which we're very 
excited about, building a richer user experience by connecting users to 
public figures, celebrities, including Will.i.am from
 
right onstage, Britney 
Spears, Richard Branson, just to name a few.
 
In closing, we had a phenomenal Q3 and we hope to continue the good work 
for our customers, partners and users in Q4. I will now turn over to my 
partner and colleague, Susan, who will dis
cuss the product performance of 
this quarter.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
Thanks, Nikesh. Let start by talking about Search. We had another great 
quarter for Search quality with over 100 launches. We improved our preview 
feature so that when you hover your 
mouse over a search result, a large 
thumbnail of the site appears on the right. We also expanded the site links 
feature to include more links, with full snippets for each link.
 
A good example of this is when you search on Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
You ca
n see links to exhibits, the store, and general information. What I love 
about features like these is they magically make Google easier to use.
 
The same goes for our new speedy Flight Search option. When you enter a 
query like SFO to JFK, and then click on
 
the Flight link on the left
-
hand side 
panel, you can see all the different flight options. You can sort it in a variety 
of ways, airline, pricing, nonstop, times, and bring up a map that shows the 
flight route and other potential destination and prices. F
light Search 
combines IT expertise with Google technology. We are still very early with 
the product. Think of this first version as the takeoff, not the final 
destination.
 
Turning to our Ads business. As Patrick mentioned before, our revenue 
growth was ver
y strong. We are pleased with the Paid Click growth, which 
increased this quarter while keeping ad quality high. After a number of 
quarters of strong CPC growth, we continue to see year
-
on
-
year CPC growth. 
As we have said in the past, these average CPC met
rics incorporate a 
number of factors, including mix effects such as Mobile and emerging 
markets, as well as true changes to keyword prices. It's also important to 
look at clicks and CPC metrics together, since more clicks can often lead to 
decreases in ave
rage CPC and vice versa.
 
We also made a number of improvements to our core advertising product. 
Starting with the local and the small business market, we launched AdWords 
Express in the U.S. and started product trials in the U.K., Germany, and 
France. Ther
e are a lot of businesses who want to advertise online, and they 
haven't done so because they're too busy running their business. AdWords 
Express makes it possible for these businesses to start running an ad 
campaign in just a few minutes. The advertiser g
ives us some basic 
information, and we do all the rest. The keywords and the bids are 
automated.
 
We're excited about this product because we believe it's the first time we 
successfully simplified all aspects of AdWords, while keeping its effectiveness 
for 
local and small businesses. And the results, so far, are quite positive with 
our advertisers.
 
With regard to the local market, we also expanded Google Offers to 11 
cities. The latest launch was in Miami last week. On the other end of the 
spectrum are large
 
businesses and agencies. We made a number of 
significant improvements to Google Analytics this quarter, since we know 
that when site owners have more insight into site traffic and better 
information about how to optimize their campaigns, they tend to incr
ease 
their spend.
 
This quarter, we launched multichannel funnels in Google Analytics. This 
gives marketers aggregate information and insights into the full path to 
conversion, including clicks from paid and organic searches and display ads, 
not simply the 
last click. So advertisers can tell which marketing and ad 
programs are working.
 
We also added real
-
time reporting to Google Analytics so that marketers and 
publishers can see what is happening on their site right now. This is 
especially useful to measure 
the immediate impact of social media. So if you 
put up a new blog post, or you send out a Google+ update, you can instantly 
see what happens to your site traffic. We also launched a premium version 
of Analytics with more data, advanced tools, dedicated sup
port, and service 
level guarantees.
 
Nikesh mentioned how well things are going with display advertising. From a 
product perspective, we'd like to highlight interest category marketing. 
We've completed rolling it out to all advertisers at the end of Q2. And
 
since 
then, thousands of advertisers have signed up and the annual run rate has 
doubled. With interest categories, we look at the types of pages a user 
visits, and associates their browser with relevant interest categories, such as 
ecotourism, mobile phon
es, or hybrid cars. Then advertisers can show that 
user relevant ads across all types of sites. Users can opt out at any time, but 
the results of interest category ads is that they are more useful to users and 
more effective for advertisers, which, in turn
, leads to higher returns for 
publishers.
 
We are making it a lot easier for advertisers to set up and manage video ad 
campaigns on YouTube, and the Google Display Network, as well. We began 
beta testing AdWords for Video, which integrates video buying camp
aigns 
directly into the AdWords interface.
 
The momentum around Google+ is starting to apply to our ad products as 
well. Users can now +1 Display ads on the Google Display Network, and 
we've had +1 buttons on search ads and results since the end of Q1. 
Alth
ough it's still pretty early, our data shows us that ads and results that 
are socially annotated are more relevant for users.
 
And finally, we shipped Google Wallet to Sprint Nexus S 4G phones and 
started working with Visa, American Express, and Discover as
 
partners so 
their cards could be added to future versions of the apps. This morning, I 
bought my latte using my phone as a wallet. I'm looking forward to leaving 
my traditional wallet at home in the future.
 
That's it for now. Thanks, and back to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Susan. So we'll circle back with Jamie to open up the call and

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brian Pitz with 
UBS.
 
Brian J. Pitz

UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
 
I've noted the proliferation of newer, richer ad formats, like product listing 
ads. C
an you help us understand the impact on your financial model? Are 
they more or less profitable to you? And then secondly, on your comments 
on Western European ad sales softness, is the softness across all formats or 
are Mobile and display holding up genera
lly better?
 
Larry Page
 
I think I'll ask Nikesh to answer that.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes. I think we are constantly improving search as well as improving our ad 
formats. So if you look at our revenues, we will always be trying to drive 
new ad formats to our custome
rs because we believe they are better, they 
provide better information, both to the user as well as they're great for the 
advertiser. Effectively, I'm not going to comment on the profitability of the 
ad formats except for the fact that they're great for us
ers and advertisers; 
and good ads are delivered, and users click on them more, obviously, it will 
have an impact on the financial end. I'll let you figure that one out. In terms 
of my comment on Western European ad sales, it was more of a relative 
comment 
vis
-
a
-
vis prior quarters as opposed to an absolute comment about 
softness. Generally, we're seeing that the economic impact in some of those 
markets might flow through to some of these things, but it's just mildly soft. 
We're generally comfortable. General
ly, queries are growing up. People are 
happier with Mobile, people are happier on Display. We're seeing Search 
query growth. So it's a bit of a mix across
-
the
-
board, but it should not 
--
 
it's 
just slight softness, not weakness.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next t
o Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
On that paid click growth, that's a real sharp acceleration but the organic 
revenue growth didn't sharply accelerate. So could you just provide some 
color on that? Is that just this market shift towards Mobile searches? What's 
driving that? And secondly, w
hat's behind that other revenue that really 
spiked as well?
 
Larry Page
 
I'll let Susan take that. Susan?
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
Yes. So there were certainly a number of factors at play in terms of the CPC 
and the Paid Click growth. But the most important thing t
hat I want to 
emphasize is that it's really important to look at these 2 factors together. 
Since they often move in reverse from one another. The other thing is there 
certainly was a mix factor where we do see changes in our mix, and that 
sometimes does ha
ve impacts on how our CPCs are 
--
 
how the aggregate 
ones are being affected.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Just on other revenue, let me comment on other revenue. It really is the 
year

year impact of ITA. So, Mark, that's really the key issue there.
 
Operator
 
And we'll

Just 2 quick ones, if I could. First, Larry, on the $2.5 billion Mobile run rate 
revenue, could you give us a rough sense of how much of that is Mobile 
search v
ersus Display, perhaps? And then the second question relates to the 
people strategy. Given, Larry, what you said about being at the edge of 
what's manageable, should we expect headcount growth to moderate in 4Q 
and into 2012? And are you contemplating any 
sort of adjustments to base 
salaries as you saw earlier this year?
 
Larry Page
 
Yes. And I think that we're not going to break out more than we've already 
given you there. So we thought it was important to show the tremendous 
success of our business, and so 
we want to give you a nice milestone for 
that, but we're not going to break out more data. And also, on headcount, 
like I said, I think I had already said we're at the edge of what's manageable 
in terms of our headcount growth and you see our numbers are, 
as I said, 
were consistent with last quarter. I think we are always running our business 
very carefully and prudently, and making sure we're investing in the right 
places. And we make those kind of decisions every day. And we don't give 
guidance on what we
're going to do in the future.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Benjamin A. Schachter

A couple of questions. First, could you discuss the strategy around video 
content? It seems to me there's sort of UGC prem
ium and then all the stuff 
in between. Is that how you're thinking about it? And if it is, how are you 
thinking about emphasizing each area? And then just quickly on emerging 
markets, you mentioned India and Brazil. Any chance you can quantify some 
of that
, how fast are these markets growing? How big are they overall? Are 
these top 10 markets, how big are they in the overall scheme of the 
different countries?
 
Larry Page
 
Ben, I think we think about 
--
 
certainly, YouTube is just tremendously 
successful. It's 
going gangbusters in every way. And we see that site is 
redefining the way we think about video. And I'd also note that it's very 
small percentage of people's overall video usage still. So we see 
opportunities for tremendous growth there. I think the other
 
interesting 
thing about YouTube is it really blurs the lines between the kinds of content 
you're talking about. You can move from one type of content to another very 
easily. And we're finding our users don't really think about it that way. They 
think abou
t having a great user experience. And we see it as serving our 
users well, and serving all the content creators well, regardless of their size. 
And that seems to be working great for us. And for the second part, Nikesh 
will take that.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes. We'
re not going to break out the numbers for India and Brazil. But what 
I can give you directionally is both of them are very, very important markets 
for us. Our products are successful. You see search traffic continuing to rise. 
YouTube is very popular. Chro
me is very popular. So really, we're very 
happy with the usage of our products, and we believe there's tremendous 
sort of runway in product usage in those markets because of the changing 
characteristics of those markets, both from an online penetration per
spective 
and the economic growth perspective of those markets. So with that sort of 
tailwind behind us, we have great teams on the ground, which are driving 
businesses to come online. And we're seeing tremendous growth in the ad 
side, pretty much across
-
th
e
-
board and Display, Search and Mobile. So 
we're very, very happy with the success of those markets, with the progress 
of those markets. I'll just give you that as a directional statement.

But I wanted to ask if you could give us a sense for how much growth in 
Mobile impacted Paid Click growth this quarter and how sustainable you 
think that level is? And also, if you could just tel
l us a little bit on the 
progress you're seeing in narrowing the gap between CPCs between Mobile 
and traditional search.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
Yes, this is Susan here. So first of all, we don't really break out how Mobile 
impacted any specific part of Paid gro
wth or CPC. I will say that our ad 
system is designed to be very flexible. There are always lots of different 
factors at play that we see changing in terms of users, queries, advertisers, 
bids. And so, really, we are designing our ad system to be as flexib
le based 
on what we're seeing at that specific moment. In terms of narrowing the gap 
between 
--
 
in CPCs of Mobile and traditional search, we see a lot of 
opportunity for us to continue to grow Mobile. And for example, advertisers 
having landing pages that 
are mobile
-
enabled, we can continue to improve a 
lot of our algorithms. So we see opportunity for us to continue to improve 
that over time.
 
Larry Page
 
Yes. And I would mention too, Heather, that the mobile phones are just 
getting amazing. You'll see our 
work there, and other people's works in 
coming out, that I think that your experience on phone could actually get to 
be better than your experience on a computer. I mean, the phone knows 
where you are, and can help you even when you're mobile and so on. So
 
I 
definitely 
--
 
we definitely see that the experience on mobile improving 
greatly, especially with Android.
 
Susan D. Wojcicki
 
We've introduced a number of formats, just kind of building on Larry's point. 
So we have advertisers, we can give location. We ca
n actually say, if you 
search on one specific store, that store is 0.1 miles from where you're 
located right now, with a map. Or include a phone number, when you click 
on the phone number, then that's like a CPC. So we're seeing that there are 
a lot of for
mats that we can really optimize for mobile, which will make for a 
great user and advertiser experience.

Larry, I know you hav
e to be careful because of litigation, but maybe you 
could help us understand what steps Google can take to help defend the 
Android ecosystem on a big picture basis? There's a lot of questions about 
some licensing threats out there. And then, secondly, may
be this is for 
Patrick. Can you tell us what verticals performed well in the quarter? I know 
you've been able to do that in the past. But which verticals really did well in 
the quarter and maybe others that might have been a little slower?
 
Larry Page
 
I thi
nk we are very, like I mentioned, we are very excited about Android. 
And we see our partners and that whole ecosystem continuing to grow 
hugely. And while there's been lots of people trying to attack that and so on, 
we see absolutely no signs that, that's 
effective. And ultimately, we think 
that other companies' actions there will alienate their customers and their 
relationships with the other companies. So if anything, we see our strategy 
is getting stronger there. Obviously, we announced our intention aro
und 
Motorola, and we're serious about protecting the Android ecosystem, making 
sure that, that continues to be incredibly successful. But we feel good about 
our efforts there.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
And on my side, Justin, look, we were 
--
 
again, quite a reflect
ion of the 
economy around us. So the U.S., some of the verticals that have been 
stronger, right, travel, auto, you go to rest of world, interestingly retail, 
which is not as strong in the U.S. than it would have been in rest of the 
world because there's mo
re activity in real estate and in retail in rest of 
world. In the case of the U.K., automobiles have been kind of particularly 
strong. And so these are the kind of verticals, again, they are a snapshot 
and reflection of the economy around us. And maybe Nik
esh has kind of 
more color commentary on it.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
No. I agree with everything Patrick said. I think the only, sort of nonsecular 
event that's happening, is that we are continuing to see strength in the CPU 
verticals. Because we are doing well on Di
splay and CPG have traditionally 
verticals that advertise more in display. So there was a bit of a opportunity 
there, whereas search wasn't their prime focus, but those guys are doing 
really well with the Display offerings we have for them. But I agree wit
h 
Patrick with everything else.

Two things. First, one business you didn't really talk about was Google 
Offers. I was hoping you could add som
e more color there in terms of your 
strategy and what you think you can do differently in this space. And then, 
secondly, I know this is probably tougher but just related to MMI. We've 
obviously seen examples in the past around CPTN and Intel and McAfee, 
a
round writing in concessions in certain ways. Is that something that Google 
would potentially be willing to do, in terms of licensing patents, to open 
source software and then, also, delivering product updates and roadmaps at 
the same time as for MMI?
 
Larr
y Page
 
I think Nikesh will take the first question there.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I guess it's early days for Google Offers. As I mentioned, we have expanded 
from one Portland trial to over 11 cities in the U.S. And we are leveraging 
some of the sales efforts we alre
ady have with our Ads business. We are 
leveraging our relationships with small, medium sized businesses. Google 
Offers, for us, is just one part of the overall opportunity to work with SMB. 
So it's early days. We're very happy with the progress we've made 
so far. 
You might have seen us launch Google Wallet, which is also a part of an 
enablement strategy for that. So, so far so good, very pleased with the 
progress so far.
 
Larry Page
 
Yes. As you know, Motorola deal is under review, and I think it would be 
pre
mature for us to comment about anything we might do with regards to 
that.

And our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott W. Devitt

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
Just had 2 questions. In certain areas like shopping, 
payments, travel, 
reviews and mortgages, the company seems to continue to get deeper into 
the purchase funnel or closer to the actual transaction. And Susan, you 
noted the ITA example on the call. I was wondering if you could talk a little 
more broadly abo
ut this more vertical approach, the benefits of it, and the 
categories that you're particularly focused on. And then secondly, noncash 
stock
-
based comp, I think was up 31% sequential and 50% year
-
over
-
year. 
Patrick, you noted the annual grant. I was just w
ondering if this is the new 
run rate or if there is something one
-
time or, potentially, there's been a 
change in the cash versus noncash comp.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Why don't I answer the last question first and then flip it over to Susan. I 
mean, you're 
seeing the full year impact of our salary raises last year 
flowing through in all aspects of our compensation. So when we did the 
equity refresh this quarter, obviously, it's augmented by the fact that people 
have 10% more salary and all of the corollary i
ssues around it. So it is a 
onetime item but you're changing the plateau, if you wish, and then it will 
flow through into the next year and then it will stabilize itself. That's the best 
way to think about it. And then on the issue of the verticalization, 
I'll have 
Larry take a crack at it, please.
 
Larry Page
 
Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think that we really think about Google as providing 
the exact right answers when you need them. And those things are not 
necessarily particular websites or whatever. They're ac
tually 
--
 
maybe 
actually trying to get a very specific piece of information, like you do with an 
airline ticket, for example, as we were talking about. So I think we see this 
as a general instance of a problem, of just making search work better across 
anyt
hing you might want to be able to do. And we're pursuing that in a lot of 
different areas, and have our whole history, basically. So I think you'll see 
us do a better job of providing a great user experience on more and more 
specific things over time. And 
that's what we do, when we make a better 
search engine.

And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
I've got 2 questions. First, a quick follow
-
up on Android. So we've seen
 
some 
of the Android partners now agreeing to pay Microsoft licensing fees. So in 
order to protect the ecosystem, is Google planning on subsidizing a portion 
of these fees? Or is there 
--
 
how does that strategy play out? And then 
second question on Google 
Wallet. Is the long
-
term plan here to partner with 
other financial transmitters, like PayPal and maybe their credit card 
networks for some of the heavy lifting in the payment space? Or does 
Google plan on kind of vertically integrating with the banking sys
tem to offer 
customer service and risk management around transactions for the Google 
Wallet customers?
 
Larry Page
 
I think that maybe I'll answer it in just kind of a general way. Rather than 
seeing, for example, Microsoft compete in the 
marketplace with their own 
smartphones, they've really continued resorting to legal measures to hassle 
their own customers, right? So it seems kind of odd. And we haven't seen 
the details of those total agreements, and I suspect that our partners are 
makin
g good deals for themselves there. And so while there's a lot of press 
around that, we're really looking forward to our announcements with 
Samsung next week, which I think will be very exciting. And like I said, we 
see Android going gangbusters, and we don
't see anything that's going to 
stop that. On your second question about Google Wallet and so on, I think 
we're very early. We just released a phone with Sprint, the Nexus S with 
Sprint, that's sold out and has had tremendous demand. And we think that 
the 
customers who have gotten that experience are amazingly excited about 
it. And like Susan mentioned, she can buy her coffee that way. And that's an 
amazing experience, and we're just at the very early stages of that.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
A couple of questions. Can you talk about in the Mobile business as a whole, 
how do you structure some of the revenue sharing agreements that you 
have on the advertising side relative to in
-
browser searches? And I guess, 
who is it, typically, that you're typically paying for that distribution, the 
wireless carriers, the handset vendors, and how do you see that evolve 
going forward? And then I have a quick follow
-
up around kind of vertical 
int
egration. You've seen companies launch new devices, hardware
-
wise, to 
layer on top of some of the content and applications they sit on. You've 
obviously looked at Motorola now, and you're stacking from hardware OS 
into the applications environment. Do you 
think that, as you look at mobility, 
the world 
--
 
there's a unique opportunity to develop a much richer, deeper 
relationship? And I guess maybe a little bit more elaboration on the vertical 
integration there that you're looking at.
 
Larry Page
 
Yes, I mean, 
I think it's an exciting time. There's a lot of innovation going on 
in different business models and so on. I think we're very excited about our 
Android ecosystem and the growth of that. And I think we have very, very 
successful strategy there, as you see 
from the numbers that we talked 
about, over 190 million devices, and growing quickly. So I think there's 
many 
--
 
you're asking about different kinds of structures but we're very, 
very excited about the structure we have now, and about continuing that 
growt
h and continuing to evolve that platform ecosystem. And maybe Nikesh 
can take the second part there.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think Larry's right. There are many interesting models out there. As you 
know, Android is an open ecosystem, and our Mobile strategy is a ve
ry 
partner
-
focused strategy. So in many cases, we work with various partners 
to deliver the experience to the end user. And there are different partners, 
there are different value they bring to the equation, whether it's distribution, 
whether it's making G
oogle Search part of their services, whether it's 
allowing us to be an ad
-
serving platform there. So each of the relationships 
are slightly different, and they have different negotiated deals with them. 
But generally speaking, I think we believe there's a 
fair value transfer to 
whoever in the ecosystem brings value to the table. And we get our fair 
share for providing services in that ecosystem.
 
Larry Page
 
We've been very successful with these models on the web, and we have a lot 
of experience with it, and 
I think we're good at doing those kind of deals.
 
Jeetil J. Patel

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
It seems like owning content, at least in the Mobile space, seems to be a 
differentiator. Is that something that you'd possibly look at longer term? Is 
t
hat owning more the content structure out there?
 
Larry Page
 
I think, again, we're not going to comment on what we might or might not 
do. I think that we've had very, very successful models for a long time 
without owning content. And I think many of the mod
els of you see don't 
involve people owning content but actually selling it or distributing in various 
ways. And I expect that will continue.

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research

One of the threads that drew a lot of these questions in the Mobile market 
is, how do you increase monetization, and kind of where we're at. And I 
think one of the things I'd love to get your view on is where we are in the 
process of bringing tog
ether some of the disparate local services? How does 
Offers intertwine? And when does that sort of take on a little bit more of a 
unified feel versus sort of a set of one
-
off products that a user would use?
 
Larry Page
 
Jason, I think that's a great 
question. I think that 
--
 
I think first thing to 
keep in mind is that we're still very early in the Mobile business, and you see 
it's incredibly exciting business. There's a lot of activity. The user 
experiences are getting tremendously better, just growin
g like crazy. And 
there's a lot of economic activity and so on. So we've done well by having a 
long
-
term view about it. And I think that we also sort of want to balance 
having total integration with really fast iteration and fast progress and 
experimentati
on. And I think you definitely, I mentioned our unified look and 
feel that we've rolled out on Google which I'm very excited about, and we'll 
continue to do things like that, that really unify experience and make it more 
intuitive for people. But we're als
o going to do some experimentation, also, 
on new things, and then have a little bit less integrated. So it's always a mix 
of that. I think that offers, specifically, we think about our local business as 
being how do we help merchants and users, users like 
yourselves, get really 
good information and help the merchants get the right users at the right 
time and for the right amount of money, and so on. And that's a very hard 
problem across a whole bunch of different areas, basic information about 
merchants' in
teraction with between the merchants and the end users. And 
we have things going on in all of those spaces. And it's going to be a mix of, 
again, rapid iteration and also the integration of those things into, then, a 
more cohesive whole. And I'm very excit
ed about that space.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays 
Capital.
 
Anthony J. DiClemente 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I have 2. The first question is for Patrick or Susan. You cite your Mobile 
business as
 
a run rate, which was very helpful. I was wondering if you could 
do the same for your Display business, particularly interested in YouTube, 
and so if you could comment on pricing and volume trends at YouTube in the 
quarter, at least directionally, that wi
ll be helpful. And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So we, as you know, we don't provide any guidance. We had this 
extraordinary moment this quarter in Mobile where we had a confluence of 
so many things going on. And that we thought it was on a on
etime basis, 
again, appropriate to kind of provide number of users, the Android 
ecosystem that's going gangbusters. And therefore, it was, we thought, 
appropriate to kind of round it up with kind of a snapshot of where we stand. 
So for that reason, right, 
and because of the competitive nature of the 
environment in which we are, we don't divulge typically these numbers, and 
you shouldn't expect us to actually give you more information in the future 
on them, whether it be Display, or Mobile, or others. In the
 
case of YouTube, 
it's the same thing. I mean, as Larry said, we're incredibly pleased about the 
growth of YouTube, whether it be the number of videos viewed a day, the 
revenue growth rates, the performance overall of the content, and the ad 
system within 
it. So I mean, all I could say is this is a really, really kind of 
well
-
growing property for us in which we are really excited.
 
Anthony J. DiClemente 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Okay. And then just for Larry, I'm just wondering if you could comme
nt on 
your broader media strategy. Unlike traditional cable providers, the Google 
platform isn't limited by geography. It's not limited by the contiguous 
networks or territories. So I just wonder 
--
 
there's been some conversation 
in the marketplace about a
 
multichannel video offering in the U.S. to 
supplement your media product. And so I was just wondering if you could 
talk a little bit about that, even just philosophically, that would be helpful.
 
Larry Page
 
It's hard to talk about what we might do in the f
uture, again. But I think, in 
general, I just think there's a lot of opportunity in providing better services 
for end users around media. And you see that, I mean, there's tremendous 
growth in all these businesses that are doing that. And I think we're, 
ob
viously, in a good position to help users find the content and the media 
and so on that they're looking for. And we're in a great position to also help 
those companies, and publishers, and authors, and content creators to find 
the right users, and get paid
 
both through advertising and directly. And so I 
think that's just a logical place for us to be in, and a logical place where 
you'll see a lot of activity in general.

Two questions. First, you'd talk about shutting 20 products and you've got 
some further products in Q1, I believe. Is there any way you can give us 
sort of a percentage in terms of how much resource that opens up? 
Is that 
sort of a 10% increase, or any kind of color you can give us there. And then 
second, at what level of Google+ users do you need to see a material 
improvement in ROI and Search, and really move the needle for the 
business there, just maybe in terms 
of active users?
 
Larry Page
 
Yes, I think those are great questions, Jim. I think that I'm not prepared to 
give you specific numbers about projects we shut down or whatever, but I 
will tell you, it's been a pretty significant effort, we've had to really 
str
eamline our business and we've made, like I said, tough decisions about 
where we should be focusing so that we really can generate amazing 
products and businesses. And those are not easy decisions. So I think 
there's significant resources involved in the k
inds of things we're talking 
about. And it's also 
--
 
it's a fair amount of work, also, for us to just go 
through those 
--
 
that process. But I'm excited about that increased focus for 
us. I think, as I mentioned on Google+, I think we're seeing tremendous 
g
rowth, which I'm very excited about. We're still very, very early. It's been 
out just slightly more than one quarter now, and not even fully open until 
--
 
only for a very small part of that. So I think we're very early in that. But on 
the other hand, I enc
ourage you to all try Google+, and sign up, and flock to 
it. And you'll find that you will see data on search about what other people 
are doing. You'll see someone had +1'd something or so on. And I think 
those things can be very meaningful to you as a use
r. So I have no doubt 
that there'll be significant impacts from that.

Just 2 brief ones. First on Chrome a
nd your efforts there to expand 
penetration. Can you talk about the specific drivers of growing distribution, 
adoption, maybe how we might expect this to impact margins over time? 
And then, secondly, the growth in the Google Site revenues. I wonder if you 
can add just a little bit of color there on the specific uptick, if that's an 
acceleration from a Display on YouTube as well as Mobile, or is that core 
search
-
related?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I'll take the latter, and then maybe Nikesh will cover the Chrome. On t
he 
latter, the answer is yes. Yes, yes, and yes. So yes, YouTube; yes, mobile; 
yes, format. And I mean, that's why you see such an acceleration of our 
revenue, and that's why we're so excited about it. And maybe Nikesh, if you 
have comments on the Chrome a
nd our penetration and how it's working.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I'd love to answer the question like that, like yes, yes, yes. But 
unfortunately, that's not how the question is phrased. As far as Chrome is 
concerned, as we have talked about in previous quarters, Chr
ome is very 
strategic for us because we believe it is a phenomenal user experience and a 
user benefit. It just improves the user browsing experience so 
phenomenally. And we believe that it's important that Chrome be 
distributed, shared, with almost every u
ser around the world. And a lot of 
our marketing efforts, and distribution efforts, have been focused around 
getting Chrome in the hands of our users. We are doing distribution with 
partners. Our partners encourage people to download Chrome. We are doing 
d
istribution where we do direct advertising to consumers to get them to 
download Chrome with a clear user benefit of better browsing, better video 
watching, and better security. So we are doing a lot of that. I think, I'm not 
going to comment on the margin 
part, but you have to understand, a great 
consumer experience from Google as part of Chrome makes Google 
--
 
makes users use more Google services. So from that perspective, we're very 
happy with the distribution strategy we have on Chrome. And we don't see 
any abatement of that strategy.

Good day, and welcome, everyone to the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to 
turn the call over to Jane Penner, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please 
go ahead, 
ma'am.
 
Jane Penner
 
Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to today's Second Quarter 2011 
Earnings Conference Call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer;

So let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking, including statements 
regarding Google's future investments in our long
-
term growth and 
innovation, 
the expected performance of our business and our expected level 
of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note 
that these forward

activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash 
flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP t
o GAAP measures 
can be found in our earnings press release.
 
With that, I will now turn the call over to the Larry.
 
Larry Page
 
Well, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. 
It's really exciting to be with you today and share di
rectly with you the 
progress we have made in my first quarter as CEO.
 
As you will see from our press release, we had a great quarter, with revenue 
up by 32% year
-
on
-
year and a new record for quarterly revenue at over $9 
billion. We've substantially increas
ed our velocity and execution this quarter, 
which is a key goal of mine since taking over as CEO. So I created a new 
product focus management structure, with clear leaders responsible for each 
area.
 
The new management team is working together fabulously an
d has already 
achieved a lot in just these 3 months. First of all, I want to talk about 
Google+, which we launched a field trial invitation only. Our goal at Google+ 
is to make sharing on the web like sharing in real
-
life, as well as improve the 
overall Go
ogle experience.
 
Circles lets you choose with precision who you're sharing with, not 
surprisingly this has been very well received, because in real life, we share 
different things with different people. Hangouts allows for serendipitous 
interactions. Like 
in real life, when you run into a few friends, gives you 
seamless and fun multiuser video, and it's really amazing.
 
Last quarter, we launched the +1 button in search results and ads, enabling 
users to recommend stuff they like and to have those recommendat
ions 
show up in the search results of people they know. This quarter, we released 
the +1 buttons to the entire web and many sites like Huffington Post, The 
Washington Post, and Best Buy has added +1 buttons. Google+ is still in 
field trial with limited acc
ess as we scale the system. Users have to be 
invited and sign up with a profile in order to use it. However, the growth on 
Google+ has been great, and I'm excited to release some new metrics for 
you today.
 
Over 10 million people have joined Google+. That's
 
a great achievement for 
the team. There's also a ton of activity, and we are seeing over 1 billion 
items shared and received in a single day. Our +1 button is already all over 
the web, and it's being served 2.3 billion times a day. So while we still have 
a lot of work still to do, we are really excited about our progress with 
Google+.
 
Google+ is also a great example of another focus of mine, beautiful products 
that are simple and intuitive to use, and actually was one of the first 
products to contain our n
ew visual redesign. We also launched that 
beautiful, consistent and simpler design on our homepage, Gmail and 
calendar, with many more products soon to come. Reader focus has also 
been another big feature for me this quarter. More wood behind fewer 
arrows 
and last month, we announced that we'll be closing Google Health 
and Google PowerMeter. We've also done substantial internal work, 
simplifying and streamlining our product line.
 
While much of that work has not yet become visible externally, I'm very 
happy 
with our progress here. Focus and prioritization are crucial given our 
amazing opportunities. Indeed, I see more opportunities for Google today 
than ever before, because believe it or not, we are still in the very early 
stages of what we want to do. Even i
n Search, which we've been working on 
for 12 years, there's never been more important changes to make.
 
For example, this quarter, we launched a pilot that shows an author's name 
and picture in search results, making it easier for users to find things from 
authors they trust. Of course, when we started doing Search, people thought 
we were crazy. They said there was no money to be made in search over 
and above a bit of banner advertising. Most new Internet businesses have 
had that same criticism. Fast
-
forward
 
to today, it feels like we're watching 
the same movie again in slow motion. We have tremendous new businesses 
being viewed as crazy. Android, I actually have a new metric to report in 
Android of 550,000 phones activated a day. And that's a huge number, ev
en 
by Google standards.
 
Chrome is the fastest
-
growing browser. We have over 160 million users. 
Now people rightly ask, ""How will we monetize these businesses?"" Of course, 
I understand the need to balance the short
-
term with the longer
-
term needs 
because ou
r revenues in growth serve as the engine that funds our 
innovation. But our emerging high usage products can generate huge new 
businesses for Google in the long run, just like Search. And we have tons of 
experience monetizing successful products over time.
 
Well run technology 
businesses with tremendous consumer usage make a lot of money over the 
long term.
 
And I think about our products in 3 separate categories. First, there is 
Search in our Ads products, the core driver of revenue for the company. And 
Nike
sh and Susan are going to talk more about Ads later in the call. Next, 
we have products that are employing high consumer success: YouTube, 
Android and Chrome. We are investing in these in order to optimize their 
long
-
term success. Then we have our new prod
ucts, Google+ in commerce 
and local. We are investing in them to drive innovation and adoption. 
Overall, we are focused on long
-
term, absolute profit and growth, as we 
have always been, and I will continue to have tight financial management 
we have had in 
the last two years, even as we were making significant 
investments in our future.
 
I'd like to finish on our people. Great companies are no greater than the 
efforts and ingenuity of their people. We're continuing to hire the best. 
Keeping them happy and wel
l
-
rewarded is crucial to our future. Many of you 
will be interested in hiring whether we hired a few hundred more or less 
than you expected this quarter. But we will optimize headcount for the long
-
term in the opportunities we see.
 
I'm happy with the inves
tments we've made in people, but we're probably 
even a little ahead of where we need to be with headcount growth at the 
edge of what's manageable now. Easy to focus on things we do that are 
speculative, e.g. driverless cars. But we spend the vast majority 
of our 
resources on the core products. We may have a few small speculative 
projects happening at any given time but we're very careful stewards of 
shareholder money. We're not betting the farm on this stuff.
 
All of us at Google will want to create services
 
that people in the world use 
twice a day just like toothbrush. And we strive to make those services 
beautiful, simple and easy to use. That way we can provide huge benefit to 
the world. We've made a good start, but we're only at 1% of what's 
possible. Goo
gle is just getting started, and that's why I'm here, working 
hard to lead the company in the next level.
 
Thank you. And again, we had a great quarter. Now over to Patrick for the 
financial results.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Larry. Thank you, everybody. 
Thanks for joining us. And Larry is 
going to stay with us for the Q&A. So I just wanted to make sure that 
everybody knows he's not going anywhere.
 
Okay, so let's go through the number. We had obviously an excellent quarter 
with 32% year
-
over
-
year revenue g
rowth in Q2, and it clearly demonstrate 
the continuing power of Google's product innovation, but also the relentless 
momentum of the digital economy. The strength continues to be driven by 
our core desktop search ads, but also increasingly, by new emerging
 
areas 
just like the Mobile, Display, including YouTube and Enterprise that we 
regularly talk about.
 
So let's turn to the specifics of our performance in the quarter. Growth 
revenue grew 32% year
-
over
-
year and we've reached $9 billion in revenue, 
5% quarte
r
-
over
-
quarter growth as well. Note that while currency fluctuation 
boosted our revenue somewhat, even in constant FX terms, our growth rates 
remain strong, particularly in what tends to be a seasonally slower quarter.
 
Google website revenue was up 39% 
year
-
over
-
year to $6.2 billion and 6% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter, with strength across most major geographies and 
verticals. Google Network revenue was also up 20% year
-
over
-
year to $2.5 
billion, 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Network revenue was again negatively 
impa
cted by the Search quality improvements made during the latter part of 
Q1, as you will remember, and know that Q2 reflects a full quarter of this 
impact. This impact is to be expected in the short
-
term, given that it is now 
different publishers that are re
ceiving traffic and may not have yet optimized 
their sites for our advertising programs.
 
Other revenue was also up 20% year
-
over
-
year, just $310 million and 15% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong, up 
18% and down 2% qua
rter
-
over
-
quarter. Our UI changes to search ads such 
as BizURL drove year
-
over
-
year click growth in Q2, along with the ongoing 
and accelerating shift from offline to online. The slight decline quarter
-
over
-
quarter is just typically consistent with our summ
er seasonality.
 
Aggregate cost
-
per
-
click growth was also very healthy, up 12% year
-
over
-
year and up 6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Note that FX also had a positive 
impact on CPC, and remember too that this is an aggregate number that 
includes both Google.com and
 
our AdSense properties.
 
Turning to our geographic performance, the U.S. and Rest of the World are 
growing both at very good pace, and our results reflect that. While the U.K. 
still continues to lag slightly in the global recovery, year
-
over
-
year and 
quart
er
-
over
-
quarter growth in Q2 continues to show signs of acceleration in 
the U.K. as well. So revenue from the U.S. was up 26% year
-
over
-
year to 
$4.2 billion, and in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor 
Relations website, you'll see that 
we've broken down our revenue by U.S., 
U.K. and Rest of the World to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our 
hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
 
Non
-
U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $4.9
 
billion, up 
38% year
-
over
-
year, which includes only $4 million of benefits from hedging 
programs, compared to last year where we had $79 million of benefits for 
Q2. Year
-
over
-
year growth in fixed FX would have been 29% versus the 
30% I just mentioned. Jap
an's future revenue was again negatively 
impacted by the aftermath of the disaster there, but there again we see 
signs of faster recovery, faster than expected at first. The U.K. was up 27% 
year
-
over
-
year to $976 million, and year
-
over
-
year growth and fixe
d FX was 
still a healthy 19% for the U.K.
 
Let me turn to expenses. Traffic Acquisition Costs were $2.1 billion or 24.2% 
of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.1 billion 
dollars, including stock
-
based compensation of $51 million and 
finally, our 
operating expenses, which exclude stock based compensation totaled $2.6 
billion. The stock
-
based compensation totaled $384 million in Q2.
 
The increase in year
-
over
-
year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, 
increased advertising and promotiona
l spend and also professional services. 
So as a result, our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $3.3 billion in Q2 which 
excludes the stock
-
based compensation, resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating 
margin of 36.7%.
 
Headcount was up approximately 2,450 versus Q1 endi
ng the quarter with 
28,768 full
-
time employees. When we exclude ITA adds of roughly 450, the 
net headcount growth is roughly similar to Q1.
 
Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q2, and the effective tax rate is down due 
to the mix of earnings between domestic
 
and international subsidiaries, as 
well as our hedges.
 
Let me turn now to cash management. In Other Income and Expense, our 
result was $204 million for Q2, a solid portfolio management performance 
from our team, which, like every quarter, is offset by the
 
impact of our 
hedging expenses associated with FAS 133, which in itself was also 
significantly lower in Q2 gave us these great results. For more detail in 
OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR 
website.
 
Operating cash f
low, very strong, $3.5 billion for Q2. CapEx for the quarter 
was $970 million versus last quarter of $890 million. So pretty much in line. 
The majority of our CapEx spend in Q2 was related to facilities, expenses, 
and production equipment. And regarding sp
ecifically these facility expenses, 
like last quarter, we just happened to have a great opportunity in Q2 to 
purchase buildings in Dublin and in Mountain View, and we took opportunity. 
As a reminder, we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments, an
d 
these have shown to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when 
we're able to actually make these investments. But overall, we can be 
nothing but pleased with our free cash flow which was $2.6 billion for Q2.
 
As Larry mentioned earlier, we continu
e to deliver growth with a disciplined 
agenda. This means investing and making sure that our resources are 
deployed wisely with focus and a balance between that short and long
-
term 
that Larry covered.
 
So with those financial highlights covered, I'm going t
o turn it over to Nikesh 
who will actually cover now our sales performance in the quarter. Here you 
go Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. I'm going to give you a quick update on our business 
activities, which spans sales, partnership marketing, and c
ustomer service 
around the world in support of our product and revenue.
 
Let me start by focusing on the first priority of our sales team, the need to 
continue to drive revenue growth in core and new businesses. This quarter 
we continue to drive revenues in
 
our corner areas like Search, as well as 
new areas like Display, Mobile, and Enterprise. Core Search and Desktop has 
done very well this quarter, with Google.com accelerating and our large 
advertisers continuing to spend more as they see more value in Sea
rch. 
We've also have been able to drive tremendous focus on small advertisers 
around the world, with programs like GXPO, which I will talk about slightly 
later.
 
Broadly, however, our sales teams are getting better at tailoring Integrated 
Solutions for clie
nts, using the full area of our advertising products. These 
solutions create better opportunities to improve our customers marketing 
ROI. Clients have used Search to focus their targeting capabilities, such us 
such as audience and topic targeting, to help 
improve the marketing 
effectiveness. Some of our most successful Search clients include people like 
GM and EgyptAir.
 
On the other hand, in addition to our core desktop Search business, we 
continue to be very excited about our investments in Display and Mob
ile. Let 
me first focus on Display. We've seen continued healthy growth in our 
Display product space across all fronts: Advertiser, publisher and technology 
solutions. 98 of the top AdAge 100 advertisers have bought Display across 
YouTube and the Google Di
splay Network this quarter. Customers continue 
to use our DoubleClick products and we are happy with the increased use for 
the DoubleClick Ad Exchange and Invite Media for ad buying. With our 
announcements to acquire Admeld, we hope to deliver even better 
solutions 
to our publishers and buyers.
 
Continuing on Display 
--
 
on YouTube, where we have over 3 billion daily 
views, we have had great success bringing popular content to our users, 
further increasing audience engagement. Take for example, our April 
broa
dcast of the Royal Wedding which generated 100 million YouTube views. 
Our range of platform and content means that advertisers are beginning to 
use them for superior branding solutions. A great example of our branding 
products in action was T
-
Mobile's laun
ch of the Samsung S4G on YouTube. 
In this campaign T
-
Mobile took over YouTube running ads in their home 
page, watch page, Mobile. That particular campaign helped them reach 46 
million unique users.
 
Continuing to talk about revenues, our Mobile business con
tinues to be 
another area of robust growth. The number which Larry just shared of 
550,000 Android, that and the success of smartphones in and general Mobile 
Data devices around the world is acting as an accelerator for our Mobile 
advertising effort.
 
Let me
 
just take one quick example. One format which was launched by 
Susan's team called Click
-
to
-
Call or Click
-
to
-
Share has been particularly 
successful. Unilever is a great use case of these formats. They integrated 
our AdMob product into a very large campaign
 
of launching a new product to 
use the banner to drive traffic to a campaign Mobile site and achieve 
unprecedented results with almost 700,000 unique visitors accessing their 
content.
 
Another leg of our revenues is the Enterprise Business. We've seen great
 
results in enterprise as well, in particular apps for business continues to 
grow as organizations move to the cloud. We've had key wins at 
Intercontinental Hotels, [indiscernible] State of Wyoming. In addition to 
that, some small simple changes in our pro
duct side have allowed us to 
tremendously accelerate Google Apps for small businesses.
 
Looking at our revenues from a slightly different perspective, geographies 
and customer segments, we've seen strong growth in regions and across 
customers of all sizes. 
First let's take a look at geographies, we maintained 
our strength in large, mature countries while we accelerated in emerging 
ones.
 
Now a large majority of countries which are countries even though some of 
our facing economic challenges, this secular tren
d of online advertising and 
the effectiveness of the teams to continue to drive healthy revenue growth is 
showing great results. Several countries are worth noting as Patrick 
mentioned. The U.K. has accelerated this quarter with strong growth by 
small adve
rtisers. In Japan, we've seen recovery, driven primarily by Display 
and Mobile spending by large advertisers. Our focused execution in Canada 
and Spain has led to these markets beginning to show recovery. Finally, we 
saw tremendous growth in emerging count
ries especially Brazil and Russia, 
where our Display products are getting strong adoption from advertisers.
 
Across each country, we focus to improving the product knowledge and 
selling capability of our sales force, our frontline teams can now sell Search,
 
Display, and Mobile to the needs of our customers, which is a great trend 
we're seeing of integrated products selling across multiple Mobile ad 
formats. As a result we're becoming better advisors in the digital space for 
our large advertisers. For example
, Nike, Sony Ericsson, Telefonica, all of 
them partnered with us to create integrated solutions down there, 
sponsorship of Copa América.
 
Outside of revenue, one key area of responsibility is marketing. And if we 
continue to use marketing as a strategic bli
pper. We use marketing to both 
drive customer acquisitions as well as usage of our key consumer products. 
I'm very proud of my team's work on getting business online GXPO as I 
mentioned in Q2 we successfully launched Brazil, Canada, Australia 
Thailand. To 
objective is to try and bring another million small, medium 
businesses across 20 countries online for the first time. As you know, more 
advertisers gets more queries, has more adserves against it. There's nothing 
in a more robust option for us.
 
In addition
, also we saw strong results from our own advertising campaigns, 
including the most recent one around Google Chrome. The web is what you 
make of it. I'm sure many of you might have seen Justin Bieber and Lady 
Gaga in these campaigns. These campaigns have s
hown tremendous 
effectiveness and have also convince more users to switch to the Chrome 
browser.
 
Last but not the least, I want to spend a quick minute on talking about 
something we're more and more passionate about, which is continuing to 
drive better cus
tomer satisfaction on an advertiser front. We continue to 
improve service and support across all customer segments. We've started 
providing large sets of advertisers proactive full support and on boarding 
help, which includes signing up for campaign buildi
ng, signing up and getting 
assistance, as well as free full support after they become a customer of ours. 
As a result of these initiatives and others, spending by our small businesses 
continue to accelerate.
 
Overall as Patrick and Larry have 
mentioned, it was a great quarter. I'm 
very proud of the wok of our teams across the world in various countries. 
We have done a tremendous amount of effort to serve our customers, 
partners and users.
 
Now I'm going to turn over to my business partner, Susan
, who is going to 
talk about all the positive impact that our products will have this quarter.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Thanks, Nikesh. Larry started the call by talking about a few of the quarters 
product highlights and I'd like to cover some more of them. So let m
e begin 
with Search. We're always looking for new ways to help our users find 
answers to their questions. This quarter, we brought 2 of the most popular 
mobile search innovations to the desktop, Voice Search and Search by 
Image.
 
Voice Search traffic for Mo
bile devices is up 6x in the past year. So we 
thought this would be a useful feature for our desktop users as well. It's 
especially useful for searches that you know how to say but don't how to 
spell like Bolognese sauce or Schenectady, New York, neither o
f which I 
could easily spell.
 
With Search by Image you can draw pictures of places, art, or even 
mischievous creatures like the Loch Ness Monster right into the Google 
search box and Google can identify and tell you about those pictures.
 
In addition to the
se changes, we released about 100 other quality 
improvements to the Search algorithm. More and more people are searching 
and using apps from Mobile phones, where Android has had terrific 
momentum. There are now 135 million Android devices that have been 
ac
tivated in total, up from 100 million just 2 months ago. There are also now 
over 400 different Android devices available globally.
 
Android market is also picking up momentum. It has over 250,000 different 
apps, and users have downloaded apps over 6 billion
 
times, which is double 
the downloads from just a few months ago. We're expanding beyond apps 
too. This week, we started renting movies and selling books on phones from 
Android market and earlier in Q2, we launched Music Beta, which lets users 
upload their
 
personal music collections and playlist to the cloud. All this 
media, movies, music, books and apps, are instantly available on their 
Android devices, no cable required.
 
Smartphones are also becoming key to the shopping experience. Making 
shopping mobile 
and local is a vision behind Google Wallet and Google 
Offers. We announced the Google Wallet mobile app in May in partnership 
with Citi, MasterCard, Sprint, and First Data, and we are now testing it in 
field trials. And as of this week, Google Offers are a
vailable in San Francisco, 
Oakland, New York, and Portland.
 
But now on to Ads, which is the product area that I manage. On the Search 
Ads side, we had a great quarter for quality with over 50 ads quality 
improvements and a big upgrade to the ads relevancy 
system. We launched 
the latest in a series of small tweaks for a search add format. This format, 
this quarter, we added the landing URL to the headline so that users know 
where click will take them. This may seem like a small thing, but we 
launched several
 
of these small tweaks over the past year and cumulatively, 
they have had a big impact.
 
There were also a lot of quality improvements across our Display Network. 
Over 20 launches, making it one of our strongest quarters from a quality 
perspective. In gener
al, Display advertising is moving to a scientific model 
based on technologies like real
-
time bidding. But this technology when you 
land on a web page, advertisers decide what they want to pay for the ad 
space, and then auction is held. And the best ad is m
atched with the 
publisher's ad space. It's a lot more efficient. It provides better performance 
for both advertisers and publishers, and more relevant ads for users. Real
-
time bidding is an important technology shift that we are investing heavily 
in.
 
Invit
e Media, which is the buying platform for advertisers and agencies that 
we bought last year, has doubled its client list in the last year, with over 5x 
growth outside of the U.S. Mobile Display is starting to take
-
off too with 
traffic on the AdMob network 
up more than 3.5x in the past year. More and 
more of that traffic is coming from tablets, so we launched a new set of 
formats designed specifically for tablets. These formats are web
-
based. They 
use HTML, and brand advertisers don't need to make different 
versions of 
their ads for different models.
 
Nikesh also mentioned our great momentum with YouTube, where we're 
getting strong performance from the YouTube skippable ads. Because users 
can choose to skip these in
-
stream ads, the people who choose to watch 
t
hem are much more engaged. More and more advertisers are choosing to 
make their ads skippable and now, over 1/3 of in
-
stream ads on YouTube 
are in a skipable format, which is a pretty remarkable stat given that we 
launched this format in December.
 
Finally,
 
I'd like to update our progress on Chrome. Larry mentioned how we 
passed 160 million users which is more than double year
-
on
-
year. This 
quarter, our partner Samsung and Acer Search using Phonebooks in 7 
countries. Phonebook are designed to be fast, to jus
t work, and to get better 
over time, thanks to our automatic updates. And they're now available 
through Amazon and Best Buy. Phonebooks are also available to schools and 
businesses via subscription model. The subscription includes Phonebooks, of 
course, ad
ministration, warranty, and support, starting at $20 a month.
 
So overall it was a very busy quarter for us. But maybe the coolest thing we

actually play, and users recorded over 40 mi

That's about 5 years of music.
 
I'm looking forward to hearing your questions and comments. And for now, 
back to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Susan. So Jamie, our operator, is going to help us through this. 
Jamie, you ca

Nikesh, Larry, and myself to answer any questions you may have.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang 
with Credit Su

Crédit Suisse AG
 
Two quick questions, if I could. First for Patrick or perhaps Nikesh, 
International revenue growth as you mentioned was really strong. I was 
wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on perhaps that's
 
driving that? If you could give us a sense of how much of that is core Search 
versus some of the newer initiatives like Mobile, YouTube, and Display. And 
then the second question is for Larry. I was wondering if you can just talk a 
little bit, Larry, abou
t the patent strategy. Our understanding is you guys 
have about 650 patents. So just given the Oracle situation, I was wondering 
if you could talk about the patent strategy to ensure that you guys can 
continue to innovate going forward.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I'
ll let Nikesh answer the first part of the question, and then Larry will talk 
about the patent issues.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we've seen tremendous 
growth across pretty much all product areas. So the growth you're seeing i
n 
international is driven by Mobile, by Display, by Search. Clearly international 
is not one market there are many different countries. So we have seen 
different effects in different markets. Places like Japan, as I said, have been 
driven more by Display a
nd Mobile. Various parts of Asia are just getting up 
the curve for us in Display and are strong contributors in Mobile. Having said 
that, Russia has been very strong for us. Brazil has been very strong for us. 
Brazil in the back of Mobile and Display as we
ll, and as well as core Search. 
So if you think about what we're seeing, we're seeing more and more a 
pickup of Display and Mobile because we have established sales team are 
pretty much on almost every major market around the world to help sell 
Display. An
d the Mobile tick up based on tick up of smartphones and Android 
et cetera is helping that trend as well. In addition to that, a lot of effort has 
gone in to bringing small business online and that increases a number of 
advertisers in many international ma
rkets. As you get more advertisers in 
international markets. It has a very positive impact on our RPMs in those 
markets. So we're seeing that effect as well.
 
Larry Page
 
To your question on Android and patents and so on. Obviously we have a 
number of 
intellectual property patents in progress not just already issued. I 
must just say, Android's really on a tear. I mentioned there were over 
550,000 new Android daily activations previously. And there's over 400 such 
devices, 39 OEMs, 231 carriers in 123 co
untries, and over 78 open handset 
alliance partners. And that velocity is only increasing. And of course despite 
the efforts of some of our competitors, there hasn't been any slowdown in 
any of those things. And partners and developers are continuing to ex
pand 
the Android ecosystem. Of course we're really committed to Android and 
continued to support that platform and ecosystem, and do it in a cost 
effective manner.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
Mark Mahaney

Citigr
oup Inc
 
Two questions Larry. Could you talk about what you have maybe put in to 
improve the velocity of decision
-
making? And as you step back and think 
about the management improvements you could see over the next year or 
2, how significant do you think 
--
 
how much better 
--
 
how much more 
efficiently do you think Google could be run, than what we've seen maybe 
over the last 2 or 3 years? And then Susan, real quickly, social search 
signals, how important do you think they are now? How key are they 
--
 
how 
muc
h of that is Google+'s strategy for trying to make the core search results 
more relevant?
 
Larry Page
 
This is Larry. I'm super excited about the changes we've made and I think as 
companies scale, we always change how we're running the company over 
time. So 
I think we have a much more of a product focused structure now, 
which I'm very excited about and talked about it. And I think that 
maintaining and improving our velocity and execution is a really noble goal 
for us. And it requires always a lot of work in c
ompanies. And I think that's 
super important direction for us, and I'm really excited about it.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Susan, on social?
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Yes, so I think the first thing I would say about social is that we're very early 
right now. And really our fo
cus with Google+ will be to focus on making sure 
that we have a wonderful consumer and user experience. From a targeting 
perspective, there are a number of signals that we use right now. Obviously 
keyword on Search, contextual, interspaced advertising, dem
ographics, and 
social signals overtime can be an important part of that. But it would be one 
of multiple ways that we actually do targeting. When we did rollout Google+, 
we do have pluses on all the ads this is what we do in search results. So if 
the user 
does click on it, and someone on their circle has actually does a 
query and triggers that, then there will be social annotations, which will be 
useful information for the user to see that their friend has +1
-
ed that ad.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Ben Sc
hachter with Macquarie.
 
Benjamin Schachter

Macquarie Research
 
Congratulations on the execution and the launch of Google+. Larry, at a 
high
-
level what, if any, are some of the key differences on how you think 
about managing specifically the economic model
 
of the company today 
versus when Eric was CEO? Specifically any changes to target margins, 
revenue growth targets, et cetera? And then separately, on Mobile Search 
specifically, it's clearly been successful in terms of search share. But when 
we're trying 
to figure out the overall impact to net revenue in kind of 
balancing out some of the positives like incremental searches and share 
gains and higher click
-
through rates, but also having the headwinds of TAC 
payments to partners and lower CPCs, how should we
 
think about the overall 
net impact of Mobile to the business?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Why don't I'd take the second part of that question, and then Larry can talk 
about the economic model versus in the context of what you said. But for 
Mobile search, you have to
 
go back and focus on what we focused on. Build 
businesses that are going to be billion
-
dollar businesses and that actually 
contribute significant operating dollar margins. These are businesses that 
scale to a humongous scale as they grow. So for us, that 
is the focus that we 
have. And the second piece in the specifics of Mobile is we really see Mobile 
a bit like Search was in 2001, 2002, 2003. All these formats are so new that 
you know that there's so much more room for optimization on top of it. So it 
is 
in fact a bit of a mistake to kind of say okay, today whatever we have is a 
good proxy for what the future will look like. And that's why we're excited 
about it. And that's why we focus so much on Mobile. For the economic 
model and how we run the company, 
maybe Larry, your thoughts on that?
 
Larry Page
 
Absolutely, thanks for the question. I think certainly Eric is a great partner 
and leader for me and for Google for the last 10 years, and continues to play 
a big part in the company. So I don't think there's,
 
like we said before, 
there's no major changes in what we're doing. And I'll reiterate maybe a 
little bit and add a little detail to what I already said. I think about really in 
our products in 3 separate categories. First, through Search and our Ads 
busin
ess, which is the core driver of revenue for the company. We really 
invest in that, we work hard on it. Next we have businesses that are 
enjoying really high consumer success. For example, YouTube, Android, and 
Chrome. And we invest in those in order top t
hem for long
-
term success. 
And we have some new businesses on Google+, Commerce, and Local that 
we're really excited about and are at pretty early stage and those things we 
invest in as well. And we don't do things that we don't think will generate 
really 
big returns over time. So we're optimizing for our long
-
term economic 
success. But we do have these very different buckets of things that we work 
on.

Two questions
. First on Google+ and then second on Google Offers. So on 
plus, we haven't seen real integration. We know it's only a couple of weeks 
old but with Google's kind of core competencies around search and other 
things that you've been very successful at in the
 
past. So can you talk about 
plans on integrating some of Google's core strength into Google+ to further, 
I guess, differentiate the products from other services that are out there? 
And then on Google Offers, can you just talk about your overall strategy i
n 
terms of rolling out offers? You're in 4 cities today. How fast do you think 
you're going to accelerate into these newer cities, and is international 
territories also on the roadmap and the near
-
term for Offers?
 
Larry Page
 
I'll answer the first part, thi
s is Larry. Google+ actually has a lot of 
interesting product integration. The black Google bar that you see is an 
entry point and notification point for Plus across basically all of our 
properties. And we're really excited about that, and think it's a big
 
deal. 
Suffice to say there are many things that you would do with Plus and with 
+1 that affect what you would see in search results. Like I mentioned, when 
you +1 something, your friends will see it in search. So absolutely, and I 
hope it was clear that w
as our strategy, but we're very focused on improving 
all of Google, improving the sharing and identity across all of Google.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Maybe Nikesh can give a comment on the rollout of Google Offers.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks, Patrick. We won't give 
out details on how we rollout our offer 
strategy. I think Susan said it very well in our overall strategy, because 
Offers for us is not just an isolated event. It is a combined, a bit of a 
commerce offering, which includes their Mobile phone and other thin
gs we 
talked about. We were very happy with the rollout we've had in the one city 
where we've been for a while, which is Portland, and we just rolled out 2 
more cities earlier this week. So from our perspective, you can expect us to 
roll out other cities, 
but we're going to be testing and looking at the models 
see what's working and what's not working because we want to build the 
next version of how we rollout an Offers product. So stay tuned.

Two quick questions. As we note the proliferation of the newer, richer ad 
formats like product image ads that we're seeing more and more of on your 
site, can you help us better understand the impact on paid click growth 
specifically? And th
en separately, can you also give us a little more color on 
some of the [indiscernible] quality changes you're doing on the network? 
Any commentary on how much impact to growth of AdSense that had this 
quarter and how long should we expect to see more than 
expected impact 
from continued quality changes?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Why don't I let, actually, Susan tackle those questions? Susan?
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
On the richer ad formats, we see a few important opportunities for us, and 
what we feel about them is it gives u
s the opportunity to make those ads 
better for the users. And as we can create better experiences for our users, 
they're more likely to have the information that a user wants. And so what 
we'd hope to see is a click
-
through increase over time. And hopefull
y, for the 
advertiser on the back end, a better conversion. So in terms of click growth, 
and what's actually driving the click growth that we see, it's a matter of 
factors. One of them is always going to be query growth that we have. 
Second thing would be 
on improvements that we have to our back end 
quality models. So the better the quality model is, the more likely we are to 
actually match the right advertisement to the right user. And we had a 
number of good ads, as I mentioned, not just good, we had grea
t ads quality 
launches this quarter, and a number of ad formats that made the ads more 
readable. And by making them more readable, the users are more likely to 
click on them. And that turns into click growth. And then on the last question 
that you had, whi
ch was Panda, Panda was a change made by the search 
team with the goal of improving overall search experience. There was, as we 
talked about last time, some negative effects from the AdSense partners. 
However, Panda does 
--
 
or any search quality that we ma
ke, does have a 
change of ranking, which means that there are different sites that wind up 
getting traffic. And that those sites may adjust their monetization strategy 
over time. And so it may just take some time for that to actually balance 
out. And also,
 
in terms of the last question, we don't really comment about 
future changes that we're going to make, but we're always thinking about 
the right way to continue to improve the search results for our users.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Panda, once again a great example
 
of putting the user first ends up 
benefiting everybody in the end, the publishers, the advertisers, and the 
users.

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
Larry, thanks for joining the
 
call. And while we have you, I'm just going to 
ask you a question I get all the time. How focused is senior management on 
the stock either as an employee retention tool or a measure of 
management's performance over, say a 3 to 5 year period? And then 
seco
ndly, if I could just ask about the local opportunity, it looks like a lot of 
launches happening for Google. Do you see it as a different ad market than 
your current search ad market? And how might your model be different than 
some of the larger players in
 
that market currently?
 
Larry Page
 
We have a lot of stuff to do here at Google, and unfortunately one of the 
things we don't get to decide is our stock price. So you all are in charge of 
that. I think we're really focused on our long
-
term success as a busi
ness and 
the kind of things I mentioned already are absolute, overall profitability over 
the long
-
term and our revenue growth. And so, we tend to focus much more 
on that, with a much more long
-
term view than we do on our stock price.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Susan
, views on the difference and the similarities between the local and our 
traditional ads market.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Yes, Local can be thought about 2 different ways. Local can be the large 
retailers who have many different points of presence. So, for example, 
Starbucks or Pizza Hut or any retailer which is a large holding company or 
one large retailer, but then has many different local points of presence and 
then there's a separate bucket which are the small Joe's coffee shop 
example. And both of them need diff
erent things from a product perspective 
in order to be able to advertise more broadly. And we are working in both 
buckets to solve and make them advertisers on AdWords with solutions that 
will work for them. The large ones need functionality of how do I ru
n a 
campaign in all of these different locations with different keywords, different 
pricing. And so we're working to enable location in our AdWords campaigns 
where you're managing a large account to make that much easier. The Joe's 
Coffee Shop example, wha
t we're working on is enabling signing up for 
AdWords to be a much easier experience. So we actually have a product that 
we released this quarter called Google Boost. And Boost, a product is a 1 
page, 5 minute sign
-
up for advertisers. It's very easy to sig
n
-
up. We haven't 
marketed it a lot right now but we have seen good success with our 
advertisers. And we're hoping to make that more known to our advertisers.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
The last piece in the puzzle is, obviously Susan, Mobile, which is completely 
int
egrated from an ads perspective and targeting as well.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Yes, the other thing too is we would like to make all of our products be 
accessible from a Mobile perspective. Click
-
to
-
Call would be an example. 
Click
-
to
-
Call is really nice so that as 
someone, for example, is local walking 
down the street, they can actually call. But it's also really nice from the small 
retailer perspective, because they can understand that they're getting a call 
and they're getting a lead, which for them would be much 
more tangible 
than actually a click to their page. So we're investing very heavily in that in 
terms of Click
-
to
-
Call technology and the good tracking for the local 
advertisers.

Two questions. I guess first of all, you've got obviously quite a few products 
and applications that have had success over the years. Kind of that are out 
there obviously Search, Gmail, Chrome, Android et cetera. I guess as 
you 
think about next generation of consumer relationship and stickiness, how do 
you think about like integrating a lot of these core assets together in terms 
of building a consumer relationship, which kind of moves seamlessly from all 
these different solut
ions and formats out there, as well as devices? And then 
second, maybe around Google+, obviously it's only been 2 weeks now. But 
maybe can you talk about the overall trend in terms of 10 million users? 
How does that compare against maybe the early days of 
how Android or 
Chrome or maybe even search or mail ramped? What kind of trajectory or 
what kind of trend schedule does it look like right now if you were to 
pinpoint it against another product in the business?
 
Larry Page
 
We are 
--
 
on the integration point,
 
we obviously have a lot of different 
products that do different things for different people. And we know one 
effort that I mentioned, I've been really excited about, is this visual 
redesign. And I also mentioned the bar that goes across the black bar that
 
goes across with Google+, that gives you a notification on sharing and so 
on. We're definitely working hard to integrate our products better to make 
the user experience simpler, intuitive and beautiful and consistent. And I'm 
really excited about our prog
ress just in one quarter on that and I think 
you'll 
--
 
we're certainly working hard on that. And we have to continue to 
over time. On the Plus growth question, we've been very, very excited about 
the growth we've seen and the engagement we've seen. Over 1 
billion items 
shared and received in a single day. And I think that for us, there's a lot of 
barriers to use Plus right now. One thing, you have to be invited and so on 
and it's still in field trial. So I think given all that, were just extremely 
excited a
bout that. But it's very early days. It's been less than 2 weeks since 
we released it into field trial.

First on Local. You've got a lot of 
interesting services and capabilities. But 
they're still fairly disparate and in some instances there's some overlapping 
features. I'm just curious, from an end
-
user perspective, how are you 
thinking about bringing together your various local commerce prod
ucts? And 
then maybe to follow up on the Google+ question, since it is so early, what 
are your longer
-
term goals for Plus? I mean measured by their users or 
number of items shared. How are you thinking about this over say, a 2 year 
timeframe?
 
Larry Page
 
I'
ll take the second question first, on the Plus, how would we think about 
success of it. I think we are really, obviously, like I said we want people to 
make products that everybody uses 2x a day, like their toothbrush. We'd 
certainly think about plus that 
way, and also just generally having really 
great sharing experience and identity experience across Google and all of its 
products. And so that's kind of how we think about the success there I think 
it's pretty straightforward. On the first question, integr
ation? Patrick, do you 
want to take that?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Let me say just that what's been really cool about local for us, in the 
addition to what Susan has mentioned a few minutes ago is, you have to 
think of it as we are in fact assembling all the piece
s of the puzzle. Local is 
actually a quite complex experience, but when you have Maps, you have 
Mobile, you have Wallet, you have all the ads serving, you basically have the 
pieces of the puzzle to succeed, and it's not as much what was yesterday's 
tools t
hat we had, and how do we evolve only yesterday's tools, it's about 
taking those pieces of the puzzle and really creating true innovative services. 
And that's how we have to think about local. And that's why it's not obvious. 
But if you look at the arsenal
 
we're building, it's actually quite formidable. So 
that's why we're excited by that. Thanks Jason for your question.

I wanted to ask 2 things. First, Patrick, c
an you give us some color on the 
mix as headcount additions? And in particular, if you look at R&D it looks like 
it was flat sequentially, but yet you added more than 2,000 people during 
the quarter. So I'm hoping you can provide some color there. And then
 
secondly can you give us some context just in terms of how you think about 
the Display business and whether you need more O and O inventory.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I'll answer the first one, and then I'll let Susan answer the second. On 
headcount, again, as we 
said on the call, roughly, we have IT for 450 so 
roughly about 2000 for the quarter, and Larry comment on that. And we 
--
 
there's still a huge amount of engineers in that. It just happens that R&D is 
actually in every line item. So you'll find in many othe
r areas of our P&L. And 
so you should not worry. We have a complete focus to make sure that we 
actually have a majority of our hiring that is focused on Engineering, which 
is really the core of the business and then we continue to kind of 
--
 
then you 
have 
the mix of sales and then just general overhead. It's really engineering 
and sales that have been the focus in that sequence. For Display, I'll let 
Susan talk about it.
 
Larry Page
 
I'll just add too in the headcount question. None of the focus there has 
cha
nged substantially from our past.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
On Display, our biggest O and O property is obviously YouTube. And given 
the numbers that we saw, we've seen tremendous growth there and a huge 
opportunity to monetize video as more users come online, and mo
re content 
lines are being uploaded on YouTube. But the strategy, and our Display 
strategy overall is dependent not just on O and O. It also has many other 
components. The first of being to be a platform to enable advertisers and 
publishers to much more ea
sily buy and sell Display advertising. And then 
second, to enable all of the sites out there, of which there are of course 
many, many millions, hundreds of millions of them, for them to be able to 
monetize and sell display advertising and for us to be able
 
to help them as 
part of that process and via our network, where we have a lot of different 
targeting techniques to try to serve the right ad to those users. So really our 
strategy is part O and O with our sites like YouTube, but then also to 
continue to b
uild a great network and platform products to that advertisers 
and publishers across the industry can serve Display advertising.

Barclays Capital
 
I ha
ve one for Patrick and one for Larry. Patrick if you just isolate the 6% 
sequential growth in cost
-
per
-
click versus last quarter, wondering if you 
could help us understand the driver of that acceleration, and moving 
forward, should we expect that to contin
ue or moderate, given that as 
Mobile queries start to take up more of the query mix? And then question for 
Larry, it would appear that in social media that switching costs for users are 
high perhaps years of photos on a social network platform. And as you 
look 
at Google+ and the growth there, what are the most compelling offsets to 
those switching costs you think or do you perhaps see a future where folks 
can simultaneously be a part of multiple social networking platforms?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So why don't I l
et Susan actually give you a bit of color on our CPC and 
evolution, and then Larry will take on the latter, the social one.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
The drivers of CPC, there are few of them. One of them in this quarter was 
FX, certainly. But we've been really 
focused on our ads quality 
improvements, and how do we continue to obviously make our ads better for 
our users and for our advertisers. And in doing so, we've actually 
--
 
we done 
a lot of optimization of our ads that appear above the search results like si
te 
links, some of the ad changes in the formats that we made this quarter, and 
a lot of the ads that appear above the top search results tend to be higher 
CPC because they're the first 3 ads. So as we continue to optimize and really 
drive a lot of the incr
eased click
-
through and visibility for the ads that 
appear above the search results, you will see 
--
 
since those tend to be 
higher CPC because they're at the top of the results, you will see some of 
that increasing.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Larry on sell
-
through a
nd switching costs?
 
Larry Page
 
I think we've been really excited about Google+ really improving the overall 
social experience and making it more like how you would share in real
-
life. 
And that's really a different product than is out there now. And we're g
etting 
just rave reviews for that. People really like being able to share with more 
discrete groups in an easy way, intuitive way, and there's a lot of magic built 
into the product that causes that. And as you say, you asked about the 
photos, we actually h
ave a really great photo experience on the Android. 
Like if you take a picture on Android and you have Google+ client, which you 
would have, if you're using it. It uploads your photos automatically, and it's 
super easy to share them and post
-
them to your f
riends, or your family or 
whatever. It's a really, really great experience. So there is legacy in Google, 
as a company, believes in users owning their own data and being able to 
easily move it out of Google. As some of our competitors don't believe in 
that
. We think the users will eventually move to services that are in their 
best interest and that work really well for them.

Cowen and Company, LLC
 
I wanted to
 
ask a question on 
--
 
or follow
-
up on where you guys said that 
you're a little ahead of where you expected to be on hiring. Should we think 
about the hiring and particularly in R&D sort of coming in waves where you 
hire a bunch of people, get them integrat
ed, it sort of slows down and picks 
up again? And then the second question and just on the P&L, other cost 
surviving users of percentage of [indiscernible] TAC seems to be a little high. 
Is that coming from increased Data Center depreciation or is it may b
e 
coming from YouTube and content related costs?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I'll answer the first one, the latter one, and then I'll let Larry talk about 
hiring in general. The P&L, yes, it is a combination of factors this quarter. So 
in that cost is also included h
eadcount. And so headcount is actually 
increased. Power is increased because of seasonality. It's summer now, so 
our power is a little higher. And we've also had kind of catch up on expenses 
on some of the equipment. So there's been a bit of a between Q1 a
nd Q2, 
there's been a bit of a cleanup in some of the areas of equipment that have 
actually slightly deflated Q1 and inflated Q2 as we finish the clean up, so 
that was a bit of a catch up there. So I wouldn't read the data point between 
Q1 and Q2. Don't cr
eate a graph with that, with that line. But it's a bit of 
everything, including a bit of cleanup and some of the equipment accounts. 
For the issue of hiring, I'll let Larry actually talk about general where we 
stand right now.
 
Larry Page
 
That's a great que
stion. I think just a couple of factors that affected that and 
I think you know we implemented compensation changes in Q1. We 
increased our employee compensation. And they've had even more positive 
effect on hiring and retention than when we expected. It's
 
been a super 
successful change. And I think in general this has more excited people who 
want to work at Google and who want to stay working at Google than we 
expected. And so that's had some impact on those numbers. Of course 
there's a limit on how many w
e can 
--
 
and how fast we can productively 
hire, and I said this in my remark, I think kind of my judgments where at 
the edge of that piece being reasonable. We're just adding a lot of people. 
And I'd say that we're always looking for good people, and we're
 
always 
--
 
the exact rate is going to depend on success and where we really want to 
invest in the company. We have a really strong management team. I said 
that's working together fabulously, and we can absorb those hires and put 
them to use well. But like 
I said, we're definitely 
--
 
we're surprised that the 
success of our previous changes around compensation as well.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
With that, I just want to thank Larry for joining us today, and Nikesh, and 
Susan for the comments as well as the Q&A. I want
 
to thank, once again as 
I always do, all the Googlers out there. Our fantastic Googlers that have 
made this quarter possible. And all of the innovation, especially I think it's 
worth mentioning, our Google+ team that has done a phenomenal job in this 
laun
ch. So 2 thumbs up.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thank you. Good 
afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third 
quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and 
Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the 
statements that we make today may be considered forward looking in
cluding 
statements regarding our future investments, our long
-
term growth and 
innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected 
level of capital expenditures.
 
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could 
cau
se actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer 
to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10
-
K for 2017 filed with the SEC. 
Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward
-
looking statements and 
they are made based on assumpti
ons as of today. We undertake no 
obligation to update them.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release. As you know we distribute 
our earnings 
release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. 
This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call 
will be available later today.
 
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.

Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit 
from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from 
YouTube, cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of 
$33.7 billion, up 21% yea
r
-
on
-
year and up 22% in constant currency.
 
For today's call, I will begin with the results for the quarter on a consolidated 
basis for Alphabet focusing on year
-
over
-
year changes. I will then review 
results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclu
de with our outlook. 
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will 
take your questions.
 
Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for 
the quarter, our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a n
egative currency 
impact year
-
over
-
year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our 
hedging program.
 
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our 
performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 
billion, u
p 20% year
-
over
-
year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% 
year
-
over
-
year. In constant currency terms EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues 
were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. 
Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 1
9% year
-
over
-
year and up 
28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the 
Argentine peso.
 
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll 
discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28%
 
year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 
36% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses. The key 
drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations 
including depreciation whic
h continue to be affected by a reallocation of 
certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for 
YouTube.
 
Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year
-
over
-
year. Once again 
the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting ou
r continued 
investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses 
reflects increases in sales and marketing head count primarily for cloud and 
ads followed by advertising investments in cloud, Chromebooks for the back
-
to
-
school season 
and the Google Assistant.
 
G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of 
factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with 
recognition of equity security gains which were again partially offset by the 
reallocatio
n of certain expenses from G&A primarily to other cost of 
revenues.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the 
quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior 
quarters, the majority of new hires were en
gineers and product managers. 
In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in 
cloud for both technical and sales roles.
 
Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating 
margin of 25%. As discussed in the p
revious two quarters, both operating 
income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes 
the way companies account for equity security investments. This new 
standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided
 
a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line 
items.
 
Other income and expense was $1.8 billion which includes $1.4 billion of 
gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line 
items within OI&E in 
our earnings press release.
 
Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete 
items, notably an adjustment associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income 
was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06.
 
Turning now to Cap
Ex and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $5.3 billion which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating 
cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the 
quarter with cash and marketable securities of
 
approximately $106 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, 
up
 
22% year
-
over
-
year.
 
In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a 
strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network 
revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year
-
on
-
year reflecting the ongoing 
momentum of AdMob an
d programmatic.
 
Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year
-
over
-
year fueled 
by cloud and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our 
earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics 
of our advertising b
usinesses.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion or 23% of total advertising 
revenues and up 20% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
advertising revenues was relatively flat year
-
over
-
year, primarily reflecting a 
favorable revenu
e mix shift from network to sites, offset by an increase in 
the sites' TAC rate. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year
-
over
-
year was 
driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, 
which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we expe
rienced a year
-
on
-
year 
decline in the network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of 
which were individually significant.
 
Google stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 
23% year
-
over
-
year. Operating income was $9.5 bill
ion, up 11% versus last 
year. And the operating margin was 28.2%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter 
was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center 
construction and facilities.
 
Let me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 mil
lion, primarily 
generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets' 
accrued CapEx was $55 million. In terms of Other Bet updates for the 
quarter, with Waymo in the third quarter, we built on our early rider 
program, both expanding t
he group of participants and beginning to test 
pricing models.
 
At Verily, the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with 
leading pharmaceutical companies, consistent with its mission to move 
medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently lau
nched efforts include a joint 
venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research 
collaboration with Gilead.
 
Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment 
teams GV and CapitalG which are also within Other Bets.
 
Within the $1.4 
billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 
million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment 
activities in the 10
-
Q.
 
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our 
longer
-
term 
outlook. First, with respect to revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect 
FX headwinds with U.S. dollar strengthening in contrast to the tailwinds that 
enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be 
pleased wit
h the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we 
apply our strength in machine learning to improve the experience for users 
and advertisers. As we noted, hardware was only a modest contributor in the 
third quarter as we launched a new Made by 
Google family of products for 
the fourth quarter holiday season.
 
Second, with respect to profitability, within cost of revenues, the biggest 
component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the 
pace of year
-
on
-
year growth in sites TAC as
 
a percentage of sites revenues 
would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that 
again clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do 
expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year
-
on
-
year reflecting 
on
going strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal 
impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales which are typically 
higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content 
acquisition costs for YouTube, which ha
ve also historically been higher in the 
fourth quarter.
 
Within OpEx, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long
-
term 
growth. In terms of head count, growth was seasonally higher in the third 
quarter because we brought on new graduates. We ar
e continuing to invest 
in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in 
engineering and product management and to support our most sizable 
growth areas, in particular, cloud.
 
As I've mentioned previously regarding sales and marke
ting, expenses are 
more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in 
prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to 
support the holiday season.
 
Other Bets remains a portfolio of earlier stage busine
sses focused on 
addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of 
commercialization, while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment 
against achievement of key milestones.
 
And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued in
vestment as 
we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see 
across our businesses. This includes a number of datacenter construction 
projects in flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity.
 
I will now turn the call ov
er to Sundar.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter, and it was particularly special 
because last month, we celebrated Google's 20th birthday and the 10th 
birthday of Chrome. It's exciting to think that 20 years in, we are sti
ll just at 
the beginning of what's possible. We get billions of questions from users 
every day and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before.
 
Our mission to make the world's information accessible and useful is as 
relevant today as when we s
tarted. I want to begin by highlighting our 
recently launched family of hardware. It's a great example of how we bring 
together Google's strengths to help people through their day. Then I'll touch 
on ways AI is helping us approach our mission. I'll give an
 
update on our 
video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll talk about our growing cloud 
business.
 
First, hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the 
boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by 
Google hardwa
re, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware 
and AI. Our third generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google 
Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet and more. We're getting great feedback, 
and I'm very excited for users to try these 
devices, especially as the holiday 
season approaches.
 
Our new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the 
Google Assistant, Android and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we've used AI to 
create a best
-
in
-
class camera. New features like top shot mak
e it so you 
never miss a shot. If your timing wasn't perfect, the camera will suggest a 
better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you 
take really good pictures even in bad light.
 
Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip call
ed Titan M. It was built to secure 
Google's own datacenters and now we are bring it to our users. We also 
released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows 
your morning commute, lets you control your smartphone and gives you 
hand
-
fr
ee help in the kitchen, and Pixel Slate, Chrome OS reimagined as a 
tablet with all the great apps from the Play Store.
 
Our hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily 
active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in th
e last 
year alone. I'm incredibly proud of our growing hardware team, including the 
talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are 
paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more 
countries around the world.
 
Even
 
as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our 
mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 
20 years of Google search by introducing some of the biggest updates in 
many years. They include a new AI powered ra
nking approach that delivers 
more relevant results, a redesigned Google feed called Discover to help you 
stay informed on topics that matter to you and a new search experience for 
Google images.
 
We also continue to tackle the information problem of connect
ing people to 
relevant jobs right from search. This has already helped connect to over 100 
million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. 
Now U.S. service members can search for jobs for veterans and enter their 
military o
ccupational code to see relevant civilian jobs.
 
The Google Assistant continues to gain traction, drawing on our strengths in 
machine learning and helpful Google services like search, YouTube and 
Maps. We have expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 c
ountries 
and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We 
launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our 
own Google Home Hub.
 
Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new duplex technology 
wh
ich helps you complete real
-
world tasks over the phone like calling a 
restaurant to book a table and we introduced a new way to easily book ride 
services with your Google Assistant. In Maps, we also made several 
improvements including a commute tab with li
ve traffic and transit 
information and support for mixed
-
mode commutes.
 
Earlier this month, we announced an exciting test called Project Stream. We 
are working with video game publisher Ubisoft to stream their latest game, 
Assassin's Creed Odyssey to Chrom
e browsers on laptops and desktops. 
Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great 
technical advance and we look forward to seeing what's possible here.
 
I'm particularly proud of our strengths in AI are creating life
-
changing 
contrib
utions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, 
which use AI to better predict when floods will occur had the potential to 
help millions of people get out of harm's way. We are starting in India, 
where 20% of flood
-
related fatalit
ies occur today, and we're looking to 
expand to more countries soon.
 
Earlier this month, our research has showed how they've applied deep 
learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast 
cancer. Our research found that pathologist
s and AI can work together more 
effectively than either alone.
 
Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic 
opportunities for partners around the world. First YouTube. One particular 
area of focus is educational content. Every
 
day people from all over the 
world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to 
cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand 
our YouTube Learning initiative which will help fund established and 
emergin
g educational careers. We're also partnering with organizations like 
Goodwill and Year Up to create curated playlists that teach career skills 
directly in our new learning channel.
 
YouTube's Ask business continues to provide great results for marketers and
 
creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we'll be expanding our 
popular TrueView for actions format. This helps users take action directly 
from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter and 
soon they'll be able to find movie 
show times, download apps or even book a 
trip right from the app. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build 
alternative revenue products like Super Chat, channel memberships and the 
ability to sell merchandise directly to fans.
 
YouTube gaming creator, M
arquis player (19:55), increased its revenue by 
20% using channel memberships. We continue to see positive traction for 
our newest subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium YouTube TV and 
YouTube Music Premium are continuing to expand to many new count
ries. 
The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on 
YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform 
is a big priority for us.
 
Next, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we are bringing our 
machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and 
universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is 
Smart Shopping Campaigns which use signals like seasonality and price to 
optimize where ads are shown. Tens of t
housands of advertisers are using 
this and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget.
 
Just last week we announced that Nike, Best Buy and Sephora are joining 
our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from 
browsing to
 
buying with a universal card that works across Google search 
and our system.
 
In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives 
our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile 
gaming titles across 1.5 billion d
evices. Unity's developers can monetize 
their apps with Google ads without any additional development work.
 
And lastly, our growing cloud business. At Google Cloud Next, we made over 
100 announcements including the Titan security key, which features Google
 
designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer's key has been 
tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, 
which now includes vision, natural language and translation.
 
And all over the world we are seeing great 
customer adoption of our Cloud 
Platform. With help of SAP, Metro, one of the largest B2B wholesalers 
globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. 
They're using BigQuery to generate data
-
driven insights to help create more 
person
alized marketing campaigns.
 
In the U.S., we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide 
access to cloud services that help researchers access large datasets to 
accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and 
Broadco
m, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger.
 
Our G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large 
and small and we crossed two important milestones in the quarter. Google 
Drive became the eight Google product with 1 b
illion monthly active users. 
And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users.
 
One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer 
best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees 
globally to G 
Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on
-
demand 
forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our cloud business is benefiting from 
our investments in technical infrastructure including a U.S.
-
Europe cable that 
will improve speeds for millions of people.
 
Be
fore I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia 
as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see 
from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection 
of our very focused efforts to 
build great experiences for the billions of 
people across the region. We have adapted many of our core products like 
search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users 
coming online.
 
We're also building products to meet the specific nee
ds of users in the region 
like Tez, a digital payments app for India, to help people easily pay their 
electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps. Just one year since it 
launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app
 
every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. 
We have recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many 
of the app's features to others around the world.
 
We are also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 
80% of Alphabet's 
total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments 
in datacenters, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to 
users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, 
supporting t
housands of jobs and countless local businesses. This year
-
to
-
date we have added over 9,000 new employees in the U.S. and we continue 
to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it.
 
As you can see, there's exciting momentum across many different areas. I'm
 
constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a 
company and how far we have come over the last 20 years. I want to say a 
big thank you to all of Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that 
mission every day.
 
With tha
t, I'll hand it back to Ruth.

Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for Sundar if I can. Referencing 
the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of 
search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the 
company needs to make so th
at search becomes more visual or relevant and 
what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with 
your products relevant to that medium to long term.
 
And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear 
from advertis
ers that there is some blurring between brand and direct 
response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended 
lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of Adweek 
were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct re
sponse. How 
are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for 
product development long term? Thanks so much.
 
Sundar Pichai

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thanks, Eric. I'll take the two. The first on search. You're right that search, 
we are always
 
trying to anticipate what the user experience expectations are 
and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, people do want 
immersive engaging experiences. They want their experiences to be more 
visual and that's partly what you saw us announ
ce in our 20th birthday 
event. And we are excited to move in that direction.
 
And I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a 
big part of what we do. We are investing in image search and we do have 
products like Google Maps and 
Photos which all add to the visual experience. 
And as part of doing that, we are investing in our advertising offerings as 
well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand
-
in
-
hand. But I think 
it's an important evolution for us.
 
In terms of YouTube
, I think part of what makes YouTube great is I think we 
can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct 
response is something that can work well on YouTube. And our instinct is 
bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases t
hat are many times now 
sometimes instead of search, actually find something I want to do in 
YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place. And I research it on 
YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our 
standpoint, we want 
to make sure that we are evolving the product to bring 
those opportunities to advertisers. So I'm very excited by it.

Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, two questions for you. First, earlier this 
month or it might have been late last month, Sridhar Ramaswamy, your 
Head of Ads and Commerce left to go 
to a VC firm. I'm betting that wasn't a 
surprise to you, but I'm just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of 
succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect 
any sort of broad changes to ad product strategy.
 
And then secon
d, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary 
were the evolution of Feed to Discover. And I recognize that's an evolution 
of a product, but it does look like you're taking advantage of that long 
unused white space on google.com. And so, just love 
to hear a little bit 
more, just sort of a follow
-
up on Eric's question on the evolution of search, 
but how you see that surface in particular evolving and particularly the 
potential for ad monetization over time. Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Good. On the first one, look I mean we, one of the things I'm really proud 
about Google is we have a deep bench of talent and for example in the ads 
team almost all of our senior ads leadership has been here for well over a 
decade. And so for us, we are fo
rtunate to be able to tap into it.
 
Our ads leadership comes 

 
Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product 
and engineering efforts, someone I worked with for many, many years, and 
most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, 
is a deep computer scientist. And I expect to, for him to continue our 
tradition of technical excellence with the 

 
approach our advertising work. 
Also want to mentioned Philip and his team, his extraordinary team, who 
definitely lead many of our initiativ
es here. And Philip and Prabhakar, with 
them I think it's in great hands. And I expect a lot of continuity there.
 
On your question on search and Discover, it's in addition to making search 
more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not 
always do 
users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be 
there when users need us, anticipate what they want and sometimes 
proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role. 
Right? And I think we are t
hinking hard about how we can surface relevant 
information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on, in a 
way in which it's delightful for them and is showing up for them when they 
need it.
 
So I see that as an important evolution of sea
rch as well. And so you're 
going to see us investing more. Mobile offers us a great opportunity. And if 
you use it in Pixel 3, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of 
how to bring all these products together and we'll give you a good sens
e of 
how we plan to do that over time.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of 
Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
 
Anthony DiClemente

Evercore Group
 
LLC
 
Great. Thank you for taking my questions. First for Sundar, you spent some 
time on hardware. You spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, 
the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those 
investments in hardware,
 
both in the products and on the marketing side 
here in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for 
success that we should be looking for on hardware?
 
And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for 2019, 
how are you
 
thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and 
dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the 
macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to 
the broader ads environment as it was this year and
 
in prior years? Thank 
you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing. And so, 
and a lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing 
together the entire experience in an integrated w
ay for our users. And we 
genuinely see a very differentiated way to do this. We think of our approach 
of bringing together AI software and hardware is unique and we think we 
can deliver the best
-
in
-
class experience and we are committed to doing it. At 
the 
same time, we want to build a great business here as well. So we are 
investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business 
opportunity for us as well, so both go hand
-
in
-
hand.
 
We closely look at metrics, and the metrics we have been 
very focused on 
for the last couple of years. This is our third generation of hardware. It's the 
first time we actually are doing our products end
-
to
-
end, and we've 
expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We 
measure NPS scores
. And our scores are now reflecting best
-
in
-
class in the 
category. And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and 
we are thoughtfully building a business but we are committed to building 
and investing for the long run.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphab
et, Inc.
 
And in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it 
now. And many of the questions sort of been already asked sort of point to 
the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the 
ads business as we'
ve talked about on numerous calls. We continue to invest 
here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage 
machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers. 
And some of the comments that Sundar made about the
 
opportunities that 
open up with visual search again continue to point the direction direct 
response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're 
focused.
 
But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we 
conti
nue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term. 
Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really 
important examples, and we think the steps that we're taking, the 
investments we're making, provide the foundational supp
ort for ongoing 
long
-
term sustained growth. And so then we marry that with the second part 
of your question, which is in how do we think about the pace of investment. 
As we've said repeatedly, we're very focused on investing for the long term. 
We're trying
 
to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity 
set that we have and we make the right types of trade
-
offs but we do 
remain focused on long
-
term investing given the scale of the opportunities 
that we see.

Got it, thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Mark Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. Two questions please. One, Sundar, could you just update us with 
your th
inking on China and the China market and the extent. I know Google 
is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand, re
-
expand your presence there with search.
 
And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of 
Way
mo, do you know when, do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing 
established and you'll have a roughly well
-
defined and acted on go
-
to
-
market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next 
year, whenever? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And, Mark, on China, we obviously, we deeply care about serving Chinese 
users. We've been investing for many years and especially from developing 
Android. But more recently, we have launched mobile apps such as Google 
Translate and Files 
Go and improved our developer tools there. So we are 
constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users. And 
that's where we are today.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And then in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you 
know, we 
extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group and we moved into very 
early days of commercialization. So we do now have people paying for rides 
and we're also testing pricing models.
 
I think the main point, we've said this repeatedly is that,
 
we are intently 
focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what 
that means is, we're really expanding the program methodically. We're 
taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic 
footprint.
 
And then on to
p of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been 
developing the B2B opportunity. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been 
piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their 
employees and customers. And again it's earl
y days. So small revenues, but 
we're pleased to be testing this out as well, and then on top of that 
continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and 
for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities. So you can
 
see 
a move in the third quarter. But as we said repeatedly, it's very early days 
and we are taking a very deliberate iterative approach to broadening it out.

Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. An
d our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on map 
monetization and putting some more ads in the map. Can you just tal
k 
about sort of early learnings there? I know you talked about local mobile 
searches growing quite rapidly in the past. But any early learnings from the 
monetization and the return that advertisers are getting on that front?
 
And the second one on video gam
es and Project Stream. Could you just talk 
a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet, and 
what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and 
scale direct
-
to
-
consumer facing cloud gaming product.
 
Sundar Pi
chai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time and we 
are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant. But I wouldn't 
underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local 
mobile searc
hes are growing faster than just mobile searches overall, and 
have increased by almost 50% in the last year.
 
So for us, that's an important focus area and Maps plays a big role there. So 
we recently announced Local campaigns, which is a new campaign type 
s
pecifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right. And it's 
going to roll out in the coming months. And so that is a big focus.
 
And as you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with 
newer ad formats on Maps itself. 
We have promoted places which appears 
on the map itself. We have place page ads which appear on Google listings 
in Maps and search. But we are definitely in the phase of putting those, 
testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure w
e 
can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the 
opportunity in local search, it's a big opportunity and we are focused there.
 
On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across 
Google ads but in many ways, r
ight. Obviously, Google Play does this a lot. 
It's a big important vertical on YouTube. And so we touch with gaming 
developers across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking 
about what more we can do there.
 
And Project Stream, having spent 
my life on computing. I was blown away 
by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real
-
time interactions 
and to be able to do that from the cloud. And it's one of the most important 
technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going t
o focus on 
that and make sure we are making progress there and bring newer 
experiences for gamers.

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, can 
you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms 
of licenses and TAC going forward? And what impact do see that
 
having on 
financials? And then Ruth, can you just talk about where you are in the 
hardware replacement cycle in your datacenters? Pretty major step up this 
year just given that large ramp. How are you thinking about the trajectory 
into 2019? Thank you.
 
Su
ndar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thanks, Doug. On Europe, I mean it's early to say. We'll begin only 
implementing the remedy in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, we 
always, we're focused on complying with the commission's directive and we 
want to mak
e sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM 
partners is as smooth as possible.
 
In this case you're dealing with life cycles for mobile phones. So changes is 
going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the 
licensi
ng model will be adopted. But our products are very popular with 
users across platforms. And so it's early to say but we're focused on doing 
the right thing there.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx as w
e talked 
about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in 
our core ads and search businesses as well as the longer
-
term opportunities 
in newer businesses in particular to support cloud. And then very 
importantly, as we've talke
d about machine learning across Alphabet.
 
And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning, 
because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers 
and for enterprise customers. And so given our view about the
 
long
-
term 
potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we 
have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what 
you're really seeing with the uptick in investment.
 
To give you a bit of a breakdown, the 
largest component continues to be 
machines. But relative to last year, it's important to note that datacenter 
construction is an increasing percentage of our CapEx investment. And so 
we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 datacenter sites 
g
lobally. We're also investing in network infrastructure such as undersea 
cables so we can deliver speed and quality. So again this really goes to our 
view of the opportunity set.
 
That being said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of CapEx 
and
 
also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our 
decisions here on CapEx don't just result in CapEx spend but also translate 
into higher depreciation expenses and that goes both to cost of sales and 
OpEx. So very careful about how we're
 
using it, but I want to make sure that 
we've built for the requirements that we have.
 
And as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note 
that our facility spend, namely real estate, was more muted this quarter and 
it was primarily 
just the ongoing work on our ground up development. So 
you're primarily seeing what's going on, on technical infrastructure here.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

Great. Thank you both.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross S
andler of Barclays. 
Your line is now open.
 
Ross Sandler 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Great. Two questions. Ruth, so you guys posted pretty solid growth all 
around. But if we look at some of the international markets, each geography 
had a tougher comp and decel
erated a little bit on a currency
-
neutral basis. 
So, I guess, stepping that high level, the growth rates are solid. But can you 
give us any color on the overall macro picture here? I think we're getting 
mixed feedback from different companies across differ
ent sectors. So any 
high
-
level comments would be helpful on just the ad market given that 
you're close to 20% of global advertising ex
-
China.
 
And then, Sundar, question on I guess Pixel and just the overall advance 
that you're seeing in smartphone devices.
 
So as you guys roll out more 
products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of 
your 1 billion
-
plus apps like search and YouTube, is there any way to parse 
out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and 
West
ern Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and can 
you keep adding these additional utilities? Is query volume going up on a per 
user basis? Any color there will be helpful.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So in terms of your first question, 
we actually felt pretty good about the 
strength globally, which as I noted in opening comments, across the board, 
20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base. As Sundar noted, what's going 
on in APAC, 30% year
-
on
-
year growth. It's now over a $5 billion re
venue 
business and we've had sustained quarter after quarter growth at this kind 
of 30%
-
ish area, feel really good about that.
 
And by country, it really does reflect broad
-
based strength. As he said, we're 
very focused on the region. And I think we're deli
vering terrific products and 
experiences in rapidly growing markets. You see the same thing in other 
Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year
-
on
-
year growth. 
So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we 
make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we 
build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great. We 
definitely see use
rs engaging more. And so, we see an opportunity. And 
that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that 
into an experience, both for our ecosystem as well as for us. It helps us give 
users a much deeper engaged experience as well. An
d when you look at all 
our products, we see that. And so, we do see that as an opportunity.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of 
MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
 
Michael Brian Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson LLC
 
Th
anks. I have two for Sundar, kind of the same theme. One is on the Pixel 
3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder, 
when you look at to date the success ramping the product, what's been the 
gating factor? Has it been the carr
iers? Has it been the price? And we look at 
the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have a 
scaled, what are the factors?
 
And then on Verily, you called out some deals you've had with big 
pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But
 
again there I wonder, who's 
your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals, insurance, governments? So 
we think about the big opportunity, where is the most natural fit to drive 
Verily going forward?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On Pixel, look, first of
 
all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation 
of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we've been scaling up the product 
in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So if you 
remember the first couple generations were strug
gling to meet the early 
demand we saw. This is the first year we have done it end
-
to
-
end and we 
are ramping up from there. And so each year when I look at all the metrics, 
be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our reviews, etcetera, everything is 
progressing
 
well.
 
But there are, you're right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all is to 
be able to build the supply we need. And second is go
-
to
-
market, getting 
ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as 
possible with 
as many carrier certifications as possible. So in each of those 
dimensions, we are making progress as well.
 
Ruth Porat

Alphabet, Inc.
 
In terms of Verily, what we've talked about there is, they have partnered 
with a whole host of leading pharmaceutical co
mpanies focusing on specific 
diseases, whether it's diabetic retinopathy or across the board for 
neurological diseases. I announced a couple of new partnerships, the 
ResMed arrangement as well as Gilead. And that's what they tend to do. 
They partner with b
est
-
in
-
class to focus on specific areas where working with 
the pharmaceutical companies they can, and the technology we have, and 
benefiting from machine learning, we can really move from reactive to 
proactive care. That's the Verily focus.

Great. Thank you. I just wanted to 
focus on cloud a little bit more. Sundar, 
you gave some good color in your prepared remarks. But I'm wondering if 
you could share with us an update maybe on the partner momentum and 
direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that 
ch
ange?
 
And also if you could highlight, if you've noticed if there's been noticeable 
changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature. 
And you, also in the beginning of the year and exiting Q4, you would give us 
some high
-
level gro
wth commentary about GCP. and I'm just wondering if 
you have anything else you could share? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Thanks, Heather. Look, overall I mean it's now we've been doing this 
seriously at the next level for three years. And we a
re definitely seeing 
strong indicators that are the investment in product is clearly beginning to 
work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive 
situations. I've seen many important wins in what seemed like very, very 
competitive situati
ons.
 
I also don't, from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero
-
sum game as 
you know. We're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like 
very early days. And more importantly, the general sense I get is, we're 
very aligned with where th
e market is headed in the long run. And this 
notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked 
in and allowing for a multi
-
cloud environment to develop. That's the 
direction we are betting on and our indications are that the mark
et is headed 
in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort. That gives us a lot 
of comfort as well.

go to market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of 
our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership str
ategy is 
beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead that's we are 
clearly seeing momentum there as well. In this business, obviously the 
enterprise business plays in a way in which you do have wins, but those 
accounts turn into larger revenue
 
deals over time. And so it's very clear to 
us that we are laying the foundation and we are getting the strong early 
momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way 
in the area. And over time, we'll obviously share more here as wel
l.

And could I just ask one follow
-
up if possible? I was just wondering if you 
look at Microsoft, they have a on
-
premise and cloud strategy. If you look at 
Amazon ,what they're doing with AWS and VMware, they're ki
nd of doing a 
similar strategy. Do you think there's a requirement for you to also have an 
on
-
premise strategy to solve this hybrid world as long as it's hybrid for? 
Thank you.

We are thoughtfully looking at it. I mean we are
 
increasingly working with 
partners like, for example our partnership from SAP or Pivotal, VMware, 
these are all on hybrid cloud solutions. And so we are thinking about how to 
do that better. and our overall approach to cloud hybrid modernization I 
think i
s the right long
-
term direction and so we are doing that. And there are 
many, many situations we are in where on
-
prem is a big, big, big 
requirement for customers, but with our partnership approach, we've been 
able to address the needs well. So, I don't se
e that as a gating issue for us.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your

Thanks. Ruth, I just wanted to see if yo
u could quantify the FX headwind. I 
think it was a negative 1% for Q3 and in Q4, do you anticipate it to be 
similar or a little worse?
 
Ruth Porat

I will let you forecast the dollar. As you noted, it was 1 point here. We went 
from a tailwin
d in the second quarter to a 1 point drag here going forward. 
But we called out that and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact, 
for example, a pretty big delta between our reported and fixed and other 
Americas, 19% to 28% growth and that was reall
y what was going on with 
the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. We saw some movements in other 
currencies around the globe, but you can see that, which is why we broke 
out the geography the way we've done it a number of quarters ago to try 
and give you
, help give a better sense of the types of headwinds and I'll let 
you forecast the dollar.

Okay, we look forward to that. Real quick just on EMEA, you were flat on 
your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last two quarters de
spite with 
GDPR. So, I would believe that would suggest that you're probably not 
seeing as big a headwind perhaps as maybe some expect. Could you just 
talk to the European business and what you're seeing there?

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, I mean s
pecifically, I think if your question is around GDPR and so on, 
first of all, I mean we've always been as a company very, very focused on 
user privacy and security. And so in some ways we were very early on, 
engaged on GDPR and we worked very hard to make 
sure our products are 
ready in in compliance. We've generally always approached our products 
with a strong privacy lens for our users. So, and I think that helps us work 
through these changes, because I don't think they are at odds with what we 
are trying 
to accomplish. I think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set 
of regulations. And so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on 
our products and for our users.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank 
of America Merrill 
Lynch. Your line is now open.

Great, thank you. One quick one for Ruth. People are really asking about 
Amazon. Just wondering if your e
-
commerce vertical was any difference 
versus your other verticals in the quar
ter. Anything to call out there?
 
And then secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube 
and Waymo and cloud and other areas. As you look out two or three years, 
do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positi
ve 
difference on the bottom line for overall Google? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e
-
commerce, maybe really in 
people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see 
strong gr
owth there as well. We see is an important use case and that's why 
we are investing a lot. And if you look at our recent work with Shopping 
Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there.
 
And when we do those things, we clearly see users
 
respond. Like for 
example, on Shopping Actions I think we just recently had partnerships with 
Best Buy and Nike and Sephora, I mentioned it earlier. So we are continuing 
to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail 
sector, b
oth in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud. 
And I think that continues to be a big opportunity.
 
And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across 
Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over
 
the past 
20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer 
science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an 
opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas. There are a lot of 
opportunities ahead of us. W
e are pretty disciplined about where we focus 
on and we're focused on real large opportunities. And when you mention 
areas like YouTube and Waymo and cloud and hardware, they all fit the 
category. But we take a very long
-
term view. And we want to investiga
te the 
user experience right. And we're pretty confident that when we do that, the 
value will follow.

Good day and welcome everyone to the Google Inc.'s Third Quarter 2014 

turn the call over to Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead.
 
Ellen West
 
Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's third 
quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette 
and Omid Kordestani.
 
As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor 
Relatio
ns website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR 
website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that 
accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page 
for the latest Company news and updat
es. This call is also being webcast 
from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our 
website later today.
 
Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking includin
g statements 
regarding Google's future investments, our long
-
term growth and 
innovation, the expected [Audio Gap] this presentation and we undertake no 
obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these 
forward
-
looking statement
s in light of new information or future events. 
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk 
factors that may affect our results.
 
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as 
operating income 
and operating margin, are expressed on a non
-
GAAP basis 
and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock
-
based 
compensation and, as applicable, other special items. We've also adjusted 
our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capit
al expenditures 
which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of 
non
-
GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, Ellen. As some 
of you may know, we have a new leader in our 

voice you just heard a minute ago, a second ago. Ellen is a long term 
Googler who joined us in 2007. Although she is here with us today
 
in 
Mountain View, she is actually based out of New York and that will give us a 
bit more footprint on the East Coast as well. So, Ellen, welcome to the team.
 

Our gross total 
consolidated revenue grew a healthy 20% year
-
over
-
year to 
$16.5 billion and was up 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Without currency 
fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have been 
19% year
-
over
-
year. Google sites revenue was also up 20% 
year
-
over
-
year 
to $11.3 billion and was up 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by the strength 
in our mobile search.
 
Network revenue was up 9% year

over

over
-
year growth in the 
AdMob
 

grew a healthy 50% year
-
over
-
year to $1.8 billion and was up 15% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, this driven by year
-
over
-
year growth mainly from the Play 
Store but also complemented by an increase in 
licensing revenue.
 
Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 17% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down 
only 2% year
-
over
-
year and flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And without currency 
fluctuations, aggre
gate cost per click would have been down 1%, and in fact, 
up 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
As we began to do in our last earnings call, we continue to disclose paid 
clicks and cost per click changes by property type as well in addition to the 
aggregate number. 
So to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 24% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Google sites CPC were 
down 4% year
-
over

over

paid clicks were up 2% year
-
over

-
over
-
qu
arter 
and network CPCs were down 4% year
-
over
-
year but up 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our aggregate monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a 
number of factors including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well 
as ongoing products and policy c
hanges.
 
Turning to geographic performance now, we saw solid performance in the 
U.S. as well as in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can 
find on our Investor Relations website, you will see that we've broken down 
our revenue by U.S., 
UK and the rest of the world to show the impact of FX 
and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for 
the exact calculations. U.S. revenue was up 15% year
-
on
-
year to $7 billion. 
The UK was up 17% year
-
over
-
year to 1.6 billion a
nd in fixed FX terms, the 
UK grew 10% year
-
over
-
year. In the UK, growth was impacted by a 
combination of factors this quarter including platform and property mix as 
well as tough comps from year
-
over
-
year and quarter
-
over
-
quarter growth 
rates for a number 
of reasons including for example weather. Our non
-
U.S. 
revenue excluding the UK was up 26% year
-
over
-
year to $7.9 billion. This 
accounted for 48% of total revenue which includes a 10 million benefit from 
our hedging program. In fixed FX terms in fact the r
est of the world also 
grew 26% year
-
over
-
year, very healthy.
 
Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 
23% of total advertising revenue. Our non
-
GAAP other cost of revenue was 
2.8 billion in Q3 which excludes stock
-
based c
ompensation and also a non
-
cash impairment charge of 378 million related to a patent licensing royalty 
asset acquired as part of our Motorola Mobility purchase. Non
-
GAAP 
operating expenses totaled 5 billion, again excluding SBC. And as a result, 
our non
-
GA
AP operating profit [Audio Gap] and our non
-
GAAP operating 
margin were 32% in Q3.
 
Headcount was up roughly 3,000 in Q3. In total, we ended the quarter with 
approximately 55,000 full time employees. And please note that the 
headcount does include still appr
oximately 3,500 full time employees from 
the Motorola business. In the past year, we continued to attract and hire the 
best talent from the best colleges and universities from all around the world. 
Continuing our past trend, graduate starts are much more h
eavily 
concentrated in Q3, which is part of why you are seeing the significant bump 
in headcount with the majority being tech hires, I want to kind of 
emphasize.
 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% for Q3 and which includes the 
impact of the imp
airment charge that I mentioned earlier which is a non
-
deductible for income tax purposes.
 
Let me turn now to cash management. OI&E or other income and expenses 
was $133 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset 
the continued impact
 
of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for 
more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call 
on our IR website. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash 
flow at $6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.4 billi
on. In this quarter the 
majority of the CapEx was related to our data center construction, 
production equipment and real estate purchases, in that order. It's important 
to remember that our infrastructure supports all of our products, whether 
they are core
 
products like or Search or Ads, Maps or YouTube, but in 
addition to fueling our growth products like Photos and Hangouts, Google For 
Work and the Cloud platform. If you look at our data center announcements 
over the last four quarters, you will also see t
hat we've been really busy with 
both groundbreakings and expansion all around the world including Finland, 
Taiwan, Singapore, recently announced Netherlands in addition to our 
ongoing investments in the U.S. In total, our free cash flow was then 3.6 
billio
n.
 
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team 
continues to work hard and we look forward to seeing them join the Lenovo 
team soon. Motorola had a great Q3, with strong user reviews for products 
like the Moto X, Moto 360 and Mot
o Hint, clearly demonstrating the 
impressive momentum of the company.
 
So there you have it. Strong results with continued strong growth in both 
revenue and profits and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund 
strategic growth opportunities inclu
ding the usual Android, Chromes and 
YouTube but also Google For Work and Cloud to name a few.
 
Before I hand things over to Omid, I'd like to share with you some great 
news. I am really thrilled to announce that Omid is now officially Google's 
Chief Busines
s Officer and this on a permanent basis. All of us at Google 
couldn't be happier to see Omid at his post running our business 
organization once again. And with that, I will turn it over to him for more 
details on our performance in the quarter. And after h
is remarks as usual, 
we will have Jamie open up the lines for your questions. Here you go, Omid.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thank you very much, Patrick. And hello, everyone. I am Omid Kordestani. I 
am happy to be back at my new old job and thank you for joining us t
his 
afternoon. I joined Google back in 1999 to help get our business off the 
ground and led our business operations until 2009. Since then I have served 
as an advisor for Larry and outside Google actively helped many 
entrepreneurs. I am thrilled to be back
 
at Google leading our global business 
again.
 
We continue to have the same boundless energy and endless curiosity we've 
always had as a company and we are as focused as ever in our mission of 
making information useful and accessible to everyone. Case in po
int, we are 
really excited about this week's Android Lollipop launch. This is our largest 
release on Android ever with over 5,000 APIs for developers. It adds new 
features including better notifications, battery life and security and 
introduces a refreshed
, consistent visual style. And alongside the new 
devices Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, consumers in India who bought 
the recently announced Android One will get the update to the latest 
software at the same time.
 

e business highlights from Q3. As 

advertising, our advertising platforms and our emerging non
-
ads businesses. 

 
Peopl


hand as a developer of many services, Maps, YouTube, Gmail that also are 

mobile apps. With that in mind, we have a 
simple goal with performance ads: help marketers connect with customers 
at the right moment to drive measurable results.
 
Our partners have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads with AdMob 
on our click to dow
nload formats. But most mobile apps are downloaded, 
used once and eventually deleted. So we launched new features to help 
advertisers re
-
engage with users post download. For example, advertisers 
can now deep link from their search ads directly into their m
obile apps. To 
succeed with multi
-
screen marketing, advertisers also need modern 
measurement tools so they can understand when their ads drive phone calls 
from customers resulting conversions on other devices or lead to store visits 
and purchases. Last Oct
ober we announced estimated total conversions, our 
effort to help marketers better measure the value of their multi
-
screen 

cost device measurement for display ads. Clients have alre
ady found that 
mobile display campaigns drive 15% more conversions than they had 
previously measured.
 

performance ads we are directly connecting people with [Audio Gap] and 
then 
enabling them to buy and have them delivered. We keep making 
improvements to our products to help retailers. Keeping inventory organized 
and up to date is a constant challenge for retailers. We help them manage 
this issue by completing the transition of pr
oduct listing ads to our shopping 
campaigns platform.
 
And finally, people often want to find stores near them to make a purchase 

show customers this information in the U.S. and we laun
ched these in the 
UK, France, Germany, Japan and Australia last quarter. In summary, the 
core of our business, performance advertising, continues to deliver great 
results.
 

digital t
he best possible canvas for creative and effective brand
-
building 

advertising starts with great content. On YouTube, stars produce amazing 
content that our users love from Bethany Mota
 
to Smosh to Mental Floss. 
Earlier this year we launched Google Preferred to help connect brands with 
premium ad inventory on our most popular YouTube channels. Since then we 

getting star

of our U.S. Google Preferred offering which represents among the top 5% of 
popular channels inventory on YouTube. And as a result of terrific brand 
events in Germany, France, UK and Australia,
 

interest from local agency partners around the world.
 
Last quarter we also saw some great progress in our brand efforts beyond 
YouTube. We launched new ad formats customized for mobile screens. We 
also announced an expansion of You

network of more than 650,000 mobile apps. Everyday our teams work to 
develop both the products and terrific partner relationships that enable us to 
tackle any digital marketing challenge across multiple channels together. 
W
ith encouragement from Google and YouTube, ABC executed a digital first 
marketing plan for their new fall TV line up. Their effort included custom five

Exchange to customized private exchanges which complement our core 
offerings. This quarter we signed new private advertising exchange deals 
with pub
lishers like Fox TV and Edmunds. This helps publishers generate 
revenue from premium ad space. We have nearly doubled the number of

of the amazing Android ecosystem. We brought 
Play Music to 17 new 
countries, bringing the total to 45 and our expansion continues. Today, Play 
Movies is available in 93 countries and Play Books is available in 61 
countries.
 
On the hardware front, just yesterday, we unveiled three fantastic new 
Nexus 
devices, Nexus 6 phone, Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus [Audio Gap] and 
Android powered streaming media player. This quarter we worked with HP, 
Toshiba and Acer to introduce five new Chromebook devices and teamed up 
with Asus, LG, Motorola, Samsung and Sony to he
lp launch new Android 

now available in 31 countries around the world. And we sold more than 1 
million Chromebooks for education this quarter, even more than last quarter.
 
Chromecast 

smashing success. Users have hit the cast button more than 400 million 
times since it launched to enjoy their favorite sports, music, premium 
movies and TV shows. In September, we added even more
 
content to 
Chromecast, including Disney content. And we were so proud to launch 
Android One, an effort to make high quality low cost smartphones available 

other countries, includ
ing Indonesia and the Philippines in the coming 
months.
 
For businesses, what was called Google Enterprise, is now simply Google for 
Work. This business has great traction. In addition to the tremendous 
growth in our Apps business, we have more than 1,800 s
ignups for Google 
Drive for Work every week. Plus there are almost 250 billion active Google 
Drive users, including consumer, education and business users.
 
We continue to invest in our growing Cloud platform business, helping 
developers realize the promise
 
of cloud computing by providing affordable 
on

-
class technology. We recently announced Google 
Cloud Platform for Startups and offer up to $100,000 in credits to enable the 

 
S
ony Music recently built an interactive app in less than three weeks using 
App Engine to engage fans tuning into One Direction Day, an eight
-
hour 
YouTube livestream featuring the band, one of the largest ever YouTube 
music live streams.
 
Lastly, our marketi
ng team had a great quarter as well. Google My Business 
helped more small businesses get online. And our Art, Copy & Code project 
showed advertisers the creative potential of digital marketing. And from the 
annual Google Science Fair to more recent campaig
ns showcasing amazing 
content on Play, YouTube stars and the power of the Google App, the magic 
of Google was on prominent display.
 
All told, it was another terrific quarter at Google, continued momentum in 
our core business and exciting innovation in new 
areas. Kudos to the 
Googlers around the world who made it all happen.

Thanks for taking the questions. So, first one, maybe with the 

g Express into other 
cities and rebranding it and new retailers are coming on, [Audio Gap] what 
you saw on those first few cities to think about extending it further into the 
other cities. And what you might be hearing from feedback from retailers 
about ad
opting the platform because a few also dropped off the platform at 
the same time? Just wanted to get a little bit better color about how that 
was developing and how you were going to go forward with it. Thanks.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thank you very much, Eric. So
, we're really trying to learn a lot here. 
Innovation is a messy process and especially with Google Express here. 
There is a lot of understanding that we need to have on improving efficiency 
in the logistics process, trying to find price points that shoppe
rs find 
attractive. And our goal is really to help the over 35 merchant partners 
succeed and reach their customers. And I'm a user of it and I am really 
impressed by how much time it saves. I see the cars running around the city 
around me. And I think our 
goal is really to take it a step at a time and see 
the success, understand the logistical operations, how much it costs us to do 
this and can we deliver this basically in a successful way.

Just Eric, just a couple of kind of additional poi

announced this week three other cities. So if you go back to the fundamental 
premise of [Audio Gap] which is the first thing was would people show up

The second question then is, we've had a lot of questions about 
monetization, and we've announced this week we're taking real actions on 
the monetization service, both including commissions on each transa
ction 
from merchants, but also service fees that were announced as well. So from 
that perspective, we kind of think of it as now we're in Phase II of this 
product where according to our business plan we continue to kind of look for 
the barriers, the milest
ones, and then when we hit those milestones, we 
with enthusiasm keep on going. All this to say, it is nevertheless a scale 
business, so working on efficiencies, working on all of the issues that are 
related to logistics continues to be a big focus of ours.
 
And on the partners, I mean we're really thrilled to have the partners we 
have. You can expect as we kind of grow through this that we have a few 
coming in, a few coming out, but overall very, very pleased with the 
trajectory there. And so I think you sho
uld see the announcements of this 
week as this kind of sign of optimism and momentum in it.
 
Thank you so much for your question, Eric.

Thank you. I'm wondering if you can help us at all segregate the search 
business from other items in Google website and just give us your view on 
the health of the search business.
 
And then comment a little bit on the paid 
click deceleration, what's driving that? And do you even see that as an 
important metric? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So I'll take that. The two points is, one, look, we don't give the breakdown 
of the Google site
s, but actually it's pretty healthy on all dimensions. I think 
that from that perspective, search is going well. And all of the other 
dimensions of our sites have actually doing pretty well, and that's what you 
see in our kind of 20% year
-
over
-
year just fo
r sites growth. So from that 
perspective, I think that we're pretty happy on that front.
 
On the CPC issue, it's pretty simple. I mean we really had 
--
 
again, you have 
to think of the CPC and the volume as one basket that actually delivers. So 
monetization 
overall is still very strong. We're very happy with the 
monetization, Jamie. And if we have in one quarter kind of movements 
between one and the other, that's just basically the continued 
experimentation and the impact of all the factors that I usually tal
k about.
 
So from that perspective, there was nothing noteworthy to kind of mention 
this quarter. We're very happy with the trends in both cases.

Unidentified Analyst
 
Hey, thanks. So I think in the past you've talked about the opportunity cost 
of not being 
there for the user when they're trying to access your products 
and services as a rationale for making investments. So is there any data you 
can share on your newest users in the emerging markets who are going 
straight to mobile? Is it safe to assume that c
onsumption from these new 
users are running at a pretty similar growth trajectory with what you've seen 
historically on a desktop and as well as your established markets? Or is their 
engagement with all of your products more intense?
 
And is there anything 
you can say in terms of what areas of your business 
are seeing the more intense level of investments? Is it more your consumer
-
focused initiatives or more your enterprise
-
focused cloud initiatives? Thank 
you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So a couple points there, and 
then if Omid has additional comments. One is 
clearly emerging businesses 
--
 
emerging markets are just fundamentally 
different than the more developed markets, if you think of a country like 
Indonesia or India where people go straight to mobile. And so in t
hat 
context, there's clearly a lot of differences between those markets and how 
they're evolving compared to what would have been 10 years ago the UK or 
the U.S. So from that perspective, I think that 
--
 
and that's why you see us 
launch things like Android
 
One, right? When you have 1 billion 
--
 
just under 
2 billion people around the world that have already smartphones, the vast 
majority of the population looks for things online. So these kind of initiatives 
that we're launching is the most important piece.
 
From an investment at Google, we're investing 
--
 
without giving you all the 
details, we're clearly investing in our core business. It remains the focus of 
our activities. But if you look across 
--
 
as Omid mentioned, he mentioned 
the Cloud business, the Goo
gle For Work business, all of these other areas, 
the Play business, the Hardware business, these are all areas where we're 
investing and we're investing with enthusiasm with each their own specific 
business case, each of them are actually looking for what 
is their growth and 
profitability models and we just monitor them pretty tightly.
 
Okay, so you're welcome. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

Hey, Patrick, in describing the Google search strength, you said you saw 
particular strength in mobile search. Could you elaborate?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yeah. I mean, look, it's very clear that mobile is still a big part of our 
growth. And we're very 
pleased about it. I mean, it's 
--
 
but when we talk 
about mobile, I think there's a couple things. One is you have to continue to 
look at both the growth in volume and the growth in pricing. So these are 
long
-
term trends that we're seeing. The CPCs and the 
clicks, they can 
fluctuate from quarter
-
to
-
quarter. It just happens that we've made some 
changes this quarter that improved the mobile pricing while impacting the 
lower quality clicks and that's what you see a bit reflected in our numbers.
 
And again, and I
 
wouldn't 
--
 
just as an overall statement, remember to 
everybody that I wouldn't attribute the aggregate CPC movement [Audio 
Gap] mobile, because there's still a full factor mix that 
--
 
as I talked in my 
remarks about geography and about our product change
s. And so all this 
actually makes a big factor as well. So that's what we've seen in the 
strength in mobile, but we're still very pleased with the momentum.
 
Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Ross Sand
ler with Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Sandler 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Thanks, guys. I just had two questions, first on the UK and then second on 
mobile payments. So the UK growth, looks like it's dropping off pretty hard 
on an ex
-
FX basis, either one
-
year or two
-
year growt
h rates. So I think this 
is an economy that folks generally think is supposed to be holding up pretty 
well. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the UK? You had 
mentioned weather and a few other things, but a little bit more color on 
what's going on
 
with the ad market in the UK.
 
And then mobile payments, that's an area that's getting a lot of attention 
lately. Can you just give us an update on where the Google Wallet team 
stands and what kind of traction you're seeing in terms of user adoption and 
ma
ybe how you plan on addressing merchant payments kind of outside of 
in
-
app or things from the app store? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So, Ross, why don't I take the first question and then Omid will give you the 
answer on the second?
 
As we talk about the UK
, a couple points are worth note. One is, the UK 
contributed roughly 10% of our total revenue this quarter, and that's been 
the same for kind of the past many quarters. And in fact, if you go back 
years, it will still be in the same range. So there's nothi
ng kind of 
fundamental that 
--
 
it's worth noting that it's still a pretty good market with 
decent growth.
 
The issue of deceleration this quarter specifically, on platform 
--
 
I mean I 
mentioned a number of elements, right? So platform mix, we do see [Audio 
Gap] of desktop, tablet searches having a greater impact in UK than 
anywhere else that we see in our network of countries. On property mix, 
remember we talked about this also on prior calls. AFS as a business has 
much bigger part of our both UK and U.S. bu
siness, so it will skew to those 
geographies. And so those are kind of some of the elements.
 
And as I mentioned, year
-
over
-
year comps were difficult. And then if you 
have a great summer in terms of weather or bad summer in weather, it can 
have some real im
pact on the growth rates as well. So it's a combination of 
a number of factors that the UK has driven our performance, but still pretty 
pleased. But I won't 
--
 
that's really what's going on there.
 
In terms of the payments, I'll let Omid give you an update 
there.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Hi, Ross. I think our goal here is really achieving mass merchant adoption, 
so the availability of these NFC devices is about that and also making it 
easier for consumers to replace their wallets with their smartphones 
hopefully more
 
and more over time. So reducing friction in everyday 
shopping experiences is how we approach it and the focus on the user and 
we're really developing a fully functional payment system.
 
So, as you may know, users can send money today to friends through Gma
il 
using the Wallet app. We have loyalty and gift cards that can be stored in 
the Wallet app. The Buy with Google button makes it possible for users to 
make purchases very quickly with two clicks. So, again, it's this two
-
fronted 
focus on merchant adoption
 
and removing the friction for users.
 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, Ross. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Ben Schachter

Macquarie
 
Omid, after many years of waiting for televi
sion budgets to shift online, it 
appears to be happening in a more accelerated fashion. So, one, do you 
agree with that? And two, could you just discuss YouTube's positioning 
versus competitors and in particular Facebook Video?
 
And then Patrick, a couple o
f quick ones for you. One, given the evolution of 
tax laws in Europe, how are you and how should we be thinking about 
Google's tax rate over the coming years? And then also just any comments 
on stock comp being particularly high this quarter? Thanks.
 
Omid 
Kordestani
 
Thank you, Ben. This is Omid. So the way we look at it is that users are 
really accessing Internet on large screens with high broadband speeds, and 
we're getting great monetization on these screens and advertisers are really 
paying 
attention. So we have seen a real shift where marketers and 
agencies who have historically built their brands on TV are really reorienting 
this toward investments on digital.
 
And as in regards to YouTube, our focus here is really this focus on 
investments 
and more content, more creativity. And I think you also 
mentioned that you had a Facebook comment. What they are doing I think 
in video has always helped us with bringing more attention and more 
innovation to the space, so we welcome that. And the way we'r
e going to 
approach it is just continue to investing in our platform and on the creators 
and building better and better monetization solutions.
 
Just again, you may know some of these metrics, but I'll say it again that we 
have 400 hours of content that are
 
uploaded every minute and partner 
revenue is up 60% from 2012 to 2013 on YouTube.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. Let me jump, Ben, on the 
--
 
your two specific questions. [Audio Gap] 
tax issues, you've heard about the Ireland announcement earlier this week 
on the
 
double Irish tax structure. I mean, for us, we've always said that it's 
for politicians to decide what laws they want to put and then for companies 
just to comply with those laws. And that's what we're basically doing. So 
we're deeply committed to Ireland
. We've worked there for many years. We 
have a great 
--
 
that's our headquarters. We have over 2,500 employees 
there. And so from that perspective we're committed to the place. And we're 
going to work with the authorities just to kind of get clarifications 
over this. 
But it's really way too early to tell what's going to happen. So we're, just like 
you, getting the information, the news, and we're going to work with the 
authorities to understand it better and then comply with the laws.
 
In terms of stock
-
based
 
compensation, just a few notes on this one for this 
quarter. We have 
--
 
it's the time of year where we do equity refresh. And 
from a timing perspective last year, we did the equity refresh in Q2 instead 
of Q3. So there's kind of like a geography of Q2 ver
sus Q3 that kind of hit us 
in Q3. In addition to this, if you go to our filings, you'll see that our 
executive compensation 
--
 
so think of the top 15 or top 20, I can't 
remember the exact numbers, but it's stated there 

 
that they do their 
refreshes every 
two years and it happens to be this quarter as well. And 
then finally, I mean, we obviously have more employees. So it's just a 
compounding set of factors, Ben, that I kind of lumped it all into Q3. So it's 
no more, no less than that on that 
--
 
on that one
.
 
Ben Schachter

Macquarie
 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks for your question. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
 
Anthony DiClemente 
-
 
Nomura
 
Thanks a lot. Just on core operating e
xpenses, is there anything [Audio Gap] 
Patrick that you might call out in terms of expense growth in the quarter as 
you have operating deleverage through the P&L? Just wondering, going 
forward, if that's likely to continue.
 
And then a question for Omid I s
uppose on YouTube. You mentioned 
--
 
I 
know that YouTube's investing in its studio as a way to help along new 
talent, new homegrown talent onto the platform directly. I'm wondering if 
you can talk about the multichannel networks, how YouTube's relationships
 
with the multichannel networks, the MCNs, are evolving at a high level? How 
you guys think about that dynamic between the homegrown YouTube talent 
itself as compared to talent that resides on the MCNs? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay. Anthony, thank you for
 
your question. Why don't I jump in right now 
on just expenses for the quarter? I think if I had two comments to make on 
expenses in the quarter, you may notice that relative to a few models that I 
saw out there, R&D was higher and other areas are a bit lo
wer. And I just 
want to highlight that we hire and we focus clearly our hiring in our tech 
payroll, or think of it as all of our engineering. And that skews to R&D. So as 
we bring on people and we push forward the growth of our 
--
 
we really focus 
it in the
 
areas that are going to make a fundamental difference to Google, 
which is engineering, and by doing so, it kind of skews to R&D. So that's 
why R&D may be a bit higher than expected by some models out there. And 
so that's one piece.
 
And then the other one 
is just wanted to reiterate that it's very clearly an 
extraordinary quarter from a hiring perspective for the comments I've made 
before. And so we're kind of clearly seeing that. But at the same time I 
wouldn't say that this is clearly a new run rate for u
s or anything like that. It 
just happened that most of these college students end up landing in Q3 and 
we have the result of a banner year from a hiring perspective all through. It 
takes a year to hire them all and then they come into this quarter. So that
's 
really kind of the two big elements that have actually flowed, Anthony, 
through our P&L this quarter.
 
I'll let Omid answer the YouTube question.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Yes. Anthony, so, again, we have a very, very partnership minded 
organization here and compa
ny as a whole. So we view MCNs as 
--
 
or 
organizations that are really going to help develop a great content, support 
the creators on YouTube. Just like we are doing that with YouTube Studios, I 
think MCNs can help a lot of these become future stars hopeful
ly and 
develop more success. So just we view it as another form of partnership that 
we need to pay attention to and support. So that's how we look at it.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Anthony. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll 
go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Thank you. I have two questions. Patrick, is CapEx still driven by real estate 
and construction? And if yes, can you explain in a bit more detail what 
changed about 18 mon
ths ago in the way you acquired real estate and build 
to drive the inflection in capital intensity that we have seen? It looks like you 
operated for more than 10 years in one way and then there was a shift that 
has led to this massive inflection. So what h
appened there?
 
Secondly, do you think that Google login is adopted or inspired to being 
adopted by a large enough number of important mobile apps for you to be 
competitive in the long term when it comes to offering mobile [Audio Gap] 
and can you give us an
 
update on the developer adoption of deep linking? 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So I can certainly take the first and let Omid answer the second. I've made 
that comment before in a prior quarter, Carlos. The CapEx intensity and our 
CapEx program has been built by a combination of, as I mentioned in 
previous quarter, catching up when w
e were running too hot in terms of 
tightening of capacity. And so 
--
 
and once I'm very happy that when we 
really torque our utilization rates, on the other side it creates a lot of 
operational issues. And that led us to believe that in fact investing ahead
 
of 
the curve was actually a strategic imperative for us to make sure that if we 
have the extra capacity, we will grow into it.
 
And I think the difference between 
--
 
certainly on the data center side, data 
center construction and machines, and you'll have 
noticed that this quarter 
again, there are priorities. If you look at the nomenclature I gave, 
construction of data center is the primary. So it is the core infrastructure, it's 
groundbreaking and it is setting up the core infrastructures. Machine was the 
second one for this quarter, but you'll notice that it flip flops real estate. In 
the case of the real estate, we have been investing for our campus and 
otherwise when we see 
--
 
when we hit kind of minimum scale, we need to 
kind of make investments in real
 
estate. And again with an eye of looking for 
the long term, rather than just filling at least for the next 12 months or 24 
months, because once you kind of 
--
 
if you decide you're going to grow in a 
place, then you need the capacity for multi
-
years. So al
l of these factors 
have actually kind of been the driver for the shift in capital intensity that 
you've seen over the last 18 months. So that's basically the explanation, 
Carlos.
 
I'll let Omid kind of jump on the second question about the mobile question.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Sure. Thanks, Carlos. So the AdMob network reaches 900 million unique 
devices per month and our own apps are hugely popular, Gmail, Maps, 
Google App and YouTube. And our focus is also 
--
 
is helping developers 
generate app downloads and re
-
e
ngagement with users who have already 
downloaded their apps, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier. And we're 
really helping drive hundreds of millions of app downloads through app 
promotion products.
 
Again, the goal here is that you just search and not wor
ry about where the 
answer is either on a webpage or on an app. And we've been in this game 
for a while. Four years ago, we acquired AdMob and have continued to invest 
in this space heavily. And this quarter, we launched the next generation of 
these promoti
on ads across Google search, Google Display Network, and 
YouTube. So we're really focused on this area to help the developers and our 
users.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I think we can clearly say that we're pretty pleased with the developer 
adoption of this. They see
 
a huge benefit, so they're actually investing in it.
 
Thank you, Carlos.
 
Carlos Kirjner 
-
 
Sanford Bernstein
 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
 
Douglas 
Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Thanks for taking the question. Just two for Omid. First, you talked about 
estimated conversions and seeing a 15% increase there. Can you just talk 
about whether you think that's actually leading to more spend at this point 
from advertise
rs? And then, secondly, are you seeing mobile like
-
for
-
like 
pricing improvements at this point? And what gives you the confidence in 
mobile closing the gap with desktop over time?
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thanks, Douglas. Both are really good questions that are rel
ated really. I 
think the way this is going to play out is that I think advertisers are going to, 
with these tools, be able to just understand conversions better 
--
 
where is it 
happening? And then the dynamics of how those changes is all the way back 
to adj
usting bids and then paying attention to where the conversions are 
coming from.
 
So, again, I think just to maybe highlight some examples for you, we have a 
fashion retailer Express who's an early tester, found that the overall return 
on their ad spend doub
led when offline sales were included in their online 
advertising results. So we're just continuing to invest here and get this right. 
It's too early to figure out the impact exactly on revenue, but we expect the 
estimated total conversions to help the adve
rtisers fully measure this and 
ultimately adjust their bidding and just get much more sophisticated in these 
measurements. I hope that answers.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And mobile on a like
-
for
-
like basis?
 
Omid Kordestani
 
The way we're focusing this is th
at users really are using their screens 
interchangeably simultaneously throughout the day and that we really are 
not at this point doing this like
-
by
-
like comparisons or comment on it 
because we think it's still early and we're really focused on just again
 
delivering the results. And it took many years, for example, for the desktop 
ecosystem to develop the right ad formats and really take advantage of the 
platform. So I think we just need to continue innovating here, experimenting 
here to get it right.
 
Doug
las Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, Douglas. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark May 
-
 
Citi
 
Thanks for taking my question. One on 
--
 
there's been quite a bit of 
attention paid to cloud services space and Google in particular. Wondering if 
you can comment a little bit around the traction that you're getting with the 
Compute Engine? And what sort of impact that that's having on revenue or 
expenses and CapEx for the 
business?
 
And then secondly, I think earlier you made a comment around some 
changes you've made in mobile that have impacted some of your network 
click metrics, so hoping you could elaborate a bit more on that.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay. Do you want me to...
 
O
mid Kordestani
 
Go ahead.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I'll just jump on the cloud and then the last piece and then maybe 
--
 
I 
wasn't sure what the very first part of your question, Mark, was. But clearly, 
cloud is an area that is kind of booming, right? We know that t
he long
-
term 
trends are very clear for us, which is the vast majority of businesses. 
Everybody is moving their infrastructures to the cloud. So 
--
 
and it is an area 
where we have fundamentally great assets to contribute to this industry, 
both in terms of t
he flexibility, the cost structure, the technology, and that's 
why we're investing heavily in there. We're seeing great progress from an 
adoption perspective, signing up new customers.
 
And from a CapEx, obviously you need to kind of 
--
 
that's one of them t
hat 
as I mentioned on the CapEx story with Carlos a few minutes ago, if you do 
take off and you really get the kind of customer adoption that you expect, if 
you don't have the capacity in place, it can have a really important kind of 
differential in your s
uccess. So there is one that we're keeping a pretty close 
eye on from a CapEx perspective in making sure that we have the option 
value.
 
The third question was mobile that have network clicks. So, yeah, I mean, 
clicks and CPCs always fluctuate from quarter
-
to
-
quarter. It just happens 
that we've made some 
--
 
as I mentioned, made some changes this quarter 
that improved our mobile pricing while impacting low quality clicks. So 
sometimes, it goes 
--
 
if you think of a long
-
term trend in the mobile sector 
piece of
 
our product, sometimes you kind of put a new change in the 
network and it creates a lot of clicks for it, but then the CPCs are much 
lower. And then if it doesn't actually create something that's really good for 
the user, you need to kind of pull back on 
it, and that's what you've heard, 
for example, just parallel to the AFS business. So it's kind of constantly 
fluctuating.
 
What's really important us is really the combined volume and pricing growth. 
And so for us, it's very clear that we're doing some grea
t work in this area 
and monetization in aggregate is doing very well. And that's really what 
we're 
--
 
like on a quarter
-
to
-
quarter basis, don't panic about little 
movements here and there. Look at the fundamental trends, and that's 
where we're very pleased
.
 
Now, did you have a first 
--
 
was there a first question that I missed, Mark?
 
Mark May 
-
 
Citi
 
No. I was hoping on cloud that maybe you could put some numbers behind 
the level of traction in terms of number of customers impact on expenses, 
CapEx, the level
 
of investment in the cloud.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I see. Okay. So I've given you what I can give you on that. Again, we're 
really thrilled by the momentum there and our focus in that area.

Thanks for taking the question. One for Omid. Going back to estimated total 
conversions, wondering if we could exp
ect Adometry to be integrated into 
the DoubleClick platform and how that may or may not work with the 
estimated total conversions tool? And then, finally, I'm wondering [Audio 
Gap] on your work around coming up with a solution that reduces the 
dependence u
pon cookies and perhaps introduces a cross
-
platform, a cross
-
device ID for Google and what impact that could have in the market? Thank 
you.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Sure. I think 
--
 
again, it's early for us to call Adometry. It's a great 
attribution 
solution and we've been investing in that tool for a long time now 
and trying to just get this right by all the innovation that's happening within 
Google and just really understanding the impact of these usage models and 
--
 
between the mobile devices and d
esktop.
 
And so I think we're going to look at everything that's available out there, 
both what we're developing and partners out there that we could partner 
with, and continue to invest here. It's going to take us a while, just like we 
experienced before w
ith search, to get this right and have a real end
-
to
-
end 
solution for marketers and publishers. And so I think you will see a lot of 
innovation in this space. What Facebook recently announced is another 
approach. And we're going to study that and just figu
re out what is the right 
set of offerings from us.
 
So I guess, unfortunately, I can't give you a very specific answer here. But I 
think what you'll see from us is pay a huge amount of attention here, make 
the measurements and see the impact and then offer 
a full suite to our 
customers.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yeah. So just basically, too early to speculate on these issues, but clearly it's 
an area of focus at the company. Thank you, Peter. Jamie, our next 
question, please?
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Heather Bel
lini with Goldman Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs
 
Great. Thank you. I had two questions. The first was a follow
-
up on Google 
Shopping Express. I mean, just wondering, when you think about what 
Amazon is doing with same
-
day delivery, they're obviousl
y building these 
fulfillment centers themselves, which theoretically should give them scale 
over time. I'm wondering if you could share with us how you see this 
evolving for Google over time?
 
And then a follow
-
up question would just be related to your comm
ents about 
payments. And I'm just wondering, how critical is it for Google itself to 
[Audio Gap] friction that you're seeing with kind of a ubiquitous digital 
wallet? Or would you be fine with a third
-
party doing so for the Android 
platform?
 
Patrick Pichet
te
 
Thank you, Heather. I'll take the first and then let Omid answer the second. 
Clearly, Google Shopping Express, there is an issue of scale and it's a 
combination of an issue of scale, tools and efficiency. I mean, that's how 
you, if you think over time, 
can end up with a product that you can deliver 
within kind of hours at the right value and where you can make money.
 
So it's not only about 
--
 
yes, for efficiencies you need centralization. You 
need a bunch of distribution tools that actually work. We're c
learly focused 
on that as well. I mean it is part of the business case that we're building. But 
you need more than that. There's a lot of other elements as well. So clearly 
focused like our competitors would be. And our announcements today, again 
kind of o
ur 
--
 
was it yesterday 
--
 
yesterday's announcements on Shopping 
Express kind of tell you that we are investing both for 
--
 
the three new cities 
kind of give you a hint of, yes, it's about scale. So clearly we're focused on 
that.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Yeah. And H
eather, on the wallet question, I think we're going to continue to 
be open here. So we are trying to get it right and innovating on multiple 
fronts, as I mentioned earlier. And if partnering makes sense, we'll take a 
look at it, as well.
 
So 
--
 
and the goal
 
is here really to provide this very seamless experience for 
the users and then get the merchant adoption and hopefully get this right. 
I'm certainly delighted every time I use this and it works. And I think if we 
can all get the ecosystem right and there 
are multiple players in it and 
partnerships that are making it happen, we're definitely open to that.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Heather. Let's go to our next question.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Paul Vogel with Barclays.
 
Paul Vogel 
-
 
Barclays
 
Yeah. Gr
eat. Thank you very much. As Google Play has grown, I'm just 
wondering if you could talk about the relationships with the carriers and how 
that's evolving over time.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yeah, I can answer that. So, essentially, Google Play is doing great and 
everybody wants to kind of be part of this answer. And so, for our carriers, 
[Audio Gap] basis. So the real question is, what's the win
-
win? And so 
they're all done individually. We have great partnerships with many carriers 
that actually fuel this, and we
're including carrier billing. So all this actually 
is just a very, very positive ecosystem for us. And so we're totally thrilled to 
have these partnerships and we expect to continue to do so.
 
Paul Vogel

Barclays
 
Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, 
Paul. Jamie, one more question.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our final question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
 
Brian Pitz

Jefferies
 
Great. Thanks for the questions. Two for video 
--
 
on video for Omid. You 
mentioned Google Preferred in your comments. Any colo
r on further 
expanding the upfront process with the ad agencies? Basically, do you 
anticipate that upwards of 5% to 10% of your top inventory could actually 
be set aside for preferred longer
-
term?
 
And then just given the shift of offline TV dollars to onli
ne, as you've 
mentioned, any comments on political specifically or other new categories 
more aggressively moving on to YouTube? Thanks so much.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Sure. Thank you, Brian. So we secured upfront commitments from five top 
agencies: IPG, OMD, Digi
tas, Carat, SMG, and some major brands like 
General Motors and Coca
-
Cola and we were actually very, very pleased with 
how Google Preferred was experienced and adopted. And so I think we're 
going to definitely continue working on this. And also if you look 
at our 
history, we're very used to the selling model that was all about performance. 
And then as we added properties like YouTube and Brand and Mobile, we're 
just getting more and more now gaining a better understanding of how to 
work in this upfront proce
ss, for example, to offer the marketers this 
incredible asset that we have in YouTube and our network. So we're going to 
just continue getting better at 
--
 
on the products side, figure out how to 
package this inventory better, and then the tools that are n
eeded, and then 
on the selling side, just get better at also working with the agencies and our 
advertisers and marketers to get this type of selling right.
 
And on the political vertical, I think clients love to use our products as part 
of their campaigns f
or federal, local, state campaigns and it is a really great 
area for us. We have actually a political sales team that's focused on it. So I 
think you'll see more of that effort from us.

Omid, thanks.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Thank you very mu
ch.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, Brian. Jamie, that's all the time we have. So if you don't mind, I'd 
just like to close by reiterating what Omid said a bit earlier. This quarter was 
a great quarter with great momentum again. And I just wanted to thank all 
the
 
great efforts of our Googlers around the world who make us look good 
on this call because of their fantastic effort.
 
So with that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call, and have a happy Q4 
everyone.

Now, let me quickly cover
 
the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking including statements 
regarding Google's future investments, our long term growth and innovation, 
the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level
 
of 
capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
 
Please note these forward

and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock
-
based 
compensation and restructu
ring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided 
by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as 
free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP to GAAP 
measures can be found in our earnings press release.
 
With t
hat, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second 
quarter 2014 earnings call. So I will dive right into the numbers. Nikesh is 
going to give you a business update and
 
then we will open
-
up for Q&A. So 

 
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 22% year
-
over
-
year to 
$16 billion and was up 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Without currency 
fluctuations, our 
gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have 
been 21% year
-
over
-
year, still very healthy.
 
Our Google site revenue was up 23% year
-
over
-
year to $10.9 billion and 
was up 4% quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by strength in our core search 
advertising 
business.
 
Our Network revenue was up 7% year
-
over
-
year at $3.4 billion and was up 
1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by year
-
over
-
year growth in our AdMob and 
Ad Exchange businesses.
 
Finally, Google other revenue grew 53% year
-
over
-
year to $1.6 billion and 
was
 
up 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our 
Play Store drove the year
-
over
-
year growth.
 
Our global aggregate paid click was strong this quarter, up 25% year
-
over
-
year and 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Aggregate CPC were down 6% year
-
ov
er
-
year, but flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
And without currency fluctuation, aggregate cost per click would have been 
down 7% year
-
over
-
year. So currency had a very minimal 
--
 
and currency 
had no impact on quarter
-
over
-
quarter CPC growth.
 
As we indicated in o

cost per click changes by property type in addition to aggregate numbers. 
So to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 33% year
-
over
-
year and up 
6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our Google site CPC we
re down 7% year
-
over
-
year and down 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
On the Network side, network paid clicks were up 9% year
-
over
-
year and 
down 5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And our network CPCs were down 13% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Our monetizat
ion metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors at 
an aggregate level, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix, as 

disclosing additional property metrics related to o
ur monetization, it maybe 

with sites.
 
Sites monetization metrics includes ads that were served on Google owned 
and operated properties across different geographies and form facto
rs. So 
these properties include YouTube search obviously 
--
 
YouTube engagement 
ads like TrueView, and then other owned and operated properties such like 
Maps or Finance and otherwise.
 
Our Network monetization metrics include ads served on non
-
Google 
proper
ties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, and 
AdMob businesses. We also provide corresponding historical data since Q1 of 
2013 for reference, which can be found on 
--
 
in our earnings slides.
 

spond as usual to your question 

may have detailed questions about monetization trends from prior quarters. 
And to help you with that, the IR team will be ready to answer your 
questio
ns after the call.
 
Turning to geographic performance, we saw solid performance in the U.S. 
and U.K and continued strong performance in rest of the world. In our 
earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations' website, you'll 
see that we've b
roken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world, to 
show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please 
do refer to these slides for the exact calculations.
 
The U.S. revenue was up 12% year
-
over
-
year to $6.6 billion. The U.K. w
as 
up 22% to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 15% year
-
over
-

 

skews toward the U.S and the U.K. And our ongoi
ng user focused product 
and policy changes have continued to have a clear impact on our revenue 
growth in these two geographies.
 
Our non
-
U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 31% year
-
over
-
year to 
$7.7 billion, and this accounted for 48% of our total 
revenue, which includes 
a $6 million benefit from our hedging program. So in FX term, the rest of the 
world grew also 31% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 
23% of total advertising revenue this quar
ter. Our non
-
GAAP other cost of 
revenue was $2.7 billion in Q2. This is excluding stock
-
based compensation.
 
Our non
-
GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, again excluding SBC 
and as a result, our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $5.1 billion and our no
n
-
GAAP operating margin stood at 32% in Q2.
 
Headcount was up, roughly 2,200 people in Q2 in the last 90 days. And in 
total, we ended the quarter with approximately 52,000 full
-
time employees, 
but please note that the headcount does include approximately 3,
500 full
-
time employees from the Motorola business.
 
Our effective tax rate was 21% in Q2. Our tax rate this quarter was 
impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and 
international subsidiaries.
 
Let me now turn to cash management.
 
Our OI&E, our other income and 
expense was $145 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains 
on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging 
program. And for more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that 
ac
company this call on our IR Web site.
 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.6 billion. 
And CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion. This quarter, the majority of the 
CapEx spend was related to data center construction, real estat
e purchases 
and finally production equipment in that order. Investor should see our 
investment in CapEx as a positive signal, since it reflects our sustained 

 

g
-
term and 
our infrastructure and real estate assets remain a key strategic area of 
investment for us. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3 billion.
 
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team 
continues to be hard at work a
nd we look forward to seeing them join with 
the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q2 with the Moto E and Moto G, 
both showing strong sales momentum especially in emerging markets.
 
So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us t
he 
confidence to continue to fund strategic growth opportunities in many areas 
including our CapEx area that we talked about earlier.
 
And now I'll let Nikesh cover some more details on our business performance 
in the quarter and after his remarks, I will t
ake it back to open
-
up the phone 
lines for questions. Here you go Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 

our focus in creating great multi skin experience is paying off. I hope you 
saw our annual IO Dev
eloper Conference a few weeks ago. We were joined 
by over 6,000 developers in San Francisco along with approximately 1.9 
million people globally tuning in online.
 

expanding android platfo
rm to cars, watches, TVs, as well as making it easy 
to search Google from anywhere by simply saying okay Google. Making 
magical products that people love using everyday is what drives our 
ambition, fuels our business.
 
Last quarter we saw strong growth with
 
$16 billion in gross revenue. We saw 
particular strength in the travel and retail verticals as well as in several 
countries like Japan and India.
 
By now you know the four areas driving our business. One, performance or 
direct response marketing; two helpi
ng clients build their brands; third our 
ad tech platforms for agencies and publishers; and four, our emerging 
businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware.
 

investme

performance advertising, in the long
-

where people jump seamlessly across screens of all sizes on all types of 
surfaces.
 

hone opportunity is absolutely key 


showcasing a businesses location or click to call, etcetera.
 
The teams are laser focu
sed on making ad campaigns easier across screens 
and helping businesses measure their effectiveness across devices as well as 
offline. We already offer great solutions for marketeers wanting to promote 
app installs, in April at our AdWords performance foru
m, we supercharged 
our offerings for app developers across search, display and as well as 
YouTube.
 
We launched improvements like app deep linking and search to help 
developers re
-
engage users, who have already downloaded their app, better 
targeting options
 
in AdMob to help them recent most likely customers, even 
a new app install format on YouTube and more powerful measurement tools, 
so they know exactly how their app is performing at every stage.
 
Mobile hotel booking app Hotel Tonight uses mobile search ad
s as a the key 
part of their global marketing efforts because it drives consistently high 
value users or more likely to purchase quickly in the apps. In fact, 
international mobile search campaigns drive three times higher conversion 
rates compared to other
 
direct response channels.
 

segments, product listing ads across screen. In fact this past quarter, we 
sent over three times as much traffic to merchants on smartphones and 
tablet devices comp
ared to Q2 of last year.
 
Let me go to the second area of brand building. I recently spend some times 
at Cannes Lions Festival. I know it was working Canne, where Google had a 
big presence, hosting over 300 meetings with creative agencies and brands. 
What w
as actually interesting this year was how much the conversation with 
brands has changed from years past. Whereas digital used to be just one 

campaign.
 
We see this from our clien
ts as well and video seems to be the linchpin of 
the strategy. YouTube continues to be driven by the insanely popular 
channels from some of our top content creators like breakout hip 
--
 
hit Epic 
Rap Battles of History and new sensation Vice News.
 
We launch
ed our Google Preferred Video offering at BrandCast in April, 

phenomenal amount of support from agencies and brands so far.
 
Digitas was our first agency to sign on and since then Omnicom M
edia Group 
has also pledged their support. Brands including General Motors, Coca Cola, 
and Universal Pictures are also having tremendous amounts of success as 
Google preferred. Adidas was one of the major brands to leverage our global 
platform to reach fan
s during the World Cup. They engaged soccer fans by 
live streaming events with athletes, promoted them on YouTube through 
TrueView ads, as well as using beautiful light box ads across our display 
network.
 
Now a few words about our ad technologies for agenc
ies and publishers. 
Again, video is at the forefront of our efforts here. Last month we introduced 
a premium programmatic video marketplace called Google Partner Select to 
help publishers monetize their video content and to help agencies reach top 
quality 
video content across the Web.
 

great. We continue to see strong growth across premium inventory, 
particularly with the growth of private exchanges across AdMob and AdSense 
publishers are i
ncreasing their investments in mobile sites and apps and 
growing their businesses using our platforms.
 
Before I move on to our emerging businesses, I want to talk about an area 
we continue to invest in, online tools for small businesses. Small 
businesses 


have a Web site. To help set them up for online success; last month we 
introduced Google My B
usiness, which helps small businesses manage their 
online presence across search, maps and Google+.
 
We also have a vibrant ecosystem of partners who have local businesses 

support for sm

our advertiser customer satisfaction scores which bodes really well.
 
Now, let me talk about emerging new businesses, digital content, enterprise 
and hardware. Google Play continues to grow at 
breakneck speed across all 
types of digital content, helping developers and content partners reach users 
around the world. For instance, Play Movies is now available in over 90 
countries, with its recent additions in Argentina, Poland and the Czech 
Republi
c.
 
We also recently signed deals with CBS TV and Viacom to bring their TV 
content to Google Play. With over a 1 billion active android users to going 
success of Google Play, means that more developers are building successful 
global businesses in our platfo
rm. As we mentioned at IO, since last June, 
we paid out more than $5 billion to developers through Play which clearly 

 
Shifting gears to our enterprise business, I can report that over 60% of the 
Fortune 500 use
 
our paid products. This quarter we added even more like 
Rockwell Collins. They signed up 20, 00 employees to use Google apps.
 
We also launched Google Drive for work, a premium service of businesses 
that includes unlimited storage. The reception so far has
 
been great and we 
even closed our first sale within minutes of the announcement. Our cloud 
platform business also has momentum with new features announced at IO.
 
On the hardware side, over 1 million Chromebooks were sold into schools. 
Clearly a record qua
rter and the popularity of Chromecast continues to grow. 
Now available in Australia, Korea, Portugal and many more. I got to watch 
some World Cup games from the ESPN app using my Chromecast.
 
Before I close, I want to mention our marketing team, in addition
 
to a great 
IO this year, we also launched the Made with Code initiatives with partners 
like Girl Scouts with the USA and Girls to Code, to inspire the next 
generation of women coders. We are really excited about the enthusiasm 
around this initiative and w
ho knows hopefully some of this chorus will join 
us at Google.
 

helped make this a fantastic quarter. On a personal note, as you might have 

like to thank Larry and Sergey 

everyone at Google for the amazing experiences and the phenomenal 10 

cheering them f
rom the sidelines.

Thank you. Two quick questions. The recovery in the growth rate in the U.K., 
could you provide more color around that o
r was it just you had hard comps 
last quarter, but the growth rate really consistent with what you had seen 
before. And then there was been some recent reporting about YouTube 
revenues. Could you just clarify even if its just historical data, the size of

initiatives etcetera. Thank you.

we had talked about the U.K. having had a tough comp t

talked in the past PLAs is actually a fundamental sort of existential need of 
our product. So research business, because as people go to tablets, as 
people go to mobile devices, t

answers when they search and the ability for them to go directly to the

with every retail out there, try and get as many products listed. And our 
product listing service, so when you actually search you get a plethora of 

how many products are a

good evolution from a search perspective, which clearly translates into 
people clicking on those and thereafter hopefully driving more commerce 
towards our partners and retail segment. As I said, we d

for us and our teams are really, really exc

you have a business case, you have a thesis 
and that thesis is basically tested on a regular basis through the gating of

nature were it will take

we think of kind of half decade, sometimes even a 
bit longer before we know that

you can get kind of real momentum on 
revenue and profitability. Others 

think about it. What matters most is really that we actually set up that 
gating and that we have these refinements to the business models and you 
know Google Shopping Express another great example of that where yo
u 
just kind of have the gating and then they come back for funding every so 


specifics of anyone of those, 

just given you. You can come through what is really an asset in terms of 
versus a software kind of intensive kind of play and then it gives you a 
guidance of how fast and how slow we should expect our returns
 
to be.

mentioned in my prepared remarks that we continue to have ongoing user 
focused product change
s and they continue to impact our AFS business is an 
example. So AFS, right and then what you end up with is you all remember 
that AFS or AdWords for search 
--
 
essence for search, it really skews to the 

see the disproportion 
into those results. So on the DLA obviously, they will lapse over the course 
of this year and 
--
 
but the additional kind of continued product changes and 
user focused product changes and policy changes will continue to kind of 
hammer 
them to make sure that we get the perfect balance between what is 


pleased with our growth rate in th

let Nikesh give you a bit of comment on that?

I think its important to step back and look at what the Google Play team has 
achieved. I mean its 
--
 

wh
ich provides services, apps, content around the world as we mentioned 
over 90 countries of Google Play movies. And as Patrick would say, $5 billion 
developer which is 5,000 million, so lot of money. And its actually really 
great for innovation. Its phenome
nal for the app developer ecosystem and 

find tremendous (indiscernible) and all the apps and all the services they get 

the Google Play 
opportunity. I think in terms of margin, you should be able to look at the 
market and understand how typically these relationships work and should we 
know different than what the current market is around the margin 
opportunity for services 
in the long

term.

Thanks guys. I have two questions, product related. So at IO you announced 
some new innovation in search and discovery for apps, including opening up 
app indexing globally. So what kind of timeline do you think Google is on 
before we start to see a lot of 
app content appearing in core search results 
more regularly and what kind of revenue opportunity do you see around 
that? And then the second question somewhat related is you also announced 
a bunch of new screen for android, watches, TVs etcetera. I know it
s still 
very early days, but do you envision the long
-
term business model for these 
being similar to the existing model with ads in Google Play or do you see 
potentially feeling close loop transactions as an example? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Ross, thank yo

then about the screen stuff. I mean, if you think about it, Google has been in 
the business of making sure that we drive traffic on behalf of people and 
advertise and help people find things.
 
And as you look at mobile phone 
behavior, people spend a lot of time on apps as well as in the browser 

provide the content that users are looking for. So, you should expect us to 
most aggressively try and make sure that App Indexing all happens and its 
available and easily accessible across devices and people are looking for 

cases that happens to be the app. So
 
allowing for people to discover apps as 
well as creating more engagement for apps that people may not have been 
engaging with for a while. So, I think clearly an area of focus and clearly you 
should see 
--
 
expect us to see activity in that space. And in t
erms of revenue 
its not unlike any revenue we cerate in the search where we help people find 
things and that allows us to create an advertising opportunity where people 
are 
--
 

terms of you
r second question, I think you have to take a longer term point 
of view towards the screen question. As you can see all the screens are sort 
of almost designed as island where every screen has its own operating 

e noticing more and more 
people want to switch from screens and retain the service experience. And 
towards that end, the android team is doing a phenomenal job making sure 
that we provide that seamlessness across screens and the fungibility of 
services acr
oss those screens. So, I think long
-
term we have to think about 

from one screen to the other and making that happen seamlessly. And if 
that works out I think there is will phen
omenal business opportunities for us 

figure out the monetization when we have a lot of users excited about it.

Carlos Kirjner

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
 
Thank you. Two questions if I may. One on revenue, is there a significant 
positive net impact of growing penetration in usage of s
martphones on 
search place and revenue? And what happens to search revenue growth if 
there is no more benefit in developed markets as smartphone penetration 
approaches a 100%? Second, you added more than 2,400 employees to 
Google in the quarter versus 1,40
0 in the second quarter last year; I think 

Patrick, it is the new normal in terms of the rate in which you grow 
headcounts for the core. How do you think about the rate of headcou
nt 

 
Patrick Pichette
 

one. On the issue of headcount, look we have this amazing opportunity and 
machine to 
actually look around the world to look for the best engineers. 

do find people that fit the culture and that we think will actually do a great 
contribution and be great Googlers, we
 

them. Because if we hire them a bit too early or a bit too late it might 

look at the last couple of quarters I mean the trend has been pretty 
kind of 
solid. And in addition to that you have to look at the impact also of our 



d up with X amount for this quarter and then that 
once we hit our quarter we see everybody else next quarter. So from that 

--
 
the vast 
majority of our hiring to kind of give comfort to our investors
 
is, it is really 
still in the engineering field and the product management field which is really 
where we want to focus our attention, and we continue to focus there. So, 

Nikesh can ta
lk about revenue and smartphone penetration.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes, of course (indiscernible) the answer is, yes. As we see more and more 
users with penetration of smartphones, people spend more time looking for 

a very, very long sort of 


websites take mobile very, very seriously. They want to be present on 
mobile. I think t
he revenue opportunity is phenomenally high, because right 
now mobile does not monetize as well as certain other forms. But given the 

more relevant to be able to find information in 
the long
-
term, mobile should 
be monetizing even better than desktops. So, I think as a tremendous 

smartphone penetration in developed markets for a while.

Thanks very much. Patrick, can you give us an update on your internet 
access initiatives particularly Goo
gle Fiber. Maybe update us on the evolution 
of the economics of that business and then perhaps even the timing of the 
Google Fiber rollout for more recently announced cities? And then a separate 
question on the Google Compute Engine business. How big of a 
growth 
driver can GCE be? And what do you guys see as the competitive advantage 
that Google has and what seems to be an increasingly competitive space in 
terms of the Cloud? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 



important to bear in mind the following. First is, the economics of a fiber 
network today are clearly much cheaper than they were say a decade ago. 
There have been
 
a lot of improvements in cost reductions and technology 
components all through the fiber network, but also in the way we build it. 
The second one is, I just want to remind everyone that, an important part of 
our strategy is actually to build the demand. S
o, unlike the typical over 
builder, actually we have a very different kind of business model and thesis 
for that. And we do work closely with each city to streamline the process 
that keeps again the cost of construction way down. So, as an update to you 
ri
ght now, Anthony we have as you know we are working with 34 cities, 
separate cities with a kind of completed checklist of items to help us prepare 

basically, they are in the last 
rows of finishing these checklists and its 

through all of the details with them, whether it would be write away or 

decis
ions as to how broad a program will have. We expect that to kind of 
give an update between now and the end of the year as the information 

be kind of a great piece of focus for us
. And just stay tuned for more, the 
next update on it. As per the GCE, do you want to take it Nikesh or?
 
Nikesh Arora
 

the past, that we believe there is a lot of 
businesses out there have still to 
shift to the Cloud. We think in the long
-
term every business will be most 


ed 
about is making sure we have an amazing offering for businesses so they 
find value in working with us and making sure that we can support them in 
their transition to the Cloud. We think we have a great set of products. Our 

beginning to ramp up. So, I think there is 

pie for a long time because a lot of businesses are clambering to move their 

y are, because 

businesses that we work in actually got to the bleeding edge of technology 
as much as the consumer services are.

Thanks for taking my questions. A follow
-
up on the network business. I think 
some of the 

too for a while, part of the intended consequence result I would imagine 
would be to recognize higher overall CPCs or pricing every time, but that 

I wonder if you could shed a 

of kind of what your expectations are going forward, is that in fact one of the 
intended consequences that we should be expecting going forward? And 
the



been seeing or making any progress
 
in closing the gap there maybe in 
markets like APAC and what exactly are you doing to try to improve pricing 
outside the domestic and more stylish markets?
 
Patrick Pichette
 

spe

--
 
one of 
the key things about CPC is clearly it gives you a trend, but the trend is 

at one in isolation of the othe

case of network for example, I mean we just discussed at the beginning of 

months to actually work on quality issues. And that clearly h
as an impact 
when you push on quality to 
--
 
when you look at the mix to actually drive for 
the kind of revenues and growth rates that you see in our results on the 

factors that w
e see whether it be as you said geography or product mix or 
otherwise. So, all in all I think that the team is doing a good job, both on 
network and on sites, and you can see that as well on our detailed 
information about, of sites where we continue to see
 
the kind of 
--
 
or 
certainly over the last few quarters kind of creeping back up of CPCs which 
actually continue to push for this quality issue. In terms of geography, I 
think that yes, geography makes a big difference and that CPCs are much in 
some cases 
lower in international markets or emerging market. But the 

take CPCs as just one general. We will focus on each country, look for 
initiatives on localizations for each country to
 
get the maximum CPCs on a 
geographic basis country
-
by
-





-
bye
-
side to 
continue to push on these areas. So, we see a lot of runway in this one, and 
geography is just one of these areas. And you mentioned like APAC, but 
APAC was a combination of more
 
mature markets like Australia and Japan, 
and then we had the real emerging markets in there as well like Indonesia or 
India. So, even APAC itself is again localization matters immensely because 
very different answers for different countries. But all in al
l a pretty good 

user first and then make sure that we have the right monetization. So,

Douglas Anmuth

Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two things. First 
thing to the added disclosure just on volume and CPCs. If we look at the 
sites data on pricing, it looks lik

two quarters, and then now more flattish here sequentially in 2Q. Can we 

pricing impact from mobile? And can you give us some color on wha

seeing in terms of like
-
for
-
like mobile pricing as this point? And then 
secondly just on CapEx, Patrick, can you just help us understand how your 
philosophy may be has changed around CapEx spending over the last few 

iod of building out potentially a lot of excess 

quarters we can also see things slow down as the business grows into that 
spending more? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So, Douglas let me 

first. On CapEx, listen, if you listen to the script I gave a couple of minutes 
ago, interestingly this quarter that in priority order was construction of 
datacenters. Second was actually real
-
es
tate which typically would have 
been historically, you would have heard me talk about kind of equipment, 
and then equipment was third. So, CapEx continues 
--
 
we think continues to 

t

--
 
we have a big building program right now 

talked about a minute ago about GCE and other Cloud services that continue 
to grow. So, to strategically have
 
the capacity versus not having the 
capacity is such a strategic asset to us that will continue to look at way. In 
terms of real
-
estate we found the same time. We found that we have, when 
we have opportunities to actually acquire real
-

ke versus 
so buy versus lease option. And if you think of our growth and the growth in 
the strategic areas where we want to be, when we find great opportunities I 
think that we have a no
-
regret move in actually taking that action. So, 

tivities on that front which answers a bit, a lot of 
questions have been around, is the core business kind of capital intensity 


ight now in making sure that 
we have the long
-



Was that for sites?
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
For sites, and the lower or smaller decline over the last two quarters?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes, again I would refer you back to the IR team to get a lot of more 
detailed questions. But I think on a quarterly basi
s there can be so many 
fluctuations. I think year
-
over
-
year gives you a much more kind of realistic 
trend about what is fundamentally going on in the business, because one or 
two changes can really kind of swing, even seasonality can swing quite a bit 
both
 
in terms of growth rates or CPCs 
--
 
clicks and CPCs. So, be aware 
always of 
--
 
and if you can see that in the network numbers, clearly on the 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter as well there is a lot of noise in the data. So you have 
to be careful in the quarter
-
over
-
q
uarter. But year

would do it. Thank you very much for your questions. Jamie, lets go to our

ne which just I was going to start with that

Shopping Express seems to be a great way to impact the small business 

 
different areas. Is that kind of the, should we start to see an inflection in 
small business advertising adoption?
 
Patrick Pichette
 

about local and local is really about both sma
ll businesses as well as large 
businesses. So, it really 
--
 
so absolutely small businesses will be as part of 


us of 


in the past where basically you have a great convergence because there is 
humongous strength in both of
 

converging in many ways. Today you can get 
--
 
for example, on an Android 
phone right Chrome kind of powers the search and vice versa. So we have a 
lot of these cross
-

 
one 
leadership which is Sundar, and he basically actually makes sure that these 
two teams continue to work into an integrated fashion. Everybody knows 
that Chrome has a huge focus on security, and that is in fact a great focus to 
kind of migrate over into
 
the Android ecosystem to make sure that we have 
kind of the equivalent of enterprise grade security for all of our users 
whether they be Chrome or Android. So, I think that, when you think of 
multi
-
screen there are both of these OSS are actually very comp
lementary 

that across these multi
-
screens you should expect, Android continues to be 
very much the thing of choice for mass and Chrome continues to be very

whether they are directly tied to advertisin
g because they are an advertising

you a great infrastructure on which kind of that fuels the searches and the

Just trying to understand the content strategy within YouTube, so just 
how high do you want to go up the professionally created content funnel, 

model?

Thank you, You

all forms of professional content available today. It has all the way from user 
content to very popular user content with people like Michelle Phan etcetera, 
and it has a lot of clips from pr
ofessionally created content from various 
media partners we talked about CBS and Viacom in the earnings call. So, we 
have lots and lots of content from different players out there. And our 

It is 
now the linchpin of each of our brand strategies if our partners and 
advertisers want to come work with us to create brand campaigns because 
YouTube allows you to actually target a fragmented set of interest in a most 
efficient fashion as opposed to 
try and do burst advertising that you would 
do in television and broadcast more. So, clearly the monetization model is 

experimented with various models on YouTube and we continue to 
exper
iment to see if advertising is the only model or there are ways that we 
can monetize using subscription of paid for content. I think that we will 
continue to do and see which ones in those sticks with the users.

Thanks very much. Nikesh, could you just expand on that last comment, 
putting together Google Fiber and a year on from YouTube channels. How 
important is it for Google over time to establish a subscription based type 
revenue stream especially if c
ontent moves to bundles. And for Patrick two 
things that would help us benchmark Google versus peers. First of all can 
you talk about the portion of ad growth or even the overall ad sales which 

tioning of the 
notion that large amounts of offshore cash can be permanently reinvested. 
Can you tell us what portion of cash is now offshore and how we should 
think about international opportunities that might absorb these very large 
volumes of cash? Than
ks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Richard, thank you very much for the question. I think in terms of your 
question around Google Fiber, YouTube, content bundling, subscription, 


lot of moment across the board where different people are 
trying different models, where cable is trying to provide content over the 
top, where YouTube is available on television screens, where people are 
trying to increase the broadband speeds because eve
rybody gets the sense 
that we will consume more and more broadband content. I think what's clear 


cons
ume content more and more in a non
-
linear fashion. And its clear that 
content will come from different places, not just the traditional mechanisms 

people will monetize content b
oth either in some form of payment or some 
form of advertising. Beyond that how all of this sort of coagulates and takes 

different ends of the spectrum where we have like YouT
ube purely 
advertising based content and monetize today which is over the top which 
works on broadband. We have Google Fiber, we have channel bundle. So I 
think we are experimenting, we are playing in every space. And I think 
eventually the user will decid
e whatever is most convenient and most able to 

of these races.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

again kind of take a b
it of exception through the premise of your argument 
about well how much is driven by mobile? We really are living in a multi
-
screen world. You start on mobile, you hop on tablet, you go to your 
desktop, you kind of come back to your television, you kind o
f Chromecast 

how much of your advertising is really driven by one? And we do a lot of 

advertisers is, how
 
much attribution to kind of show to each of these 
elements which is in that chain of activities that actually leads to the end 
which is either a consumption of something or a purchase. So from that 

e as a percentage 
of ads. What really matters is that you have the footprint across all of these 
devices and modes to actually deliver the best answer to our users, and 

In the case 
of CapEx in international, like last quarter our offer cash was 


today. It may move a percentage, here and there. We
 
do have great 
opportunities outside the U.S. as well to actually invest our cash whether it 


outside of the 
U.S. where our headquarters in Ireland continues to grow and

when you see our real

that transactio

Thank you, Ellen.
 
We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, ref
lecting 
our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers and enterprise 
customers around the world. In aggregate, we had substantial revenue 
growth, up 26% year
-
on
-
year and up 23% in constant currency. Sites 
revenues continued to exhibit stro
ng year
-
on
-
year momentum, benefiting 
from innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the 
way.
 
Our network adverting business maintained a healthy growth, led by AdMob 
and programmatic advertising. The businesses comprising other revenue
s, 
namely Cloud, Play and Hardware again had substantial growth.
 

consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year
-
over
-
year changes. There 
are two items to note in our earnings p
ress release. First, we provided a 
table to highlight the impact of the European Commission fines on operating 
income, net income and EPS results in the second quarters of 2018 and 
2017. Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the ne
w 
accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity 
security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater 

review the quarter. I will then revi
ew results for Google followed by Other 
Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business 
and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
 

f
or the quarter. Our total revenues of $32.7 billion were up 26% year
-
over
-
year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year
-
over
-
year of $768 million or $665 million after the impact of our hedging 
program.
 
Turning to Alphabet revenues by
 
geography. You can see that our 
performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.9 
billion, up 21% year
-
over
-
year. EMEA revenues were $10.8 billion, up 26% 
year
-
over
-
year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%, reflecting 
strengthen
ing of both the euro and for British pound. APAC revenues were 
$5.1 billion, up 36% versus last year and up 34% in constant currency, 
reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Korean won. Other 
Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 31% year

related expenses. The key 
drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, 
including depreciation, which conti
nued to be affected by a reallocation of 
certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for 
YouTube, followed by hardware

related costs.
 
Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $16 billion. 
Excluding the impact of
 
the EC fines, operating expenses were $10.9 billion 
in the quarter, up 24% year

over

year. Once again, the biggest increase 
was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical 
talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects i
ncreases in 
sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud, followed by advertising 
investments in Cloud and the Assistant.
 
G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of 
factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connec
tion with the 
recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the 
reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of 
revenues.
 
Stock

based compensation totaled $2.4 billion. Headcount at the end of the 
quarter
 
was 89,058, up 4,008 from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the 
majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of 
product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both 
technical and sales roles.
 
Operating income
 
was $2.8 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, 
operating income was $7.9 billion, up 15% versus last year, for an operating 
margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $1.4 billion, which includes 
$1.1 billion of gains in equity security investme
nts. We provide more detail 
on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
 
Our effective tax rate was 24.2% for the second quarter, reflecting a sizable 
impact from the non

deductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $3.2 billion 
and earning
s per diluted share were $4.54. Excluding the impact of the EC 
fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were 
$11.75.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 

e Google segment results. Operating 
cash flow was $10.1 billion with free cash flow of $4.7 billion. We ended the 
quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the
 
Google 
segment. Revenues were $32.5 billion, up 25% year

the revenue detail. Google Sites revenues were $23.3 billion in the quarter, 
up 26% year

mobile search with str
ong contributions from both YouTube and desktop 
search.
 
Network revenues were $4.8 billion, up 14% year

ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google 
were $4.4 billion, up 37% year

Hardware.
 
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to 
give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising 
businesses.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.4 billion or 23% of total advertising 
revenues and up 26% year

year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
advertising revenues was up year
-
over
-
year, primarily reflecting an increase 
in the sites TAC rate, which was offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from 
network to sites. The increase
 
in the sites TAC rate year

over

year was 
driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, 
which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced year

year and the operating margins was 27.6%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter 
was $5.3

construction, and facilities.
 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. Other Bets revenues were $145 
million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $732 
million f
or the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $10 million.
 

Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up 
to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica 
minivans to its self

driving fleet. And lastly 
Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous 
miles with most of those on city streets.
 
A couple of weeks ago, X announced that Loon and Wing have graduated to 
become independent comp
anies under Alphabet. Graduation from X signals 
that these companies have reached certain technical and business 
milestones and that their focus is shifting toward commercialization. And just 
last week, Loon indicated that it is partnering with Telkom Keny
a to launch 
commercial service in regions of Kenya by early 2019.
 
Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer term 

momentum in our advertising businesses. As dis
cussed previously, we 
continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the 
benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for 
users and advertisers.
 
Looking ahead, our hardware business is seasonal, typically ex
periencing 
lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new 
products for the holiday season. Second, with respect to profitability. Within 

past couple of quart
ers, we expected the pace of year
-
on
-
year growth in 
sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue would slow after the first quarter 
of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results of this quarter.
 
As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate
 
to continue to 
increase year
-
on
-
year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at 
a more moderate pace relative to the year
-
on
-
year increases experienced 
over the past several quarters.
 
Within OpEx, we continue to take a disciplined approach t
o setting priorities 
as we invest for the long
-
term growth. The majority of our headcount 
growth continues to be in technical roles and engineering and product 
management. In terms of business areas, the largest number of headcount 
additions were in our cl
oud business with hires for engineering, sales and 
marketing.
 
As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 
because that is when we bring our new graduates. As I mentioned last 
quarter, regarding sales and marketing, we continue to 
expect expenses to 
be more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the 
holiday season.
 
Another factor to consider in year
-
on
-
year comparisons next quarter is the 
timing of two expense items in Q3 last year. As we called out last year, 
there 
was a meaningful benefit in the third quarter of 2017 from the shift in timing 
of our annual equity refresh and also from the timing of sales and marketing 
spend which was more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.
 
For our Other Bets, we remain foc
used on making progress on a number of 
commercial opportunities across the business, while continuing to manage 
investment against achievement of key milestones.
 
Third, with respect to CapEx. As I discussed with you last quarter, our 
commitment to growth i
s evident in the ongoing trend in CapEx investment. 

opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience. And we 
are investing in the additional compute power required to
 
support growth in 

businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute 
needs, most notably Cloud. The investment pace also reflects the 
importance of machine learning across
 
all of our products including search 
and ads. Although machine learning is more compute
-
intensive, it is 
increasingly core to businesses across Alphabet, and opens up the possibility 
of accelerated innovation in products and services. And keeping with our
 
approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long
-
term value creation, 
we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.

mission. We revamped the Google News app 
in May to create reviews. It uses machine learning to highlight top stories 
organized for users, explore topics more deeply with articles from a range of 
clustered news sources. We believe in the need to deliver hig

quality 
information and news to users, and to support the news industry as we do 
so.
 
The Google Assistant is another the great product based on machine 
learning. By the end of this year, it will be available in more than 30 
languages and 80 countries. We
 
have worked with partners to expand the 
number of smart devices that are now compatible with the Google Assistant 
like doorbells, dryers, refrigerators and more, and connect with more than 
5,000 devices in the home.
 
At Google I/O, we also highlighted how 
AI is improving Google Maps, 
including enhancing the experience with Assistant and AR features. Through 
our improvements in machine learning, we have seen a 25x increase in our 
ability to build maps algorithmically, and we have added 110 million 
algorithmi
cally drawn buildings to Maps, since the beginning of this year.

There are many more great AI powered features we rolled out this quarter 
including the new version of Gmail with Smart Compose, a new features that 
helps users craft emails faster. And Google Photos now suggests actions to 
help you brighte
n, share, rotate or archive a picture.
 
Next, our computing, video and advertising platforms. These platforms are 
providing real economic opportunities for developers, creators and 
publishers in every corner of the vault. Last year, I announced that in the 
three
-
year period from 2014 to 2016, we paid out over $15 billion in 
revenue to our creator, publisher and app developer partners in Europe, 
Middle East and Africa via AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. Our 
contribution is accelerating. In 2017 alone, we ge
nerated an additional $7 
billion for these partners.
 
First, our computing platforms. 10 years ago, we launched the first Android 

everyone. Today, there are more than 24,000 devices
 
at every price point 
from more than 1,300 different brands. The Android ecosystem supports 
thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell 
Android devices. Millions of app developers around the world who have built 
their business
es of Android and billions of consumers who can now afford 
and use cutting
-
edge Android smartphones. This is all supported by a 
business model that encourages and enables this open ecosystem to thrive.
 
Continuing this momentum, at I/O, we unveiled a pletho
ra of new features 
throughout the Android platform, like battery saving features in Android P, 
new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, the new Android model to 
help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors, as well as 
tools to he
lp users understand and control how they are spending time on 
their device. Our investments in our computing platforms, as well as in AI 
and design are also helping us generate great momentum in our made by 
Google hardware business across Pixel, Home, Nest
, Chromecast and more. 
We brought Google Home and Mini to Ireland, Australia, Spain and Mexico. 
Additionally, bringing the Nest and Google teams together is showing early 
results. The products can more seamlessly work together and our product 
development a
nd go

market are benefiting from the new alignment. 
There is a lot more to come here in the next few months.
 
Second, our video platform, YouTube is growing tremendously. We launched 

ing 
great feedback from users and artists a lot. This quarter, YouTube rebranded 
its subscription service, YouTube Premium, featuring originals like our hit 
series Cobra Kai, which got 41 million views to first episode alone. While 
advertising on YouTube i
s an incredibly strong and growing source of income 
for creators, we are also investing in new ways for creators to generate 
revenue on the platform, including paid channel memberships, merchandise 
shelves on YouTube channels, and endorsement opportunities
, through a 
company we acquired in 2016, FameBit. In fact, half of the creators that 
used FameBit in the first three months of 2018, doubled their YouTube 
revenue.
 
And third, our advertising platforms which are firing on all cylinders, as we 
put the power 

 
At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising 
products, our core product Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform which 
provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies, an
d 
Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers.
 
We also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning, called 
Responsive Search Ads. It automates the manual process of building text 
ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best 
performing ad for each 
search query. Advertisers also got a first look at local campaigns and smart 
campaigns. Local campaigns are designed exclusively to drive foot traffic to 
local businesses and smart campaigns are now the default for new SMB 
advertiser
s. Small business owners love the simplicity and the results.
 
This quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with 
leading global retailers like Carrefour, designed to give people the power to 
shop wherever and however they want. 
Carrefour is a great example of how 
we can partner deeply with companies, bringing our shopping and ads and 
cloud products together for them. They recently chose to migrate from Office 
to G Suite for their more than 160,000 employees and have selected us a

Speaking of our efforts to help businesses succeed in the cloud, our cloud

momentum. Success of our vertical strategy and customer centric approach 

izza, SoundCloud and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target is migrating three areas of its business to 
Google Cloud platform. Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the 
cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models and improve 
customer
 
experiences.
 
New customers include Banco Itaú in Brazil. We also have our rapidly 
growing business for our specialized cloud AI services. AirAsia expanded its 
relationship with us to use machine learning and data analytics. We are 
seeing an acceleration i
n business adoption of Chromebooks, the most 
secure and cost efficient way for businesses to enable their employees to 
work in the cloud.
 
In Q2, unit sales of managed Chromebooks grew by more than 175% year
-
over
-
year. And we saw deployments at customers li
ke Veolia. And to support 
our growing global customer base, we continue to invest in new cables, open 
new regions in Finland and Los Angeles, and announced the Zurich region. 
We now have 17 open regions with three more on the way.
 
Before I close, I want to
 
give a quick shout out to the work that we are 
doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming 
online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria, 
many of whom experience the web only through thei
r mobile phone. This is 
a big area of focus for us. Through a great partnership with Indian Railways, 
and RailTel, we have hit our goal of enabling high
-
speed public Wi
-
Fi in 400 

in 
Indonesia and Mexico with more to come soon.
 
And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced the new 
Google AI research center in Ghana with the goal of bringing together top 
machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI resea
rch and 
applications in Africa and beyond.
 
Of course, our commitment to help communities and people benefit from the 
digital economy, expense beyond the products that they use. Last month, as 
part of our broader growth Google effort, we expanded the Google
 
IT 
Support Professional Certificate program to more than 25 community 
colleges in the U.S. This will give students an opportunity to learn skills 
needed to jump start their carriers in IT support.
 
I want to thank Googlers for their hard work which helps u
s create products 
that billions of people love and use every day.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our 
first question comes from Eric 
Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thank you very much. Two questions if I can. Sundar, for you, following 

commerce space. I want to
 
understand how those partnerships might evolve 
over the next couple of years? What Google brings on table for those 
partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we thing 
long
-

Waymo, in 
the quarter. Is there any you can give us of some of the key investment 
milestones or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the 
Waymo business in the coming years? Thanks so much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Great. On the commerce front, obvious

to drive partnerships. We already have deep advertising relationships with 
many of these providers, increasingly. Shopping is an area where we are 
beginning to work together. And finally, I think cloud is another im
portant 
way by which we can start working together. So, I do think we are seeing a 
lot of traction there. I gave the Carrefour example. We also announced 
strategic partnership and significant investment in JD.com, the second 
largest ecommerce company in Ch
ina. Today, we are already, for example in 

retailers like Walmart, Costco, Target, Walgreens and PetSmart. So, there is 
a lot of traction. I think we are building upon these relatio
nships, trying to 
have more holistic conversations across the breadth of our offerings, and I 
think I see all being very synergistic.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then, in terms of Waymo. We remain very excited about the opportunity 

 
our progress on a number of fronts. 
I think the main point is, it is still very early. But, in terms of our progress. 
So, 2018, the focus has been to launch the commercial rider program in 

-
end. W
e do view 
that as a first step in building a more fully rolled out rider program in the 

program in Phoenix with an emphasis on delivering a safe experience that 
delights users.
 

lso continued to build out our vehicle relationships. You saw 


deliveries. We talked this past quarter about lic
ensing the technology for

new market does take time. and then on the CapEx versus OpEx, the way it 

viewed as more of a development or R&D phase than much of the

still very early.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. 
I just had two questions. One, I was wondering if you could talk 


at this point? And then, Sundar, as you men
tioned, with Google Next upon 

--
 
you guys are talking very positively about the 
business. But, are there anymore stats you can share with us, even about 
the growth rates in G Suite or GCP or combined? And then, when we think 
about 
this business scaling over time, is there any reason to think that the 
pace of gross margin progression would be materially different than say 
Azure, AWS at similar revenue levels? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Heather. On GDPR, obviously 

a long time well over 18 months, but the rollout just happened towards the 


ocused on 

so, we are working closely with our partners and regulators and committed 

 
And on Google Next and Cloud, obviously the 
conference is tomorrow. So, I 
will hold for the announcements there. Couple of things, G Suite has 
definitely I think seen a lot of momentum, definitely have noticed in the 
--
 

I 
gave the Carrefour for example. But increasingly, we are seeing big 

development.
 
And on Cloud, I think we are investing for the long run. We are definitely 
seeing traction. A lot of ou
r effort, from a product and technology 

investing in our go

to

market efforts. And as we do it, both developing our 
in
-
house strength but as well as partnering, those things are 
beginning to 

conference.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my question there. I have
 
two. The first one, the Google 
Assistant and the Hardware and Google Mini. I was curious, if you could just 
talk about sort of early learnings and differences in consumer behaviors, 
how they interact with those devices as opposed to mobile search and the 

-
term value proposition 
for users and advertisers. Maybe talk about the focus, and the hardware is 
long
-
term for users and advertisers. And Sundar, I appreciate your color on 
India and Indonesia and emergi

strategically trying to position yourself for business potentially beyond 
advertising and payments or other areas in the countries, if you could, 
please?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
So on Google Assistant, obviously, we see Google Assis
tant as an important 

People definitely are pushing the boundaries of what they can do with these 
devices, and home control and automation is a good example of the kind of 
use case
 

assets in Nest et cetera end up battling over time. So, there is a lot more 
actions, people are trying to get things done, which is definitely areas we are 

portant to understand that experience not just 
in the context Home and Home Mini, but also your core mobile experience, 


-
to
-
end user experience in mind, a

all the investments we have done over many, many years I think will come 
into play as the product evolves.
 
On your question about emerging markets, the user growth there is 

So, all our 
major products, products which have over a billion users each, they are all 


opportunities in th
ese markets, which are different from the markets we are 
here in here in our more mature markets. You highlighted payments as a 

in India. And so, we will look to do more like that. A
nd beyond just getting 

in talent in these countries. And there is a lot of innovation, which is going to 
happen from these countries, both for their own markets and for the world 
b
eyond. And we want to be in a position to do that well.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is 
now open.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Two, if I could. First, for Ruth. You talked about the higher cost, as you shift 
to machine learn
ing driven business and then also your tech upgrade cycle 
around machine? Can you give us a sense of where you are in making those 
transitions and absorbing those investments from a cost perspective? And 
then, Sundar, mobile strength, clearly in the quarte
r. Can you just help us 
understand better how machine learning and AI or driving the stronger 
growth in mobile search and if there is any specific innovations or products 
you can point to that are driving that outsized growth? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, in ter
ms of your first question and kind of machine learning, and I think 





learning and we are really proud of the team that we have and given the 
opportunity set that they are able to address. And I think
 
you were getting 

quarter as well, we view this as it lands into our outlook for growth and the 
required additional compute capacity. And there are number of growth 
drivers there. And pa
rt is really to support growth that we are seeing in our 



 
also for our newer 
businesses, as I noted in opening comments. And then very importantly, it 
reflects the importance of machine learning across our products including 
search and ads.
 

in
tensive, but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet, 

with best

class compute capacity. And so, the build is really machines, 
data centers and network infra
structure, and just to make sure and put a 

the growth we see. We do constantly remain focused on efficiency per unit 

e investing 
here for long
-
term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue 
the opportunities that we see ahead of us.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And Doug, on your question on how is machine learning driving the mobile 
search experience. The key thing is, 


ranking, actually understanding the intent, the context around the query, 
and getting you the right answer. I think, the experience is 
--
 
I mean
, the 
improvements are happening continuously. And so, we are 
--
 
I would just 
say we are getting deeper in terms of what we are able to do.
 

understand, I gave the Translate example earli
er. While it may seem like a 

--
 
obviously, we can do translate well 
because of machine learning. But where it helps us is, we want Google to be 
the source you think of when you run into a problem. And the fact that the 
dat
a shows that during the World Cup in Russia, our usage spiked up. To me 
it shows that when people are running into new things, new experiences, 
when they have questions on their mind, Google is what they are reaching 
out to. And I think the way we continue
 
to do that well is by increasingly by 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of 
Evercore. Your line is now open.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Thank you very 
much. First for Sundar. You talked about Android in your 
prepared remarks. In your blog post you said that you are concerned that 
the Android ruling from the EC sends a troubling signal in favor of 
proprietary systems over open platform. So, I wonder how a
re you thinking 
about the possible business impact from this Android ruling, specifically on 
tying the Play Store from Search and the Chrome browser. And does it in 
any way change your strategic approach for Android going forward? And 
then, for Ruth, on th
e theme of OpEx investment trends, if we isolate just 
the other revenue businesses, Cloud, Play and Hardware, all growth drivers, 
but clearly structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and 
profitability. You said, most of the headcount ad
ditions are in Cloud, but 
would love to understand more about how you prioritize investment across 
Cloud, Play and Hardware, those three? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On Android, I said in my blog post, Android has really worked well, I think 
globally for user
s for everyone in the ecosystem. You can clearly see there is 
robust competition. There is a lot of innovation, lower prices that has made 

more choice for everyone, not less. We a
re analyzing the decision, and I 

said. But we will 
--
 


 
we 
are also looking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the 
enormous benefits of Android to users and so on. So, there is small work to 

that we can find a way
 
to make sure Android is available at scale to users, 
everyone.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of your question, on investment priorities, I think one of the 
most important points to underscore is that one of the biggest opportunities 
for investment, continues to
 
be in our ads business where we are continuing 
to investment meaningfully, given the opportunity set that we see there. 
Sundar commented on some of them, as did I, looking at opportunities to 
enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for a
dvertisers, 

we are increasingly seeing, is, as we focus on mobile, the benefits are across 

So, we are contin

with the notion that the investment is just pointed to the new business sets.
 
And then, more specifically to your question, what we look at is the 
opportunity set, the 
--
 
each one of these is 
different. When we start with 
cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building 
upon, our technical infrastructure, security app, machine learning, analytical 

 
the 
core pillars that are needed to win. And what has been the recurring theme 


that enterprise cust

opportunity, the pace of investment that can be done effectively and 
therefore position us well.
 
Our hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly 
with the sales as a hom

there. We talked about the HTC acquisition last quarter because this is a 
scale business. And the ability to operate as effectively as possible

Great, thanks. Two questions. It seems like your commentary on cloud is 


at a broad industry infl
ection point in terms of cloud adoption, and any 



be on a global basis as 
kind of traditional TV brand advertising. Any thoughts on that as an 


 
Sundar Picha
i
 
On the first question on cloud. For sure, I do think there is an inflection 

-
sum game. I think all the major 
players are definitely seeing traction. And to me, the reason is, typically 
when you look at enterpr

architecture, you try and stay on it as long as you can in many, many cases, 
but this change is hard. But, this is a case in which the benefits are super 
clear. And over time, I think, there is a tremendous cost t
o your business of 
being on the wrong architecture, especially if you need to digitally transform 
yourself, thinking through the cloud architecture becomes an important way 
by which you are improving your business. So, I think at a foundational 

 

questions about cloud. Almost all businesses I deal with, I can clearly see 

 

--
 
busin
esses are going to embrace multiple 
clouds over time too. So, I think not only is this early, but I think it is going 

something we view 
--
 
this is something we have built expe
rience over 20 
years. And we are thoughtfully gaining strengthen and committed to it for 
the very long term.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then, in terms of kind of trends in advertising, to your question. We 
have talked about this quite a bit in the past, over 90% of co
mmerce is still 
offline, and we do see a great opportunity for digital to play a bigger role in 
that and tap into our budgets, into other budgets that have traditionally 
been there. And so, we are quite focused on the advertising opportunities, 
as said. An
d the fact that ad budgets are offline, and as we focus on, these 
are opportunity and the tools for advertisers, we see view that as another 
opportunity.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital

Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, you 
mentioned in your prepared remarks or highlighted at least the launch of 

an initiative
 
that will help drive demand across a number of Google 

aimed at driving store visits, one would assume Maps would play an 

ked you about Maps, 
it was focused more on getting the user experience right. So, my question 
is, do you see local campaigns as something that drives a bit of incremental 
level of monetization of Maps.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

l is an extraordinary use case in 
mobile. Local mobile searches are growing faster than mobile searches for us 
and have increased by almost 50% in the last year alone. And we are 
continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, 
users and advertisers. And local campaigns is something new which we 


to you. You provide us with your budge
t, business locations and creatives, 
and we use machine learning to automatically optimize the ads to appear 

we are beginning to experiment with new ad format, which we have had
 
in 

places and place page ads.
 
So, these are important ways by which we are exploring the commercial 

have. And 

continue to do so, because the growth is very, very high. So, we see a lot of 
headroom. But as that experience is 
--
 
as we get a better understand of it, 
we are developing our views on how we can
 
bring monetization experiences.

And our question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
 
Brent Thill
 
Ruth, the U.S
. and Asia business has accelerated sequentially modestly, but 
Europe was down a touch. And I think there have been many questions 
around did GDPR have any impact, and Sundar said it was too early to call. 
But, is that just completely unrelated to what hap
pened or maybe there is 

 
Ruth Porat
 

each of the regions at 19% year
-
on
-
year growth in EMEA and a fixed basis 
wher



each of the various region. And as we both 
commented on, as long as you 

pleased with the growth, 34% on a fixed FX basis and it underscores 

well as the sup
erb leadership group. Mobile strength is the key there as well, 


with the fact that it is 
--
 
all regions ar
e contributing nicely.
 
Brent Thill
 
And a quick follow
-
up for Sundar. You mentioned on the cloud business that 

institutions. One of the big questions we get is around the heavily regulated 
ind

referenceability there. Are you happy with where you sit across the more 
heavily regulated industries now versus the tech
-
focused industries where 
you sit right now?
 
Sundar Pic
hai
 

right, getting certifications needed, depending on the industry and building 

and both on GCP, but as 
well as G Suite. And so, we definitely are going to 

opportunities in these areas very seriously.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird. Your 
line is now open.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
I have a couple, maybe first going back to the commerce theme. I wanted to 
ask about Shopping Actions and level of adoption you might be seeing with 
that formats. And more generally, what do you envision monetization for 
G
oogle Assistant, if we should still expect to see more of a transactional 

more color perhaps in the tiny or how much of the second quarter benefited 
from the moderation in growth in 
sites TAC just so we can get a better sense 
as to how to model that expense item over the next few quarters?
 
Sundar Pichai
 

exciting to see the improvement there, but I still 
would like that experience 

these areas, we always set a high bar to make sure the user experience is 
working well. You have seen us do that with Maps or something like that.
 
And 
I think today while we have taken promising steps with Shopping 
Actions for all of us to really work well and to delight users. I still feel we 

stay focused there, get the experience
 
and then that will give us new 
avenues to monetize it. I've seen this with YouTube now, beyond ads we are 
experimenting with a lot of new formats, and the same thing here. So, I am 
pretty confident of our ability to do that well, if we get the user experi
ence 
right.
 
Ruth Porat
 

percentage of revenues is affected by quite a number of factors. The main 
point is that we do continue to expect the TAC rate to increase on a year
-
on
-
year basis. A
nd the primary reason is when we talked about really in the 

desktop. So, on a year
-
on
-

seeing as the ongoing strength in mobile.
 
Ov
er the past four quarters, changes in partnership agreements have also 
been a driver of increases in the TAC rate and then there are host of other 

device mix or partner mix or mix 
of organic and pay distribution points.
 
And so, as we called out last quarter, we did expect the pace of year
-
on
-
year growth in the sites TAC rate to slow beginning in this quarter, the 

 
repeatedly said, it is most effective to focus on year
-
on
-
year changes given 
the significance of this shift to mobile and mobile growth. And so variations 
in quarter
-
on
-
quarter move are less instructive.

Thank you. And our next question comes fro
m Michael Nathanson of 
MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, firstly. You went through a lot of 

you talk a bit about 
what the bottlenecks are then to be solved by you or 
your clients before you can scale the Verily opportunity? And then for Ruth, 

growth. What is usual timeframe do you think, do you 
see where those 
investments to pay off? And what factors would make the CapEx to sale ratio 
start growing even faster from here? Those were my questions.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Broadly, Verily is clearly set up us an other bet, and they are doing really 
important w
ork on healthcare, if we look at the recent progress on their 

more talk about. Across healthcare, we see a big opportunity for both Google 

ry important for Cloud. And we are 
obviously helping a lot of healthcare partners across their needs. And Verily 

lot more to say on all of this over the course of time.
 
Ruth Po
rat
 
And then, with respect to CapEx, look, I think, our view is that what you are 
saying here is an aggressive piece of investment, given our outlook for 
growth. And as I said the required additional Compute capacity, we are quite 
focused on the kind of fu
ll resource utilization across businesses. If I go back 
to couple of years when we incorporated stock
-
based compensation into the 
way we are talking about the businesses, I made the point that that is 
helpful, both externally and internally, and looking at
 
resource utilization, 
the same is clearly true of CapEx. And we are quite focused on long
-
term 

opportunities in a prudent, appropriate way to capture the opportunity while 
making sure that
 



piece and an appropriate one, given the op
portunities that we see, and it is a 
class data centers, machines and network infrastructure as I said.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of 
Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 
Thank you. I just wan
t to get into website growth. First, maybe you can help 
us a little bit understand strength in mobile search. Are there new any ad 
formats or ad changes? You mentioned local, anything to call out there? And 
then, just wondering, given the YouTube controver
sies last year, did 
YouTube accelerate this quarter? And what are some of the big content 
areas that you are investing in? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, in terms of sites revenue, I think, our view is ongoing strength reflects 
our focus on improving the user e
xperience and enhancing tools for 


us to deliver over a 100 innovations each quarter. And really exciting area
 
is 

enhancing experiences for users but the tools that we talked about for 
advertisers and for app developers, certainly helping them find the right 
audience, to be able to opt
imize campaigns at scale, to deliver more relevant 
and higher quality ads. Sundar talked about a number of them. The Google 


 
or local 
campaigns, smart shopping campaigns, another great example is universal 
app campaigns. So, across the board. And again, I made this comment 

growth opportunities across platfo
rms.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

complexity you need to deal with to have advertiser, and increasingly we are 
using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the 
busi
ness problem they are trying to solve. And that turns out to be a big 
driver overall.
 
On YouTube, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum, 

to grow and the gro
wth is global. And we see it across many, many verticals. 


investing a lot in people to review the content th

policies. And again, using machine learning to make all of this work better. 

engaging with the platform more. So, I would say overall, there is a lot of 
mome

Patrick Pichette
 
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 
earnings call.
 
Before we jump into my usual remarks, I'd like to bring two points to 
everybody's attention. First, a reminder that on April
 
2nd, we issued our 
Class C stock dividend with twice as many shares outstanding, our usual per 
share information will look quite different starting this quarter.
 
Also, second, and also as a reminder, our expected sale of the Motorola 
business 
--
 
mobile bu
siness to Lenovo triggered discontinued operations 
accounting treatment which means Motorola's quarterly results are shown 
separately from Google net income. You'll see this new presentation in our 
financials starting this quarter.
 
So with these two caveat
s noted let's dive into the details of Google's 
financial performance in Q1. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a 
healthy 19% year
-
over
-
year to $15.4 billion and it was down 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Without currency fluctuations, our gross total con
solidated revenue growth 
would in fact have been 21% year
-
over
-
year. Google sites revenue was up 
21% year
-
over
-
year to $10.5 billion and was down 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter 
driven by the strength in our core search advertising business.
 
Network revenue was up
 
4% year
-
over
-
year at $3.4 billion and was down 
4% quarter
-
over
--
quarter driven by improved year
-
over
-
year growth from 
our Ad Exchange and AdMob businesses.
 
Finally, Google's other revenue grew 48% year
-
over
-
year to $1.6 billion and 
was down 6% quarter
-
ove
r
-
quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our 
Play Store drove year
-
over
-
year growth. Chromecast sales were also strong.
 
Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter again up 26% 
year
-
over
-
year and down just 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Our aggregate cost 
per click was down 9% year
-
over
-
year and flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. Our 
monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors 
discussed on previous calls, inclu
ding geographic mix, device mix, property 
mix as well as products and policy changes.
 
And to help investors better understand the complex dynamics of these 
monetization metrics, we'll begin disclosing paid clicks and CPC growth by 
property in Q2.
 
To be cle
ar this means we'll disclose CPC and paid click growth rates for both 
our sites and network businesses. We will continue to disclose aggregate 
growth rates for CPC and paid clicks.
 
Turning to the geographic performance, we saw strong performance in the 
U.S
. and rest of world, solid performance in our U.K. In our earnings slides, 
which you can find in our Investor Relations' website, you'll see that we've 
broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world, to show the 
impact of FX and benefits from our
 
hedging program. So, please refer to 
those slides for the exact calculation.
 
U.S. revenue was up 14% year
-
over
-
year to $6.7 billion, the U.K. was up 
14% year
-
over
-
year to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, it grew 11% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Our non
-
U.S. revenue
 
excluding the U.K. was up 25% year
-
over
-
year to 
$7.2 billion. This accounted for 47% of our total revenue, which includes a 
$8 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest 
of world grew, in fact, 30% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Let me 
now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.2 billion or 
23% of total advertising revenue. Our non
-
GAAP other cost of revenue was 
$2.6 billion in Q1, excluding our stock
-
based compensation.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.6 billion, agai
n excluding stock
-
based compensation and as a result, our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $5 
billion and our non
-
GAAP operating margins were 32% in Q1.
 
Just a quick word on a few items that may have created noise in our 
operating expenses this quarter. We ha
d some discrete legal expenses that 
hit our G&A line as well as one
-
time M&A related costs that increased our 
operating expenses, particularly in R&D. So, absent these discrete items, our 
expenses continue to demonstrate the same disciplined agenda we've a
lways 
had.
 
Headcount was up, roughly 2,100 people in Q1. In total, we ended the 
quarter with approximately 50,000 full
-
time employees and please note that 
the headcount still includes approximately 3,700 full
-
time employees from 
the Motorola business as we
ll as the employees from the acquisition 
completed in this quarter.
 
Our effective tax rate was 18% in Q1 and our tax rate this quarter was 
impacted obviously by the federal R&D credits, which expired in 2013.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. Other incom
e and expense was $357 
million for the quarter and realized gains on investments and interest 
income, offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging 
program. For more details on OI&E, please refer to the slides that 
accompany this call on our 
IR website.
 
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $4.4 billion. 
CapEx for the quarter was 2.3 billion this quarter; again the majority of 
CapEx was related to data center construction, production equipment, and 
real estate purchase
s.
 
As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest in the 
long
-
term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of 
investment for us. Our free cash flow was $2 billion for Q1.
 
And before I close, I want to give a brief 
update on Motorola. Motorola had a 
great quarter in Q1 with the Moto G showing strong sales momentum 
especially in emerging markets. The team continues to be hard at work and 
we look forward to seeing them join up with Lenovo soon.
 
So, there you have it, s
trong results and an optimism that provides us the 
confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities including Android, Chrome, 
YouTube, enterprise just to name a few.
 
And now I'll cover more details 
--
 
I'll let Nikesh, in fact, cover more details of 
our b
usiness performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up 
the phone lines for questions. Here you go Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. You're welcome to cover more details if you'd like.
 
Our business is growing well, with $15.4 billion
 
in gross revenue; we had a 
particularly good advertising performance in the United States, highlighted 
by very strong auto sector showing around the Super Bowl. We had strong 
Play growth in Asia and we had a few isolated tracks.
 
By now you're aware of the
 
four areas driving our business. The first one 
direct sponsor, or as I like to call it performance marketing; the second one 
helping clients build their brands; third our ad tech platform for publishers 
and agencies; and fourth, our emerging businesses li
ke digital content, 
enterprise, and hardware.
 
Let me give you an you an update on all of those and talk about industry 
trends that are driving the investments we're making. On performance 
advertising, people are now always online and they want seamless, ea
sy 
experience as they move from screen
-
to
-
screen.
 
This constant connectivity is driving our investments here as people use 
search to navigate their world, Google is well
-
positioned to help people 
navigate between web, apps and the places around them. They 
help the 
marketers measure the entire customer journey and to drive better 
monetization.
 
Next week, we'll be welcoming hundreds of advertisers to our adverse 
performance forum where we'll talk more about our work in this area for 
marketers. But clients are
 
already benefiting from our recent investments 
like enhanced campaign and estimated total conversion.
 
For instance, Shutterfly recently began measuring cross device conversion 
networks to understand sales that start in one device and end on another. 
As a 
result, they saw 60% increase in mobile conversions for non
-
brand 
terms, leaving them to include 100% of their keywords on mobile devices.
 
We're seeing great momentum in product listing adds as well, with a new 
shop in campaign system. International retail
er Farfetch upgraded shopping 
campaigns and increased their conversion rate by 13% while reducing cost 
there per acquisition or CPA by 20%.
 
And Domino's Pizza 
--
 
who doesn't like pizza, recently made it easy for 
customers to pay with Google Wallet, instant
 
buy in their in Android app.
 
Moving on to brand building. For years you've all seen the rise of digital 
video, over
-
the
-
top networks, connected screens, streaming devices and 
high quality digital programming. Already for example, YouTube reaches 
more than
 
1 billion people a month through usually popular channels like 
fashion guru, Bethany Mota; cooking maven, Rosanna Pansino; and cult hit 
Nerdist.
 
For marketers this is an irresistible trend, and we're now at a significant 
industry moment. Marketers and age
ncies that have historically built their 
brand on TV are reorienting their creative, planning, and investments with 
digital at the center.
 
This year nearly all Super Bowl advertisers turned to YouTube to extend the 
life and reaches of their TV spots and Su
per Bowl related ads on YouTube 
have been viewed over 300 million times. That's roughly three times the size 
of the audience that watch the ads on TV.
 
In Australia, we work with Nissan to create made for YouTube video for the 
launch of their new Patrol SUV
. The campaign which is promoted by 
TrueView ads and YouTube mass set for over 340% increase of daily visits to 
their websites, and more than 2% of those were interactive for the campaign 
booked a test drive.
 
In a few weeks in New York at our annual Brandc
ast Upfront Event we'll 
focus on our new Google preferred offering. This features exclusive access to 
the best, most engaging content on YouTube with guaranteed audiences 
through third
-
party measurement providers, Neilson and Counselor. We're 
really excite
d about this and we're looking forward to the results of that 
Upfront Brandcast Event.
 
We're also helping brands through our newest display ad formats. We 
recently teamed with Tory Burch to bring her New York Fashion Week Show 
to a global audience across o
ur display network. Then also the first ever live 
stream of fashion show in an ad using a light box ads, and we're able to 
share the exclusive event with more than 7 million of their biggest fans.
 
Third, moving to our ad technologies and platforms; our pro
grammatic ad 
technologies are seeing 
--
 
are continue to see great momentum with 
premium publisher partners like The Local Media Consortium.
 
That's comprised more than 800 daily newspapers and 200 local broadcast 
stations as well as timing. Both of them 
signed on with us in February to 
create private exchanges. This maximizes a value of that ad space for 
handpicked premium environment.
 
One thing we know is that agencies and publishers want to trust the 
environment in which they're transacting. Our ad netw
ork and exchanges 
are widely regarded across the industry as having the best quality controls 
and we continue to invest here.
 
In February we acquired wellium fraud fighter Spider.io and thousands of our 
clients are already using our MRC
-
accredited Active V
iew technology to buy 
high
-
quality viewable ad impressions.
 
Let me switch over to our emerging new businesses, digital content, 
hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to be the thriving hub of our 
digital content business. This quarter we introduce
d Google Play movies to 
39 new countries, so now people in more than 65 countries can enjoy 
movies through Play.
 
We also teamed up with Sonos to bring high
-
fidelity play music into the 
home and we introduce new development tools for Google Play games 
inclu
ding game gifting and iOS multiplayer support.
 
Over 75 million new users joined Google Play games in last six months; all of 
this is helping turn developers around the world into full
-
fledged businesses. 
In fact, we paid out more than four times as much mo
ney to developers in 
2013 compared to 2012.
 
And following the Open Automotive Alliance that we announced with 
partners in January designed to bring android as a car, in March we've 
announced Android Wear, a project that extends android to wearables.
 
We're 
also already working with several consumer electronics 
manufacturers, chip makers and fashion brands who can't wait to see what 
developers come up with for your wrist.
 
We also continue to see strong momentum from our suite of hardware 
products, our $35 Chr
omecast is a real hit. Last month we brought 
Chromecast to 11 more countries. We also recently opened up Chromecast 
developers, and in just a few weeks, more than 3,000 developers worldwide 
sign up to bring their apps and websites to the platform.
 
Turning 
over to enterprise. We continue to see strong product adoption 
around the globe. We launched Chromebox for meetings, which makes it 
easy for any company to have high
-
definition video meetings through the 
power of Google+ Hangouts and Google apps.
 
We're als
o investing significantly in the Google cloud platform and I've seen 
a very positive response to our most recent product announcements.
 
We expect to see continued momentum in this area and we believe we can 
bring significant value to the many companies tha
t opting public cloud 
because of our experience in building and operating one of the world's 
largest cloud computing environments for over a decade.
 
We able to pass on the savings that come from lower digital storage cost to 
our customers through highly co
mpetitive pricing. In addition, every day 
more businesses, governments and schools start using Google apps to work 
better together including the state of Sao Paulo who moved to Google apps 
for more than 4 million students and 300,000 teachers and staff.
 
Be
fore I close, I want to call out our marketing team who continues to 
highlight the magic of Google to beep around the world, into fourth annual 
Google Science Fair, the doodle for Google in United States, the hugely 
popular ad campaigns.
 
They also helped t
o build great retail experience for Chromecast in over 
6,000 stores. I'd like to thank all Googlers around the world who help makes 
a terrific quarter.
 
I'll now hand over back to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Nikesh. So we'll work with Jamie to go s
traight to the Q&A. 
Jamie?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from 
Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Ben Schachter 
-
 
Macquarie
 
Patrick, I was wondering if you could help us quantify some of
 
the expenses 
you saw, the one
-
time nature of G&A and anything else there that was really 
one
-
time. Just to help us understand what that run rate would look like if 
that wasn't in there?
 
And then maybe the cash, if you could talk about the theme of sort of
 
advertising attribution and how that's going to help you potentially bring 
over more brand dollars, and how do you think about bringing over those 
television dollars.
 
I mean is that something that's going to come sort of a big rushing in 2014, 
or it's jus
t going to be a slow evolution over many years. Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. Thanks Ben. When I start, look on the discrete legal expense that 
impacted, it really impacted our G&A if 
--
 
and then the one
-
time M&A deal 
cost impacted all of our operating l
ines, but most prominently our R&D line, 
which you'll notice will have jumped a bit.
 
The one
-
time M&A deal costs are largely stemming from the Nest deal, 
which was a pretty large transaction for us this quarter, but I think that the 
best way to describe it
 
is that our expenses in Q1, they are completely in 
line with our objectives if you'd kind of take apart these two items, so that's 
how I would describe it. Nikesh?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
In terms of brand benefit Ben, I think 
--
 
thank you Patrick, thank you 
Ben. 
The brand question is a very good question. What we've noticed in the past 
let's just say 1.5 year is that people have slowly started coming to the digital 
medium to create extensional the existing brand campaigns like I mentioned 
the Super Bowl ad. P
eople come to YouTube and say I'd like to read certain 
audiences which are only available on digital medium hence we see those 
advertising dollars shifting as an enhancing existing television or media 
campaigns.
 
Now the real fun will began when people star
t doing campaigns exclusively 
on digital to go and help them build brands. That requires us to get ahead of 
the curve and get into the creative process much earlier because usually 
what we end up doing now is we get up 
--
 
we get to the end of the period of
 
process and they just want to extend their brand.
 
So we're working really hard to work with creative ad agencies, the large 
agency groups as well as our advertisers say how can we get ahead of that 
creative process, how can we help you conceive of brand c
ampaigns that 
actually start and end in digital where perhaps you use TV as an extension 
medium as oppose to the other way around.
 
Now I think this is definitely the Holy Grail. This is going to take us a level of 
time to get there, but with things like at
tribution in place with our deals with 
Nielsen and comScore we're beginning to create the compatibility saying 
look the same dollar you spend on television equates to so many dollars on 
digital or vice versa.
 
The fact that we can give them sort of cross me
dia measurement capability, 
we can give them comfort that their dollars are being well spent, even spent 
in digital. We will go long way in making sure that we get them to transition 
from just using traditional media to including digital in their media mix
 
and 
eventually designing campaigns that start and end up digital.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Nikesh. Jamie, let's go to our next question. Thank you, Ben for 
your question.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JPMo
rgan
 
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two things I wanted to ask. 
First, Patrick, just on the U.S. you had commented on the strength here in 
terms of 14% year
-
over
-
year, but it does look like on a sequential basis we 
saw a little bit more of a D
eSale have been in recent 1Qs. Can you just 
comment if there's any factors there to point out.
 
And then Nikesh, can you just talk about the key drivers of mobile pricing 
going forward. How you think the gap can close with desktop over the 
coming quarters a
nd years. Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
All right. Thanks for 
--
 
Doug, for your questions. So in the case of the U.S. if 
you think about it you have the Q4 to Q1 issues that are typical. And then, 
as we've said before, the network business does skew toward the 
U.S. on a 
relative basis, so network clearly grew slower than site.
 
So that's what really what you see is that mix of the two, but in aggregate, 
right, pretty pleased with the U.S. growth overall. So that was a pretty 
strong quarter. I'm really happy with 
it. Well, let Nikesh answer the mobile 
questions.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah, Doug, I think thank you again for the question. I've had firm belief 
and I continue to hold on to it that I believe in the medium to long term. 
Mobile pricing has to be better than deskto
p pricing. And I think the reason 
-
-
 
the way to think about it is that in mobile you have location and you have 
context of individuals which you don't have on the desktop.
 
And the more you known about the user and their context, the more 
effective advertis
ing you can provide to them. The better the conversion is 
likely to be for a search or any piece of advertising that you do. There's a 
whole bunch of building blocks that need to come into play for us like you 
said to get the gap to close.
 
The good news is
 
a lot of people are spending a lot of time on mobile 
devices. There's a lot of mobile search queries that we get. People are more 
and more focused about what they look for in mobile devices. They are 
closer to intent. They are closer to transaction.
 
You s
ee that there's a lot of friction
-
less ways of paying and converting 
transactions into commerce which is happening but things like instant buy 
etcetera. You're also seeing the lot of advertisers seemed through value of 
making sure that their present and a 
great experience on the mobile 
devices.
 
So part of our challenge has been that if you guys just huge massive 
advertise in the desktop which over the last decade have become better at 
advertising, Understanding, optimization, understanding conversion, 
under
standing truncation.
 
That journey is just beginning for advertisers in the mobile site. They're just 
beginning to understand what it takes for the end user to come transact on 
their website.
 
So like right now we can leave the horse to the water, we can't m
ake it 
drink. But with all the advertisers coming on
-
board and working with us, we 
are actually begging to show them real transactions and asset beings to gain 
traction. I think we begin to see that gap continue to converge.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Thank
s you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks Doug for your question. Jamie let's go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
I'm going to go to next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
 
Ross Sandler 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great. Thanks guys. I had a question on the Google Play App 
Store revenues 
and Nikesh you just mentioned that you guys paid out 300% more revenue 

 
So, I guess, how much is Play contributing to the overall licensing and other 
line, and there is clearly some lines or some items in that
 
line that are not 
growing nearly as fast to get to the current 48% average. So can you talk 
about maybe what's underperforming in that area?
 
And then last question on this topic is, I think if you go back to the infamous 
Andy Rubin slides from the Oracle 
case, the revenue share was around 5% 
for Google Play App Store revenue share, where is that now and is it 
changing as the Android ecosystem gets larger?
 
Patrick Pichette
 


 
if you think of our 
other rev
enue estimates for this quarter, right 

 
first of all its 

 

delighted by the Play business. So 

 

had 

 
I mean, I'm going to bring back everybody to Q1 of 2013.
 
We had a lot of Nexus 4 hardware sales, beca
use we were in stock out in 
Q4. And that in combination with the accounting change of our Play app 
content revenue recognition. Again, remember till Q1 of last year both just 
simply created a bit of tougher year
-
over
-
year comp for this quarter, but 
overall
 
very pleased with all of the kind of big lines of growth in this space.
 
As for the rev share, I mean, obviously, this accounting change kind of goes 
to this 30% rather than the what you would have seen before which would 
have the net and 

 

vulge with the percentages are, that we 
keep going forward.
 

pleased with this line for this quarter.
 
Nikesh Arora
 

us a 
while to get all the capabilities in place around the world in different 
markets, making sure we have all the content we need, we have all the app 
providers we need as well as the we have the payment mechanism. So, we 
really are excited about the Goog
le Play business going forward.
 
Ross Sandler 
-
 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great. Thanks guys.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks. Thanks, Ross. Jamie lets go to our next question.
 
Operator
 
And we will go next to Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark May 
-
 
Citigroup
 
Thanks. A question regardin
g the CPC segmentation for next quarter. Why 
you may not be in a position to provide these specific data points for Q1. I 
was hoping that maybe you could give us directionally how CPCs have 
trended between the owned and network businesses and kind of what 
are 
your expectation is going forward? Thanks.

So, Mark, you will get the information in Q2. What we really wanted to do 
with the recognition as we think about giving more transparency to our 
shareholders, just looking at having exactly as
 
you just mentioned the split 
between kind of our core sites and then the network itself.
 
I think it will be useful for everybody and then, obviously, we will have the 
information going forward.
 
So a lot of insights are going to come out of that and we are
 
very pleased to 
be able to share with you starting next quarter. We've just made this 
decision over the last little while and shared it with the Audit Committee, the 
Board, so just stay tuned for next quarter on it.

There are number o
f dynamics that play into the blended CPC that you've 
called out before property, policy, geo and device among others. Once you 
provide this new layer of transparency, does that really capture the major 
--
 
is it really the property and maybe to some degree
 
policy differences that 
are influencing CPCs between owned and network or will geo and devices 
continue to play a major role in reported CPC, even once you provide this 
extra segmentation?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Well, they all will and if we do 

 
we may 
change just the policies that effect 
network, you will see them much more in transparent way. So in that sense 

 
Whether devices kind of have effects on network versus others, you will 

 
it 
will be much more difficult to se
e. But, clearly, the impacts that are driven 
specifically for network or for sites you will be able to see on a quarter

Thanks. Two questions on the U.K. revenue growth at 11% number and on 
the partner websites at 4%, is there anythin
g you would want to call out 
that has been unusual drags on those growth rates? I think U.K. is the 
lowest we've seen and maybe just lot of large numbers and really successful 
execution of that market. But anything you want to call out for either of 
those 
two revenue streams. Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Well, as I said, well let me start with the U.K. The U.K., look, combination of 
partner mix this quarter, as well as, again, year
-
over
-
year matters a lot and 
we have happen to have a year ago a real revenue fav
orable weather.
 
I mean, people kind of tend to forget it, but last year we had a very strong 
Q1 for the U.K. and the combination of these two things just kind of year
-
over
-
year made the comparison a little tighter for this quarter.
 
As it relates to website
s 

 
partner websites, I covered that a bit earlier. And 


 
I mean, again, you back to last year where network, if you think 
about Ad Exchange, that model change in that model continues to be very, 
very strong.
 
And we will remember again last year that
 
we started the DLA policy change 
in Q1 or maybe it was in Q4, but the impact of the DLA actually takes time 
to flow through.
 
We said that would take multi quarters. So, this has not kind of float over 
completely. So what you have again there is very stron
g on the quarters 
where we want sort of the Ad Exchange and AdMob, but on the flipside of 

ago. But the effects have not fully flowed through, so even in the coming 
quarters yo
u should see a bit of an effect there, but, overall, pretty pleased 
with actually these results, Mark.

Thank you. I have two questions. First, in the last eight quarters headcount 
has grown significantly slower than revenue, but this quarter you hired, I 
think, 2,300 people in the cor
e and headcount grew its revenues. Was this 
change in hiring rate mostly because of acquisitions and marginally what 
prevents you from hiring 2,300 people a quarter or even more as the 
business grows?
 
And secondly, Patrick, in the spirit of giving more tra
nsparency to 
shareholders, can you give us some color on what has driven such a 
sustained increase in CapEx over the last four quarters?
 
Because, I 

 

buying data center sites in advance of demand a
nd if this is the case can we 
infer that CapEx will revert to historical levels. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Carlos for both of these questions. So, to the headcount 
question, I think, you've basically nailed it intuitively, which is, the 
acquis
ition of Nest 

 
the acquisitions this quarter had a quite a bit of people 
impact on this number. Or kind of if you think of our organic numbers, have 
actually not changed in any material way.
 
So it just happened, you know, you buy Nest and it comes with a 
lot of 
people. We also had, you remember, the acquisition of DeepMind and few 
others. So for us we had the double hitter of having the opportunity to 
continue to attract people on an organic basis to our processes and these 
few acquisitions kind of moved t
he needle quite a bit for us this quarter.
 
As it relates to CapEx, listen, you are right that we 

 
and I've mentioned this 
in the last couple of quarters, where we have 

 
and just a reminder to 
everybody, if you think of the CapEx categories, right, data c
enters first, and 

of like the hierarchy of needs.
 
And in the case of data center construction, we have found that the option 
value of having more capacity on standby and avail
able to us to grow versus 
not having it is actually a real strategy issue for the company and in that 
sense if for whatever reason we continue 

 
we had a spike in demand that 
was really pronounced and sustained for a couple of quarters and we did not 
have 
the capacity, it would be a real issue strategically for us, relative to the 
quite low cost of having the infrastructure in place.
 

view of long
-
term. So from that 

mindset we are applying and we've always said that CapEx was lumpy, so 
you have a good manifestation of it right now, right here. So thank you for 
you those two questions, Carlos.

believe that they can actually buil

Great. I have three quick things. Did Enhanced Campaigns which you rolled 
out over the summer, impact Q4 and do you see some more benefits coming 
this year?
 
Second, on PLAs, we think you had very good success in the U.S. in Q4,
 
did 
that 

 
does that, do you still have some benefits to come from that as you 
roll that out in Europe. How are you looking at the timing there versus how 
you rolled that out in the U.S.?
 
And finally in the first quarter, maybe you can call out some speci
fic verticals 
that might have strong or weak for you. Thank you.
 
Nikesh Arora
 

detail in terms of precise impacts of any individual products that we have. 
But, Enhanced 

them both for process reasons as well as the reason that consumers are 
going from screen to screen as well as advertisers need to advertise across 
multiple screens.
 
So from that perspective Enhance




 
In terms of PLAs,
 


shopping campaign effort that we have. PLA is working for us and its sort of 
working from multiple perspectives.
 
It 
is providing users the detailed information that they need when they are 
declaring intent and saying and I would like to search for particular product, 

 
So it is working. We are going to roll that out one, separate time a
round the 
world. I cannot comment on the timing exactly. But I think both of those 
things are having a positive impact in our minds to everything we are doing 
around here.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Just to close on this, just a few verticals here. I mean, again, completely 
reflecting the economy around us. If you go to 

 
automobile has been quite 
strong across the world. Travel, actually quite strong in the U.S., so in the 
U.K. as well as in the rest
 
of the world, a little bit less in the U.S, but just to 
give you a sense of. And then real estate, clearly, in the U.S. has been a 
strong vertical as well as in the U.K, so, again, a good reflection of the 
economy there, Justin.
 
So, Google Trends, I alway
s encourage people to go and checkout Google 
Trends as well because they continue to give good insights as to what's 
going on in the economy which would mirror in terms of verticals.

Thanks for taking the question guys. So two ones. One for Nikesh. Nikesh, I 
would love to get your view o
n sort of your view of the travel industry. Sort 
of how are you approaching that industry as a participant from an economy 
basis in that industry, both the marketing funnel and potentially the booking 

lately about the way in 
which you guys might approach that industry vertical.
 
And then second, Patrick for you. Maybe taking a stab at the one
-
time 
expenses from a different approach, when we look at the model, if you take 
your comments before about sort o
f smoothing out the expenses we saw in 
the back part of the year and even year
-
over
-
year, it appears that one
-
time 
expenses might have been about 50 basis point to 100 basis point impact on 
each of those two lines which would have sort of brought the blend
ed 
number back up to sort of somewhere between 75 basis point to 150 basis 
points on margins. But just want to take a stab at that from a different 
direction just to quantify it. Thanks guys.
 
Nikesh Arora
 

y talking about pulling up 
the article which recently 
--
 
were Darren Huston talked about the 

endorsement that all our efforts in the last many years in rather travel 
industry are a
ctually working.
 
They see tremendous value in our ability to help them bring more travelers 
to their sites and for them to help convert them into a real transaction. So 
whatever we are doing is working.
 
I think I am expecting 

 
suspecting that the comments
 
we are talking about 
is our continued efforts in providing more and more detailed information 
when people do searches. And as we've talked in the past before that 

evolving the results
 
at Google, whether its knowledge cards or Google Now 
all the things that we do towards giving them more and more precise 
answers, in which case sometimes we are required to go work with various 
industries to get the underlying data to surface it when the 
users are looking 
as opposed to send them to other sites where they have to go through that 
search process again.
 
So I think you can expect us to continue do that. But our intent there is to 

top or 
mobile devices. Accordingly, we also working together with the advertisers 
to provide them various advertising opportunities which allow them to work 
effectively with the end
-
user and provide them the answers that they are 
looking for or perhaps in 
this case the ticket or the hotel booking that they 
are looking for.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Great. And then on my side, Eric, look, as I said in my earlier comment, our 
Q1 expenses were completely in line with our objectives and there is always 
seasonality.
 
As y
ou've noticed, from Q4 to Q1 there is always 

 
we spend less on 

right, we would have been in line with the objectives we've set for ourselves. 
So these one
-
time costs were genuine

-
time.
 
And 

 
I mean, when you acquire Nest for bit over $3 billion, there is just a 

the issue there. So, I would go back to your instinct of at le
ast kind of we 
should be roughly in line with what our expectations where and they 

 

why the nature of truly extraordinary items. So thanks for that question.

attributions for a moment? Given aspects attribution and I think 
you guys 
are doing a great job on the cross screen attribution and taking advantage of 
your ubiquitous login across different platforms and Enhanced Campaigns.
 

versus offline attribut
ion for those types of marketers, particularly brand 
advertisers, supermarket advertisers, the 30,000 SKUs and those retail 

-

search opportunity. How are you helping them close the gap bet
ween their 
online activity and offline sales? Thanks very much.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks Peter. Thanks again for the question. I think as you rightfully pointed 
out the attribution story on the advertising side is kind of becoming clearer 
as we partner with Nie
lsen and comScore, and adopted some of the 
mechanisms that traditional media has used to create the comparability 
between traditional and internet media.
 
I think you identity a good challenge which is that how do we bridge the gap 
between online commerce a
nd offline commerce and relate that to 
advertising opportunity, i.e. when we sell search, we sell traffic to different 
people, how do we convince them, how do we make them realize that that 

o results in 
offline sales at stores and how do we encourage that activity.
 
So over the last many years around the world we have run specific studies, 
working with various advertisers which are called online to store studies 
where we actually try and measu
re what online activity created by them 
took to control group's results in more foot traffic in their particular stores 
and certain reasons about. And we've pretty much had very good results 
across the board.
 
I can't detail specifics right now because they
 
are all specific to individual 
advertisers who we work with. But we do understand that opportunity and 
the problem and we work specifically with third
-
party research teams to 
work on figuring out how do we keep showing the online to store efficacy. 
And th
ere are other products as you can see where we start doing 
conversion, we start looking at things like Google Shopping which also helps 
us in those areas.

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to an earlier question 
there was 

 
y
ou responded about the building blocks that were needed in 
order to get mobile pricing, mobile CPCs to convert to desktop.
 
I was just wondering if you could share with us kind of specifically what you 
think those building blocks are that need to happen ove
r the medium to 
long
-
term as you said to see that conversions occur. Thank you.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Of course, thanks Heather for the question. I mean, look, there were some 
very simple things and there are some complicated things. The simple things 
are, we will 
make sure that there is payment enablement for users.
 
So i.e. users have a mechanism that allows them to pay with lowest amount 

to enter payment information on a very small screen
 
where you are trying to 
conduct the transaction. So that enablement is happening across the 
industry, across multiple payment platforms.
 
There is also the need that when people search for some things they can get 
quickly down to the information and they d

sites, because people are more keen on declaring intent to mobile devices 
than going and searching multiple websites and trying to figure out what 
they are trying to do.
 
And that intent could be in the form of restaurant, could
 
be in the form of a 
taxi, could be in the form of them looking for individual product. And you are 
beginning to see apps, you are beginning to see solutions on search that 
allow you to get to that granularity of information.
 
Of course, there is a big buil
ding block which is getting all the people out 
there which shows the advertisers effectively in this case the merchants who 
actually have to have experience in the mobile site which are simpler to 
execute on.
 

le websites and it's more 
own risk than their desktop sites because they've been spending a decade 

optimizing mobile experience, in some cases not believing that people want 
to transac
t with them in a mobile device and some cases they are just slow 
and they are just slowly diverting resources from desktop to mobile.
 
So, if you take all those things and take the notion that we need to keep sort 
of working hard towards getting these build
ing blocks in place, I think 
there's a finite time where these building blocks will come into plays.
 
And as they keep coming into plays, you will see or as we talked about 
earlier, perhaps the conversion will happen between pricing in mobile 
desktop. But t
here's a whole bunch of other issues, I think but those are the 
big things that we need to think of right there.

Great thanks. I wanted to ask you a question on the cloud platform. Since 
this is obviously a huge revenue opportunity for you and fir
st
-
off if you could 
put context around the impact of this business on CapEx and OpEx, 
particularly on the infrastructure of the service part of the business?
 
And then secondly, if you could talk about how you're planning to 
differentiate the service, is it
 
really about pricing or is it by tying in the 
software and platform as a service offering, if you could touch on that? 
Thanks very much.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I can cover the first part and then I'll let Nikesh cover the second. Look 
we're very comfortable wit
h our cost structure. In light of Google 
efficiencies, economies of scale, our vertical integration from data center to 
chip 
--
 
to servers, to software. I mean we really have 
--
 
we believe we have 
absolute unique position from a cost structure perspective 
and therefore, 
from a margin perspective makes us very, very comfortable.
 
In terms of differentiation, I'll just let Nikesh jump in here.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think Colin 
--
 
thank you again for the question. The important part to at 
least acknowledge in the spac
e of cloud computing is we think that it's very, 
very, very early days. I mean if you think about the potential scope and 
scale of what this opportunity is, that's pretty much every business which is 
going to be around for the long
-
term has to operate in t
he cloud.
 
There's no efficiency compared to the efficiency of the cloud, but in 
compared to owning your own infrastructure running it by yourself. So, this 

shift one at a time. And
 
if you look at the opportunities out there and the 
options, there's very few options.
 
So, there's a lot of room for all of us to have a great time for many, many, 
many years before we start worrying about differentiation and why my sort 
of thing is better
 
than yours.
 
So, right now, the key is to be able to work with the companies out there, 
the enterprise customers out there to get them to shift on the legacy 
systems, get on to the cloud and realize that Google has been working in the 
cloud for more than a
 
decade, because we have been running one of the 
largest cloud computing platforms in the world in the public space. And we 
have all of the expertise and skills that are required to be able to serve these 
enterprises and get them off their current legacy s
ystem onto the cloud.
 
So, our effort is really trying to work with each of these third
-
party partners, 
trying to get them off the legacy systems onto our cloud. I don't think the 
challenge right now is the need to differentiate. I think our biggest 
differe
ntiator is we have the most experience in the space.

Jord

Morgan Stanley
 
Hi, thank you for taking the question. Actually two if I may. A couple of big 
picture questions, I think for Nikesh. The first is I think there's an ongoing 
debate about whether mobile web or mobile app is going to win and what 
the implications are for various businesses, Google included?
 
And I'm just curious to get your view on whether you think one will win over 
the other and then whether it matters for Google?
 
And then the second is when you look at Google's share of global 
ad
vertising, you're coming up on about 10% of total, but when you look at 
your business in the U.K., you're north of 20% of total.
 
So, when you think about your global businesses as economies start to 
mature, do you think the U.K. is a fair proxy for thinkin
g about your 
business globally or are there other factors that you think may prevent you 
from getting to that type of scale globally.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I guess let me answer the second question first Jordan, because I'm 
standing here Patrick is looking at me 
asking the same question. I think the 
way to think about it is that we have 10% by some metric depending on 
what we believe the total is.
 
As per your metric, we have 10% of the total advertising sort of money. And 
the U.K. we have 20%. That just tells me t
here's 90% more opportunity 
around the world and 80% more opportunity in the U.K.
 
So, we're not going to constrain our thinking in terms of what believe is a 
stable state. Our aspiration is to be able to serve every advertiser in the 
long
-
term and our aspi
ration is that 
--
 
our hope is that every piece of 
advertising becomes digital advertising.
 
The question is how much of that are we able to provide through our 
technology platforms, how much are we able to provide through our own 
sort of properties and how 
much do we partner with others to provide on 
their network.
 
So, I guess I'm trying to tell you we don't constrain ourselves and our 
thinking. I'm not trying to be arrogant, say we want 100%, but we like more 
than what we have in every market out there.
 
In 
terms of your question around the mobile web and mobile search, that is 
a tough question and that is a very involved question and I think the 
approach 
--
 
the best way to think about it is that we're trying to make sure 
we can make both of them effective fo
r the end
-
user and make them both 
work, because we're not about to try and pick winners.
 
Right now, you can see that people spend as much time on mobile devices 
--
 
more time mobile devices they are beginning to spend on the desktop and 
they are spending th
e time across the mobile web as well as mobile app 
landscape.
 
We're participating in both those ecosystems, whether it's somewhere placed 
on the app front, whether it's through our browser
-
based search properties 
or through our app
-
based search properties.
 
So, we're participating across 
the Board and I think at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to ease
-
of
-
use and consumer choice.

Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if you don't mind. 
The first is on the revenue side, can you talk a little bit 
--
 
can you maybe 
giv
e us an update about the breakout of YouTube versus DoubleClick 
revenues, where are those today and where could they be over time?
 
And then on the cost side, Patrick could you just walk us through just how 
you think about the ROI on capital? We get a lot o
f questions from investors 
asking about spending, could you maybe tell us more about the thought 
process and how the company looks at the ROIC of capital going forward? 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay, well Robert, let's start with the last one first and 
then we'll go back to 
revenue. ROI clearly we have 
--
 
we always look at capital intensity. The fact 
that we're investing quite a bit in CapEx right now is a real tribute to kind of 
the potential and the optimism we have about our businesses going forward.
 
Most of our core businesses if you think of YouTube or advertising or search 
are not that capital
-
intensive relative to other areas that we have such as for 
example, Google Fiber, if you think of the access portion right which is much 
more traditional CapE
x.
 
For each of these areas, we actually track and make sure that we have good 
returns and we have a capital efficient. So even though an area that take the 
advertising business that we run, even though you could argue that it's 
phenomenally good on return 
on capital, the questions that we will ask 
internally is okay so if the utilization rate is X on our machines on this 
business, right, why can't it be X plus something?
 
So, even though we have already good return on capital in these areas, we 
continue to a
lways push the envelope to make sure that our capital 
efficiency continues to be better and better on a year
-
to
-
year basis and then 
across a portfolio, every area has some capital kind of targets to make sure 
that we're driving for value.
 
Finally, there's 
a number of areas if you think of take the newer stuff like 
Loon, for example. In those cases, you test through the hurdles that we kind 
of we seed capital to the Loon team as they hid their hurdles and they kind 
of earned their right to the next cost for 
funding.
 
And in doing so, right, we continue to always have the business case in mind 
that says here is why this continues to make sense to fund and invest and 
with an ROIC or value in mind for the long
-
term, but in the short
-
term, it's 
really kind of deli
very of milestones on very specific engineers objectives 
that actually gives them the next round of funding.
 
So, Robert as you can see, given the portfolio of mature stuff we have and 
growing areas as well as kind of much more R&D and innovation at the ear
ly 
stages, right, we just need to have a basket of tools to actually manage the 
concept of ROIC or ROI on each of them. And that's what we do. It's not 
rocket science; it just requires a lot of discipline on our part.
 
On the revenue side, look, we don't br
eak out DoubleClick or YouTube. I can 
just tell you as I mentioned a bit earlier; we're really pleased with our 
network revenue in the kind of AdMob, AdExchange. Many of our areas 
continue to grow very well and we're very, very pleased by these 
investments
 
and clearly continue to be very pleased with YouTube as 
mentioned

Yesterday you announced an offline conversion tracking plan and program 
with Datalogic. Is that something potentially the whole online to offline 
tracking that could have a positive impact on CPCs? And separately any 
updates on how you think about
 
Fiber longer term? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay, so why don't I take the last portion and then Nikesh may have views 
on this data conversion plan.
 
On Fiber look, you've heard our announcement earlier this quarter where 
we're working with 34 cities and lo
oking for working with these 
municipalities, they've indicated to us they are really excited about, they 
kind of self
-
selected to be really excited about getting Fiber and the next 
generation of access.
 
So, right now, we're basically working directly with 
them to look if we have 
the right conditions to actually go to the next stage which would be the 
build. So, very excited about it. I think that it's a really good sign of things 
to come in access in general.
 
I think that everybody now in the industry is ta
lking about the gig. It's 
becoming the standard and we're absolutely thrilled for all of the users out 
there that can think in one day they will get a gigabit of symmetrical internet 
at reasonable price. So, stay tuned on the next part of the chapter, but 
really excited to work with these communities. And Nikesh maybe you want 
to talk about
--
?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah. Thank you, Gene. I mean as I mentioned earlier and the question 
earlier from 
--
 
I think it was Heather that the online to offline conversions 
are r
eally important opportunity where it's important for offline merchants to 
be able to understand what results they get from their online activity.
 
And some of the experiments that we talked about required partnerships of 
third
-
party data providers to unders
tand how that happens and I think 
Datalogic is one of those things, which we're looking out to see how we can 
help quantify the opportunity and quantify the answer for our offline 
partners. It's just one of those things that we're doing.

Alpha
bet, Inc.
 
Thank you. Our revenue of $26.1 billion in the fourth quarter underscores 
the continued excellent performance of our businesses globally. For the 
fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 24% in constant currency 
versus 4Q 2015, notwithstandi
ng a challenging year
-
on
-
year comparison. 
Advertising revenue growth was driven by Mobile Search with ongoing 
strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in 
other revenues from hardware, Play and Cloud.
 
Our outline for today's call
 
is first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated 
basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I'll focus on year
-
over
-
year changes in our results. You can find quarterly comparisons in the 
earnings release. Second, I'll review the results f
or Google and then Other 
Bets. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of the full
-
year results and our 
outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the 
quarter, after which we will take questions.
 
Let me start with a summary of
 
Alphabet's consolidated financial 
performance for the quarter. Total revenue was $26.1 billion, up 22% year
-
over
-
year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year
-
over
-
year of $202 million or $15 million after the benefit of our hedging 
pr
ogram. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenue 
grew 24% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business 
around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 24% year
-
over
-
year to $12.7 billion. 
U.K. revenue w
as up 7% year
-
over
-
year to $2.1 billion, reflecting the 
continued weakness of the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX 
terms, the U.K. grew 21% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Rest of world revenue was up 24% versus last year to $11.3 billion. In fixed 
FX term
s, revenues were up 26% year
-
over
-
year. GAAP other cost of 
revenues was $5.8 billion, up 41% year
-
over
-
year. Non
-
GAAP other cost of 
revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by 
Google
-
related expenses; specifically, costs associate
d with operating our 
data centers including depreciation and content acquisition costs primarily 
for YouTube as well as hardware.
 
The impact of our Q4 hardware launches is reflected in both revenues and 
cost of revenues. However, it's important to note the
 
cost of revenues was 
also affected by approximately $320 million of one
-
time charges related to 
equipment and another adjustments, which were unrelated to hardware.
 
GAAP operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 13% year
-
over
-
year. Non
-
GAAP 
operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year
-
over
-
year. Year
-
on
-
year comparisons in part reflect the impact of the 
expenses from project milestones and Other Bets in 4Q 2015 that we 
discussed last year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6.6 billi
on, up 
23% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Non
-
GAAP operating 
income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 
33%. Stock
-
based compensation totaled $1.8 billion, up 29% year
-
over
-
year. Headcount at the end of the 
quarter was just over 72,000, up 2,100 
people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of 
new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in 
priority areas such as Cloud including the addition of employees from o
ur 
Apigee acquisition.
 
Other income and expense was $218 million. We provide more detail on the 
line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate 
was 22% for the fourth quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings 
and certai
n discrete items affecting our U.S. rate. Our effective tax rate for 
the full year 2016 was 19%. Net income was $5.3 billion on a GAAP basis 
and $6.6 billion on a non
-
GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.56 
on a GAAP basis and $9.36 on a non
-
GAAP
 
basis.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $3.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.4 billion with free cash flow of 
$6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of 
$86.3 billion of which 
approximately $52 billion or 61% is held overseas.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google 
segment. Revenue was $25.8 billion, up 22% year
-
over
-
year which includes 
the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google S
ites revenue was 
$18 billion in the quarter, up 20% year
-
over
-
year. Year
-
on
-
year growth 
reflects strength in Mobile Search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a 
very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView 
including buying
 
on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $4.4 
billion, up 7% year
-
on
-
year reflecting the ongoing strong growth of 
programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses.
 
Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year
-
over
-
year 
with 
strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud. Finally, we 
continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price 
and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details 
in our earnings press release.
 
Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements. 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.8 billion or 22% of total advertising 
revenue and up 20% year
-
over
-
year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a 
percentage of Sites revenue, as we
ll as network TAC as a percentage of 
network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely 
Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a 
percentage of total advertising revenues was up as a result of an increase in 
t
he Sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile which was partially offset by 
a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites which carries lower TAC. 
Operating income excluding SBC was $9.5 billion, up 19% versus last year 
for an operating margin of 3
7%. Google's stock
-
based compensation totaled 
$1.7 billion for the quarter, up 29% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.9 billion, up 17% 
versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the 
quarter was 
$2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, 
facilities, and data center construction.
 
Turning to Other Bets, I'll cover results for the full year 2016 because it's 
most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time 
h
orizon as discussed previously. Results for the quarter are in our earnings 
release.
 
For the full year 2016, Other Bets revenue was $809 million, up 82% versus 
2015, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss 
excluding SBC was $2.9 billi
on for the full year 2016, a slight decline from 
2015. Including the impact of SBC, the operating loss was $3.6 billion for 
the full year, an increase of 4% over 2015.
 
Other Bets accrued CapEx was $1.4 billion for the full year 2016, up 63% 
over 2015. Befo
re I move to my conclusion, I'll quickly cover some specific 
changes to our past practices.
 
First, we are making changes to our non
-
GAAP reporting. SBC has always 
been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that 
aligns their interests wi
th those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash 
expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because 
SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. 
Starting with our first quarter results for 
2017, we will no longer regularly 
exclude stock
-
based compensation expense from non
-
GAAP results. Noncash 
stock
-
based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow 
statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to 
non
-
GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.
 
Second, we are shifting the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle for 
employees to the first quarter of every year. The next full year equity 
refresh will occur in the first quarter of 2018. Be
cause the last full employee 
equity refresh occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we are providing 
employees with a one
-
time half grant in the first quarter of 2017. Overall, 
total SBC for 2017 will be roughly the same as it would have been had we 
maintai
ned a Q3 refresh cycle. However, given the shift in refresh timing, 
there will not be the historical seasonal increase in SBC in Q3 and Q4. We do 
not plan any changes to our senior executives' equity refresh, which occurs 
every two years with an excellent 
plan for 2018.
 
Third, to hedge our non
-
U.S. dollar earnings, we are moving from using 
options
-
only to using primarily forwards. We believe they will be a more 
effective way to hedge earnings. We intend to continue to use options 
selectively.
 
We 
continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth provides the 
best insight into underlying trends by isolating the impact of currency 
movements on revenue. We will continue to provide constant currency 
results for consolidated revenues, as well as
 
for revenues by geography. This 
will give you a view into the effects of currency movements on our revenue.
 
Turning now to our full
-
year 2016 performance and outlook. 2016 was 
simply a great year for us. Our extraordinarily talented employees worked 
very 
hard and successfully for our users around the globe. That commitment 
is reflected in the company's exceptional financial results. For the full year 
2016, consolidated revenue grew 20% and excluding the impact of currency 
movements grew 24%. GAAP operating
 
income was up 23%. This 
performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our 
success in Mobile Search, YouTube and programmatic advertising, each of 
which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited 
about the si
zable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.
 
Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue 
streams within Google over the medium and long
-
term. In 2016, our other 
revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis, reflecting the g
rowth in our Play, 
hardware and Cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for 
these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non
-
advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our Cloud and 
hardware businesses as well a
s our newer non
-
ad revenue sources for 
YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for 
Google in the next several years. We're also investing significantly in the 
machine learning capabilities and next
-
generation computing infras
tructure 
that will propel Google's growth over the longer
-
term.
 
For our Other Bets, we continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of 
investment appropriate to their individual execution paths. A couple of our 
recent announcements demonstrate our approach
 
here.
 
First, in December, Waymo graduated into a standalone business within 
Other Bets. We did this because Waymo achieved agreed thresholds on the 
path to commercialization in its technical and business model. Waymo 
continues to excel at safety, has begu
n putting its new Chrysler Pacifica 
minivans on the road and is continuing to drive down hardware costs.
 
Nest delivered an outstanding performance this holiday season with sales of 
key products more than doubling over the two weeks including Black Friday 
a
nd Cyber Monday.
 
And just this morning, Verily announced that Temasek has agreed to invest 
$800 million for a minority stake in the company. Temasek's extensive 
experience with life sciences and healthcare companies and deep 
understanding of Asian markets 
make it a valuable long
-
term partner for 
Verily.
 
The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the 
Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully 
across the opportunities that we see. We remain committ
ed to managing for 
long
-
term revenue and EPS growth for dollars rather than margin targets, 
while exercising careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of 
investment.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thanks, Ruth. 
2016 was a great year for Google, and 2017 is shaping up to 
be even more exciting. This quarter was about the business firing on all 
cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment.
 
Today, I'm going to talk about three things. Fir
st, the key trend powering 
Google today, machine learning and how it's improving our products and 
creating lots of opportunities. In particular, how it's underpinning our core 
mission of providing access to information for everyone, especially via the 
Goog
le Assistant, which is off to a great start.
 
Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and 
hardware, where we are making great progress. And third, I'll discuss the 
great trends we are seeing across the platforms; our vibrant c
omputing 
platforms, Android, Chrome and Daydream, strong momentum in Google 
Play, as well as our thriving advertising platform.
 
First, machine learning and access to information. As I've shared before, 
computing is moving from a mobile
-
first to AI
-
first wi
th more universal 
ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all 
made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning. 2016 
was the year that this became central to who we are as a company and the 
products that we b
uilt. We had more than 350 launches powered by machine 
learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play.
 
You've heard lots of these examples; easier e
-
mail replies and inbox, better 
YouTube recommendations, the incredible cameras on our P
ixel phones, and 
smarter bidding for advertisers in AdWords.
 
A centerpiece of our machine learning efforts is the Google Assistant which 
allows users to have a natural conversation with Google to help them get 
things done across their experience. It's off 
to a great start. You can easily 
ask it to navigate home, tell you about your schedule for the day, or even 
play trivia. We reached a milestone last month with our announcement of 
the Assistant developer platform called Actions on Google. It gives 
develope
rs like Uber, SongPop and Headspace the opportunity to build 
conversation actions for Google Home, and we'll expand it even further this 
year. The Assistant is baked into our smart messaging app, Allo, which we 
expanded this quarter in languages like Hindi
, Brazilian Portuguese and 
Japanese.
 
This quarter, using neural machine translation, we have improved our 
translation ability more in one single leap than all our improvements over 
the last 10 years combined. We'll be rolling neural machine translation out
 
across to more than 100 languages available in Google Translate in 2017 
and also for all of our Cloud customers through the Google Cloud Translation 
API.
 
And Google Photos, which as you know has machine learning at its heart, 
continues to grow in populari
ty. Last quarter, we launched PhotoScan, which 
helps you digitize all of those old printed photos that are probably stored in a 
shoebox in your closet, to keep them safe, organized and shareable. In 
February, we are hosting a summit where our machine learn
ing team and 
other experts will discuss the future of the TensorFlow open
-
source initiative 
and share some of their latest demos.
 
Now, I want to spend some time talking about three big bets, YouTube, 
Cloud and hardware. First, YouTube, which remains the pr
emier destination 
for online video globally and is seeing tremendous growth. At the heart of 
YouTube's success is its booming community of creators. Every single day, 
over 1,000 creators reached the milestone of having 1,000 channel 
subscribers. We are foc
used on two main areas of investment. First, creating 
the best video experience that's fast, personalized, searchable, and that just 
works. We have rolled out many new features to the platform like 360
-
degree videos, mobile live streams, and support for vi
deos and virtual 
reality. In regions with limited connectivity, we introduced YouTube Go, 
which has transparency and control of data usage.
 
Second, we are focused on delivering content that gives fans exactly what 
they want through offerings like YouTube M
usic, YouTube Kids and YouTube 
Red. We have 27 originals, pairing some of the most popular YouTube 
creators with the biggest directors and producers in Hollywood. One of our 
new originals called This Is Everything, Gigi Gorgeous about the courageous 
journe
y of a transgender YouTube star, officially premiered at Sundance just 
a few days ago. The popularity of this original content has been successful in 
driving new subscribers and retaining existing ones, and we'll do more in 
2017.
 
Second, our Cloud business
 
is on a terrific upswing. In 2016, we made huge 
strides building out our product offerings across all areas of Google Cloud 
Platform or GCP. We routinely hear from customers that we have now 
moved well beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated
 
offerings 
in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, 
tools for application development, and the ability to create connected 
business platforms, leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee. Our product 
advancements across
 
all of GCP, in addition to our increased focus on how 
we work with the enterprise customers, have enabled us to accelerate 
growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current 
customers to substantially expand their use of GCP.
 
We have 
also enjoyed strong growth with G Suite, our cloud
-
based 
collaboration and productivity applications. G Suite achieved a significant 
new customer milestone last quarter. More than 3 million paying businesses 
are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and
 
securely in the cloud. Our 
increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled 
security and data protection we can provide by offering an entirely cloud
-
based solution that enables an extremely strong level of production. For both 
GCP 
and G Suite, expanding our partner ecosystem continues to be a big 
focus. And last quarter, the team announced new alliances including Intel, 
Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. Our customers and partners are 
appreciating Google Cloud's dramatically ac
celerated pace of product rollout, 
as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations. We look 
forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our 
next annual Next user conference in March.
 
Third, hardware. We introduced
 
a new family of beautiful hardware devices 
in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel 
phone, which featured a Google Assistant built in. We are thrilled with the 
reception as well as the really happy customers we saw over the hol
iday 
season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many 
people opened on Christmas morning. We are committed to this for the 
long
-
term as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to 
people. The early signs are promis
ing and you can expect us to see us 
expand our offerings thoughtfully. We will also continue working closely with 
our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for our users.
 
So those are three of our biggest bets. We are also continuing to push th
e 
platforms that are powering our business and our partners' businesses. First, 
our computing platforms; and second, our advertising platforms. Building 
powerful open platforms has always been core to Google and our platforms 
like Android, Chrome and Daydr
eam are creating more innovation, more 
choice for users and more opportunities for partners. This was on full display 
at the CES show. There we saw partners like NVIDIA and AirTV introduce 
new media players based on Android TV. And Casio and New Balance sh
ared 
their latest Android Wear smartwatches.
 
We also worked closely with Samsung on a new generation of Chromebooks 
called the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus, which are getting great buzz. 
And in VR, we recently worked with partners like Huawei and ASUS a
nd 
others to introduce even more new Daydream
-
ready devices. CES is just a 
start and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these 
platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand
-
in
-
hand with them to 
provide the best experiences for our
 
users.
 
We're also investing in ways to help developers succeed using our platforms. 
Last week, we announced that we are acquiring the Fabric mobile app 
development platform. This will work alongside our Firebase platform to help 
developers build better ap
ps and grow their businesses. Since we launched 
Firebase at I/O, developers have created over 1 million Firebase projects. 
That's incredible momentum. Google Play helps bring our platforms to life on 
mobile and beyond, and it's experiencing great momentum.
 
As a piece of 
trivia, do you know what 2016's top movie was on Google Play? I'll provide 
the answer in a second.
 
Play had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets, as well 
as in emerging markets where user spend grew by more than 70% year

year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. As the 
content hub across our growing platforms, the Play team is working hard to 
help users get the most out of their devices through apps, games and 
premium content.
 
In Q4, the Play Stor
e launched on Daydream, Android apps became available 
on Chromebooks and we announced that the Play Store will soon be coming 
to Android Wear. The platform is also benefiting significantly from machine 
learning. We recently introduced a new Google Play mus
ic experience that 
makes music streaming smarter and easier to use with better 
recommendations and playlists. And the answer to my trivia question, the 
top movie in 2016 was Deadpool.
 
Lastly, I quickly touch on the highlights across our growing advertising 
businesses. I'm so pleased with the terrific partnerships we have continued 
to grow this year. We work incredibly closely and deeply with agencies, 
marketers and publishers worldwide.
 
These relationships owe a lot to the 
hard work of our fantastic business teams around the world. Our mobile 
properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people 
turn when they are actively engaged. They are the primetime in the mobile 
e
ra.
 
We had another successful holiday season where we saw two clear trends. 
First, this was the year that mobile shopping went truly mainstream, with 
shoppers using phones as their door to the store to locate nearby retailers, 
find promotions and compariso
n
-
shopped. We recently introduced promoted 
places in Google Maps, helping advertisers stand out with branded location 
icons, showing promotions and live updates of popular times right when 
someone's looking for it.
 
Gap Inc is one example of a company that 
understands the importance of 
connecting with consumers on mobile devices. In December, they increased 
their U.S. mobile search ad spend with us; and as a result, they saw about 
four times the mapped mobile traffic to their U.S. e
-
commerce sites 
compared t
o December of last year.
 
Second, we saw this season that measurement really matters, and 
advertisers want reliable ways of understanding where their sales and traffic 
are coming from and how their campaigns are working. We saw increased 
use of our popular 
store visits technology over the holiday shopping season, 
helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their 
physical stores. In less than two years, store visits have helped advertisers 
measure over 3 billion store visits globally.
 
No
w, turning to our thriving video ads business, led by YouTube. Marketers 
are seeing terrific success here. Air France used YouTube's TrueView video 
ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around 
the world. By showing engaging vi
deos, highlighting the unique experiences 
of Air France, they saw more than 100 million views throughout the 
campaign.
 
Turner Sports partnered with YouTube and DoubleClick for NBA opening 
night to try a new way to reach fans for the start of the season. We
 
help 
them deliver real
-
time video ads with behind the scenes pregame footage 
uploaded immediately into a YouTube TrueView ad campaign. Thanks to the 
campaign, they were able to reach 19 million more people across the web 
with 17% left in ad recall. Speaki
ng of DoubleClick, many news publishers 
who are using our Accelerated Mobile Pages are now plugging into our Ad 
Exchange to drive revenue. We are thrilled that most publishers are getting 
higher click
-
through rates and effective CPMs with the AMP pages.
 
Be
fore I end, I want to highlight one area that I'm really proud of that 
Google is truly leading the way. As you know, our data centers from 
Oklahoma to Chile, to Finland enable our services to be blazing fast and they 
are what make it possible for Google Ph
otos to offer unlimited storage. But 
to do all this, they use lots of energy. In 2012, we set the long
-
term goal to 
reach 100% renewable energy for our operations. In 2015, we procured 
enough renewable energy to cover 44% of our total and in 2016 we 
increa
sed it to more than 50%. I'm really proud that we'll reach 100% 
renewable energy for global operations in 2017. This is great for the 
environment and with renewable energy costs declining, it's a huge win for 
our business results too.
 
With that, I want to 
thank the Googlers around the world who help make 
this another exciting quarter. Over to you, Ruth.

Great. Thank you. I had a question for Sundar. I was wondering, I wanted to 
focus on the cloud business. When we speak with CIOs about GCP, they 
highlight in many
 
cases the need for Google to improve upon its enterprise 
sales strategy. I'm just wondering if you could share with us the changes 
you've been making in that organization and the goals that you have for the 
cloud business for 2017.

Thanks, Heather. As I said in my opening remarks, I do think we have seen 
tremendous momentum at our partnerships team and how we are 
approaching. There are a lot of new alliances which I talked about. So now 
we have teams dedicated to partnering w
ith GSIs and we have a team 
focused on technology partnerships too. On the GSI front, we announced a 
new alliance with Accenture last September to create industry solutions for a 
number of industries including retail. So for me, I think, overall, everywher
e 
I look at we are establishing a world
-
class enterprise team. Partnerships has 
been a big focus and I've seen progress there.
 
I think as I said in my remarks, overall, 2017 I expect to have a lot of 
momentum because we have moved well beyond the table sta
kes. Now, we 
are really competing on areas which we think we have differentiation. I 
talked about data analytics and machine learning, security and so on. So I 
think we are well
-
positioned. The momentum when we look at the numbers 
internally and as well as
 
the traction we see in competitive situations, I 
definitely think we are going to have a great year and hopefully in the next 
conference coming up, Diane and team will share a lot more details.

Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first for Sundar. Now that you 
have this breadth of device ecosystem out there into the ma
rketplace, 
wanted to know if we get a little bit more color around what your learnings 
are about the adoption of the device ecosystem, how you're thinking about 
the go
-
to
-
market strategy over the medium to long
-
term and how we might 
see sort of an evolutio
n across operating systems? And if I can, maybe one 
for Ruth, you called out a one
-
time charge in 

 
or one
-
time impact on the 
number in the quarter. I wanted to get a little more granularity about what 
went into that one
-
time expense so we could just sort 
of factor that into the 
financials. Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Hey, Eric. I'm assuming when you said the device ecosystem you're talking 
about how our platforms are working at scale. The thing which I get excited 
about is computing is increa
singly moving rather than just one device which 
is a dedicated computing device to being there for users in their context and 
you'll see computing increasingly embedded in many things, and we have a 
comprehensive strategy. We do want 

 
we invest in it for 
the long run. We're 
improving our computing experiences with machine learning. We expect to 
be there for users across a device ecosystem, and we're also building things 
like Google Play to work across all of this so that users can have one 
coherent experie
nce. I think we see great momentum both across our 
partner ecosystem, as well as pushing the cutting edge of the experience 
which is what we strive to do with our own hardware devices. And so I think 
the end
-
to
-
end strategy is working well for us.
 
Ruth Por

Alphabet, Inc.
 
And in terms of, you noted, the one
-
time item, there are really two that I'm 
actually going to call out. One was in cost of revenues, I noted that 
equipment costs were elevated by some one
-
time charges, and so there was 
some pressure th
ere. And then the other item that I noted was with respect 
to our tax rate. I noted that there was slightly elevated tax rate this quarter. 
It's always affected by the geographic mix of results but we did have a 
discrete item that affected the U.S. tax rat
e to make that clear.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your 
line is now open.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. Two questions, please. Again, Ruth, on that $320 million one
-
time 
charge, is there any 
more detail you can provide on that? It seems like a 
relatively sizable amount.
 
And then, Sundar, if you could talk a little bit about Voice Search, 
particularly in the home and in the car, and the importance of getting 
devices out in the marketplace? And 
the challenge I'll throw to you is, it 
looks to me like Google devices are being outsold ten
-
to
-
one or something 
like that in most 

 
in a lot of homes, and it's immaterial now, but it could 
see in five years that there's is a new Voice Search interaction i
nterface and 
it's not Google in the home. That could be a real challenge for the company. 
Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So, on the first one trying to be helpful in giving you dimension and impact 
on cost of sales, but really not much more to add 
there. I think the other 
point is that you're thinking about the hardware business. It was gross 
margin positive. There were just some other variables in there.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And, Mark, on Voice Search, we are really excited about it. I th
ink it's a very 
natural way for users to interact. We think it will be one mode. Users will 
have many different base by which they interact with computing. And for 
voice, as you pointed out, we expect voice to work across many different 
contexts. So we are
 
thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and 
trying to drive that ecosystem that way, and we want Google to be there for 
users when they need it. And even with Google Home, we just launched it in 
Q4. We had a very strong quarter there, and we ar
e going to invest a lot in 
it over 2017. It's very early days. When I look at what it would take to Voice 
Search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural 
language processing comes into play, and I think there's a lot of work ahead 
to 
make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've 
invested in for the very long term, and so I feel very comfortable about how 
this will play out in the future.

Your line is now open.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, you commented on YouTube and 
addressed some of the non
-
advertising revenue streams. I was
 
just hoping 
you could elaborate there a little bit what the goals would be there for your 
users.
 
And then just to follow up on Mark's question on Voice Search, I understand, 
Sundar, it's early, but how do you think about the challenges and 
opportunities f
rom a monetization perspective in Voice? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So on the first question in terms of YouTube, Sundar elaborated on my 
opening comments. We're really pleased with the ongoing strength we have 
there. We talked about on prior call
s. It's largely driven by Video, primarily 
TrueView with a strong contribution from DoubleClick Bid Manager, and we 
are continuing to invest significantly in the business given the importance of 
supporting the ecosystem of content creators through partner 
payments, 
marketing, YouTube Originals, YouTube Spaces. We're broadening the 
platform. We're investing in the requisite infrastructure given machines and 
bandwidth required, and Sundar elaborated on some of the upside we see 
there on the non
-
ad side.
 
And r
eally the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's 
comments is, we've got the non
-
ads momentum here on the YouTube side, 
and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud, which we're 
excited about, and the hardware and investing behind tho
se. So those 
continue to build out the revenue streams as we're looking in the near to 
medium to long term.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And, Doug, I mean, just like Mark's question on Voice Search, I would 
encourage you to think about it as from a user 
standpoint, they are looking 
for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of 
the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the 
Google Assistant, we think about it as an ongoing conversation with our 
use
rs across different contexts. So they may ask a question on voice, later 
when they pick up their phone, they want continuity, so we think of this as 
an end
-
to
-
end thing. And all of this means users engage more with us, more 
with computing and look for more
 
information, and I think the trends we see 
are positive. So we think about it from a long
-
term perspective, and so I see 
more opportunity than challenge when I think about Voice Search.

Thanks very much. Another one on YouTube, if I could. Would it be possible 
to get any sort of metric
s around YouTube Red and how the subscription 
business has been progressing, realizing you're not going to be providing 
that every quarter but that you do occasionally give us some sort of 
benchmarks in the market? Thanks so much.

Well, at this point, we've launched in five countries. We're pleased with the 
early success and it's still early days, it takes a while to build a subscription 
business here. And I'll pass it to Sundar for additional commentary.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, I mean, I think 

 
I would think about it as, we are investing a lot in 
developing this premium experience in a way of YouTube Brand, YouTube 
Music, and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well. You will see us 
invest more, more 
countries, more original content, and we'll bring together 
the experiences we have over the course of this year. So it's even more 
compelling for users. But we are seeing tractions with the rate of signups. 
We're not disclosing specific numbers, but I'm ex
cited at the progress there.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan

Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my que
stions. I have two. The first one, just to go back to 
YouTube, I appreciate the color around the content. I'd be curious to hear 
about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium 
content players to maybe drive even higher engagement an
d an even better 
YouTube experience.
 
And then the second one, if you kind of step back in your Mobile Search 
business and the verticals, the innovation you've had at retail and travel 
with Shopping and Hotel Finder, I guess I'd be curious to hear about whe
re 
you see the biggest potential for more improvements in certain verticals for 
an even more relevant and higher search result experience over the next 
years. Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
On your first question, look, I mean, we think of YouTube 
again as an 
ecosystem. We are trying to connect creators with users, form a community. 
And so, we work hard to bring more premium content. We already work with 
TV networks and their individual shows, whether it's a late
-
night show like 
James Corden or Jimm
y Fallon, afternoon shows like Ellen, sports 
programming like NBA and NFL. For example, sports is one of the most 
popular verticals. We have hundreds of sports partnership in place, and so 
we'll continue to invest that way and drive the premium content the
re.
 
On the second one, we do look at the end
-
to
-
end experience, look at what 
are the kinds of tasks which users are trying to get done. Mobile raises the 
bar if you want to provide those deeper experiences for users. And so, I 
generally think local is a bi
g area. We have strong assets there with Maps, 
and so we think about how we can improve the local experience a lot more 
for users. So for example, within local areas like dining, we work closely with 
our partners to make that better. So we get it at a pret
ty granular level and 
we try to hit all the areas. And so, I think you'll see progress in all these 
areas over the next few years.

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah, just on YouTube, I'd love to hear 
about the pricing and then also about AdMob (44:47). So, is there anything 
you could highlight on
 
ad format? And specifically, we noticed that recently 
you're enabling marketers to target YouTube ads based on search, and so I 
just want to hear about that strategy. And maybe relatedly, the recently 
announced non
-
skippable YouTube ads format. Would love
 
to kind of hear 
about that. Thanks for taking my questions.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, overall, I would say there's been a 

 
been very pleased with how the 
team has been driving innovation in ad formats and ad experiences. I think 
video advertis
ing is in its very early days. We see whenever we (45:32) 
innovation phase, and advertiser response to all these new formats has been 
really positive. So for example a bumper ads are six second video format 
that we launched. It's already being used by thou
sands of accounts, 
including major brands like Universal Pictures and Netflix.
 
On your question around how we think about the experience across screens, 
it's really important to understand users consume YouTube across screens, 
and so they experience consis
tent experience. And similarly, from an 
advertising standpoint, we want that to be thoughtful for users, more 
relevant across screens as well. And so that's the context in which we do 
this. We give users control over that experience. But I do think as part
 
of 
these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their 
YouTube campaigns across devices so they can better understand the impact 
of their marketing campaigns. So I think it's early days, but I think it's the 
right direction, and I think w
e will see good traction from it.

Thanks. I 
have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, just picking 
on the YouTube questions, there was a report that YouTube and CBS had 
agreed on an agreement to distribute CBS on YouTube. Can you talk a bit if 
that has actually happened? And if so, what's t
he opportunity to partner with 
networks and how will that evolve over time?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, I can't comment on any specific discussions, but I said a little bit 
earlier we are constantly working with partners across these areas. We 
work 
very closely with TV networks on their individual shows. It's a big part of the 
YouTube experience. And so you will see us work hard to make these 
partnerships deeper and bring more content to our users. So maybe I'll 
leave it at that.
 
Michael B. Nath
anson

MoffettNathanson LLC
 
Okay. And then for Ruth, you mentioned programmatic drove the network 
members' revenue growth this quarter. If you look at fourth quarter this 
year and last year, there seems to be an acceleration in Q4 and then it 
comes back. 
I wonder what's happening seasonally to that revenue line that 
drives fourth quarter up so much.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Well, as we've talked about on prior calls, there are obviously a number of 
businesses within the network line, and a number of thi
ngs went right this 
quarter. I wouldn't extrapolate from it. As you know, there can be some 
seasonality, and Q1 is typically lower than the fourth quarter.
 
I think the main point is that the programmatic business continues to be a 
strong contributor with s
ignificant growth reflecting the ongoing advertiser 
adoption just given the overall efficiency of programmatic and improved 
targeting and the benefit of inventory growth. And so the story, it's pretty 
much unchanged. We continue to see the growth in progra
mmatic offset by 
declines in the more traditional businesses. And when you're looking at the 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter, we are continuing to see things like the impact of 
policy changes and timing of product launches. But I just think that there 
were a number o
f things that went well this quarter. Q3 was a bit lighter so 
that's been flatter quarter
-
over
-
quarter comparison, but I wouldn't 
extrapolate from this.

es from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche

Lloyd Walmsley

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks. Wondering, Sundar, if you can just give us a sense on the Pixel 
phone hardware opportunity to kind of build direct mobile distribution a
nd 
capture hardware margin, and how you think about that versus the potential 
disruption that having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the 
Android ecosystem? Do you think this is something that could get 
meaningful market share without disr
upting the ecosystem?
 
And then a second follow
-
up related to this would be on the Pixel phones 
with Google Assistant having been built uniquely into the core of the 
experience, is there anything you're learning as the usage of that increases? 
Is it driving
 
a step
-
function, increasing engagement with the 
hardware/software integration? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
Look, I mean, we are in the early days. I think it's really important when you 
work on a platform you have to drive it forward as we've a
lways done by 
putting out the state
-
of
-
the
-
art and I think it especially gets important in the 
vision we have for computing where users are going to use it across many 
different contexts. And so to do that end
-
to
-
end experience, it spans 
devices. So I thin
k it's important for us to work at the intersection of 
hardware, software and services and so that's how we think about it. And I 
think we invest a lot more in our ecosystem and I mentioned earlier, I'm 
incredibly excited at the lineup we have for this yea
r from our partners. So 
we do both and we are very thoughtful about it. I think the scale at which 
we are doing it shows it's working and I'm confident we'll be able to strike 
that balance well.
 
In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how sear
ch works, I 
think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure 
it's working better for users. Our thesis is that as we make it easier for users 
to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing and including 
many modes 
whether they are typing or asking Google a question, we find 
that it overall benefits. And so it will be a long
-
term trend but I think our 
earlier studies (51:44) show that our intuition is right there and so we'll 
continue approaching it that way.

Okay. Thank you. So, Sundar, you called out Google Play growth in 
emerging markets in your prepared remarks. So I thought from a revenue 
size standpoint it would be one of the big bets you would highlight but 

 
so 
I'm wondering how you view your 
own Instant Apps as well as the products 
or their operators to let consumers try apps either in a messenger product or 
on an HTML5 environment? Do these innovations present an opportunity or a 
challenge for you at the Play franchise?
 
And secondarily, it se
ems that the recurring theme in your prepared remarks 
is how AI is making the consumer products better. Is there anything you can 
share with us as to how it may be making monetization better? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
So, on Google Play, fo
r me what makes it work well is just with the vision of 
computing we have been talking about how it works across contexts. You 
need an ecosystem. You need an apps and services ecosystem to work 
cohesively across all of this and that's what I like about how
 
we are 
approaching Google Play and you saw us this quarter 

 
see Google Play work 
beyond Android phones. They're coming to Chromebooks. They work in 
Daydream, they work in Android Wear and so it's an end
-
to
-
end thing which 
works well. And that's the most 
important thing so that as a user, you know 
whether you're engaging with a game or a TV show that you can reliably get 
it across your computing experiences. And we'll adapt and I think we will 
drive innovation simply to go where what's right for users and 
developers 
and so be it Instant Apps or driving better HTML5 experiences. We invest in 
all that and I think we'll move it all forward.
 
On your second question about how machine learning and AI is improving 
our monetization, it definitely, I mean, just like
 
we had many, many 
launches last year which involve machine learning being incorporated across 
Google including our monetization products. Our monetization teams at 
Google have always been at the cutting edge of what I would call as 
machine learning techni
ques from early days on. And so they are doing it. It 
is early days now but I think we already have really new insights and so we'll 
bake it in over the course of the year.

Hi. Just maybe another question on YouTube. Can you expound a decision 
this quarter to 
remove third
-
party cookie and Pixel activity? It looks as 
though you're favoring something much more identity
-
based and maybe you 
could just think through the 

 
or explain a bit about the impetus there and 
maybe the trade
-
offs for marketers, that would be 
great. Thank you very 
much.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
I spoke about it a bit earlier, but I think it's important that we evolve all of 
this from a user
-
centric standpoint, and users have an identity, they have 
preferences. And so for example, think ab
out it from a user standpoint. If 
they don't like one particular ad or they don't want to see an ad from a 
particular advertiser. They want it to work across their experience, across 
their cross
-
device experience. So we think about it that way, and so we a
re 
working towards a long
-
term experience that's right for users and which I 
think will make sense for advertisers reaching users too. So I think we are 
evolving it jointly and thoughtfully, giving users control. And I think that's 
the right way to approac
h it over time.

Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of 
Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.

Thank you. I'd like to
 
ask first a question about ad coverage and click rates. 
Maybe just your thoughts on potential to increase ad coverage now that you 
have a fourth link. Is there still room to help ad clicks with coverage 
increases? And just as you think out to this year, h
ow do you feel about the 
innovation pipeline in ads? Do you think there's a lot more you can still do in 
Search?
 
And then two, housekeeping for you, Ruth. Maybe you could just let us know 
what kind of equipment was written off so we can think about how rec
urring 
that might be, and any comment on the buyback activity in the quarter? 
Thank you.

On our monetization efforts, our teams always have been very thoughtful 
about planning not just for the short
-
term but planning for the 
long
-
term. 
We don't start the year thinking our plan is to increase ad coverage or 
something like that, right? We have many experiments in the pipeline. We 
see how user behavior is evolving and in conjunction with that, we evolve 
our ad experience. So for 
example, as people use mobile, scroll more, it's to 
track the user behavior changes, and we adapt to that in a very, very 
disciplined way.
 
So last year, you saw us maybe increase coverage in a certain way. For 
example, in desktop, we removed ads on the rig
ht
-
hand side, and so we 
take a very holistic approach to these things. For me, I do think we have a 
lot of headroom ahead. I still look at where most of transactions happen and 
how that secular transformation is underway, and so I think we see we have 
a lo
t more headroom left. And Ruth, I'll pass...

And 

 
yeah, in terms of your second question, really not much more to add 
on the first part. In terms of the buyback, we weren't able to commence it in 
the fourth quarter due to tradi
ng restrictions but we do look forward to 
getting back into the market.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Inc. First 
Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the 
conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Ellen West
 
Thank 
you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First 
Quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and 
Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.
 
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forwar
d 
looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long
-
term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses 
and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a 
number of risks and uncertainties t
hat could cause actual results to differ 
materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in 
our Form 10
-
K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be 
placed on any forward
-
looking statements, and they are made bas
ed on 
assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release.
 
As you know,
 
we distribute our earnings release through our Investor 
Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast 
from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.
 
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing strong revenue growth, up 26% 
year
-
on
-
year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding 
performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits 
of innovation and secular g
rowth, with mobile search again leading the way. 
Robust growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic 
business. Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, 
hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of
 
our 
non
-
ads opportunities.
 
Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated 
basis for Alphabet, focusing on year
-
over
-
year changes. Second, I will 
review results for Google and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our 
ear
nings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new 
accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity 
security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I 
review the quarter. I will then conclud
e with our outlook. Sundar will then 
discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your 
questions.
 
Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance 
for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 2
6% year
-
over
-
year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year
-
over
-
year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program.
 
Turning to Alphabet's revenue by geography. You can see that our 
performance was strong agai
n in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.1 
billion, up 20% year
-
over
-
year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% 
year
-
over
-
year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting 
strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues we
re 
$4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency, 
reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other 
America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year
-
over
-
year and up 35% in 
constant currency.
 
On a consolidated
 
basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll 
discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 
39% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by Google
-
rela
ted expenses. The key 
drivers were, first, costs associated with our data centers and other 
operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of 
certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition 
costs primari
ly for YouTube; and finally, hardware related costs.
 
Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year
-
over
-
year, with the 
biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in 
technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses
 
reflects 
advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant.
 
G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors, in 
particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of 
equity security gains, whi
ch were partially offset by the reallocation of 
certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues and the 
benefit of the Uber litigation settlement.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.5 billion. The quarter
-
on
-
quarter step
-
up reflects the fu
ll year equity refresh grant to employees at the beginning 
of the quarter and the biannual grant to SVPs.
 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 85,050, up 4,940 people from last 
quarter, including just over 2,000 people who joined at the end of January 
w
hen we closed our previously announced deal with HTC. As in prior 
quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. 
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the 
additions from HTC followed by hiring and cl
oud for both technical and sales 
roles.
 
Operating income was $7 billion, up 7% versus last year, and the operating 
margin was 22%. Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes 
$3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investm
ents 
recognized under the new accounting standard. We provide more detail on 
the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
 
Our effective tax rate was 11% for the first quarter. As outlined in our 
earnings press release, this includes a 5 percen
tage point reduction from the 
release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which offset the income 
tax expense on the equity security gains.
 
Net income was $9.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $13.33. As 
indicated in the table in our e
arnings press release, these results reflect an 
increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share 
due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've 
already discussed.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash 
flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $7.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating 
cash flow was $11.6 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the 
quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $103 b
illion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $31 billion, up 26% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 
26% year
-
over
-
year, led 
again by mobile search complemented by solid 
growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
 
Network revenues were $4.6 billion, up 16% year
-
on
-
year, reflecting the 
ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google 
were 
$4.4 billion, up 36% year
-
over
-
year fueled by cloud, hardware and 
Play. As a reminder, the hardware revenues in this line now include our Nest 
business, and prior periods were restated.
 
We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press rele
ase to 
give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising 
businesses. As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to 
impression
-
based monetization metrics for our network business given the 
ongoing growth of programmatic.
 
To
tal traffic acquisition costs were $6.3 billion or 24% of total advertising 
revenues and up 36% year
-
over
-
year. This year
-
on
-
year increase in sites 
TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a 
percentage of network revenues, continues
 
to reflect the fact that our 
strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry 
higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up 
year
-
over
-
year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which 
wa
s modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. 
The increase in the sites TAC rate year
-
over
-
year was driven by changes in 
partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher 
TAC. The underlying trend affectin
g the network TAC rate year
-
over
-
year 
continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC.
 
Google's stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 
22% year
-
over
-
year. Operating income was $8.4 billion, up 12% versus last 
year, and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter 
was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment 
and data center construction. Facilities was the largest component of CapEx 
of this quarter due primarily to 
the $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market 
that we announced in March.
 
Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets 
revenues were $150 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. As a 
reminder, Nest results are now re
ported as part of the Google segment, with 
revenues reflected in the Google other revenues line. Operating loss was 
$571 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million.
 
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A 
couple of updates. At 
Waymo, we have achieved 5 million miles of driving on city streets, adding 
the latest million in just 3 months. We also announced a long
-
term 
partnership with Jaguar Land Rover for their fully electric I
-
PACE vehicles. 
Verily is seein
g good progress with Onduo, its joint venture with Sanofi. The 
companies made its diabetes management platform commercially available 
in 3 states with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas and South Carolina and 
Anthem's health plan in Georgia.
 
Let me close w
ith some observations on the quarter and our longer
-
term 
outlook. First, with respect to revenues. The opportunity set ahead of us is 
quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long
-
term revenue and profit growth. We have both the 
business confidence to 
invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about 
some very compelling opportunities that, in our judgment, will enable us to 
create shareholder value. We're pleased with the continued momentum of 
our reve
nue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends 
across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on 
innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in 
our sites business. Specifically, we're exc
ited by the still sizable opportunity 
in search advertising led by mobile. At 26% year
-
on
-
year revenue growth in 
our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance 
the user and advertiser experience.
 
Second, with respect to profitab
ility. Within cost of revenues, the biggest 
component is TAC. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a 
percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, 
we continue to anticipate that the pace of year
-
over
-
year growt
h in sites 
TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second 
quarter.
 
Within OpEx, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority 
investment areas. Within R&D, this is reflected in increased headcount, 
particular
ly for technical roles. Sales and marketing is similarly elevated to 
support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect 
expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year 
to support the holiday season.
 
As y
ou've seen in prior quarters, G&A can be a more difficult line to forecast. 
In particular, this quarter, we had the impact of the accrual for performance 
fees related to the equity gains previously discussed, partially offset by the 
reallocation of some ex
penses to other cost of revenues and the Uber legal 
settlement. We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly 
focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the 
proper intensity while being diligent about long
-
term plan
s and returns.
 
For our Other Bets, we remain focused on moving toward commercial 
applications in a number of areas with a continued focus on calibrating 
investment to metrics for success.
 
Third, with respect to CapEx. Our commitment to growth is evident in
 
the 
trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between 
compute capacity and facilities. Our facilities spent in Google dominated by 
the Chelsea Market acquisition reflects that we favor owning rather than 
leasing real estate when we see 
good opportunities. With respect to compute 
capacity, the largest component of CapEx is for machines that incorporate 
the latest technologies. We are also investing in data center growth and 
increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combine
d 
investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook 
across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud.
 
In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment 
about both our confidence and clarity about f
uture opportunities with our 
focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, 
high
-
performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging 
products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers.
 
I will
 
now turn the call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Ruth. The end of Q1 is always an exciting time as we prepare for 
our annual developer conference, Google I/O. Computing is evolving at a 
rapid rate, and we can't wait to share what's next and how we 
are tackling 
important issues. I want to call out an important highlight from Q1, the 
Google news initiative that we unveiled in March. Over the years, we have 
worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through 
projects like Accelerate
d Mobile Pages. We are building on that partnership 
with the $300 million investment to elevate and strengthen quality 
journalism. As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new 
products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close colla
boration 
with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a 
subscription on participating news sites. We've had overwhelming interest.
 
Since the launch, we have heard from more than 300 news publishers who 
are interested in Subscribe with Goo
gle. We also introduced new tools for 
journalists and improvements to our platforms to ensure that we are 
surfacing accurate quality content where it matters most.
 
Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance 
that mission, then
 
I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube 
and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising 
platforms.
 
First, machine learning and making information accessible to everyone. Our 
own ML
-
powered products like Google Photos an
d Google Lens gets better 
every day. The Google Assistant is a great example of this. In the home, we 
have added over 200 new device partners that work with Assistant just on 
the last 4 months alone. We now partner with all major manufacturers of 
connected
 
devices for the home in the U.S.
 
All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, 
including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the 
store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share hom
e. 
For a concept we unveiled at I/O less than 2 years ago, this is great 
progress.
 
AI is also unlocking new opportunities for everyone. Just in the last few 
months, we have seen some amazing applications from dairy farmers in 
Georgia using TensorFlow to im
prove the health their herds to our own 
Google researchers who figured out how to use ML techniques to assess a 
person's risk of a heart attack. The possibilities of AI in health care are truly 
exciting.
 
At our recent TensorFlow summit, we introduced Tenso
rFlow hub, making it 
easier for developers to share and reuse models so that we can work 
together to tackle even more problems and get to better ideas faster. Our 
investments in this area are helped because of our specialized Tensor 
Processing Units, which
 
are specifically designed to be highly efficient for 
machine learning applications.
 
Of course, we continue to advance Google's core mission in other ways, too. 
We recently launched our Google Go app in 26 African countries. This app 
reduces the amount of 
data needed to display search results by 40%, and 
we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over 
their information across all our products. Every single day, nearly 20 million 
people visit My Account, which gives them options 
to review their Google 
security, privacy and ad settings. Additionally, tools like security checkup 
and privacy checkup prompt people to keep their account secure and control 
their data settings.
 
Now turning to our three big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardw
are. Last 
quarter, we shared some exciting metrics about the progress of Google 
Cloud, including that we passed $1 billion per quarter in 2017. In Q1, we 
saw increasing momentum. We are growing across the board and are also 
signing significantly larger, mo
re strategic deals for cloud. Our security 
capabilities, the easy
-
to
-
use advanced data analytics and machine learning 
solutions and the secure and industry
-
leading collaboration platform, G 
Suite, are winning customers over. Google Cloud is growing well. S
ome 
examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud 
AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning 
expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security 
products.
 
Our global infrastructure continues 
to expand to support demand. We 
commissioned 3 new subsea cables and announced new regions in Canada, 
Japan, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, bringing our total of recently launched 
and upcoming regions to 20.
 
G Suite has reached a point where it can serve al
l the needs of a large 
enterprise, and as a result, grow at a certain inflection point. The Suite is 
growing from strength to strength. We believe our secure environment is an 
important factor in driving enterprise customer wins. G Suite customers like 
Col
gate
-
Palmolive Company tell us that no one offers a better combination 
of hardware, network and data security. In Q1, we also signed agreements 
with customers like Airbus and Thailand's Krung Thai Bank. As a result, G 
Suite revenue growth accelerated in Q1
.
 
Next, YouTube. The platform continues to grow as millions of creators build 
communities and find opportunity on YouTube. Over the last year, channels 
earnings 6 figures annually grew more than 40%. This quarter, Dua Lipa's 
video for New Rules became the 
100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion 
views. We are also investing in new experiences like life content, where we 
see tremendous momentum. One recent example was our exclusive 
Coachella live stream, which had more than 41 million live views from all 
ov
er the world.
 
Coachella was YouTube's most viewed live music festival ever. And no 
surprise, Beyoncé was the most viewed Coachella performance ever on 
YouTube. Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on 
making sure that YouTube remains a
 
safe platform with great content. We 
are aggressively combating content that violates our strict policies through a 
combination of user and machine flags. Over 6 million videos removed in Q4 
were first flagged by our machine systems, and over 75% of those
 
videos 
were removed before receiving a single view. We also changed our 
monetization requirements to better identify creators who contribute 
positively to the community and drive more ad revenue to them.
 
Moving to hardware. This quarter, we welcome Nest o
f the Google hardware 
team to supercharge our efforts. Nest is building industry
-
leading products 
for the home, including new additions like the Nest Hello doorbell and Nest 
temperature sensor. In 2017, they sold more devices than the previous 2 
years comb
ined. They are an incredibly talented team with fantastic 
momentum.
 
Google Home continues to be super popular, and we are making it available 
in many more countries. Just recently, we launched Google Home in many 
--
 
in India and Singapore, and the response
 
has been terrific.
 
Our early 2018 Net Promoter Scores rank among the highest in the industry 
across all product categories. This shows how much love people have for 
Made by Google consumer hardware devices and makes us even more 
excited for what's ahead.
 
There's great momentum across our computing platforms, like Android and 
Chrome. At Mobile World Congress, a new generation of Android partner 
devices was introduced, including Android One phones like the Nokia 7 plus. 
Android One pairs high
-
quality hardwar
e with a secured and streamlined 
software and experience from Google. This quarter, we launched the Acer 
Chromebook Tab 10, the first Chrome OS tablet designed specifically for 
education. It is a secure and easily shareable tablet equipped with all the 
Chr
omebook features that educators and students love.
 
And finally, our advertising platforms. We continue to make Google Search 
and Shopping the best places for people to find and buy products from a 
range of merchants. We recently announced shopping actions,
 
allowing 
customers to easily buy from their choice of participating retailers on the 
Google Assistant and Search with the universal card across mobile, desktop 
and even Google Home. The results are really helping retailers. Early testing 
showed that parti
cipating retailers see an average increase in basket size of 
about 30%.
 
YouTube is delivering great results for our advertisers. To help brands reach 
broad audiences on YouTube with even more flexibility, we introduced 
TrueView for Reach, which 
optimizes in stream ads to reach a wide 
audience. In beta testing, 9 out of 10 campaigns drove a significant lift in ad 
recall, with an average lift of nearly 20%.
 
We are also helping small businesses take advantage of video with the 
expansion of YouTube D
irector onsite to over 170 U.S. cities. This gives 
SMBs access to a professional filmmaker to create and edit their video ads.
 
Finally, we remain focused on investing in our publisher partners. Last year, 
we paid $12.6 billion to publishing partners in our
 
ad network. We recently 
announced AdSense Auto ads. This uses machine learning to analyze ad 
placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to 
perform well while providing a good user experience.
 
Google's success depends not just on th
e success of our partners but also on 
the community's very work. We recently announced the Rolling Study Halls 
program for rural areas across 12 states. It equips school buses with Wi
-
Fi 
devices and onboard educators so that students with long commutes can
 
get 
their homework done during the trip.
 
We are also making long
-
term investments in our offices and data centers 
around the country. Last month, we announced the purchase of Manhattan's 
Chelsea Market building. And in Tennessee and Alabama, we broke grou
nd 
on 2 new data centers, which will have a big economic impact on the local 
economies. These investments are made hand
-
in
-
hand with our commitment 
to sustainability.
 
In 2017, we officially met our goal to purchase enough renewable energy to 
match all elec
tricity consumed by our operations around the world.
 
I want to close by saying thank you to our employees. It's been a 
particularly tough few weeks for the Google family, especially at YouTube. 
I'm so proud of the resilience that our employees have shown, 
and I'm so 
grateful for the support we have gotten across the industry and from the 
community. Thank you.

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth 
of JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Ruth, just 
first on the accounting change, I was just hoping you could clarify. 
If we're trying to normalize that, is it right that we would be adding back 
about $632 million to operating income and then reducing EPS by $3.40, 
and then just on the EPS side, perhaps a
djusting for the tax rate? And then 
just in terms of the business, I just wanted to ask about Waymo. If you 
could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in 
Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and
 
then 
just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to 
others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. So on the accounting standard, we try to lay out all the component 
parts clearly on t
he cover of the earnings release so that you would have it 
all in one place. I think you summarized it right, but I'll just direct everybody 
to the earnings release. The net of which was the gain from the equity 
investments was $2.4 billion to net income. 
That is net of performance fees 
as well as the release of a deferred tax asset that we have, so it does reflect 
$3 billion in gains. And I think you know this, but this quarter, the 
accounting standard requires marks for everything where there is an 
observ
able raise.
 
So these are unrealized 
--
 
the majority of them are unrealized, not actually 
monetized by Alphabet, and then the performance fees are calculated based 
on investment returns. They're accrued but not paid until an exit event 
occurs, and they do a
ppear in OpEx. And as you noted, there is also, 
therefore, the benefit that flows through on the tax line, and that is 5 
percentage points of benefit offset to the effective tax rate for the quarter. 
As it relates to your Waymo question, there was a lot in
 
there. We do remain 
very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress 
on multiple fronts. It is still very early. In terms of our progress, this year is 
about offering a service that is safe, that works, that delight users in the 
Ph
oenix area. The rider program in Phoenix is open to members of the 
public, and riders will use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully self
-
driving 
cars without a driver at the wheel, and will pay for the service. We've also 
had progress on the vehicle partne
rships, as I mentioned in my opening 
comments. Last month, Waymo announced it signed a long
-
term strategic 
partnership with Jaguar beginning with a collaboration to design and 
manufacture self
-
driving I
-
PACE vehicles for Waymo's transportation service. 
The
se are all electric cars.
 
This new partnership in the vehicles adds to our strong position with FCA, 
and the production of the cars begins in 2020. And then we are expanding 
our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas like 
applying t
he technology to logistics and deliveries and working with cities to 
help strengthen public transportation and for personal use vehicles. And as 
we've talked about on a bunch of calls, the opportunity is here for us 
because we started with safety, and we r
emain a leader in safety, and we do 
believe that's the foundation for success, and it builds on the 
--
 
all the 
testing miles that we've done. So we keep coming back to when you create 
vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of pot
ential 
uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini
 
I wanted to ask two quick questions. One, just one on GDPR then one on 
cloud. On GDPR, jus
t wondering if you could share with us kind of any 
impact you're thinking about as the implementation occurs later in May, and 
so any thoughts you could share there would be great. And then on cloud, 
Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentu
m. You said G 
Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on 
the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective if that business 
accelerated or not and kind of how were the deal sites trending for that 
business in p
articular.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Great. Maybe I'll do the GDPR first. GDPR, I realize, is a fairly new public 
OPEC. But for us, it's not new. We started working on GDPR compliance over 
18 months ago and have been very, very engaged on it. It's really 
important, an
d we care about getting it right. And overall, we have long had 
a very robust and strong privacy program at Google, too. So we are 
committed to meeting requirements on May 25 and also long term. We are 
working very closely with advertisers, publishers and 
our partners. And we 
will also update all the privacy policies and controls we provide to users 
worldwide. So it's a big effort. We are very committed to it. We are very 
focused on getting it right by our users and partners, and that's where our 
focus is n
ow. On 
--
 
Heather, on cloud, I guess your question was about 
overall growth, and we are continuing 
--
 
the momentum has been very 
strong on cloud as well. We haven't talked about G Suite much, and so we 
highlighted it the moment I'm there, but cloud is cont
inuing its great growth. 
We are seeing it across the board. Things worth I would call out is we are 
seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite 
and cloud. Areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are 
beginning t
o work in terms of driving synergies to cloud. And the efforts we 
are beginning to put particular with our partners, that is beginning to bear 
fruit as well. So we have go
-
to
-
market programs now with SAP, Cisco and 
Salesforce. And I think we are beginning 
to see early results from that, and 
hopefully, that translates into more momentum going forward.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe two for Sundar, if I can. One, on mobile search, continue to call that 
out 
as a point of strength in the results. What are you most excited about in 
terms of either the product innovation or the ability to get consumers to 
adopt mobile search more broadly on devices globally, which could lead to 
more ad budgets moving it to mobil
e search? And then on hardware, you've 
now been through 2 years of sort of Pixel devices. You've made the aqui
-
hire 
of ETC engineers. Can you give us a sense of what you've learned so far 
from your hardware efforts and how that might evolve product innovat
ion or 
go
-
to
-
market strategies long term?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On mobile search, for me, mobile obviously raises the bar. And if you look at 
the evolution of Search, we gave from 
--
 
we evolved to stay ahead of user 
expectations, and we evolved from just providing
 
links to answers. I just feel 
at a high level the next big evolution we are doing as part of mobile search 
and assistant is to actually help users complete actions, to help get things 
done. And it's really hard to do at scale, and that's the work we are d
oing. 
And as we do that, it'll impact just 
--
 
not just the Assistant but mobile 
search more broadly. And obviously, that has a commercial impact as well. 
So we continue to be very excited about the opportunities there. On 
hardware, the exciting part for us
 
is now, I think we have all the end
-
to
-
end 
capabilities of a world
-
class hardware organization, along with the quality of 
the software organizations we have always had. And in this area, it truly 
takes long
-
term planning. And so for example, if you think 
about silicon, et 
cetera, the longer you can do it, the more advantages you have. And so I 
definitely feel we are taking the steps towards being able to do this well for 
the long term. Part of that obviously involves scaling of our go
-
to
-
market 
strategies 
both in the U.S. and internationally so that we can drive adoption. 
I said earlier, our Net Promoter Scores show that we are right up there with 
the best
-
in
-
class devices and across all the products we have, not just our 
Pixel, across our Nest family and e
verything we do. So the opportunity is 
clearly there. We're going to lean into it, and it takes two to three years to 
really get to the scale where we want to see it and 
--
 
but we are committed 
to getting there.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes 
from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
I want to follow up on Heather's question on GDPR, and the question I want 
to ask is, I understand that you're 
--
 
been working for a long time to make 
sure that you're compliant. But do you think that 
GDPR or other regulation 
that you see on the horizon is likely to impact materially the targeting 
capabilities about that advertisers have on Google? Is there something in the 
regulation that's going to make Google and its properties less attractive to 
adv
ertisers? That's the action question I want to ask.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Mark. Above everything else, as we are working through GDPR, we 
are making sure we are focused on getting the user experience right for our 
users and our partners. But to clarify you
r question further, first of all, it's 
important to understand that most of our ad business is Search, where we 
rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show 
a relevant ad or product. And so we've been preparing this for 18 
months, 
and I think we are focused on getting the compliance right. It'll be a year's 
long effort, and we are helping not just us but our publishers and partners. 
But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that with the positive impact for 
users and pub
lishers and the advertisers and so our business.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two. The first one on desktop search. So it's nice to hear that your 
oldest business is still growing. Just curious
, could you give 1 or 2 tangible 
examples or products that are still driving the desktop search growth? And 
Sundar, I understand you're always focused on user experience. At a high 
level, what do you see is the biggest areas potential further improvement i
n 
desktop search? And let me ask you the same question about YouTube. 
What are sort of the biggest areas of tension that you're focused on 
improving from a user perspective on YouTube right now?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
So on desktop search 
--
 
sorry, is your question
 
on the user experience on 
desktop search, how do we see improvements? Look, I mean, the same. 
First of all, users are having cross
-
device experiences, cross
-
screen 
experiences, right? So I think your desktop search experience, mobile 
search, everything go
es hand
-
in
-
hand. And every 
--
 
all the work we are 
doing to make mobile search better translates to desktop search as well. 
Areas where desktop search historically has been a bit behind is in terms of 
things like identity and payments and having all that wo
rk well to enhance 
the user experience. And with Chrome now, we are investing a lot in those 
areas as well, and I think that will contribute overall to improvements there. 
On YouTube, there are many, many areas we are focused on YouTube. 
They're always ver
y focused on making sure they are supporting emerging 
formats, be it mobile live streaming or emerging formats like VR, and so 
that's an area of focus for us. We are also really looking at what are all
-
new 
monetization options for creators beyond advertisi
ng. So be it subscriptions, 
features like super chat, which we have launched, are very popular. We have 
beta testing sponsorships, merchandise, merchandising and concept, 
ticketing and et cetera, right? So these are all areas by which we are 
improving. And
 
obviously, there are additional areas like Music and YouTube 
TV, which are seeing great momentum as well.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Just two questions, please. Americas revenue accelerated nicely on a
 
currency neutral basis. It's a geography that rarely comes up on your calls. 
So any color about what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of 
what's going on in the Americas region? And then, Ruth, a question on sites 
TAC. So I know you said 
the pace of deleverage is going to start to improve 
next quarter. Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year 
and then kind of normalize back to pretty steady pace of deleverage? Or is 
this 
--
 
are we over some critical threshold, and we sh
ould see this trend of 
moderating deleverage continue for several years into the future?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So on your first question, other Americas. I would say, like the other 
regions, really pleased with the strength we have. Across the regions, it is 
obviousl
y one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and 
really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the sites revenue 
strength. But on top of that, they benefited from hardware devices launching 
in some additional markets over 
the past year. And then in terms of TAC, I 
would say there's not much to add to what we've already said after some 
--
 
a kind of sustained period of stronger increases. We were pleased last 
quarter to be able to signal that this quarter that pace of change 
is slowing, 
and just leave it at that for now.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
I have two, one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, on CapEx, even if we 
exclude the Chelsea Market one
-
timer, the gr
oss in CapEx, is it really 
substantial even on a kind of recurring basis. Should we expect that sort of 
dramatic growth or step
-
up in the growth of rate in ongoing CapEx to 
continue throughout the year? Or other than the Chelsea Market one
-
timer, 
were ther
e any 
--
 
do we have any reason to think that it was timing in terms 
of the timing, front
-
end weighted, it's the first quarter for CapEx? And then 
secondly on 
--
 
Sundar, just a question on YouTube and your media strategy 
at a higher level. In view of the su
ccess of other competitive subscription TV 
products out there, Internet video products, can you just talk about YouTube 
Red and any thoughts on ways you can accelerate growth for your YouTube 
subscription video products, whether that may be organic investm
ent and 
content original production or even via acquisition?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of CapEx, it's about equally split between facilities and our 
technical infrastructure. And as you know that we have the $2.4 billion 
purchase in New York as well as discon
tinued ground
-
up development 
projects. Facilities does tend to be lumpier over time. We are continuing with 
the ground
-
up development projects. And as a reminder, we do favor 
owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities, and 
that h
as served us well over the years. But I think more to your question 
with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute 
power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest 
component is on machines. It's also on dat
a centers and undersea cables. 
And on machines, the biggest contributor is the demand that we're seeing. 
So in particular, it's the expanding application of the machine learning 
efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for cloud and Search and 
YouTub
e, and then secondarily, the increased cost of newer technologies, 
CPUs, memory, network. So I think, really, to answer your question most 
directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to 
suggest a one
-
off in terms of the investmen
ts we're making in technical 
infrastructure. And then in terms of the data centers, we are investing 
globally. We currently have over 20 sites on 4 continents, and that's under 
different stages of construction, as Sundar noted. And it's across the U.S. 
Ten
nessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa. So we're really building out to 
support the growth that we're seeing.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Sorry, on the second question on YouTube, for sure, the adoption and 
feedback across both YouTube Red and YouTube Music has been grea
t to 
see. We are doing a lot more work there. You will see us continue to invest 
further and develop those offerings better, and as part of that, further drive 
adoption. So for example, YouTube Originals end up playing a big part in 
YouTube Red subscriptio
ns. And so far, we have launched in a handful of 
markets, and we'll continue to roll it out to more markets there. And on 
YouTube Music, we are working on enhancing the product, and I think this 
definitely create opportunities there as well.
 
Operator
 
And o
ur next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
 
Daniel Salmon
 
Sundar, I had two for you. First, during the quarter, where there were some 
reports of changes in leadership that your Search and AI divisions 
functionally sounds like 
separating leadership over those 2 very large, 
important businesses for the company. Could you talk a little bit more about 
that and how that may impact broader strategy for the company? And then 
second, a little bit more technical one on your advertising 
business you 
launched, shopping actions during the quarter with a pay
-
per
-
sale model, 
pricing model. And I was just curious to hear what type of feedback you 
were getting from advertisers that led to a product with that pricing model in 
particular, any oth
er features of shopping actions that you think are 
important to highlight.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Dan. Search has been leading the company in terms of how they 
have been adopting machine learning and AI, and it's really working well 
through Search and Assis
tant. We sense that, obviously, as an AI
-
first 
company, AI cuts across everything we do in Google. And so as an 
organization, it's a horizontal organization, which needs to serve all our 
areas and in some ways, the change reflects that. And we have very ca
pable 
leaders. Jeff, who runs 
--
 
was the Founder of Google Brain and really well 
positioned to lead our AI efforts. And Ben has been at Google since the early 
days of Search, started in Google in 2000 and has been driving Search for 
over 18 years. And so w
e are very excited, and we think the changes will 
serve the company well. On your second thing, the question was on 
shopping actions?
 
Daniel Salmon
 
And in particular, the price per sale pricing model.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
So I think we announced the 
--
 
this new s
ervice in March, and the feedback 
has been very positive. I mentioned earlier, which is for retailers, when they 
are testing this, they see it drives an increase in basket size. So that means 
users are interacting with the product well, and that's all I ha
ve to share for 
now. It's still early days.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
A couple for me, please. First, on the cloud business. I was wondering if you 
could provide any color, at least in the re
lative momentum you're seeing in 
that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software 
services. And then related to the adoption of AMP. I guess, a key question 
we get asked is whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you 
have
 
some perspective on this from Android. But in the ecosystem between 
mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users 
between those formats.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would 
sa
y is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what 
we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and 
machine learning. The fact that we really support open, agile development 
environment. Kubernetes has literally become
 
the standard for workloads 
and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach this space. 
Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and something we've been 
leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out 
earlier
, is a good synergistic driver. G Suite is doing well, and clearly, a very 
unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive. And so I think overall, it 
comes together well. On your second question around AMP, AMP has been 
definitely very successful. It'
s really made publisher content much more 
friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, 
that option has been great. For sure, AMP has definitely helped the mobile 
web, and that's part of the big reasons we did it. Mobile web is
 
still a big 
part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us 
investing there clearly makes a difference. I guess, for example, when we 
look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP, their mobile page loading times 
are now over 90% faster. 
And now they are integrating the Google payment 
request API. That reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or 
so. So things like that. We are going to constantly stay on improving the 
mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem wo
rks.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
I have two, one for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, can you give us any 
sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search in these devices 
differ
ently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? And you're finding in 
those homes, is it additive to overall search activity? And then for Ruth, if 
you look at the last page of press release, where you've shown the new 
monetization metrics, you see a real
 
increase in the cost per impression on 
network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is 
there a mix shift types of publishers, types of products? Or is that just 
market inflation?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Look, for sure, Google Home gives rise t
o a lot of new and unique use cases, 
actions that are a big part of it. Call mom is a good example of something 
you say to Google Home a lot. I can 
--
 
which is different than what you 
would say to Search. We see this as a good complementary thing. You will
 
see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant 
and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in 
the long term, and we are definitely just getting started there.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then on the network 
monetization trends. First, just to give people a bit 
more color. When we launched the AdSense businesses, our network 
revenues were largely click
-
based. And over time, there's been a meaningful 
mix change in our business given the strong growth in program
matic, which 
is impression
-
based. So as a result, the shift now covers more of the 
business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus 
CPM growth, as we've discussed on prior calls, the network business is 
actually a number of different
 
businesses. And then within that, we have flat 
year
-
on
-
year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts 
to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads and 
AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year
-
on
-
year 
growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be 
volatile from quarter
-
to
-
quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher 
and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.
 
Operator
 
And our next question com
es from Brent Thill of Jefferies.
 
Brent Thill
 
Just as a question regarding any changes on your framework for growth 
versus operating margins. The last few quarters, you've seen steady top line 
acceleration, yet the margins were down. Can you just talk abou
t how you 
think about it at a high level for this year? Any changes from the past?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Yes, it's an important question. As we've talked about on many, many calls, 
we have been and remain focused on supporting long
-
term revenue and 
profit growth, and
 
we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite 
extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence 
and as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing 
appropriately in the next phase of innovation, and we have cla
rity about 
some very compelling opportunities. And then our judgment, that enables us 
to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in 
place the support for long
-
term 
--
 
longer
-
term growth. Part of what I'm 
saying, you can see in o
ur sites revenue growth, try to make that clear in 
opening comments, we see this consistent, strong momentum globally, and 
we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search. 
And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user 
and advertiser 
experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business. You can see 
this also in the trend on the CapEx spend.
 
As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there 
really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and 
that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and 
the Assistant. And then we also see extr
aordinary upside in the newer 
markets, as Sundar has talked about, most notably cloud computing and 
hardware. And so we're investing to support the long
-
term growth 
opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity 
in both self
-
dr
iving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to 
place the kinds of investments that we are. And with all of this, what also 
hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking 
our spots, and we're keenly focused on 
steps we can take to both make the 
right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long
-
term plans and returns. So at a high level, the approach hasn't changed. 
You're seeing the investments here.
 
Operator
 
And our final question come
s from the line of Stephen Ju of Crédit Suisse.
 
Stephen Ju
 
So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has 
talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help 
SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's
 
ad products to be 
perhaps overwhelming. So can you talk about the rate of uptake among the 
smaller advertisers and whether or not this is helping to catalyze growth in 
new budgets and where these guys might otherwise have not been able to 
advertise before
? There's SMBs and then there's local also. So what will be 
the plan to get this technology into the hands of folks who will want to use 
them?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Look, I mean, there's a big focus for us. And today, SMBs are 
--
 
play a big 
role in our ecosystem, 
and we are doing a lot of stuff to support them across 
the board, right, and from things like in our offerings to help SMBs get an 
online presence, create a website, be discovered in local, search and Google 
Maps. So we do a lot of detailed work to make su
re SMBs are working well. 
We are also doing a lot of stuff on local as well, including efforts that are 
even around local services. So we have very specific initiatives. This is going 
to be 
--
 
I mean, it's actually 
--
 
to us, it's bread and butter of what w
e do 
here, and so there's a lot of effort underway, not to mention the fact that we 
provide G Suite for businesses as they scale up as well. So it's an end
-
to
-
end 
offering, and we'll 
--
 
you'll continue to see us invest more here.

In the early days of the crisis, we were able to put in motion a number of 
efforts quickly. This is a testament to strategic areas where we have 
invested over recent years,

leadership and innovation, deep partnerships, a highly skilled workforce, and

And you may have read about our exposure notification partnership with

Up to last week, our COVID

Third, we are playing a role in supportin
g businesses and workers that are 
hurting because of the downturn. In March, we made a commitment, 
upwards of $800 million to support small businesses and crisis response 
efforts through a combination of grants, small business loans and ad credits.
 
And the
 
Google News Initiative is offering financial support to thousands of 
small, medium and local news publishers through a Journalism Emergency 
Relief Fund. We have also waived ad serving fees for news publishers 
globally on Ad Manager for the next 5 months.
 
Turning to the way people are using our products. People are relying on 
Google services more than ever. This is a strong recognition of the value of 
our products, particularly in important and urgent moments. As a few 
examples, we have seen a significant r
aise in search activity. To put it into 
perspective, in the U.S. coronavirus related search activity at its peak was 4 
times greater than during the peak of the Super Bowl.
 
People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps with 
downloads of
 
apps from Google Play rising 30% from February to March.

is live streams. I hope you saw Andrea Bocelli on YouTube live on Easter, 
which just had over 39 million views and it was 
truly beautiful.

are using our secure video conferencing platform, Meet.

nce January. There are now over 100 million daily Meet meeting 
participants. Stay tuned for much more.
 
Turning to our business, let me touch on our performance this quarter. Q1 
was in many ways the tale of 2 quarters. For our advertising business, the 
first 2 months of the quarter were strong. In March, we experienced a 
significant and sudden slowdown in ad revenues. The timing of the slowdown 
correlated to the locations and sectors impacted by the virus and related 
shutdown orders.
 
As the impact of COV
ID
-
19 came into view, we delayed some ad launches 
and prioritized supporting our customers as many adjusted their strategy. 
We are focused on products where we can help most advertisers and 
merchants during the crisis. For example, under our new leader of 
commerce, Bill Ready, last week, we announced that merchants can list 

with more countries to come and the response has been positive.
 
Overall, recovery in ad spend will depend on
 
a return to economic activity. 
There are 2 key aspects of our business that give us confidence about the 
future. First, as we saw after 2008, one of the strongest features of Search 

 
and then 
back on, and marketers see it as highly cost effective and ROI based.
 
Second, our business is more diversified than it was in 2008. For example, 
Cloud. In the public sector, we are helping governments delivered critical 
health and social services
. We are supporting the state of New York, new 
online unemployment application system as it deals with a significant 
increase in demand.
 

Wayfair, scale to support exponential traff

communication companies adapt to new behavior patterns. Vodafone is 
using Google Cloud platform to help that analyze network traffic flows to 
keep everyone connected, and we are helping Unity Technologies keep real

Institutions like Lloyds Bank are digitally transforming their businesses, and 
we are helping even more businesses do the same to new partnerships with 
Accenture, AT&T and T

Systems. We now have more than 6 million paying G

customers. G Suite is helping Netflix and German manufacturer, 
Kaeser Compressors, transition quickly to remote work, while Twitter, 
Shopify, Retailer Schnucks and Italian bank Credem are using Meet for 
things like all

YouTube subscriptions continue to grow, the team has launched YouTube 
Kids in 15 new countries around the world since the beginning of the year 
and rolled out new features to make kids focused channels safer.
 
Android previewed Andro
id 11, which includes seamless 5G connectivity and 
a smarter keyboard with a faster messaging experience. And as I 
mentioned, we have seen significant growth in play. There are now over 2.5 
billion monthly active play devices worldwide. And in hardware, we
 
saw a 
decline in device activations in the quarter due to falling customer demand 


 
Finally, moving on to our focus for rest of the year. W
e are taking a long 
view and continuing to invest in our long

term priorities, but are being 
thoughtful in the short

term. So we made the decision to slowdown the pace 
of hiring in the reminder of 2020, while maintaining momentum in a small 
number of strat
egic areas.
 
We are also recalibrating the focus and pace of our investments in areas like 
data centers and machines, and non

Waymo raised $2.25

Ruth Porat
 
Thanks, Sundar. Our results for the first quarter are a tail
 
of 2 quarters with 
strong results across our revenue lines for January and February followed by 
an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues, as governments 
globally instituted stay at home orders in response to COVID
-
19. At the 
same time, even 
through March, our non
-
advertising revenue lines maintain 

on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results 
and conclude with an update to the outlook t
hat I shared on our fourth 
quarter call. Sundar and I will then your questions.
 
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results. In the first quarter, our total 
revenues were $41.2 billion, up 13% year
-
on
-
year and up 15% in constant 
currency, driven by Search,
 

consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings 
press release. In short, advertising results reflect, in large part, the nature 
and timing of actions around the globe in response to COVID
-
1
9.
 
The decline in APAC was more muted than what we have seen in the rest of 
the world given the uneven impact of COVID as well as the composition of 
our revenues in the region. The impact in the rest of the world began later 
and was more acute by the end o
f the quarter. In terms of the foreign 
exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in a modest headwind 
to reported revenues.
 
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of 
revenues including TAC, was $19 billion, up 19% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of 
revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year
-
over
-
year 
primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses. The biggest factors here again 
this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other 
operations, inc
luding depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, 

costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube music and premium subscription 
services.
 
Operating expenses were $14.2 billion with
 
headcount growth being the 
largest driver of year
-
on
-
year growth for R&D and sales and marketing 
expenses. For G&A, the biggest driver of expense growth was attributable to 
a reserve for estimated credit deterioration as a result of COVID
-
19.
 
Stock

based 
compensation totaled $3.2 billion. Headcount was up 4,149 
from the fourth quarter. Again the majority of new hires were engineers and 
product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount 
increases were again in Google Cloud for both tech
nical and sales roles. 
Operating income was $8 billion, down 4% year
-
over
-
year, excluding the 
impact of the EC fine in the first quarter of last year for an operating margin 
of 19%.
 
Other income and expense was a loss of $220 million driven primarily by 
lo
sses in equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within 
OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 11.9%. Net 
income was $6.8 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $9.87.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash
 
flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating 
cash flow was $11.5 billion with free cash flow of $5.4 billion. We 
repurchased $8.5 billion of our shares. We entered the quarter with cash and
 
marketable securities of approximately $117 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google 
segment. Revenues were $41 billion, up 14% year
-
over
-

through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starti
ng with Google Search 
and other advertising revenue, we generated $24.5 billion in revenues in the 
quarter that was up 9% year

year. This reflects strong year

growth for the first 2 months of the quarter.
 
In March, revenues began to decline an

activity increased, their interest shifted to less commercial topics. In 
addition, there was also reduced spending by our advertisers.
 
YouTube advertisi
ng revenues were $4 billion, up 33% year

on
-
year. 
Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter 
with different performance trajectories for the brand and direct response 
components. Direct response continued to have substanti

on
-
year 
growth throughout the entire quarter. Brand advertising growth accelerated 
in the first 2 months of the quarter, but began to experience a headwind in 
mid
-
March. As a result by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue 
growth had decelera
ted to a year

-
year growth rate in the high

Network advertising revenues were $5.2 billion, up 4% year

March at a year

Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $2.8 
billion for the first quarter, up 52% year
-
over
-
year, driven by significant 
growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth at G Suite. Once again, the 
growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of cloud overall. GCP 
growth was led by our infrastructure offerings in our data and analytics 

to reflect growth in both seat c
ount and average revenue per seat.
 

proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors, including 
public sector and healthcare for disease monitoring and control, workin
g with 
leading retailers on demand forecasting working with companies across 
media and communications to enhance their customer service and across 
industries on supply chain optimization.
 
In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% 
year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non
-
advertising revenues and 

growth across its various offerings. Within Play, app revenues continue to 
benefit from strong growt
h in the number of active buyers in the first 
quarter. In addition in the latter part of the quarter we started to see an 
increase in user engagement in apps as well as in digital content.
 
Total Traffic Acquisition Costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total a
dvertising 
revenue and up 9% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
advertising revenues was down slightly year
-
over
-
year, reflecting once again 
of favorable revenue mix shift from network to Google properties.
 
Google operating income was $9.3 
billion, up 1% versus last year and the 
operating margin was 23%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.7 
billion, reflecting investments in data centers followed by servers and office 
facilities.
 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets, for the f
irst quarter, revenues 
were $135 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss 
was $1.1 billion for the first quarter.
 
Let me now conclude with our thoughts on the impact of the global crisis on 
our revenues and investments including an 
update on the outlook I shared 
on our fourth quarter earnings call. We remain optimistic about the 
underlying strength of our business over the long
-
term.
 
On a daily basis, our products play an important role for consumers and 
businesses globally. This has
 
been evident throughout the crisis and the 

continue to turn to us as much as they do and a time of global need and 
uncertainty. We take that responsibility very seriously.
 
Users clearl
y are depending on us to provide useful and accurate 
information. They are looking to YouTube for information, education and 
entertainment constantly as they study, create and work from home. They 
are using our G Suite products to collaboratively communica
te, connect and 
work.
 
Although users may not be focused as much on purely commercial activities 
right now, over the long term, the value we provide to billions of users 
globally serves us well. Our previous investments in technical infrastructure 
ensure th
at we have the capacity and resilience to meet the increased 
demand from our users in this extraordinary time.
 
We are redoubling our efforts to help our advertising customers and partners 
by sharing insights and developing new tools to keep them connected 
to 
their customers and help them be best positioned for recovery. In terms of 
more specific product points, I will start with Search advertising where our 

 
At the inception of the crisis, the i
ncrease in user interest was for 
information about COVID
-
19 and related non
-
commercial topics. Although 
we have seen some very early signs of recovery and commercial search 
behavior by users, it is not clear how durable or monetizable this behavior 
will be
.
 
In order to gauge the ongoing potential financial impact to our business from 
COVID
-
19, a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance which is 
tended to be correlated with advertising spend. As of today, we anticipate 
that the second quarter will 
be a difficult one for our advertising business.
 
As we move beyond the crisis and the global economy normalizes, this 
should be reflected in our advertising revenues. But it would be premature 
to comment on timing, given all the variables here.
 
In terms of
 
Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the 
team, reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP 
industry
-
specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses 
operate efficiently and effectively.
 
Moving 
on to profitability, while TAC and content acquisition costs are 
obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in other 
cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, such as 
depreciation and operations costs of our techn
ical infrastructure as well as 
for activities like customer support and content review.
 
Much of our operating expense is also not directly correlated to changes in 
revenues. Given that we are faced with a global crisis of uncertain depth and 
duration, we h
ave been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency, 
including slowing the pace of hiring in some categories of marketing spend 
as well as further enhancing machine utilization.
 
More specifically, with respect to the pace of hiring, last quarter, I indi
cated 
that the rate of headcount growth in 2020 would be slightly higher than the 
20% growth in 2019. We now anticipate a deceleration in headcount growth 
that should start to be visible in the third quarter and continue into the 
fourth quarter.
 
Although w
e are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall 
pace of investment, we remain committed to the long
-
term opportunities for 
which we are well positioned, so we will continue to invest in these areas, 
including Search, Machine Learning and Goo
gle Cloud.
 
Finally, with respect to CapEx, on the fourth quarter call, we shared our 
expectation that investments in both technical infrastructure and office 
facilities would increase compared to 2019. We now anticipate a modest 
decrease in the level of to
tal CapEx in 2020 compared with last year.
 
The biggest change in our outlook is the reduction in global office facility 
investments, due to both the need to pause most of our ground
-
up 
construction and fit
-
outs in response to COVID
-
19 and our decision to s
low 
down the pace at which we acquire office buildings. In terms of technical 
infrastructure, we expect a moderate reduction to our forecast relative to the 
beginning of the year, given the impact of COVID
-
19 on data center 
construction delays, as well as 
the benefit of our ongoing focus on server 
efficiency.
 
Overall, we anticipate technical infrastructure investment to remain at 
roughly the same level as in 2019 with relatively more spend on servers 
than on data center construction.
 
Thank you. And Sundar a
nd I will now take your questions.

Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric 
Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question and hope all is safe an
d well with everyone 
on the team there at Alphabet. 2 questions if I can. One, on the comment 
with respect to direct response advertising on YouTube, would love to get a 

evolve an
d perform, and how advertisers are using those ad units as part of 
their broader advertising goals.
 
And then maybe, Ruth, for you, on the comment on expenses, just want to 
understand a little bit of how much of what your messaging on expenses is 
efficiency
 
gains that you were aiming for in 2020 before we got to COVID

the pandemic. Thanks so much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Eric, thanks, thanks for the wishes. On YouTube direct 

definitely seen traction there. I think an area where it really works well for 

example of it. And we are working on iterating and making the format work 
better, so 
that it applies to more contexts as well.
 



 
see more 
traction there over time.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And on your second question, I like the way you framed it. Yes, we do have 
efficiency efforts that we started, that we had going as we enter this year. 

our view was that 
we should really double
-
down on those. And so, when we go through the 
various areas that I mentioned, we had started the year with an expectation 
about really optimizing headcount around the various areas.
 

oing to at this point slow the pace of 
hiring. To be very clear, we are continuing to hire, but we are slowing the 

you optimize within each area. The same is true for example in 
some of the 
comments on marketing.
 
We are continuing to invest in marketing. As you know well, sales and 
marketing line, the majority of it is headcount related and we do continue to 
invest here in ads, and in particular, in Cloud. As it relates to the mar
keting 
component, namely ads and promo spend, we did reduce it relative to our 
plans in the beginning of the year. And we continue to have a healthy 
budget for ads and promo, particularly in digital to support many business 
areas.
 
But as with the other are

across products and services. And with physical events canceled for much of 


iciency of the fleet for 
some time now. This is giving us the opportunity to push that even further.
 

continue to lean into the efficiency programs. We can. It does help us free 
up some reso
urces for the growth areas that continue to be a priority, but it 
is an accentuation of where we were.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks so much.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Great. T
hanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, 
Sundar, you just talked about how once the crisis has passed, the world will 

how you think Alphabet comes out
 
stronger on the other side of this 
downturn.
 
And then, Ruth, maybe taking the question on expenses a little bit further, 
did this give you any more opportunity to be even more disciplined or 
diligent on costs on the other side as well? Thank you.
 
Sundar P
ichai
 

well. In general, I would say the highest level opportunity is, across 
everywhere we see, businesses thinking deeper about the shift to digital. 

ng, cloud, in 

 
every place we see that trend. 
And so part of this is making sure our investments deliver value with respect 
to that shift.
 
So if you look at advertising, people who in the past may have debated 
things like how do I get virtual showrooming,
 
now are really thinking about 
it. People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets, do 

 
are 
looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better.
 
Cloud is an obvious area, every company has been thinking about digital 
trans
formation. But they are asking the questions deeper. For example, if 
you have data centers, there are fixed costs through something like this. 

opportunity harder.
 
So across everythi
ng we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it 
Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long term opportunity. 
And I would say overall on Alphabet as well when you look at investments 
like a Waymo and Wing, you can imagine in the fut
ure these things working 
well can play a significant role. And even in the limited area [as Lingus and] 

on those big trends.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And to your other question, if I understa

the durability of some of the efficiency efforts. I think that the way I would 
answer that is, after a decade of growth there have to be opportunities for 

But painful 
times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around taking 

 
making sure 

 
And hopefully, those instill the right kinds of health metrics et cetera against 

e intent most certainly is that 

and efficiently as we can be. And I just need to reiterate. And Sundar and I 
have both said this. We remain committed to investing for the long term
, so

term growth. 

 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thank you, both.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldm
an 
Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Ruth, I have 2 questions 
for you actually. First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth 


been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad 
spending whilst down considerably has actually improved a little bit, maybe 
some green
-
shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing 
at the 
end of March.
 

seeing for the first kind of 3, 4 weeks for the quarter, just to help level set 
us. And then, just in regards to the provision you mentioned in G&A related 
to credit deterio
ration, is there a chance you could tell us the amount of that 
provision? And do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter? 
Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you for the 

 
so, in terms of ads revenue, as I said in opening 
comments, for our ads bu
siness a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic 
performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think 

the first quarter, as I said, for Search and other revenues,
 
they were up 9% 
year
-
on
-
year for the quarter.
 
But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a 
mid
-
teens percentage decline in year
-
on
-
your revenues. And then, with 
YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when 
trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct 
response does continue to have substantial growth throughout the quarter 
while brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid
-
March.
 
So by the end of March total YouTu
be ads revenue growth had decelerated 
to year
-
on
-
year growth rate in the high
-
single
-
digits. And then, for the 

uncertainty in the environment. And a few weeks, obviously, is not a
 
quarter. So in such an unprecedented crisis, I would not want you to 
extrapolate from just a couple of weeks.
 
That being said, the decline in our Search and other ads revenue was abrupt 

t users 

monetizeable that will be. So based on our estimates from the end of March 

percentage of year
-
on
-
yea
r revenue declines.
 


think that the main point though is a few weeks obviously is not a quarter 
and given
 
it is such an unprecedented environment, I would not extrapolate 


 
Heather Bellini
 
On the G&A, sorry, no, that was very helpful so thank you on behalf of 
everyb
ody. And then just the G&A that you mentioned the credit provisions 
that you said you took, I just was wondering if you could share the amount 
it might be in the queue later tonight, but wondering if you could share with 
us the amount on the call?
 
Ruth Por
at
 
It will be in the queue later tonight.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from 
MoffettNathanson, your line is now open.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Thanks. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth
. Sundar, people have asked 
you about your priorities you talked about, but I wonder if you could step 
back and think about what this crisis will do the other side and maybe a 
reorienting of your priorities so perhaps where you would shift spend in the 
lon
g
-
term to maybe take advantage of where this is going? And then Ruth 
we appreciate the color on YouTube, just want to dig in some more, if you 
can give us any sense of YouTube geographies is there any difference by 
change by geography that is really helpfu
l? So, thanks.

term 

 
on thinking through the arc of where things are going and our deep focus on 

se 
trends will play out in the long
-
term and so if anything through moments 
like that, the strong foundation we have built allows us to continue to be 
able to invest in our long
-
term area so AI is a good example of it.
 
The shift over time on computing to a

going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and 
productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment 
and so the thesis still main so we continue to focus anywhere we thin
k the 
actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, a 
deep computational scale is the kind of investments we think still stand the 
test of time through things like, but beyond that we are actively looking at 
how user patterns are em
erging so, for example, e
-
commerce is an area and 
you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our 
shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new 

e
xperience there.
 
And so we are looking at shifts be it videoconferencing with Google Meet and 

are approaching it.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then in terms of the geographic breakdown for You Tu
be, we kind of 
bring that down, although I think as you know, well, we have a breakdown 
for the major regions around the world and to give you a little more color 
there, in mid February revenue growth across the business began to 
decelerate in APAC, althou
gh as I noted the decline in APAC was more 
muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our 
business across the region and then the impact in EMEA was first evident in 
mid February with a steeper falloff in March. In the second week of Mar
ch 
we then saw results in the U.S. as well as other Americas fall off shortly, but 
nothing more specific by product.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay. Thank you, Ruth.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is
 
now open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth, just to go 
back to your comments around the early signs of improvements in behavior 


categories or which geographies were you seeing sort of the first sign of 
green shoots on the Search side.
 
And then Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward 
digi
tal opportunities or digital transformation, if you talk to us about as you 

side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you 
really need to invest and buil
d more comprehensive SMB products for post 
recovery?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Maybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on that side too. On the 

have assets both across AdWords, Google 
Maps, Google My Business and 
obviously providing them with G Suite and the tools to get their business 
running. So, I do think we have a lot of touch points, but the focus has been 
simplifying it, making it more of a one cohesive easy experience making sur
e 
it works well from mobile that there is a truly lighter weight AdWords 
experience so that they can get on board it quicker and so reducing the work 
they need to and also over time bringing technologies like AI to just make it 
all much simpler and seamles
s for them.
 

and making sure it works internationally well as well we have clear metrics 
and targets internally and we are aligning the teams better to get there and 
you would see 
us do more.
 
On the Ad side, a question 

 
to your question about maybe I can give more 
qualitative cover to what was said earlier and we 

 
the good thing about 
search ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but Search primarily is 



-
effective 
and so we have always seen and we saw this in 2008 as well, people 
respond in the short
-
term, but the recovery is also fast
 
when it comes back 
and so it tends to work. It is very diversified not just geographically by 
different verticals and even through moments like that we do see businesses 
responding to demand shift and so we see through our system if people 
suddenly are lo
oking for office furniture or even pajamas, the system 
response, right and so you see the dynamic nature of it.
 
I mentioned earlier people are really thinking about the shift to digital so 
Philip and our ads team are super engaged with our customers helpin
g them 
think through the opportunities through moments like that. I gave a earlier 


conversations in a deeper way.
 
There are budgets, which are shifting in certain cases, some of our large 


they see, but having said 
that there are large sectors of the economy, which 
are affected, things like travel and our large partners and customers are 

gave as well.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Great. Thanks, Sundar.
 
Operat
or
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. 
Your line is now open.
 
Brent Thill
 

across SMB and enterprise, any common threads you saw between those 
two 
segments?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
We have had tremendous momentum on the G Suite and we can 

 
all of 
Google works this way, products like Gmail, Google Docs that are built from 
the ground up to really help people be productive and collaborative in a 
distributed work
 

Google Meet, have seen great traction and I gave 

 
I mentioned some user 
momentum there, but we have more announcements coming up including 
later this week and so we are seeing tremendous traction an
d engagement 
on G Suite.
 
On Cloud, the shift to digital has been deep trend and if anything people are 

customer and you have data centers, these are fixed cost when you go 
through m
oments like this and so people are really looking at opportunities 
there and so our teams are super engaged, but I do want to acknowledge, 
maybe small businesses across the world are deeply impacted.
 
As a company we have announced several efforts to suppor
t small and 
medium businesses and we are going to be deeply engaged with them, but I 

them to help them through this.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmo
n from BMO 
Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Dan Salmon
 
Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I wanted 
to return to those long
-
term initiatives that you walked through earlier and 
one that was most close to your core busine
ss and the changes that you 

 
were announced this week for shopping. Could you explain a little bit more 
about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings 
or creating the free listings and what drove you to make that decision now? 
And then a related follow up for Ruth, same question essentially, but as we 
think about the financial impact of such a change, imagine this is one of 
those things, which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter rate, but some
thing that benefits all parties over the 
long
-

color you could add on sort of the near and long
-
term impact of the Google 
Shopping changes would be great too?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
So, going t


true for shopping. They spend time discovering and comprehensiveness 

er experience and so as 

search works, for us to truly give that comprehensiveness and the quality of 
experience.
 
We need the widest catalog possible and then we are good at rankin
g it and 
providing and matching users to what they are looking for. And so it is 

 
it 
made a lot of sense for us and just looking through the range of experiences 
people who are seeking through the COVID pandemic validated it even more 

been executing really hard there with leadership in 
place and so we saw the opportunity to go back to our first principles and 
improve the comprehensiveness there.
 


e managing and giving people good quality experiences 

providers so that we get the quality signals and really improve the 
experience as we improve comprehensiveness so both of them are go
ing 
hand in hand and as we have demonstrated with Search, when we improve 
the organic experience the advertising experience also gives an opportunity 


 

us enhance the experience in this area deeply.
 
While we talk about shopping another area where we are investing and 
building the right foundation is at Google Pay and we have great leadership 
there as well.
 

the growth on Google Pay has been strong and so being able to bring all of 
that together along with strong players like PayPal et cetera will help us give 
great experience for our users here.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, 


 
echo 


 
leading the effort, and as 
Sundar said at the outse
t, one of the priorities is creating sustainable 
financial value and we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of 

 
Dan Salmon
 
Okay. Thank you both.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. 
And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of 
America. Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Appreciated all the advertising updates in March, just wondering your 

o
n workloads or a slowdown in the new customer pipeline? And then maybe 
Sundar, if you could talk about what could be the benefit for cloud as we get 
to the other side of this more work from home or just other things and 
secular changes in cloud that might 
come about from this? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 

obviously making a lot of progress both across GCP and G Suite and we find 

s from a 
deeper standpoint so we see overall momentum. There are cases where 
even though the deal trajectory is the same and we have the wins. Things 
are taking a bit longer, naturally as you would expect.
 
Our customers are impacted for moments like this t
oo so I would say, time 
to closing some larger deals are impacted. But the companies, if anything, 
all the way at a CEO level, are thinking about the shift to digital in a deeper 

 
Obviously, 
consumption gets impacted depending on the sectors which 
companies are in. And so that has some correlation with the general 

to wait and see how it develops. But the teams are doing
 

area where we are committed to the course we are on and investing deeply 
for the long run.
 
Ruth Porat
 


p
erformance for both GCP and G Suite. And the dynamics affecting cloud are 

comments with little more on G Suite and some of our opening comments, in 
this work
-
from
-
home environment 

from governments and companies looking for work
-
from
-
home solutions.
 
So just to add one more example, Cambridge Health Alliance is a U.S. health 
system with a 140,000 patients. And they relied on G Suite to support
 
their 
staff and caregivers during COVID
-
19, helping them connect across 


 
Justin Post
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And ou
r next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore 
ISI. Your line is now open.
 
Kevin Rippey
 
Hi, thanks for taking the question guys. One for Sundar and then one for 

seeing within
 
direct response piece of YouTube, like are there specific factors 

 
And then the question for Ruth, you highlighted that this has given you an 
opportunity to refocus on cost disc
ipline. It looks like that the capital returns 
by way of buyback remain quite strong in the quarter. Has this affected your 
thoughts on buybacks and capital returns going forward? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Maybe stepping back, I would say, we are overall seein
g strong momentum 
on YouTube. People are turning to YouTube. Our watch
-
time has increased 
across the board. People are also looking for our authoritative news content. 
Viewership on YouTube has increased significantly compared to last year or 
two.
 
So in ma
ny ways through the pandemic, people are using YouTube. And the 
trends are global across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific as well. On 
direct response, I do think, I think people are 

 

who have been investing are seeing that i
t is cost effective, and so, over 
time more people are looking at it.
 
Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers 
understand the opportunities there, and so being able to bring all of that to 
bear. In the case of App Campaigns, we h
ave done it with Universal App 


simple holistic solution, so all of that is impacting.
 
I mentioned gaming earlie
r. When you think about things like unboxing and 
product reviews, those are natural home for transactions as well. I earlier 
mentioned about all the work we are doing now on commerce. All of that, I 
am looking forward to those integrations coming into YouT
ube and working 
better as well.
 
And so, those are some of the longer
-
term opportunities. We are working 
hard to get the experience right and building the right foundation for the 
future.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then on your second question on capital returns, we believe a share 
repurchase program for us appropriately sized is responsible on the current 
environment based on our capital allocation framework and our cash 
balance. So in the beginning of the year,
 
I indicated that we expected to 
repurchase shares at a pace at least consistent with the fourth quarter on 
the remaining authorization and that remains our view for the second 
quarter.
 
Operator
 
Thank you and our final question comes from the line of Mark 
Mahaney from 
RBC. Your line is now open.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay, thanks. In terms of the 

 
maybe less worse or somewhat positive 
trends at the end, you mentioned this recovery or modest move up in 
consumer commercial search queries, have you also seen a small 
i
mprovement in advertiser interest in running campaigns? I think you said 
both of those factors kind of deteriorated in March.
 
One of them came back. Did the other come back too? Did you also see 
advertisers starting to come back? And then, secondly, the Yo
uTube result in 
the March quarter was phenomenally strong given what happened in the 
month of March to YouTube. Is that a comp issue? Was the comp much 
easier? It sounds as like January, February could have been up strong 40% 
year
-
over
-
year. So is there an
y color? Is that just comps, easy comps, or 
was there something that fundamentally changed that cause that kind of 
material acceleration? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 

not extrapolate fro



 
Sundar Pichai
 
Yeah, maybe just to reiterate what was said earl
ier and I said that Search 
tends to 

 
people respond to changes in Search faster, brand trail. So brand 
is maybe slower to change both on the downside and the upside. And Search 

But overall, look, we see a vibrant system. Advertisers are definitely very 
engaged and looking at it. And we are seeing active conversations between 

demand shifts and how they can
 
respond.
 
And so, overall, I see the 

 
both from users, users are engaging with 
Google, YouTube and our core products and services. And while, obviously, 

engagement from advertisers across 
our products and with our teams has 
been very robust.

Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, Ellen. And welcome to 2015 everyone. Before we get into the 
numbers, I am going to 
give a brief overview of our performance this 

say, that we saw continued strength in our core advertising business. This 
was really driven by a strong holiday and mobile perfo
rmance from our Sites 
line. We saw a great momentum in our programmatic business highlighted 
by our mobile display and our ads platform product. But we also faced a few 
real challenges as well.
 
On the revenue side, clearly as you heard out the strengthenin
g of the U.S. 
dollar resulted in a gross negative currency impact of $616 million just into 
Q4. But thanks to our hedging program the net impact was actually 
attenuated, with a net revenue impact of $468 million. Also on the Other 
Revenue line not only did
 
we see that negative currency impact really impact 
the Play growth, particularly in Japan, but also while the Nexus 7 was very 
well received as a new phone, we had real issues and unable to secure 
sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had foreca
sted. So for both 
these factors in fact, we see lower other revenue growth this quarter.
 
On the expense side, we had number of unusual charges to our operating 

we go through the c
onversation. But together these items added up to 
slightly over $300 million in expenses to our P&L.
 

estate purchases in Q4, which helped us relieve both pressure on our work 
spac
e for current employees but also to accommodate our future growth. 
And this also resulted in a large sequential increase in our real estate capital 

dive into the details?
 
Our gross to
tal consolidated revenue grew 15% year

over

year to $18.1 
billion, and it was up 10% quarter

fluctuations our gross consolidated revenue growth would have, in fact, been

Google Sites

Network revenue was up 6% year

s a reminder, our network business includes really 
two types of businesses with different growth profiles, our legacy AdSense 

policy changes for the benefit of our user experience, bu
t which has 
negatively impacted the growth in clicks specifically.

On the network side, net

over

year 6% and 10% quarter
-
over

quarter for the reasons I mentioned. 
Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factor
s. 
They include geographic mix, device mix, property mix, FX, as well as 
ongoing product and policy changes.
 
Turning to geographic performance, if you go to our earning slides, which 

n 
down our revenues by US, UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX 
and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for 
the exact calculations. So despite large currency headwinds we saw solid 
performance from our core adverti
sing business around the world. The US 
revenue was up 14% year
-
over
-
year to $7.9 billion. The UK was up 10% 
year
-
over
-
year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX term it actually grew to 11% 
year
-
over
-
year.
 
Non
-
US revenue excluding the UK was up 18% year
-
over
-
ye
ar to $8.6 
billion, accounting for 47% of total revenue.
 
And in fixed FX terms in fact the rest of the world grew at healthy 24% year
-
over
-
year. So let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were 
$3.6 billion or 22% of advertising revenue. Our 
non
-
GAAP other costs of 
revenue was $3.1 billion in Q4, which exclude SBC as well. Our non
-
GAAP 
operating expenses totaled $5.8 billion, again excluding stock
-
based 
compensation. And as a result our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $5.6 
billion and non
-
GAAP o
perating margins were 31% in Q4.
 
As I mentioned at the beginning, we had a number of unusual operating 
expenses that impacted us this quarter. We typically review our estimates 
accounting policies and balance sheet on an ongoing basis and make 
adjustments 

out these, but because they totaled slightly over $300 million this quarter, I 

providing a lot of detailed break
-
out.
 
So f
irst we took approximately half that amount in compensation charges 
resulting from a one
-
time payment and reclassification between SBC and 
bonus expense. The other half came from a review of our real estate 
portfolio, where we decide to take write
-
down on 
a small number of assets 
and also one
-
time payment to buy out a number of leases in a couple of 
markets where we face acute space pressure.
 
Headcount was up, but just over 2,000 in Q4. In total we ended the quarter 
with approximately 53,600 full
-
time emplo

effective tax rate was 16%, again another discrepancy for Q4, which was 
really, primarily impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credits for 2014 
with the entire credit being taken in Q4. As well as continued mix shift f
rom 
earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
 
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was 
$128 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the 
continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging 
programs. For more 
detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR 
website.
 
We are pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.4 billion. Our 
CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion. And this quarter, most of the CapEx 
wa
s spent on related to facilities, production equipment, and datacenter 
construction in that order. So as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we have 
been opportunistic about acquiring space in real estate where we need to 
relieve pressure and accommodate for fu
ture growth.
 
To that end, our facilities expenditure included just over $900 million of real 
estate investments during the quarter, of which $585 million was related to 
the acquisition of our property in Redwood City that we disclosed in our 10
-
Q 
for the t
hird quarter.
 
Our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, and I also want to note that we 
completed in Q4 the sale of Motorola Mobile to Lenovo in October 29. We 
recognize a gain on disposition of $740 million net of tax, which is included 
in our net income from discontinued o
perations. So there you have it, 
despite a noisy quarter from a P&L perspective. We can say that we had 
strong results in our core business as evidenced by our 18% fixed FX growth 
this quarter and are well
-
positioned for the year ahead in the long
-
term.
 
As
 
Larry says, although the vast majority of our resources in time continue 
to be invested in our core products, we also have enthusiasm to invest in 
new promising ideas like Self
-
Driving Cars or Loon. We use the same 
disciplined approach to these new areas 
that we used for investing in our 
earlier bets like Android or Chrome or Display.
 
Our projects start with small dedicated teams that are given clear milestones 
to hit before they can get further investments. And in cases where we 
achieve success against ou
r milestones, we expand our investments, and 
you saw this as an example earlier this week with our Fiber teams. We 
greenlighted 18 cities in four metropolitan areas in the U.S., out of the 34 

f to the 
races.
 

are still a lot of promise. We might ask them to take a pause and take the 
time to reset their strategies, as we recently did in the case of Glass. And in 
those s


us do this time and time again.

a year of significant investment growth, both in CapEx and OpEx at 

balance between growth and discipline and the willingness to throw a little 
back when we reached the limits of what
 
we believe we can manageably 

specifics on the successful performance of our core and new businesses.

Omid Kordestani
 
Thanks, Patrick. Hi, everyone, happy New Year. And thanks for joining us 

glad to be here to reflect on the last quarter and look ahead to 2015.
 
2014 ended 
with healthy momentum enabling us to achieve $66 billion in 
revenue for the year. In Q4, we launched Lollipop, our newest version of 
Android, refreshed our line of Nexus devices and introduced Inbox by Gmail, 
a new inbox that enables users to focus on the 
messages that matter most 
to them.
 
Meanwhile our sales teams worked diligently with our advertising partners to

about the stores
 
and goods near them. We launched some exciting updates 
last quarter. In October, we announced local availability for product listing 
ads and local store front, products that give customers real time information 
about goods that are in stock close to where
 
they are.
 

ads during the holidays. Overall, we saw strong engagement and results 
from big
-
box retailers during the holiday season. A second priority has been 
the creation of new m
easurement tools. We recently added estimated store 
visits to our estimated total conversations measurement suite. Now, 
advertisers can see a reliable estimate of the number of times a search ad 
click drive the store visit.
 
During the holidays, ULTA Beauty
 
reported that 12% of clicks on search ads 
led to a store visit with significant gains in ROI from their AdWords search 
marketing spend. These mobile
-
specific metrics help advertisers measure 
the full impact of their mobile marketing.
 
The third area of pro
gress is apps. We have driven hundreds of millions of 
app downloads on Google Search, AdMob and YouTube. And this business 
continues to grow at a healthy clip.
 
During the holiday season, Office Depot used Google Search Ads to promote 
their ElfYourself app 
that helps shoppers create videos of people re

imagined 
as dancing elves. By using Google Search Ads they saw a 65% conversion 
rate. We have recently enabled users to more seamlessly navigate between 
apps and the web and find what they are looking for in a
pps more quickly.
 
In organic search 15% of signed
-

deep links to apps. We also offer app deep linking in search ads. 
Booking.com uses Google Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via 
deep linking for their mo
bile app.
 
Last quarter, we continued to see great traction with our established mobile 
advertising products as well, particularly Google Shopping. Online growth 
remains strong with Google Shopping traffic on mobile devices up nearly 
100% compared to Q4 201
3. For much of the holiday season mobile 
shopping clicks exceeded those on desktop as users increasingly made 
purchase decisions on the go.
 
Now, I would like to turn to YouTube, where we continue to deliver great 
results for brand advertisers. YouTube now 
has more than 1 billion users. 
Everyday people watch hundreds of millions of hours of video on YouTube, 
generating billions of views. Watch time is up 50% year

This was a 600%

2013. And while we are all anticipating a certain football game in Arizona 
this weekend, the action has already begun for its advertisers on YouTube.

partners. Today, all the top 10 global agencies use at least one product in 
our double click suite. Specific products within the double click suite have 
shown exceptional 
momentum. DoubleClick Bid Manager, our primary 
frontend for programmatic buying has doubled in volume over the past year.

video, the ultimate brand medium, is starting to move to 
programmatic as well. After launching in June of 2014, Google Partner 
Select, our premium programmatic video marketplace now has more than 50 
publisher partners including Hearst Television, and Food
 
Network, and 
includes brands like BMW.
 
Next, we continue to invest in measurement tools that enable advertisers, 
agencies and publishers to better understand the results of their digital 
marketing. It starts with addressing the question of viewability. No
thing else 
matters if a human did not see your ad. This is the top question for the 
industry and at Google we are doing our part to address it.
 
Since July, we have been rolling out viewability report across our ad 
platforms, so that brands will know whethe
r their video ads on digital 
channels were actually seen or not. We recently extended this activity 
reporting to video ads.
 
Large advertisers are finding technology like this to be very useful. For 

Marketing to buy their inventory 
programmatically and increased their ad viewability by 70%.
 
Once a brand knows that their ads have been viewed they need to 
determine if the right people saw those ads and if they made an impact. 

easure brand lift come in. We have run more 
than 6000 brand lift surveys to help determine brand recall and purchase 
intent.
 
For example, Mondelez wanted to measure the effectiveness of a recent 
digital campaign for the launch of a gum brand. With brand li
ft they found a 
36% lift in brand awareness versus a control group, and a 97% lift in ad 
recall versus a control group. Getting these types of feedback in real time is 
impossible with offline media. This sets digital apart.

We launched YouTube music key beta a monthly music subscription service

Thank you, Omid. Before we turn to Jamie for Q&A, I was highlighted by the

although the Nexus 7 is still a great device, what I really meant in my

was to talk about the Nexus 6, which is this amazing device that

ld. And so that has an issue on the mix. And then also think of it as a 
promising item, which is, there is areas of new products, such as Play that 
are actually stronger international than they would be in the UK or in the 
U.S. So there lies some of the di

Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I may, Patrick. You hired 2,000 people this 
quarter versus 1,700 in the same quarter last year, which is a 22% increase. 
But Google manageme
nt talks a lot about the opportunity in front of the 

more in R&D. Can you tell us what are the specific constraints that you guys 
have or imposed on yourselves that prevent you fr
om hiring 3,000 people 

 
The second is the following, a few quarters ago, I seem to recall you saying 
that, you did not manage the business for margins, but you managed it for 
profit growth. Yet your opera
ting income is down year
-
on
-
year and even if 
you are, the $200 million is growing very slowly. You could see how 
investors would look at that and say, well, how do you reconcile these 
things? How do you think investors should think about this trajectory of
 
operating income growth? Thank you.

each in step. On the issue of hiring, you will 
notice that relative to last quarter also, which is our third quarter is typically 
a big quarter, because we get the 
influx of the hires we do at colleges and 
otherwise. We actually decelerated from the third quarter as well. What we 
are managing for is, we just have a very high bar for hiring, if you can pass 
the bar, then we hire you. We also have capacity constraints 
on leadership, 
because there is a natural kind of number that you can kind of absorb within 

have a velocity, to have traction.
 
So there is no sense bringing 5,000 people that we c

into the teams and really make them perform it. So what we manage on the 
hiring is, we have our plans, and so we have a rate of targets of hires per 
each of the pals and the areas of the company. And then from there, the 
next hurdle i
s really about, can we find these people?
 
And then finally, just making sure that we keep this kind of balance of 
bringing at a reasonable rate, so that we can actually absorb them in the 
company without losing the velocity and the culture of the place. So
 



 
On the issue of margins, look, we have different, if you think of the 
businesses in Google, we are
 
looking for growth, we are looking for growth 
in revenue, we are looking for growth in operating profits absolute dollars, 

solve for.
 
So you have an advertising business that may hav
e higher margins, lower 
capital intensity, than say, another business, which maybe Play, which has 
much lower margins, great prospect for growth with very large pools of 
revenue and margins available and we go after them for sure. You have 
Fiber right, and
 
in the access, which is a completely different kind of capital 
intensity. But, again, the question is, does it promise, or does it have a case 
for large dollars operating profit delivery and high revenue and then a 

manage it.
 
And to kind of say, okay, well, we have what we have today, but if Play 
could grow at, just to take the case, ten times faster than it is doing right 
now, right, it would impact margin, because on the weighted average basis, 
it would drag it dow
n, but we love it. We love to be able to grow Play ten 

manage them each individually for their potential, their returns, we all look 
for these big margin pools and these big revenue p
ools, and then we just

Thanks a lot for the question. I have two. Patrick, given the importance of 
Google stock price as a motivator for existing employees, for 
recruitment of 
new employees. I think, many investors out there wonder if we are getting 
closer to a point where it might be a wise use of resources to return capital 
to shareholders. Other large tech companies do it, nearly all the media 
companies do, at 
what point would you and at what point would the board of 
Google consider capital returns?
 

browser on Mozilla from Google to Yahoo! in the quarter, and going forward 
is there any 
way you can quantify the impact of that? And the investors also 
wondering, is it possible that could happen for your Safari agreement with 
Apple? Thanks a lot.

Thanks for taking the questions. One on device mix, which, Omid, you called 
out. Is there any sense you can give us of w
hether some of the pricing per 


starting to see any impact of pricing continues to move up versus desktop 
pricing y

around that. And then second, Patrick, you called out the FX impact in the 
Q4, any help you can give us on how we should be thinking about the FX 
impact going forward on their a gross or a ne
t basis to the business as you 
see it versus spot today? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

 
Omid Kordestani
 
Sure. Thanks, Eric for the question. The way we look at this, as I said, we 
look at mobile and as a behavior today really as 
-
 
versus a specific device. 
And people are using screen interchangeably, simultaneously throughout the 
day. And we really think about the user and the context rather than a 
particular form factor or device. 
And similarly in terms of the pricing model 
here, what we are focused on really building this ecosystem just the way 
desktop took a long time to develop and have the right ad formats that 

at this 
the same way.
 
We are developing different kinds of formats, working with marketers on 
mobile, estimated store visits, app install, app re
-
engagement ads and cross 

and our s
ales team and advertiser agencies partners are working with us 
making rapid progress here.
 
So unfortunate, I can disclose any specific breakdowns, but I can just say 
that we are very focus on all aspects of this just as we evolve to desktop 

 
same in this world. On to you, Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you. On the issue of FX, I think that the most important point to think 
about in Q4 is 
-
 
I mean it was material. As I said, it was like on a gross basis 

deterioration of the euro, the GDP, the 

our results in Q4, I mentioned this in the past that, our FX rates are set at 
Google a month in arrears. So in last week of November we wo
uld have set 

January.
 

certain areas, especially the euro, and the yen. So, all I can say is for all the 
informatio

 
And I think that everybody should be kind of considering it. On the flipside of 
that, I just want to kind of reinforce the fact that our FX hedging program 

ch is in a low volatility 
environment we buy insurance. And in moments where we have such shocks 


revenue. I
t just happens that we book the profits to revenue, because of the 
accounting rules.
 

which is actually quite a substantial amount on the total $600 million and 

ge benefits through the course of the year to a 
certain extent. So I think that from that perspective, right, real hit in 
December additional, but in a good position from our hedge FX program.

Ross Sandler
 
Great. I had two questions. Patrick, towards the end of the prepared 
remarks you said that Google show
 
a balance of growth and discipline, and a 
willingness to throw a little back. Can you just elaborate on that comment? 
What do you mean when you say that? Are you referring to the pace of 
expense growth or throwing something back in terms of capital alloca
tion, 
just a little clarity on that one?
 
And then, Omid, the question on app indexing, I think you guys said in 
November that log
-
in searches have about 15% coverage in terms of app 
content. Where is that percentage today and when do you guys think it will
 
be closer to 100%? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Ross, let me 
-
 

Omid answer the second.
 
On the first one, all I wanted to highlight to our investors, shareholders and 
community at large is, as I 
said, 2014 was a year of significant investment 
growth. I mean, we see real potential in so many areas that are exciting to 
us and where we see great momentum. That 
-
 
what I wanted to make sure 
is that, our investors continue to understand that we will pus
h for growth, 



and we continue
 
to monitor it quite closely.
 

have the confidence that when we manage these investments we do it in the 

circumspect
ion to make sure that you get the best bang for your buck in 
these roll
-
outs.
 


situation, given all of the res

-
over
-
year growth, in our sites if you just look at the sites, which is the core of the 
business growing 18% year
-
over
-
year, despite all the FX headwinds, right?
 
It just tells you, look, this is a license to continue to
 
invest smartly in the 
way we do, but I just want to kind of reaffirm to you that we do it in smart 

waste our shareholders money.
 

rst question, please.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Yes. Thanks, Ross. So as I said in my opening remarks that 15% of signed
-

focused on this is that we have opened up app indexing to all 
Android 
developers, so their apps can appear in searches, also linking directly to the 
right content in the apps. And it really becomes the job between the 
developers trying to understand intent and how obviously our research 
works and determining the best
 
results to provide, including the deep links. 
We offer this deep linking and search ads as well. Booking.com use Google 
Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their 
mobile approximately, and we are seeing more and more adoption
 
like this 
by our advertisers.
 

are very pleased to the traction we are having and how mobile monetization 
is performing. Thank you.

Benjamin Swinburne
 
Thank you. Patrick, just going back to return of capital again, there was

 

bill to allow repatriation of 

how you and the board would think about return of capital, or is that sort of 
a completely relevant separate point?
 
And then second, for me 
-
 
for either
 
of you, any color you can share with us 
on your wireless ambitions, I think, both on the MVNO side and 3.5 
gigahertz, there has been a lot of discussion in the press about what Google 
is up to, any update you can give us on that, would be great?
 
Patrick P
ichette
 
So, on the second question, thank you for your questions, Ben. And on the 


going on, I mean, we
 
just would be 
-
 
my PR team would be really busy. So 

 
On the first question, on return on capital, absolutely, I mean, we have right 
now a mix of, kind of, roughly 60
-
40 between our U.S. 40, international 60 
of
 
our cash. We have good use for our cash in both places. But if, in fact, we 
had a lot more flexibility about repatriating cash, that would make a big 

consideration for sure in 


there is anything you can do to get that thing through Congress, Ben, we 
would really love it and just let us know when that 
happens.

I will call my Congress person. Thank you.

commerce 
over the last few years with Google Shopping and Express. I was hoping you 
could give us an update on Google Wallet and how strategic that is to your 
business overall and kind of closing t
he loop payments in general.
 
And then secondly, can you comment, Patrick, on whether there is just 
anything in particular in driving the gap that we saw on sites between paid 
click volume and CPCs beyond some of the normal mix shift issues and FX? 
Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 


-
 
I want to 
come back on the sites issue, because 25% and then the minus 8% in terms 
of 

always the case when people kind of just focus on one, they 
-
 
we kind of 


ry strong in sites this quarter, so never 
look at them in isolation.
 
Having said that, as I said in my prepared remarks, the monetization metrics 
for sites has all the factors that I kind of usually discuss, which is 
geographic, device, property, the FX an
d all the things I talk about. So I 
think, it would be misguided again this quarter to pin it down to just one 

FX. And but I would like to point out three things specifically th
is quarter.
 
As we know as I already mentioned right, FX has been a big impact this 
quarter. I also noted the strength of mobile performance in our sites earlier. 
And I remind you that, our sites line also includes YouTube, where we 
continue to see impressi
ve growth, both in developed countries and 
emerging markets.
 
So, there is the rest of it, there is all these pieces, but these are some of the 
pieces that we should take note during this quarter. Does that make sense? 
I will turn it over to Omid, to answer
 

with Google Shopping et cetera?

actions, quickly, 
easily and enabling businesses to connect and retain these 
customers. On payments, the goal is really to remove all the friction that 

working on here is, move beyond just tap and pay and 
have a full functional 
payment system.
 
Today, users can send to money to friends through Gmail using their wallet 
app and also just made this functionality available in the UK. Loyalty, gift 
cards can be stored on the Wallet app to buy with Google 
button makes it 
possible for users to purchase with two clicks. So we really are focused on 
building a rich offering here to make it easier to shop and pay and remove 
the friction. Thank you, Doug.

s are 
very pleased with it. And we also have local inventory apps that enable 
merchants to show customers this information in the U.S., UK, France, 
Germany, Japan, and Australia, and obviously we are going to continue to 
expand that.
 
As I said in my remark
s, we added estimated store visits in December, and 

to give you some anecdotes with customers, PetSmart saw 10% to 18% of 

vesting more in Ads 
to reach customers across multiple screens, Famous Footwear nationwide 
chain have 1,100 stores. They found that 15% to 17% of the clicks on Ads

if you broke out that nonperformance adve

that data point would be very helpful. The CPC trends on sites that

factors, could you just clarify that, or could you quantify what CPC sites, 
CPSs would have been year

k, there is 


about what you want to do differently with YouTube, going forward to the 
next few years? Thank
 
you.

Q2. Look, as I mentioned just a minute ago, if you look at the sites CPCs, we

a big impact. As I mentioned right, the different properties on our sites, 

growing in emerging markets, as 
well as in its core more developed markets.
 

side, I think, we see continued strength in mobile. And so from that

up to the desktop, which its
elf as 
always improving, but we see positive trend there. So it is the mix of all 

-
by

answer for that one, Mark. Sor

answer the question on YouTube.
 
Omid Kordestani
 
Sure. So first of all, in general, just to give you sense of this, as you said, 

time 
with customers as well. And there is just tremendous excitement about 
YouTube, and over 1 billion people come to the service every month and 
YouTube mobile revenue is up more than 100% year
-
to
-
year. And what 

 
brand, GRP brand list, other 
metrics, and advertisers are already running brand list studies about 6,000 
of them have done this with that 
-
 
already with us.
 

enjoy to create and 
deliver content to a worldwide audience, and our 
investments in the service and the creators just continue to pay back for us. 
So I know based on my meetings, I spent a lot of time with consumer goods 
companies at CES with major agencies there. Everybody j
ust wants to do 
more. There are a lot of success stories the way they engage with us. And 
for us the challenge frankly is to structure our sales organization, hire the 
right people to go deeper with these customers with our agencies. And so 

 
a lot of success and emphasis from us as we go after the 
branding dollars.

And then, secondly, sorry, if I missed this. But how should we be thinking 
about the strategic and th
e financial importance of search partnerships like, 
for instance, the Safari deal. And if there is anything that we should be 
reading into the recent changes at Mozilla, and I think before that Spotlight 
and Siri search as far as either Google strategy and
 
thinking in this area or 

 
Patrick Pichette
 

flip it over to Omid to answer the Wallet one. So on the issue of 

-
 

of our strategy, because that actually gives us distribution, distribution is 
good. And so we also we look for partnerships in many spaces.
 
Partnerships have to be win
-
wins, a


piece of the strategy, which is, as I said earlier, building amazing product, 
because if you build the amazing products then people want to 
distribute 
you product.
 

do this amazing job through the knowledge graph and all of the other 
elements of search, and no matter what the device, no matter the location, 
no matter the t

and 10 clicks less than it was before and then even faster and better all the 

then people will find the way to get the Goo

So, yes, partnerships matter. But at the core of it, you need partnership,

Hi, Mark, I already addressed this a little earlier, but

Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Fourth 
Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the 
conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Ellen West
 

quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth 
Porat and Sundar Pichai.
 
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today regarding our business performance and operations and our 
expected level of capital exp
enditures may be considered forward looking 
and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer 
to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10
-
K 
filed with the 
SEC.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the 
public through our Inves
tor Relations Web site located at abc.xyz/investor.
 
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Ellen. We have a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 
billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments 
to d
eliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our 
advertisers, partners and enterprise customers.
 
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion or up 22% year
-
on
-
year 
and up 23% in constant currency, as we continue to benefit from
 
ongoing 
strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud 
and Desktop Search.
 
For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a 
consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year
-
over
-
year changes. I will 
then review results for Google followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with 
our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after 
which we will take your questions.
 
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial 
pe
rformance for the quarter: our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a 
negative currency impact year
-
over
-
year of $724 million or $600 million 
after the impact of our hedging program.
 
Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our 
perfor
mance was strong again in all regions: U.S. revenues were $18.7 
billion, up 21% year
-
over
-
year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% 
year
-
over
-
year in both reported and constant currency terms with a slight 
headwind primarily from the euro.
 
APAC revenu
es were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in 
constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar. Other 
Americas revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16% year
-
over
-
year and up 26% in 
constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazi
lian real and the 
Argentine peso.
 
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll 
discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.5 billion, up 
34% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses.
 
The key drivers were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, 
mostly for our advertising supported content in what is a seasonally strong 
quarter for YouTube, but also for ou
r newer subscription businesses, 
YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher CAC as a percentage 
of revenues. Second, costs associated with our data centers and other 
operations, including depreciation and, third, hardware related costs for our 
made b
y Google and Nest family of products.
 
Operating expenses were $13.2 billion, up 27% year
-
over
-
year. The biggest 
increase was in R&D expenses, with the larger driver being headcount 
growth, followed by the accrual of compensation expenses to reflect 
increas
es in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Growth in Sales 
and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount 
primarily for Cloud and Ads followed by advertising investments mainly in 
Search and the Assistant. The growth in
 
G&A expenses reflects mostly 
increases in headcount.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled $2.3 billion. Headcount at the end of the 
quarter was 98,771, up 4,399 from last quarter. Consistent with prior 
quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and pr
oduct managers. 
In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in 
Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
 
Operating income was $8.2 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating 
margin of 21%. Other income and expense was $1.9 b
illion, which includes 
$1.3 billion of unrealized gain related to a non
-
marketable debt security 
investment. We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our 
earnings press release.
 
Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, refl
ecting a discrete 
benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated 
guidance associated with the U.S Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and 
earnings per diluted share were $12.77.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash Cap
Ex for the quarter 
was $7.1 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating 
cash flow was $13 billion with free cash flow of $5.9 billion. We ended the 
quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $109 billion.
 
Let me n
ow turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google 
segment. Revenues were $39.1 billion, up 22% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of 
the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27 billion in the quarter, up 
22% year
-
over
-
year. In terms of dollar
 
growth, results were led again by 
mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop 
search. Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year
-
on
-
year reflecting 
the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager.
 
Other revenues for
 
Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year
-
over
-
year fueled 
by Cloud, Hardware and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics 
in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume 
dynamics of our advertising businesses.
 
Total traffic
 
acquisition costs were $7.4 billion or 23% of total advertising 
revenues and up 15% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC as a percentage of total 
advertising revenues was down year
-
over
-
year, primarily reflecting a 
favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. 
The increase in the sites' 
TAC rate year
-
over
-
year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which 
carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements offset by the 
seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth 
quart
er.
 
In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year
-
on
-
year, primarily due to our 
revenue mix shift within our programmatic business. Google stock
-
based 
compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 22% year
-
over
-
year. 
Operating income was $9.7 billion, 
up 13% versus last year and the 
operating margin was 24.8%.Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.8 billion, 
reflecting investments in office facilities, datacenters, and servers.
 
Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full
-
year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for 
Other Bets over a longer
-
term horizon, as we've discussed on prior calls. 
Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.
 
For the full
-
year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595
 
million, up 25% 
versus 2017 primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for 
Other Bets was $3.4 billion for the full
-
year 2018 versus an operating loss of 
$2.7 billion in 2017. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $181 million, down from 
$493 million 
in 2017 primarily reflecting investments in Fiber.
 
Key recent accomplishments include: in December, Waymo launched Waymo 
One, which enables participants to use its app to hail and pay for rides. Also 
Verily recently announced a $1 billion investment round 
led by Silver Lake as 
it advances on plans that are complementary and additive to its current life 
sciences portfolio. That investment of course was in addition to the $800 
million it raised from Temasek previously.
 
Let me close with some 
observations on our priorities and longer
-
term 
outlook. First, with respect to revenues. Our 23% revenue growth in 2018 
was powered in particular by the ongoing benefit of innovation in our Sites 
business. With eight products, with more than 1 billion user
s each and more 
people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to 
continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.
 
In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine 
learning capabilities acr
oss our businesses. In our advertising business, 
machine learning has enabled innovation in advertisers ability to match 
consumer intent into bit more effectively for improved ROI. It has also 
enhanced the ability of smaller businesses to benefit from adve
rtising on our 
platforms.
 
Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, 
like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most 
notably Waymo and Verily. Looking ahead, a couple of things to note. First, 

advertiser experience because we make changes with a focus on the best 
interest of users and advertisers over the long
-
term, the timing of the 
introduction of new experiences, particula
rly, in search advertising can vary 
which can result in an impact on quarterly year
-
on
-
year growth.
 
Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turn to 
headwinds in the third and fourth quarters, in line with the strengthening of 
th
e U.S dollar. Based on the continuing strengthening of the U.S dollar, we 
expect a headwind to reported versus fixed FX results in the first quarter, in 
contrast to the favorable impact of FX in the first quarter of 2018.
 
Turning to investments and profita
bility. In terms of gross margin, the 
biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition 
costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact 
that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. As we
've 
discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year
-
on
-
year growth in Sites TAC 
as a percentage of sites revenues, slowed after the first quarter of 2018. We 
do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year
-
on
-
year, reflecting 
ongoing strength in
 
mobile search.
 
Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize 
resources for longer
-
term growth in sizable markets. You'll see us continue 
to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain 
concentrated in R&D.
 
Although we expect the growth rate to moderate in 
2019. In 2018, we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new 
businesses outside of Google, our Other Bets with a model of independence.
 
While I've said previously that there is no monolithic ap
proach to how the 
Other Bets execute against opportunities, a shared principle is aligning 
employee interest with the long
-
term value creation by these companies. 
Since inception, this has been an important part of our approach at Google 
with stock grants 
comprising a meaningful component of overall 
compensation across our employee days.
 
We are increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets with 

seen the impact of some of those 
programs in the fourth quarter as we 
accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of 
equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur, the timing 
evaluation events is unpredictable and can vary between debts which can 
af
fect quarterly comparisons.
 
Finally, on capital allocation. Our primary use continues to be to support 
organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for 
acquisitions. After taking these needs into account, our Board has authorized 
the
 
repurchase of up to an additional 12.5 billion of our Class C capital stock.
 
With respect to CapEx, we continue to invest in both compute requirements 
and for office facilities. Although we expect the CapEx growth rate in 2019 to 
moderate quite significan
tly. In conclusion, 2018 was another great year, 
with tremendous ongoing opportunity ahead of us.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Ruth. Last year, we set out to bring the benefits of AI to everyone 
through our products. And I
'm proud of the tremendous progress we made 
towards that goal. From smart compose and Gmail to the new Google news 
experience, to call screening on the pixel and improving the overall safety of 
our products. AI's helping people get things done every day. B
eyond our 
products, AI is also helping us drive our mission forward at the scale we 

 
Google Al Lead, Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post 
on our AI block. Accusing AI to better deduct the
 
spread of breast cancer, or 
providing flood victims, with real
-
time information in a crisis. I encourage 
everyone to check it out.
 
We also launched the Google AI impact challenge to help nonprofits find 
ways to use AI to solve social and environmental pro
blems. In addition to 
our progress in AI we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google 
assistant, hardware, and Cloud. And our core area such as search maps new 
use YouTube under computing and advertising platforms continue their 
strong momentu
m.
 
Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information 
accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted 
information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex 
challenge. And one that is constantly 

experience in these information challenges, and it's what we strive to do 
better than anyone else.
 
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing 
and are continuing to build privacy and sec
urity into the core of our 
products, keeping uses data safe and secure with the industry's best security 
systems and giving people better and clearer controls. You will see us 
continue to do a lot more here in 2019.
 
Today I will start by sharing some of th
e new ways that we are working 
towards our mission. Then I will give an update on our video and advertising 
platforms, followed by the latest on our hardware and cloud efforts. And I 
will close with a few thoughts on our investments around the world. First
, 
advancing our mission of making information accessible and useful. The 
Google assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout the 
day and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new 
partners and features.
 
From the Lenov
o Smart Clock that wakes you up in the morning to real
-
time 
navigation that helps during your commute. To a build in interpreter that 
translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google home. And 
speaking of languages, over the past year the Goog
le assistant expanded 
from eight languages and 14 countries to nearly 30 languages and 80 
countries. In that time, the number of active users us quadruple. As we had 
more partners, devices and capabilities, the Google assistant will only get 
better and mor
e helpful.
 
There's a lot of great progress in other areas too. Last month, we announced 
the launch of activity cards and search. Now when you search for a topic 

and pick up where you
 
left off. Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, 
Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 
billion products. So if you see an item that you like, Lens can show you 
similar designs, along with useful information like product r
eviews.
 
We continue to see great momentum across our computing platforms, 
android and chrome. In Q4, we announced that android was officially 
support affordable phones that partners like Samson introducing their first 
portable devices this year. We see con
tinued traction with manufacturer 
adoption of android auto. We recently announced new media and messaging 
features to significantly simplify and improve the car dashboard experience.
 
And building on the speed simplicity and security of chrome OS, partners 
like 
Asus and HP, introduced a slew of great consumer and enterprise 
Chromebooks last months at CES. Now let me provide an update on our 
video and advertising platforms, starting with YouTube.
 
We are seeing great traction in some of our newer experiences o
n YouTube. 
YouTube music and YouTube Premium are now available in nearly 30 
countries up from five countries at the start of 2018. Last month, YouTube 
TV announced that it is expanded nationwide to cover 98% of U.S 
households with the rest to follow shortl
y. YouTube continues to invest in its 
thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 
billion monthly log in users.
 
For instance in Q4, the expanded access to tools like stories and community 
polls that strengthen the connections b
etween France and creators. One of 
our newest tools, Premiers, is a breakout hit. Ariana Grande's premiere of 
her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for 
biggest music video debut in YouTube history earning over $55 million 
views 
in its first day.
 
We are driving revenue to the YouTube creator community from established 
channels to newly emerging ones. The number of YouTube channels with 
more than 1 million subscribers nearly doubled in the last year, and the 
number of creator
s earning five or six figures grew by more than 40% year
-
over
-
year. A big priority for YouTube in 2019 is to continue our work to 
quickly find and remove content that violates YouTube's content guidelines.
 
It's an important challenge and with advanced mach
ine learning and 
investments in human reviewers, we are making continued progress. Now I'll 
touch on some of the recent highlights of our advertising business, which 
continue to go from strength to strength. Recently, Warner Brothers 
embedded the first ful
l
-
length film with an ad on YouTube and reached a 
record number of people.
 
Over 17 million users in a single day. Viewers who watch the trailer for LEGO 
Movie 2 on Black Friday, were served the franchise's original film for free 
within the Ad. So great exa
mple of how advertisers continue to delight users 
on YouTube. Performance advertisers love TrueView for action. YouTube's 
direct response offering. Since the product launch in March 2018 over 30% 
of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to b
uying inc and 
video ads on YouTube.
 
In Q4, we also announced a global strategic ad tech relationship with The 
Walt Disney Company across their entire portfolio of brands and properties. 
With Google Ad Manager as its core platform, Disney will be able to se
rve 
across its digital property seamlessly. On the web and mobile apps through 
connected TVs and even during live events.
 
Our shopping tools, that are also front and center during the holidays, 
helping retailers reach people during the busy holiday 
shopping season. In 
fact, the number of shopping daily active users on Google.com during the 
holidays, double compared to last year. Thanks and part to new features like 
product list modules that showcase the most popular products across the 
web.
 
Small ret
ailers are also benefiting from automated bidding solutions like 
smart shopping campaigns, which now has more than 20,000 live 
merchants. Impressive progress since launching in April. Now on to our 
growing hardware efforts. During the holiday season, our n
ewest line up of 
made by Google Devices top many best of 2018 looks. The response from 
shoppers was equally positive.
 
It was another record year for our Google home family of devices, with 

 
things 
done around the house. For example, people use Google home devices to 
cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season. 1 million on Christmas Day 
alone. Our newest smart displays were particularly popular. One out of every 
seven Google home device
s activated or the holiday season was a Google 
home hub.
 
In Q4, we launched significant advances in computational photography in 

also expanded availability to four more countries:
 
Japan, France, Ireland, 
and Taiwan. And finally, our growing cloud business. I want to thank Diane 
Greene for her leadership over the last three years.
 
Google Cloud is a fast
-
growing multibillion
-
dollar business that supports 
major global 5,000 companies 
in every important vertical with a robust 
enterprise organization. This was not the case just three years ago. What 
Diane and their team accomplished, it's phenomenal. Now Diane's work is 

 
to 
have him here as our new Cloud leader.
 
Google Cloud closed out the strong year, with momentum across the 
business. Last year, we more than doubled both the number of Google Cloud 
platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contrac
ts 
signed. We also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million 
paying customers for our cloud collaboration and productivity solution G 
suite. Our focus on helping customers digitally transform their businesses is 
paying off.
 
We continue to se
e strong growth in all our major geographies and 
industries this quarter. In financial services, we signed agreements with two 
of the top financial institutions in the U.S to help them transition their 
business to Google Cloud with our highly secured solut
ions. In retail, brands 
like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to 
manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumer.
 
In Media and Entertainment, the telegraph and the U.K's going all in with 
Google Cloud because of 
our data and machine learning expertise. To 
support our global growth, in Q4, we launched our 18th Google cloud region 
and announced plans for a new region in Jakarta. So as you can see we are 
investing in the many incredible opportunities across our busin
ess. We would 
also investing in communities around the world and right here at home. I 
was recently in Europe opening up our new office in Berlin, which will help us 
more than doubled the number of Googlers who work there.
 
Across Europe, we've invested mor

since 2007. And in Q4, we announced a new data center coming in 
Denmark. In all, it's estimated that these data centers have generated more 

ed 
by our creator, publisher and app developer partners across the region is 
orders of magnitude larger.
 
We also continue our substantial investments throughout the U.S. Last year, 
we made significant investments in new and expanded office space. In Q4, 
we
 
open the doors to our new office in Detroit and announced that we will be 
investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus 
in New York City, which will begin to open in 2020.
 
We are also continuing to invest in data center const
ruction and expansion. 
There is an important long
-
term investment that lay the groundwork for our 
future computing needs primarily to x
-
rayed machine learning across our 
businesses. But also to support the opportunities we see in cloud, search, 
ads and You
Tube. More than 20 years in there is still tremendous 
opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow 
their businesses and build stronger communities. I want thank every Googler 
around the world for making 2018, a great year for use
rs and our business.
 
With that I'll hand it back over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.
 
Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric 
Sheridan of UBS
. Your line is now open.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thank you so much for taking the question. Two, if I could. On YouTube, you 
never have a number of brands in the marketplace between YouTube 
Premium, TV, YouTube Music. How are you thinking about positioning those 
bra
nds against a global opportunity, especially in mobile to consume media 

opportunity. And then, Ruth, I wanted to come back to comment on revenue 
versus extends with respect to YouTube. It so
unds like called out YouTube 
as strong in the quarter on the revenue side, but is depressed on the 
expense side. Was that because of licensed content for things like Music and 
YouTube TV, or what is ad splits? How should we think about what the 
drivers wer

Thank you so much.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks Eric. On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around 
the main YouTube product and that is what works at scale globally across 
the world and 
we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well. 
We are committed to making sure there's a premium experience on 
YouTube, delivering the content people would want and YouTube Music is an 
important part of that as well. So we're investing in bot
h. As you know 
YouTube TV is U.S only and we are definitely 
--
 
it's an exciting product. It's 
differentiated and has long run value for us because it brings our advertising 
products together including being able to serve it across TV. So we are 
clearly inv
esting in areas where we see opportunity. We are pretty thorough 
about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side. And so 
we monitored with metrics and beat engagement and revenue growth and 
we see a lot of opportunity here.
 
Ruth Porat
 
An
d then in terms of revenue it's an investment in YouTube, overall, as 
Sundar said, we are 
--
YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular 
change the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong 
revenue growth. Brand advertising does r
emain the largest part of the 
business. It's growing at a strong pace and as I said in opening comments, 
we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response 
both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering a great value 
for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and 
channels. In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within 
other cost revenues. The primary driver in the fourth quarter was the 
increase in content acquisition cos
ts due to YouTube growth and that's both 
for ad supported content and what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. 
And also for our newer subscription businesses, which do have higher TAC as 
a percentage of revenue we're excited about the growth we're se
eing here.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of 
Evercore. Your line is now open.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. One for Ruth and one for 
Sundar. Ruth, if I look at the segment oper
ating losses for Other Bets, they 
were higher both in the fourth quarter and for the year '18 over '17. Is it 
safe to assume that investments at Waymo or can you just flush out a little 
bit more for us if possible, were there other Other Bets besides Waymo
, 
which were worthy of call out in terms of greater or decreasing investment. 

provide us any commentary about how good the Cloud is going? Any 
milestones? You talked about the invest
ment there. Ruth did, I think, in 
terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles and for the new 
leadership that you mentioned what is the things that the new 
--
 
that 
Thomas Kurian can kind of do Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth 
in that
 
business. Thank you so much.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in terms of the investment levels in Other Bets, the major point is that 
we are investing across Other Bets commencement with what we think is 
required kind of looking out at the opportunity set for each one. 
And we go 
through a regular process with weekly business reviews and quarterly board 
reviews and try and calibrate the appropriate pace of investment. In terms 
of the increase this quarter, as I indicated in opening comments, we accrued 
some comp expenses 
for a number of bets and that was really to reflect 
increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On Cloud, one of the things that was evident towards the end of last year is 
now our inability to win in a very large customers gl
obal 5,000 companies 
with multiyear contracts. And so that's definitely something we want to focus 
on. I think Dyne and Thomas have been working closely on a transition with 
a lot of continuity, and you'll continue to see us. It's very clear to us that our
 
product offerings are ready and differentiated and so we want to invest and 
scale our go
-
to
-
market both in terms of direct sales and our channel 

clearly seeing returns. Be the geograp
hic regions we care about the six main 
verticals where most of the momentum is. And within product offerings, the 


tting 
large wins and I look forward to executing here.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask
 
to, first, can you 

you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you 
think are really driving things here beyond some of these underlying secular 
strengt
h, with the particular focus perhaps on the retail channel, and just 

just wanted to go back to your comment on OpEx. Just wanted to clarify, 
were you saying that headcount growth, spe
cifically you think will moderate 
in '19 or are you talking about overall OpEx spending? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Doug, on the first one, obviously we have thousands of engineers working 
on continually launching search improvements. I think for me a lot of
 
this 
has been the clear hard work that's gone into making sure search on mobile 
works really, really well removing friction where we can constantly working 
to get the answers, a bit quicker and faster and make 
--
 
making the more 
relevant. So to me it's mo
re a set of a continual innovation mentality that 

 
Ruth Porat
 

headcount growth. We are continuing to hire to s
upport growth 
opportunities, particularly hiring engineers and product managers in Google 
and continuing to support growth in Cloud, and what I was just trying to 
draw out was we will continue to hire, but the year
-
on
-
year growth rate will 
moderate there.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Okay. Thank you, both.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And then next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman 
Sachs. Your line is now open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you. Yes, I had a follow
-
up on to Anthony's questions on cloud. 

m like you want to share an update on the revenue run rate. 

terms of year
-
over
-
year growth rate, and in particular are they growing 
faster than what the competitors disclosed in their
 
public results? Because 
maybe they will help think about the pace of growth in your Cloud business. 
And then, secondarily I was just wondering if you can give us a sense of the 
types of workloads, if there's any commonality to the types of workloads, 
you 
might be running work frequently than not. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue 
growth driven by GCP and GCP does remain one of the fastest
-
growing 
businesses across Alphabet. As Sundar said, we doubl
e the number of GCT 
contracts greater than a 1 million. We are also seeing a really nice uptick in 
the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased 
with the success and penetration there. At this point, not updating further.
 
Sundar
 
Pichai
 
Heather, I think maybe specifically a couple of examples, there's definitely 
we see clear strength in data management and analytics, so we can take 
specs 
--
 
for example, in retail or if you take someone like the Telegraph, 
those very important fact
ors. Application platforms, so our ability to help 
customers, deploy cloud native applications has been a differentiator for 
customers like Unity, Ubisoft, etcetera. And Multi Cloud, ability to run cloud 
services across Clouds on Prem. In terms out to be v
ery important for global 
multinational companies like HSBC. So we do see a wide variety of stuff. We 
are clearly focused on infrastructure being an application platform, data 
management and smart analytics, and of course with G suite productivity 
and colla
boration. So that's the core areas we are investing in from a 
product and a go
-
to
-
market standpoint. And we are seeing great traction 
there.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is now open.
 
Brian No
wak
 
Thanks for taking mu questions. I have two. Just the first one to go back to 
YouTube in a very strong quarter. It sounds like on branded advertising and 
now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you 
think about with an innova
tion focus, what do you see as being one or two of 
the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the 
ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here. And then 
Waymo, got a couple of milestones. But the last 3 to 6
 
months, maybe talk 
us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really 
focused on ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is 
better platform for direct response and TrueView for action is still early. We 
see great traction, but I think there's a lot more to do and I think we had a 
set of features which we l
aunched last year to make sure it works better. But 
I think there's a lot more to do. In the long run, I think for me, YouTube is a 
place where we see users not only come for entertainment, they come to 


discover, to research and so being able to match that intent over time in a 
way that we can bring the right value for our users and advertisers. I think 
there's a long run opportunity. And we're taking all the right foundational 
steps 
to realize it.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety 
first and ensuring a great user experience, and that's why we're expanding 

service in 
the Phoenix area and we're focused on expanding both the 
number of riders in the geographic reach around Phoenix. In addition, we're 
having conversations with a number of other interested cities and we are 
continuing to explore applying our technology for 
logistics and deliveries and 
for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities, so continuing 

 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is no
w open.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks. Two questions. First, Ruth, could you just provide a little more color 
on the R&D expense build up. Anything unusual on there? Just comment on 

--
 
it's been a 
multiyear effor
t. It seems like it's accelerated. There's a series of these new 
products we try to do a report on to make sure we understood them. Could 
you talk about how the strategic and maybe the synergistic impacts that 
you're seeing of hardware on the rest of Googl
e's business, on the rest of 
Alphabet's business, and do you think that it's still early days and maybe 
paint a picture of how significant those synergies could be? Thank you very 
much.
 
Ruth Porat
 
So starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing invest
ment in 
engineers, in particular, in Google and then as I said the sizable increase in 
accrued comp for Other Bets and just build that out a bit more, give you a 
bit more color, in certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through 
equity
-
based programs
. And that's because we believe that this alignment of 
interest is valuable. We do assess valuation on an ongoing basis. And at a 
minimum, we do a formal valuation assessment once every 12 months or 
when there is a significant event. And what you're seeing
 
in the fourth 
quarter is the impact of higher valuation in certain Other Bets. And as we've 
talked about previously, a goal with the Alphabet structure is to enable us to 
build new businesses that would make a positive impact and create long
-
term value. A
nd it's still early days we're very excited about the 
opportunities we see. And so what you're seeing is the impact here of 
valuation. The way we approach it is very consistent with the way startups 
are typically valued, and that includes technical progres
s and a range of 
other items.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And Mark, on hardware, obviously, we are working hard to offer the best 
Google experience we can bringing together AI software and hardware. And 
you are right that it does have a lot of synergistic value, but at 
the stage 

using hardware to drive where the rest of the computing ecosystem is. And 
so we get a very leveraged effect there. But over time, as we scale up our 
hardware efforts and do
 
it thoughtfully, so it definitely 
--
 
when I look at the 
kind of experience we can deliver. For example, if you look at something like 
the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, 
Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you wanted
, you can definitely see 
the glimpse of the future. And so, we are investing to realize that.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. 
Your line is now open.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Okay. Sundar, ju

highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Are conversations with 
advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty 
-
-
 
increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding stra
tegies. But how has the 
pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do 
you think you can target that market without a sales force? And secondarily, 
as we talk of two companies transitioning to a Cloud, there's increased talk 
of coll
ecting data, dealing with data lakes as well as analyzing all that data 
to help their decision
-
making process. So from your standpoint running 
Google, do you feel like the current technology you have at your disposal is 
sophisticated enough to keep up with
 
all of the needs for you to run the 
company as you collect all the data from across the internet? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
I think two questions. On your first question around using machine learning 
to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer
 
advertisers, 
SMBs and local advertisers. I definitely think you highlight an exciting 

of years through universal app campaigns or smart shopping campaigns last 
year, responsive 
search ads, those are all great examples of where we 
brought ML. And with that, we made process much easier for advertisers of 
all sizes and we see an impact. So I think it's a natural extension for us to 
continue working in that direction, and that will h
elp us reach SMBs and local 
advertisers better over time. So I do think that's a good opportunity. And on 
the second part of your question, I want to make sure I understand it. If 

 
the foundation of how we do everything for the past 20 years. And we 
always 
--
 
we realize a deep responsibility that coming 
--
 
that comes with 
being stewards of users' data. So everything we design is designed with 
privacy and security in mind. It's where
 
some of our core investments go, be 
it securing our data centers, literally the practices we have across the 
company, the quality and talent in our security teams and over time using AI 
itself to do all this well. So it's a core part of what we do and we 
take it very, 
very seriously.
 
Stephen Ju
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Daniel Salmon
 
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your review of some of the 
shopping products during the fourth quarter, you didn't mention shopping 
actions. And there were reports there that Walmart decided to leave the 
program recently and I think there have bee
n some public comments on 
social media from Googlers confirming that. So I would just love to hear a 
little bit more about that. But maybe more broadly the traction of shopping 
actions and, in particular, the price per sale metric that you rolled out with 
it 
during the holiday season. And then, Ruth, just a quick one for you, if we 
could return to your prepared remarks, there were a couple of sort of things 

a headwind, but just be
fore that you were talking about how new 
experiences can rollout over time to users. And I just wanted to clarify, were 

that that is a best practice in general for Google? Thanks
.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On shopping, I think we launched shopping actions around, if I remember, 
March of last year. And we've definitely seen a strong traction there. I think 
we've seen roughly a sevenfold increase in merchants in the program since 
we launched it
. And just in Q4, we announced new partnerships with Best 
Buy, Nike, Sephora as an example. And in terms of Walmart, we have 
--
 
Walmart is one of our deepest partners and they remain a strategy partner 
across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ad
s and we have efforts 
underway to work closer together with shopping. But they are definitely a 
large partner who continue experimenting and we will support them in many 

shopping and
 
you will see us focus more there on 2019. We see users come 
to Google a lot around key shopping moments and we want to make sure we 
invest in the experience to get closer to what they want.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then on the second question, we've talked 
about this on prior calls. 
We've often talked about the fact that we have been and remain committed 
to long
-
term revenue growth through innovation. And the point I was trying 
to underscore is the timing and scale of the impact. It's inherently difficult to
 
predict. And so it can be inconsistent from quarter
-
to
-
quarter. The main 
point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and 
advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply 
machine learning to solutions.
 
Daniel S
almon
 
Great. Thank you, both.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert 
Baird. Your line is now open.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Thank you. Two quick ones for me. First on Project Stream and 
YouTube TV. Just wondering how i
mportant it will be to invest in original 
content as well as how you might view the rollout of 5G as catalyzing 
consumer adoption of these services? And then on the Discover feed, I know 

nd 
engagement to date? And if there's any way you expect to monetize that 
feed in the near future? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On Project Stream, being able to deliver gaming with the kind of real
-
time 
requirements, the low latency requirements, it's definite
ly for us 
--
 
it's an 
important computing advance. We think it will help us drive the newer 
computing platforms we're working on. And I do think, services like that will 
be a point of inflection as 5G rolls out as well. So I think it is a virtuous 
cycle. So
 
we are excited. The early feedback our Project Stream experience 
has been super positive. And so we are looking to build up on that and you 
will see us do more there in 2019. On Discover, I think traction has been for 
us, we measure user engagement and sa
tisfaction and happiness on these 
--
 
on anything new we do, and the metrics have been really strong. And we 
obviously 
--
 
we offer the best experience today on our products like Pixel, 
made by Google products. And we are looking to scale that up to reach mo
re 

synergistic to search experience. And so we are looking to bring the best of 
both to our users, and you'll see us reach more users in 2019.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank 
you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, it looks like Google core 
margins were down about 3 points and what was an easier comp. S
o just 
wondering if you can give us any thoughts on how the core advertising 
business is doing in there? We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and 
hardware and YouTube TV, but just would like to get a update on the health 
of the advertising business
 
margins. And any thoughts on if you ever do 
segment disclosure. And then the second question is just on the Cloud 
strategy. There's been a pretty big leadership change. Just wondering if 
there's any new strategies or new things you will be doing this year
 
with the 
Cloud related to the management change? And look forward to the Cloud 
Conference in April. Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks. So, in terms of overall Google margins, I think that the main point 
you're seeing in the margins as we continue to see tremen
dous opportunity 
across Google, and so we're investing to support long
-
term revenue and 

of machine learning and it is a key component of incremental investment, 
particularly, in 
CapEx for technical infrastructure to support the existing 
--
 
at 
the existing businesses, but also the newer ones, and that's kind of flowing 
through here. We've talked on prior calls that we're very mindful of the fact 
that CapEx turns into depreciation, 
which is why I single this out. We are 
continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, Search and 
Ads businesses and beyond machine learning we're further investing to 
continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's 
a
cross Mobile Desktop and YouTube. So, for example, a big priority in 2018 
was expanding the availability of content for what we call the next billion 
user markets, which are for us a really important area. We are excited about 
the growth and the opportunit
y to deliver experiences across markets. We 
are also investing to enable more visual ways of finding information, such as 
photos and videos. And then, we are investing aggressively in our newer 
businesses within Google, particularly, Cloud and Hardware as 
Sunder has 
already said. So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the 

about, a big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the 
OpEx side investing 
in engineers, in particular, for Google as well as on the 
sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, 
but in particular Cloud.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
And on the second question on Cloud, I answered it around Anthony and 
Heather's ques
tion, but to add a little bit more color, while 
--
 
maybe it's the 
change in leadership, but it was a well planned transition. And so Diane and 

a continued focus on global 5000 compan
ies. We are definitely seeing 
traction with large multiyear contracts, multimillion dollar contracts there. So 
you'll see us focused there. We will continue to invest in and expand our 
sales and distribution channels to meet customer demand, so that's goin
g to 
be an important area for 2019. But mostly being highly focused on the 15 
countries, 6 industries and the 5 major solution areas that we think will have 
the most impact and directing most of our resources towards those efforts is 
probably something you
 
will see continued emphasis in 2019.
 
Justin Post
 
Thank you.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. 
Your line is now open.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. Two questions. First, there's a lot of discussion right now about 
alterna
tives to Google Play and Apple's App Store for distribution. And some 
of the large developers are starting to come up with these workarounds 
around the App Store fees. So, I guess, just philosophically, how do you 

he right long
-
term rate for Google 
Play? And then, Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth 
moderating comments, so you have expenses growing well in excess of 
revenue for some time in the core Google segment, and 2018 was the lowest 
operating i
ncome growth since you started disclosing the segments. So are 
you just flagging this as a change of direction? Is this a material change or is 
this just a small amount of moderation in 2019? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On Google Play, obviously, we do this a
t scale, thousands of developers rely 
on it to safely and seamlessly distribute their game to billions of android 
users worldwide. And we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously 
make sure their overall experience is safe and results in high enga
gement 
and for the developer's back. So I think there's a value exchange there and 
it's been the industry standard. And so, I think we will continue down that 
path and 
--
 
but obviously always adapt to where the market is.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then in terms of 

areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long
-
term 
revenue and earnings growth and just wanted to put a fine point on both 
CapEx and headcount. So on CapEx, as I indicated in opening
 
remarks, we 
do expect the rate of year
-
on
-
year CapEx growth will slow meaningfully. So 
with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does 
require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver 
on that. In term
s of the mix, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in 
data center investments relative to servers. But the point which you asked in 
your question, the year
-
on
-
year growth rate will moderate meaningfully. 
And then, in terms of headcount, we are 
--
 
I w
as just trying to make clear 
that the growth in headcount will moderate somewhat here just so that 
there's no interpolation.

Thank you. And our final question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your 
line is now open.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thanks. For Sund
ar, the cash position has doubled the last five years to 
$109 billion. Yet in the last four years M&A has been right around $3 billion, 

core is very strong, but is there hesitation
 

valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your 
peers are doing right now?

we are always 

ery high bar, and so to me it's been more 
about us finding the right fit rather than being constrained by anything in 
particular. But I do think it's always an important part of our strategy and 
we've done great acquisitions in the past. Things like YouTub
e and android 
were big acquisitions for us. And so we continue to look for opportunities 
ahead.
 
Brent Thill
 
And real quick for Ruth, just the magnitude of spend, I think goes back to 
what probably investors were most surprised by. It sounds like from your 
perspective you don't really look at the margin structure as having any floor, 

-
term 
opportunity that you need to make these investments now. I think many are 
just trying to search for a fr
amework in how you think about this investment 
cycle we are in right now?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So the reason I started by laying out, I think, in response to the question on 
margins where we're investing and how we look at is, we are very focused 
on investing to sup
port long
-
term revenue and earnings growth. We are very 
mindful of the CapEx impacts on free cash flow and earnings growth. And so 
we're trying to get it right, over investing, under investing neither of those 
works for long
-
term value creation, but we are
 
very mindful of the pace here 
and trying to lay out work with more specificity, how we are looking at the 
opportunity set where 
--
 
and making trade
-
offs where we can.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thank you.

Thanks. Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 un
derscored the 
great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue 
growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus 
last year.
 
The primary driver was the increased use of Mobile Search by consumers, 
benefiting from
 
our ongoing efforts to enhance the Mobile Search 
experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet 
search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic 
advertising.
 
We continue to rationalize our portfolio of products to en
sure we efficiently 
and effectively focus our resources behind our biggest bets across Alphabet. 
I will present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a 
consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of 
Google and
 
Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will 
then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which 
we will take your questions.
 
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, 
total r
evenue was $20.3 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year and down 5% 
sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we 
realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year
-
over
-
year of $762 
million or $593 million after the benefit of our
 
hedging program. Holding 
currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year
-
over
-
year and declined 4% sequentially, reflecting holiday seasonality.
 
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of 
our business aro
und the globe as well as the impact that currency headwinds 
continue to have on our non
-
U.S. business.
 
U.S. revenue was up 21% year
-
over
-
year to $9.4 billion and down 9% 
versus Q4. UK revenue was up 15% year
-
over
-
year to $1.9 billion and flat 
sequentially.
 
In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 21% year
-
over
-
year and 5% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 14% versus last year to 
$9 billion and down 2% versus Q4.
 
In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year
-
over
-
year and up 1% 
sequentially. GAAP other
 
cost of revenues were $3.9 billion. Non
-
GAAP other 
cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven 
by Google
-
related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with 
operating our data centers including depreciation, content 
acquisition costs, 
primarily for YouTube and hardware costs related to sales of new Nexus, 
Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall.
 
GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter. Non
-
GAAP 
operating expenses were $6 billion or 30% of re
venue, up 11% year
-
over
-
year and down 9% versus Q4. The year
-
over
-
year growth was primarily 
driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to 
head count growth.
 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.3 billion, up 20% versus last 
year.
 
The operating margin was 26%. Non
-
GAAP operating income was $6.8 
billion, up 21% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%.
 
With respect to stock
-
based compensation, it totaled $1.5 billion, up 24% 
year
-
over
-
year, and up 4% sequentially, primarily re
flecting increased head 
count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs 
every two years. Head count at the end of the quarter was 64,115, up 
approximately 2,300 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires 
continue to be engine
ers and product managers in areas where we've 
prioritized investment, such as cloud and apps. On a numbers basis, we're 
adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis, we're 
growing faster in Other Bets.
 
Other income and expense was negative
 
$213 million. As discussed on prior 
calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items with different drivers, which 
makes it inherently unpredictable. The key drivers this quarter were the 
ongoing drag from foreign exchange, given the volatility in currency 
markets 
as well as losses recorded for marketable and non
-
marketable securities. 
These items offset interest income from our investment portfolio, which 
remains fairly consistent.
 
Our effective tax rate was 18%, reflecting the geographic mix of our income 
and adoption of a new accounting standard that reflects certain SBC tax 
benefits in GAAP earnings that were previously recognized in equity. We 
have excluded these benefits in our non
-
GAAP earnings.
 
Net income was $4.2 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.2 bill
ion on a non
-
GAAP 
basis. Earnings per diluted share were $6.02 on a GAAP basis and $7.50 on 
a non
-
GAAP basis.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was 
$2.4 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google 
segme
nt. Operating cash flow was $7.7 billion, with free cash flow of $5.2 
billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $75.3 
billion, of which approximately $45 billion, or 60%, is held overseas. This 
reflects our strong operating cash 
flow, offset by the impact of our share 
repurchases during the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google 
segment, revenue was $20.1 billion, up 17% year
-
over
-
year, which includes 
the i
mpact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was 
$14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year
-
over
-
year and down 4% 
sequentially. Year
-
on
-
year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile 
Search due to the ongoing benefit from the impro
vement in ad formats and 
delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to 
have solid growth from desktop and tablet search.
 
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven 
primarily by video advertising acros
s TrueView and Google Preferred, with a 
growing contribution from app promotion.
 
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year
-
on
-
year and down 11% 
sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset 
by the traditional network busin
esses.
 
Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year
-
over
-
year and down 
1% sequentially. Year
-
over
-
year performance was driven by Play as well as 
continued strong growth in cloud and apps and a nice contribution from 
hardware.
 
Finally, we continue
 
to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of 
the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find 
the details in our earnings press release. As a reminder, these metrics 
similarly are affected by currency movements.
 
Total tr
affic acquisition costs were $3.8 billion, or 21% of total advertising 
revenue, up 13% year
-
over
-
year and down 7% sequentially. The increase in 
both Sites TAC and Network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact 
that our strongest growth areas, nam
ely mobile and programmatic, carry 
higher TAC.
 
Operating income, excluding SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, 
for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock
-
based compensation totaled 
$1.3 billion for the quarter, up 25% 
year
-
over
-
year. Operating income 
reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.3 billion, up 21% versus last year, and 
the operating margin was 31%. CapEx for the quarter was $2 billion, 
reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center 
cons
truction.
 
Turning to Other Bets financials, as a reminder, the majority of these efforts 
are pre
-
revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities, doing so 
in a disciplined way. Because Other Bets results aggregate the revenues and 
expenses from a
 
number of businesses operating in different industries, 
there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter
-
to
-
quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them 
over a longer time horizon.
 
For Q1, Other Bets reven
ue was $166 million, up 108% versus last year. 
Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Verily and 
Fiber. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $657 million in the first quarter. 
Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $802 mil
lion. Other Bets 
CapEx was $280 million in Q1, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our 
Fiber business.
 
Look forward, a few observations, first, regarding revenue; our culture of 
innovation drives our strong revenue growth. We've talked previously ab
out 
the benefits from changes made to ad formats and delivery in the third 
quarter of 2015 and that continues to be a tailwind. Mobile, as an example, 
continues to offer sizable opportunity for revenue enhancement, given the 
increasing ubiquity of mobile u
se by consumers and the strong location and 
contextual signals from mobile devices. Although we remain intensely 
focused on innovation across Alphabet, the timing and magnitude of ongoing 
changes, obviously, are inherently uncertain and are not designed wi
th an 
eye toward quarterly schedules.
 
Second, as to expenses; within Google, we continue to be focused on 
managing the expenses that we can actually control, as you can see from 
our results again this quarter. However, the secular trends driving revenue 
ar
e accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to 
support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher 
TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our Sites and Network 
businesses.
 
Third, regarding CapEx; as we have co
nsistently said, technical 
infrastructure is a key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale and 
continue to add to it. The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that 
are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benef
it 
from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost 
effectively.
 
With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed 
to our Fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute 
in a growing num
ber of cities.
 
Fourth, about our balance sheet; as I discussed on our Q4 call, last quarter, 
we initiated steps to align our capital structure consistent with the move to 
Alphabet, providing greater flexibility as we continue to grow. Our exchange 
offer wi
ll be completed on April 25, and we have completed the move of our 
commercial paper and revolving credit facility from Google to Alphabet.
 
Finally, our strategic prioritization; as I indicated last quarter, there are a 
number of different execution paths w
e are pursuing to optimize our 
investments and opportunities. In some areas, we will be increasing 
investment if teams meet milestones we set as part of our 2016 budgeting 
process. In other areas, we've chosen to work with industry
-
leading partners 
who can
 
increase our momentum.
 
Finally, in certain areas where we have had multiple teams developing 
different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to 
rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a 
smaller, mor
e focused set of opportunities.
 
So my closing comment is that in Q1, we continued to see tremendous 
revenue growth across our businesses, and we remain focused on disciplined 
investing for the long
-
term.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.

Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Ruth. It's great to join you all today. Our teams are off to a great 
start this year and there is even more excitement in the month ahead as we 
gear up for big events, like: our annual developer conference
, Google I/O; 
our YouTube event, Brandcast; and the Google Performance Summit for 
advertisers.
 
Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it 
universally accessible and useful. And after 17 years, we have just scratched 
the surface of 
what's possible. We are reinvigorated around this mission and, 
as you will hear, we are making solid progress across many of our products.
 
Today, I'll quickly share a few highlights from the quarter, as well as some 
of the areas where we are investing to m
ake our products more useful and 
intelligent. Then, I'll give an update on our Advertising business and our 
growing Cloud business.
 
A few highlights from the quarter; we continued to invest in making Search 
more useful and assistive. In the early days, whe
n you did a search on your 
desktop, we gave you 10 blue links then sent you on your way. Users still 
had to do too much work to find the information they were looking for. We 
have made a lot of improvements over the years to add more 
comprehensive and assi
stive information right within the search results.
 
For instance, 10 years ago, if you tried to find the score during your favorite 
soccer team's match, we'd likely point you to some news articles or the 
team's website. Today, we show the live scores for ne
arly 200 soccer 
leagues across 70 countries, so fans around the world can quickly find 
information, like upcoming schedules, team news and conference standings 
right in the search results. We are incredibly well
-
positioned to better assist 
our users, thank
s to our strengths in areas like search, geographical 
information, machine learning, image recognition and natural language 
processing.
 
One of the key ingredients behind this push towards greater assistance is AI. 
We have long invested in building the best
 
machine learning team and tools, 
and we are seeing these efforts bear fruit in many ways. As many of you 
saw last month, DeepMind's AlphaGo has been making great strides. It was 
a privilege to play legendary Go player, Lee Sedol, in such an important 
mile
stone for artificial intelligence. This is another step to what's creating AI 
that could help us with everything from our daily tasks to potentially even 
bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis.
 
At Google, machine learning is already hel
ping us improve our products 
every day in search and many other areas like photos, maps and more. Last 
quarter, I talked about how machine learning helps Smart Reply suggest 
responses in Inbox. This quarter, we launched Goals in Google Calendar, an 
intelli
gent feature that helps users make the most of their time. You just add 
a personal goal, like run three times a week, and Calendar will help you find 
the time, then help you stick it to. There's still a lot more that we can do to 
make Search and other Goog
le services more assistive and helpful to you. 
You'll see a lot more from us this year.
 
On the content side, we are seeing great traction on Google Play and 
YouTube. YouTube still has incredible momentum, and we continue to invest 
heavily here. What seemed
 
like a moon shot a decade ago has grown into a 
booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other 
video platform. YouTube on mobile alone now reaches more 18 to 34 and 18 
to 49 year olds in the U.S. than any TV network, broadcast or
 
cable.
 
This past quarter, we launched YouTube Originals, original content available 
on our premium service YouTube Red. And we are very pleased with how it's 
been going. And earlier this week, we announced that we are make 360
-
degree live streaming availa
ble globally on YouTube. We are kicking things 
off by live streaming select performances at Coachella for fans around the 
world in 360 degrees.
 
Google Play remains a thriving hub for digital content across apps, games, 
music, movies, TV and books. Game dev
elopers of all sizes are building 
successful businesses in the Play Store thanks to its global reach of over 1 
billion users. In fact, in 2015, we saw 50% more games reach over 1 million 
installs compared to the previous year. And we keep adding great cont
ent to 
Google Play. For instance, performances by artists like Coldplay and Justin 
Bieber from the 2016 BRIT Awards that are available exclusively on Google 
Play Music.
 
When we talk about great content, the mobile web is equally important. This 
quarter, ou
r simple, fast and secure browser, Chrome, reached another 
important milestone, surpassing 1 billion monthly active users on mobile 
alone. And, of course, one of the keys to a great mobile experience is fast 
content. As you know, we have teamed up with hun
dreds of publishers and 
tech companies to improve the mobile web for everyone with accelerated 
mobile pages. Early data shows that these pages load four times faster and 
use 10 times less data than traditional pages.
 
We recently made it easy to find AMP in
 
relevant Mobile Search and Google 
News results, giving users a lightning
-
fast reading experience for top stories. 
And there are great advertising opportunities for publishers in these new fast 
pages.
 
Another example is progress of Web Apps, which combine 
the best of the 
web and apps allowing companies to build mobile sites that load quickly, 
send push notifications, have home screen icons and much more.
 
Of course, computing is the foundational layer through which all our 
products are delivered. In March, w
e previewed the Android N release to 
give developers an early look at what's coming in the next version of our 
software. This release has key features like multi
-
window support, direct
-
reply notifications and battery efficiencies.
 
We're also building for f
uture platforms. We expanded Android Auto to 
Brazil, and Android Wear partners, like Michael Kors and Fossil, also 
announced that they are working on new devices coming later this year. In 
our newest platform, VR, we also recently introduced VR view, a qui
ck and 
easy way for developers to include 360
-
degree VR images and videos in 
their apps and websites.
 
Now, moving on to some of the key drivers and trends in our advertising 
business; as people turn to their mobile phones in moments of high intent, 
which we call micro moments, Google has a compelling value proposition. 
We offer marketers four things: the best ways to target commercial intent at 
the right moment; the best mobile ad formats; the best reach and range of 
quality inventory; and the leadin
g measurement solutions.
 
First, thanks to our unique interim signals, we are able to connect marketers 
with the right customer precisely the right time. A new example of this is 
Customer Match, which helps brands reach their most valued customers on 
Google
 
Search, YouTube and Gmail, with highly relevant and targeted ads. 
After using Customer Match to reactivate their loyal customers, specialty 
retailer Williams
-
Sonoma reported a 50% lift in revenue compared to 
previous campaigns that didn't use Customer Mat
ch.
 
Second, we continue to invest in the best new mobile ad formats, tailored to 
help users find exactly what they need at the right moment. For example, 
we rolled out Model Automotive Ads, which helps automakers recreate the 
showroom experience by featuri
ng images of cars alongside helpful 
information right in the Mobile Search results. On average, participating 
brands see a more than 30% increase in engagement rate with these new 
automotive ads compared to standard text ads.
 
Third, we provide advertisers 
with the best reach in inventory across many 
of the web's most coveted platforms. Marketers like HBO Now are seeing 
great results from our popular app (23:10) promotion offerings like Universal 
App Campaigns, (23:13) which helps advertisers easily run camp
aigns in 
Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our Display network. In fact, in 
January, we saw a 200% year
-
over
-
year increase in ad
-
driven installs on 
Android alone.
 
And in our burgeoning Programmatic business, we recently rolled out 
Programmatic Guaran
teed, a new way to conduct better deals between 
advertisers and publishers on high quality inventory.
 
And fourth, we give marketers powerful measurement tools, so they know 
exactly how effective their ads are. Just this week, we announced the 
availability 
of sales lift studies to help consumer packaged brands better 
understand how their online videos are driving offline sales. This adds to our 
significant efforts in this area.
 
I want to specifically highlight the success we are seeing with YouTube 
advertisi
ng. As YouTube continues to grow, with great content and engaged 
users, marketers can't get enough. For example, Microsoft Xbox hosted a six 
hour live streamed event on YouTube for their Halo 5 opening week 
promoted with TrueView ads where 8 million people
 
tuned in, helping it 
break sales records.
 
Excitement is especially high as we head into our annual Brandcast event 
coming up next month. Thanks to the success of Google Preferred, this is 
the third year in a row we are making it the cornerstone of our off
ering to 
marketers. In fact, number of brands in the U.S. using Google Preferred has 
doubled year
-
over
-
year.
 
Now, I want to spend time on our exciting Enterprise businesses, which have 
been gaining momentum. Last December, we have unified our cloud 
busines
ses under one leader, so we can innovate faster and better serve our 
customers. This decision is already paying off. Enterprises are starting to see 
the power of combining Google Cloud Platform with our suite of business 
applications, all of which are infu
sed with our machine learning services.
 
As companies accelerate their move to the cloud, we can help them 
automate their IT operations, better understand their data, and become 
more cost effective and secure, while also offering them transformative 
office 
productivity.
 
In addition, we are helping customers adopt our powerful Chromebooks and 
Android phones. Our recent Next 2016 Conference in San Francisco showed 
just how serious we are about the enterprise. It was wonderful to hear 
executives from Spotify an
d Coca
-
Cola share their stories about how they 
are benefiting from Google's cloud technology, including our best
-
in
-
class 
security, reliability and analytics. We also introduced Cloud Machine 
Learning, which provides modern machine learning services with p
re
-
trained 
models such as Cloud Vision API and Cloud Speech API.
 
Our growth was accelerating going into that event, and since then, the 
quantity and quality of our enterprise conversations has risen to a whole 
new level. Now, we are investing and building 
our go
-
to
-
market activities to 
ensure we have the right expertise available for each of our business 
customers.
 
We are enabling service partners to assist customers with everything from 
migrating to the cloud to using machine learning to understanding thei
r 
data. We are providing engineering to help them architect solutions, and we 
building out our support teams.
 
We are also helping businesses migrate to our suite of productivity 
applications like Gmail, Docs and Drive, and customers love them. And we 
conti
nue to accelerate our innovation in this area with new announcements, 
such as Smart Reply and Voice Typing. It's gratifying to see the immensely 
positive response from our customers and partners, who recognize that we 
offer a powerful combination that's un
ique to Google: unmatched product 
innovation, combined with world
-
class security and reliability; technical 
transparency; and customer orientation.
 
To close, as I said before, Google's mission is, and has always been, to 
organize the world's information an
d make it universally accessible and 
useful. As I think about all our businesses and each of the countries we 
reach, I have never been more excited about how our teams continue to 
bring this mission to life and make technology available for everyone.
 
I've 
been so proud to see us expanding our core products to more and more 
countries around the world: Street View in Sri Lanka; YouTube in Nepal and 
Pakistan; new Hindu keyboards (27:58) in India; and a new engineering 
center in Singapore that will help us get 
closer to the next billion users 
coming online by developing products that will work well for them. We are 
laser
-
focused on our mission at Google, and I want to say thank you to all of 
the Googlers around the world who are helping us make it a reality each
 
and 
every day.
 
Before we take your questions, Ruth and I wanted to take a moment to pay 
our respects to Bill Campbell, our very close friend and a mentor to many of 
us at Google and Alphabet, who sadly passed on Monday. Bill spent endless 
hours with our f
ounders and our leadership over the years, helping to build 
our Board of Directors and sustain our culture. He had a very big impact on 
our company, made us all smile, and inspired many great leaders of the 
valley. We offer our condolences to Bill's family
, and we will miss him.
 
And with that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth.

Thanks for taking the questions, maybe just two, one on YouTube; you've 
now played around with the idea of original content, also injected a 
subscript
ion offering into the marketplace. What have you learned from the 
early days of original content and a subscription offering and how that might 
allow YouTube to evolve and change over time as a product offering?
 
And second, with respect to the Advertising 
business, I was curious if there 
were any verticals or geographies that you might call out as either strengths 
or weaknesses in the Advertising business during Q1. Thank you.

Thanks, Eric. On YouTube, w
e are definitely excited by the successful roll
-
out 
of YouTube Red. It's been very well received. We've really focused on our 
creators and partners, so hopefully you've caught some of our YouTube 
Originals. We have released six so far, which are available 
to YouTube Red 
members. So early indications are that this is something that's going to 
resonate well with users, and we are working on a lot more original content 
throughout the year. And we'll see how it goes.

And then in terms of your question on the regions, as I tried to make clear in 
my opening comments, what we saw was real strength across the board. I 
think you could see that from the growth rates, with U.S. up 21% year
-
over
-
year, and
 
that was really strength across products. UK, we're really pleased 
with the team. We continue to see great execution there. On a fixed FX 
basis, as I noted, up 21%. The biggest contributor to growth in the UK was 
Mobile Search. And then rest of world grow
ing at 25% on a fixed basis. 
That's about in line with last quarter. We continue to be really pleased with 
the growth we're seeing there. In addition to the ongoing contribution from 
Mobile, the rest of world also benefited from Play and then really nothin
g to 
note with respect to verticals.

Hi. I have two quick questions, first on margins. Despite the increasing TAC 
as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating income margins expanded 
now almost 130 bps and 140 bps for Google year
-
on
-
year. Can you help us 
understand, even if roughly, how much of this margin expansion is specific 
to the quarter, like due to FX, versus systemic or secular, so to speak?
 
And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar, can you talk a bit about 
the dec
ision you took last year to have an additional ad on Mobile Search 
response pages relegating organic results below the fold? How is it good for 
the user experience to have ad instead of organic? And if it is good, what 
does it say about the potential for i
nnovation in organic search? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
Thanks, Carlos. So starting on the margin question, you've hit a couple of 
the components, so I'm going to try and just break it down into the drivers 
on c
ost of sales versus OpEx more broadly, as you asked it. So on the cost 
of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs 
associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market, so 
in Sites, Mobile carries higher 
TAC than does desktop and Mobile remains a 
strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue. And then on the 
network side, we have strong growth in programmatic and that carries 
higher TAC than traditional ad buying. The obvious result is more revenu
e 
and gross margin dollars, but at a lower margin.
 
And then on OpEx more broadly, we remain very committed to long
-
term 
revenue growth and profit. As we've talked about on prior calls, we did set 
priorities in the 2016 budget and we made some tough choices
 
because our 
aim is to be as efficient and effective as possible with investment dollars, 
while properly funding the big opportunities that we have that are reflected 
in OpEx.
 
So as I've repeatedly said, some of the biggest bets are in Google. Sundar 
comme
nted quite a bit on cloud. That's an exciting opportunity. We want to 
continue to add head count to drive growth. And all of this is consistent with 
our goals of driving long
-
term growth in revenue and profit. So it goes to my 
opening comments that we're f
ocused on controlling the expenses we have, 
and then there are certain trends, as I noted, in particular on the TAC side, 
that have been increasing with the strong growth we're seeing in mobile and 
programmatic.

gle, Inc.
 
And, Carlos, on the ad side, we are incredibly sensitive to the user 
experience on Search. And so we are constantly evolving how we display 
ads, but we take a very long
-
term view. Our ads quality efforts, these are 
people who have been working on
 
this for many, many years and they are 
squarely focused on optimizing for positive metrics across users and 
advertisers. So our utmost focus is making sure, for users, these changes 
have a positive impact. And mobile is an entirely different paradigm and 
so a 
lot of things are counter
-
intuitive. So, for example, users are very 
comfortable swiping on mobile. So we deeply think about these things, and 
I'm very comfortable about how we are planning this for the very long
-
term.

Thank you. Ruth, I just had one question, a follow
-
up from a previous o
ne 
on the regions. So the U.S. had greater than expected seasonal downtick. It 
was down 9% quarter
-
on
-
quarter. And I know that you picked up Yahoo and 
lost AOL from 4Q to 1Q. So is that the primary driver of that or as YouTube 
becomes a bigger percent of y
our revenue, should we expect greater 
seasonal uptick in 4Q and seasonal downtick in 1Q? Can you just give us a 
little bit more color on what's driving that? Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat 
-

Well, we, as you know, don't 
comment on any particular partner. So all I can 
add here is that the deceleration quarter

related seasonality, which we did call out last quarter, and you see that in a 
number of the products.

Thank you. And your ne

Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. You talked about TAC rising because of the increasing mix shift 
towards mobile and programmatic. There seems like there was a
 
little bit of 
an extra bump up this quarter. Would there have been any one major 
renewal of a deal that would have caused that? It did seem to spike more 
than what you would get, I assume, if you just rolled out mobile and 
programmatic. And then any comme
ntary at all on Nest; there seemed to be 
an unusual amount of press since intra
-
quarter on troubles with that asset? 
Could you just comment on qualitatively how the asset is doing? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
So 
on TAC, it's really the ongoing growth in Mobile, as I've kind of answered 
a couple of times here, and that reflects the strong secular trends behind 
mobile, so really nothing to add on on the Sites TAC side. And then on the 
network side, again, it's reall
y the higher TAC that we're seeing on 
programmatic, so nothing really to call out.
 
And then with respect to your question on Nest, I guess what I'll add there is 
Nest products are best
-
sellers in the category. It's a leading brand in the 
connected home. It
's obviously early, but a very exciting category. And as 
we've talked about, our Other Bets are all very early stage, but continues to 
be best
-
seller in the category.

Great. Thank you. This question is for Sundar. It's multi
-
part, but I
 
was 
wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your cloud ambitions? And 
wondering what do you see as the biggest changes in strategy post Diane 
Greene's appointment? And then, how are you getting enterprise customers 
to think of you as having en
terprise DNA, if you will, which is something that 
took Amazon a long time to get. And I guess lastly, just if you could just 
help us think about which type of workloads do you see Google as being the 
most competitive for at this time? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pi
chai 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Heather. Obviously, I talked about it a lot in my prepared remarks. 
And we have already had a lot of momentum in this area. And in many 
ways, given the scale at which we have done this internally for us,
 
we view it 
as an area we are very competent at. What Diane has brought to us to is a 
deep understanding of how to think about what enterprises need and adapt 
to it in a very detailed and nuanced way. And you saw the momentum at the 
Next Conference, which 
she hosted.
 
We are getting a lot more inbound. We are in much deeper conversations 
than we have ever been before. We do think we are competent across a 
range of work flows. And areas where we view we will be uniquely capable 
over time is, because of our ma
chine learning capabilities, helping 
enterprises really understand their data, understand how best they can do 
what their core competency is and really revolutionize around that. It's early 
days and it's a long
-
term investment. But bringing our machine lea
rning 
APIs over time through cloud to our enterprise customers is going be a huge 
source of differentiation for us.

Thanks for taking the question. Two things; first, Sundar, I was hoping you 
could comment more on Mobile Search pricing, in particular it gets a little bit 
lost just within overall pricing per
-
click, e
specially with YouTube in there. So 
I was hoping you could comment on pricing on more of a like
-
for
-
like basis. 
And as inventory perhaps stabilizes some, would you expect pricing here to 
increase over time as conversion improves? And then secondly, Ruth, i
f you 
could just comment a little bit more on other income and just help us 
understand some of the details there on the negative number in that line? 
Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
So I'll take those. In terms of the f
irst question, there's obviously some data, 
as I referenced, attached with the press release. And, as you know well, all 
of the monetization data reflects a host of factors, from geographic mix and 
device mix and property mix, as well as it's all on a floa
ting FX basis. And 
clearly, FX is a contributor. I think you're trying to get more color on Mobile. 
And what's hopefully clear from the opening comments, is that Mobile 
continues to outperform. Desktop growth did pick up modestly in Q1, but, 
from opening c
omments, should be clear that Mobile Search revenue was up 
significantly.
 
And then in terms of your question on other income, let me point you to the 
OI&E table that's at the end of our press release. This line consists of a 
number of different items. They
 
can be affected by different trends, but you 
can see the breakout in that table, which hopefully is helpful there.
 
Interest income has been fairly consistent. We do continue to manage our 
portfolio conservatively. FX is consistently an expense here. It wa
s slightly 
elevated again this quarter, given the ongoing volatility in foreign exchange 
markets. We haven't changed our approach to hedging, but up with volatility 
in the markets. And then the OI&E line also includes changes in value where 
equity pickups 
related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and 
investments. We appreciate with all those different line items it's tough to 
forecast, but you can see the detail attached to the press release.

Thank you. So, Sundar, I think it was at 
I/O last year when you started to 
call out the products which have over 1 billion users. At this point, are you 
able to elaborate on what percent of these users have either a Google ID or 
are known users for you?
 
And, Ruth, kind of a housekeeping, I guess,
 
item on the CapEx here. When 
you talk about CapEx with the Other Bets being primarily for Fiber, is this a 
fairly sort of straightforward passing of homes, or is your cash use going 
toward developing new technologies or products like SkyBender? Thanks.
 
Su
ndar Pichai 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Steven, on the first question, maybe I can add more color this way. So user 
base is scaling most, you know, we are also seeing tremendous shift towards 
Mobile. It's in many of these products. We are alrea
dy over 50% of these 
users are coming from Mobile. And in Mobile typically, all users are signed 
in. And so I think over time as the shift continues, I think we have a user 
base which is signed in. And so that's the way we think about it.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chie
f Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
And then on the CapEx question, if I just broaden that a bit, the CapEx 
trends in part is efficiency, in part is timing when you look at year
-
over
-
year 
spend. Compared to last year, we had some outsized machine s
pend that 
filled some recently constructed data centers. And as we've consistently 
said, our technical infrastructure is a really key strategic asset for us. We 
have tremendous scale. We continue to add to it, and the team has done an 
extraordinary job inn
ovating to deliver some meaningful efficiencies in 
machine use. And that enables us to benefit from earlier investments.
 
And although you asked about the Fiber side, just to build off of what 
Sundar was saying on cloud, given what a strategic priority that
 
is for us, 
and the requirements for a leading cloud business are clearly at the core of 
all that we do and at a scale that's unmatched, given our sustained 
investments in infrastructure.
 
One of the things that was also mentioned at Next is that we plan to
 
add 12 
new regions. And to be clear, we're going to be using multiple execution 
paths for those data center requirements. In other words, every cloud region 
isn't necessarily going to be housed in a Google data center. So we don't 
need to build data cente
rs in all of these places. They will all incorporate the 
same Google hardware and software and meet the same performance, 
reliability and security requirements. And investing in cloud isn't only about 
CapEx. We also put a lot of head count behind that agai
n this quarter.
 
And then more specifically on the Fiber side, as you were pointing to, we do 
expect that to increase throughout the year as we execute on the cities that 
we've already announced. It's primarily about continuing to execute on 
those cities. W
e now are up to 22 announced cities, two most recent 
announcements being some buildings. We're bringing fiber to like buildings 
in San Francisco and we're working with the City of Huntsville. That being 
said, I liked your question because we're also very f
ocused on innovation 
and technology. And so it's really both, but predominantly continued 
execution against these cities that we've announced.

Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few questions on YouTube; first, on 
the Preferr
ed program, Ruth, you mentioned it sounds like the growth 
continues to be really strong there going into Brandcast. And I was just 
curious, is the program now formally rolled out globally? And then I've got 
one follow
-
up on Red.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chief Financia
l Officer & Senior Vice President
 
So in terms of Preferred, you're right. I did note that the strong revenue 
growth there is driven virtually exclusively by video. That's TrueView and 
increasingly Google Preferred, and, as we said, nice ad (45:29) promotio
n 
there as well.
 
Sundar Pichai

And it's largely rolled out in major markets and we'll continue to do that.
 
Daniel Salmon

BMO Capital Markets (United States)
 
Okay, great. And then just a quick one on Red, it seems a
s if the direction 
for the content remains to focus on your own originals right now. What may 
or may not make you consider looking at other licensed, maybe more 
traditional, TV or film content?
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Well, I 
mean, look, we are going to approach it comprehensively. And we 
have obviously had great early traction with the six original series we have 
released so far. This year, we are on track to release 15 to 20 original series 
or films coming up. (46:11) And so 
I think that's an exciting direction we will 
pursue, but, at the same time, we'll keep an open mind about all other 
revenues as well.

question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.

Justin Post

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. Thank you. I have a few. First, for Sundar, could you talk about the 
cloud, why really get more aggressive now? We've been riding on
 
it for 
many years, and just wondering why now really ramping up the investment? 
And how would you characterize the margins or the returns on capital in that 
business? Why is that interesting for you?
 
And then maybe for Ruth, you know, you give us a lot of
 
detail on click 
growth, but I'm just wondering if you can help us all on query growth, just 
how that's trended since Mobile really took off? Is it growing? How is it 
trending? And do you have more room to monetize, given where your ad 
coverage is now? Tha
nk you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Just on the first one, I would say there are three points of inflection for us, 
and that's why we are really ramping it up. The first is we've always been 
doing cloud. It's just that we were con
suming it all internally at Google, but 
as we have grown, really matured in terms of how we handle our data 
center investments and how we can do this at scale, we have definitely 
crossed over to the other side where we can thoughtfully serve external 
custo
mers. So that's the first point of inflection.
 
The second point of inflection for us is as we've been investing in machine 
learning and AI for years, but I think we are at an exceptionally interesting 
tipping point where these technologies are really takin
g off. And that is very, 
very applicable to businesses as well, and so thoughtfully doing that 
externally, we view as a big differentiator we have over others.
 
And third, is definitely Diane Greene coming in. And I think I wanted to 
(48:12) scale our effor
ts here thoughtfully when it is set up with a great 
leader who understands this space deeply. And so those are the three main 
reasons why we are significantly ramping up what we are doing there.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
And then on query growth, we don't really talk about query growth. As 
Sundar said, focused on answers; there are a lot of new ways to search on 
mobile, of course, voice, et cetera. So let me try and actually add a little 
more on your question on cloud.
 
We'
ve consistently said it's early days. You asked about ROIC. We're really 
excited about the magnitude of the opportunity, as Sundar has talked about. 
And one thing that's really powerful here is we're benefiting from our 
heritage, from our differentiated st
rength, the scale of our infrastructure. 
Those are investments we've made over many years that give us 
extraordinary efficiency. We have robust security. Again, we've invested 
over many years. We have unparalleled machine learning. And so really, 
when we t
hink through to the ROIC opportunity compelling building on 
investments that we've made and continue to make and a very exciting 
opportunity.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, for Sundar on Google 
Fiber, just at a higher level, would you please broadly update us on your 
lea
rnings from Google Fiber up until this point? And what are the goals that 
Google is trying to achieve with Google Fiber in terms of longer
-
term 
ambitions in terms of TV or video distribution?
 
And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Mobile S
earch 
being driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery starting in the 
third quarter of last year. Is there any way to frame or think about what 
Sites revenue growth might be on a recurring basis if you try to exclude the 
impacts or benefits from th
e changes in formats that you mentioned and as 
we start to think about the year
-
over
-
year growth comparisons there for the 
back half of 2016? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
So let me go ahead and start on the Fiber 
question. Fiber is one of the 
businesses that is in Other Bets. And like all of our access efforts, we're 
really focused. And our vision here is to create abundant and ubiquitous 
networks. We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience 
tha
t users have, and that's where the Fiber team is focused. And we have 
some other efforts within Other Bets that are really exciting as well that 
address access. Loon within our X business is targeting the 4 billion people 
still offline. And we view that si
milarly as a big opportunity and an important 
problem to address.
 
And in terms of the early learnings, there have been a lot. As I talked about 
on the last quarter call, we've really continued to refine and enhance our go
-
to
-
market strategy, the way we're 
working with cities, the way we're 
building out those cities and really the level of technology and innovation 
that we can use to differentiate the offering and are pleased with the 
ongoing efforts there.
 
And then in terms of the change in ad format, as we
've talked about on a lot 
of calls, innovation is core to all we do. It obviously happens on its own 
timeline. We have a culture of it. We're continuously focused on it. I'm not 
going to break out impact for any change. We're constantly looking to 
innovate
 
and improve the user experience. And so there was a step
-
up, 
which we've talked about, and we continue to look at other ways, as Sundar 
talked about, to continue to enhance the user experience. But I think the 
most important point and somewhat implicit in
 
your question, that shouldn't 
take away from the very strong underlying revenue and revenue growth that 
we have in that business.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Mobile Search and the 
mobile ad format changes in 3Q of last year, could you just help us? Were 
those chan
ges made globally last year in the third quarter? And if not, how 
should we think about when they will go globally or how you're kind of 
phasing those changes?
 
And then, the second one on the desktop, Ruth, you mentioned that desktop 
growth picked up in 
the first quarter. What drove that pickup in growth and 
any learnings from the change in the right
-
hand rail in the first quarter? 
Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai

these changes for a long time and so we try to roll it out globally, and that's 
what we did.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
And then, in terms of the desktop format change, so we had a modest 
benefit from that change wh
ere, just to be clear for all, we reduced the ad 
load by removing ads on the right
-
side of the screen while adding a fourth 
ad slot for highly commercial queries in the aggregate. That resulted in a 
cleaner, more useful, presentation and improved user expe
rience. It was a 
modest impact, but additive.

Hi, guys, a few questions. Sundar, your commentary on Play focused on 
games, but what needs to happen to have more verticals beyond games 
become meaningful? And then, Ruth, a couple more on the Sites TAC, at a 
high le
vel, how do average TAC rates differ on mobile versus desktop? And 
aside from the TAC rates, are there any other notable contractual issues that 
differ meaningfully between mobile and desktop search partnerships? 
Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Chief Executive Off
icer, Google, Inc.
 
Yeah, Ben, on the first question, I think that's a good question. We are 
seeing traction across categories. It's just that games are at a much larger 
scale, but, for example, when we get into education, we see if you view that 
as a verti
cal, we do see traction there and so on. So I think taking a very 
long
-
term view, it will probably reflect they're all, there are commercial 
opportunities across every vertical. But game developers are the savviest 
developed person in terms of getting ahea
d of this curve.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
And on your TAC question, as I've indicated a number of times already on 
the call, the TAC rate is higher on Mobile. Mobile's growing at a faster rate 
and what you're seeing here
 
is a mix shift. So there is a delta between the 
two. But I think, importantly, we are benefiting from an important secular 
trend behind Mobile, and like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars 
that come as a result of that, and we'll continue to 
innovate on mobile and 
are excited about the opportunity, in particular with all the changes that we 
continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities.

Okay, great. Thanks very much. Sundar, first off, you mentioned a lot of the 
ongoing projects at Google, but I wonder if you could share with us maybe 
the two or three 
areas that you're spending the most of your time on or are 
focused on? And related to that, one of the strengths of the company is 
obviously the strong engineering orientation and ability to hire some of the 
best talent and acquire the best technology. And
 
the company has been able 
to adapt very quickly to change, but I wonder which areas of your business 
demonstrate where Google or Alphabet are really on the forefront of 
development, pushing innovation rather than adapting to changes you see in 
the market.

Thanks, Colin. On the first thing, obviously, we are doing many things, but I

we have a unique opportunity to evolve
 
search to be very assistive in how 
we serve our users and be an intelligent assistant that helps users 
throughout their needs in context, especially in the context of mobile. That's 
an area definitely I spend a lot of time on. And related to that, we do t
hink 
we can do a lot of that by based on our core advancements in machine 
learning and AI. So that's an area we invest a lot. And I'm thoughtfully 
involved with that as well. And third, definitely from a computing standpoint, 
computing is foundational to e
verything we do. And so thinking through 
about how computing evolves, be it emerging technologies like VR or how 
mobile advances over the next few years, so these are all areas where I do 
spend time on.
 
And overall, I do think in the long run, I think we w
ill evolve in computing 
from a mobile first to an AI first world. And I do think we are at the forefront 
of development. So we don't view it as adapting to it as much as pushing 
hard and getting there. And so that's the core of what we do, and we'll 
contin
ue to do that.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 
Alphabet Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator 
Instructions]. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker 
today, Jim Friedland, Director of 
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
James Friedland
 
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second 
quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and 
Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.
 
Some o
f the statements that we make today regarding our business, 
operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID
-
19 
pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward
-
looking. And such 
statements involve a number of risks and uncertainti
es that could cause 
actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the 
risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10
-
K filed with the SEC and in 
our Form 10
-
Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 expected to be filed with 
the
 
SEC later today.
 
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of non
-
GAAP to GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the 
public through our Investo
r Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. It's certainly been a 
busy week, and I'm glad to be here. I hope everyone is staying safe and
 
well. All of us at Google continue to send our deepest gratitude to everyone 
on the front lines of the pandemic all around the world. I also want to 
personally thank all our employees who continue to work so hard to make 
sure our products and services are
 
available for everyone right now. People 
looking for important health information, hard
-
hit businesses working to 
inform customers about opening hours or delivery options or teachers 
connecting to their students. The macroeconomic environment caused by th
e 
pandemic created headwinds for our business. Our revenue declined on a 
reported basis and is flat year
-
over
-
year on a fixed FX basis. Like other 
companies, this quarter, we saw the early signs of stabilization as users 
return to commercial activity onlin
e. This is true across most of our 
advertising verticals and geographies. Of course, the economic climate 
remains fragile.
 
One thing I'd like to call out is our continuing journey to invest in and grow 
new businesses. We delivered strong growth in our non
-
ads revenues 
particularly from Cloud, Google Play and YouTube subscriptions. This, in 
turn, is helping our partners, developers and creators earn revenue and 
deliver valuable services to people. We are focused on the steps to build 
long
-
term value with the
se opportunities.
 
Today, I'll review the quarter by walking through the 4 key areas for 2020 
that you heard me mention over the last several quarters: creating the most 
helpful products for everyone; providing the most trusted experiences for 
our users; ex
ecuting at scale; and creating sustainable value.
 
First, creating the most helpful products for everyone. This has been 
especially important during this time. We are focused on providing locally 
relevant, helpful and authoritative information about COVID i
n over 70 
languages in 200 countries. This has been an enormous effort across search 
and all our products. YouTube, for example, engage with public health 
officials in over 90 countries and services panels with locally relevant 
information in response to C
OVID
-
19 queries.
 
On Google Maps and Search, we now display more than 12,000 COVID
-
19 
testing centers across 20 countries, working with local governments and 
data providers to source accurate and helpful information. Using our 
technical capabilities, we are
 
helping people find more information about 
local businesses such as takeout, curbside, updated hours, donations, gift 
cards and virtual services.
 
With more kids at home, Google Play launched a special kids tab with only 
teacher
-
approved apps and YouTube h
as seen traction with learn at home as 
well as a virtual summer camp for kids called Camp YouTube, plus a virtual 
commencement series.
 
To help Indian Internet users, we announced a Google for India Digitization 
Fund. Through this effort, we'll invest appro
ximately $10 billion over the 
next 5 to 7 years to accelerate and participate in India's burgeoning digital 
economy. We'll enable information in local languages and apply technology 
and AI to important areas like health, education and agriculture. Jio 
plat
forms is the first partnership agreement in the fund and will work with 
them to help millions of users in India become owners of smartphones.
 
Second, providing trusted experiences for our users. Doing even more to 
protect users' privacy, keep information s
afe and provide high
-
quality 
information was a key focus this quarter. In one important update, we now 
set people's location history and web in
-
app activity to delete automatically 
after 18 months as the default. We also integrated password checkup into 
ou
r core security checkup to help people detect any instance of their online 
accounts being compromised. More than 100 million people have used it. 
Android 11 Beta launched this quarter with many new features to help 
people better manage their connected devi
ces. It contains a significant focus 
on privacy and security, including more granular control over app 
permissions and restrictions on app's usage of background location. Our 
exposure notifications API for Android and iOS, developed with Apple, 
launched th
is quarter. It's designed to empower public health agencies to 
create apps to help fight the spread of COVID with the strongest user 
privacy safeguards.
 
As of today, authorities have rolled out official apps in 12 countries to alert 
people that they were i
n contact with another person who tested positive for 
the virus and that they should isolate and get tested. We expect several 
more apps to launch in the next week or 2, including the first state apps in 
the U.S. We are also focused on election security ef
forts around the globe, 
whether it's removing coordinated foreign influence operations, prevent 
hacking and phishing attempts or enforcing our political ad policies that 
require transparency and prohibit narrow micro targeting.
 
Moving on now to executing a
t scale. All businesses are adjusting to work
-
from
-
home and we are no exception. While building products across 
distributed teams was new for us, this experience allowed us to make good 
use of our infrastructure investments and productivity tools. G Suite 
products, in particular, Google Meet have been absolutely critical, and we 
quickly reengineered it and made it available widely to help millions of other 
businesses and organizations connect and collaborate.
 
One area where we have executed really well to i
mprove the user and 
merchant experience in the last year is shopping. We know that we and 
merchants face incredible competition for consumer attention and wallets. 
We are helping merchants lower their costs and improve their reach in a few 
ways. They can n
ow list their products for free on the Google Shopping tab 
and on Search helping them drive more traffic and making our results more 
comprehensive and useful. We also recently announced that sellers on Buy 
on Google will no longer pay us a commission fee. 
Plus, we are giving 
retailers more choice by opening our platform to third
-
party providers, 
starting with PayPal and Shopify. Shopping ads also continue to be a great 
tool for merchants with new visual features for retailers such as smart 
shopping campaign
s that let customers know about free shipping. We are 
continually adding more ways for advertisers to reach shoppers.
 
Now let me talk about our fourth area, building sustainable value, which is 
all about driving business value for our partners and investin
g smartly in 
new areas. In our advertising business, our focus is on helping businesses 
find customers as they work to rebuild and recover. We gave search advisers 
the ability to add high
-
quality images to their ads, helping shoppers quickly 
see products t
o consider and take action faster. We added features to make 
video ads more easily shoppable and browsable on YouTube as more 
businesses are shifting to online to offset physical store closures. For SMBs, 
we are proud that so many are taking advantage of n
ew features, including 
Smart Campaigns to reach new online audiences and promoted pins on 
Google Maps to let customers know that their businesses are open. And to 
empower businesses to understand in an easy and visual way, what products 
people are searchin
g for, during the special circumstances that COVID
-
19 
has created. The rising retail categories, too, surfaces fast
-
growing product
-
related categories.
 
As I mentioned earlier, beyond advertising revenue, we see good traction in 
areas such as YouTube subscr
iptions, Google Play and Cloud. YouTube 
Premium Music and TV subscriptions performed well during the quarter. We 
are seeing strong demand for these services and are adding content 
regularly, including many Viacom networks like BET and Comedy Central. In 
Q2
, Google Play app and game downloads were up more than 35% year
-
over
-
year, which means that revenue for developers continue to grow.
 
Let me go a bit deeper on Cloud. In the first half of 2020, technology and 
innovation proved to be a significant recovery m
echanism for businesses. 
Those who are shifting to digital and embracing the spirit to innovate are 
evolving and growing. Our commitment to bringing innovative products to 
market, building and scaling our go
-
to
-
market organization, and 
strengthening our pa
rtner network helped us continue to meet the growing 
needs of our customers this quarter. We see 2 distinct trends as businesses 
embrace the future of work.
 
First, the future of business will be more digital. Customers are choosing 
Google Cloud to either l
ower their cost by improving operating efficiency or 
to drive innovation through digital transformation. Brands like Keurig Dr. 
Pepper, Deutsche Bank, Lowe's, Telefónica, Orange and Group Renault. And 
we are helping many government agencies deliver care fo
r their citizens, 
including the states of Oklahoma and New York here in the U.S., and Italy 
and Spain in Europe.
 
Second, the future of work will be more collaborative. Virtual collaboration is 
critical in order to adapt and succeed in the changing global l
andscape. In 
Q2, we saw continued demand from customers using G Suite to help their 
employees work from home, including Wipro in India and expanded our 
relationship with the state of Arizona here in the U.S. Our customers are 
using G Suite tools across ind
ustries in new ways, whether it be financial 
advisers working with clients, doctors and nurses turning to telemedicine or 
teachers educating students with remote learning. In Q2, we peaked at more 
than 600 million Meet participants in a single week. As one
 
example, PwC 
employees reached nearly 10 million hours of video conferencing in Google 
Meet in a single month. To make collaboration easier for everyone, we 
introduced an integrated workspace for Gmail, Chat, Meet and Drive on 
mobile and desktop. Our Clou
d product strategy is differentiated and our 
investments in direct sales and indirect distribution are beginning to deliver 
results.
 
Before I move to Other Bets, I want to note that our hardware team 
continues to make good progress, and I'm excited by the 
new upcoming 
devices we have coming this fall.
 
And finally, in our Other Bets. Waymo announced that Fiat Chrysler 
automobiles will work with Waymo as its strategic partner for L4 
autonomous technology across our full portfolio. We also entered into a 
partn
ership agreement with Volvo Car Group to work together to integrate 
the Waymo driver into an all
-
new electric vehicle platform for ride
-
hailing 
services. Finally, Waymo closed its externally
-
led investment round, bringing 
the total funding to $3.2 billion,
 
which includes investment from Alphabet. 
And Wing's drone delivery service started delivering library books to 
students in Virginia.
 
In closing, it's an important and uncertain time in the world. We are all 
grappling with the pandemic and a struggling eco
nomy, while also reckoning 
with centuries of injustice that affect our Black communities every day. John 
Lewis' funeral today provides a timely reminder of the struggle. In June, we 
announced a significant package of commitments to help our Black+ 
communit
y internally at Google as well as the wider Black community. This 
included product experiences that matter to Black users, including the option 
for business owners to identify their business as Black
-
owned in Google 
Maps and search. We also announced $175 
million economic opportunity 
package to support Black business owners, start
-
up founders, job seekers 
and developers. In addition to YouTube's $100 million fund to amplify Black 
creators and orders. We commit to contributing to long
-
term meaningful 
change,
 
both externally and within Google. And with that, I'll now turn it 
over to Ruth.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks, Sundar. We are cautiously encouraged by our results for the second 
quarter, although mindful of the fragile global economic environment. Our 
advertising re
venues gradually improved through the quarter, and our non
-
advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance particularly 
Google Cloud and Play. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a 
consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year
-
ov
er
-
year changes. I will 
then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and conclude with 
outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.
 
Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the second 
quarter were $38.3 
billion, down 2% year
-
on
-
year and flat in constant 
currency. Year
-
on
-
year declines in our advertising revenues from Search and 
Network were offset by growth in Google Other and Google Cloud revenues. 
Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographi
c region are 
available in our earnings press release. Across each region, we saw a 
gradual improvement in revenues in the quarter with some differences 
reflecting product mix. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange 
rate movements resulted in app
roximately a 2% headwind to reported 
revenues.
 
Regarding our key expense lines. On a consolidated basis, total cost of 
revenues, including TAC, was $18.6 billion, up 7% year
-
on
-
year. Other cost 
of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.9 billion, up 18% 
year
-
over
-
year primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses. The biggest factors here 
again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other 
operations, including depreciation and then content acquisition costs 
primarily driven by content 
costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube 
Music and premium subscription services, followed by costs for YouTube's 
advertising
-
supported content.
 
Operating expenses were $13.4 billion, up 7% year
-
on
-
year. Headcount 
growth was the largest driver of year
-
on
-
year growth for both R&D and G&A. 
Secondarily, the increase in G&A reflects contributions mainly for COVID 
response and reserves for estimated credit losses of our customers. The 
year
-
on
-
year decline in sales and marketing expenses was due to lower 
adverti
sing and promotional spend as we paused or rescheduled campaigns 
and pivoted to digital formats for flagship events. All 3 categories benefited 
from lower T&E expenses. Stock
-
based compensation totaled $3.3 billion. 
Headcount was up 4,450 from the first qu
arter. Again, the majority of new 
hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the 
most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both 
technical and sales roles.
 
Operating income was $6.4 billion, down 30% year
-
ove
r
-
year, and our 
operating margin in the quarter was 17%. Other income and expense was 
$1.9 billion, which primarily reflects an unrealized increase in the market 
value of equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within 
OI&E in our earnin
gs press release.
 
Our effective tax rate was 15.9%. Net income was $7 billion, and earnings 
per diluted share were $10.13.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter 
was $5.4 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment
 
results. 
Operating cash flow was $14 billion with free cash flow of $8.6 billion. We 
repurchased $6.9 billion of our shares. We ended the quarter with cash and 
marketable securities of approximately $121 billion.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial r
esults. Starting with our Google 
segment. Revenues were $38 billion, down 2% year
-
over
-
year. I'll now go 
through the individual advertising revenue lines. Starting with Google Search 
and other advertising revenues. We generated $21.3 billion in revenues in
 
the quarter, down 10% year
-
over
-
year in the aggregate with improvement 
as the quarter progressed. We saw a gradual return in user search activity to 
more commercial topics throughout the quarter followed by an increase in 
spending by advertisers. This res
ulted in an improvement in year
-
on
-
year 
search revenue trends during the quarter with Search revenues essentially 
flat to last year by the end of June.
 
YouTube advertising revenues were $3.8 billion, up 6% year
-
on
-
year driven 
by ongoing substantial growth 
in direct response offset by a continued 
decline in brand advertising, which then moderated toward the end of the 
quarter.
 
Network advertising revenues were $4.7 billion, down 10% year
-
on
-
year 
with trends improving somewhat toward the end of the quarter as
 
advertisers spend began to return.
 
Turning to Google Cloud, including GCP and G Suite. Revenues were $3 
billion for the second quarter, up 43% year
-
over
-
year. GCP maintained the 
strong level of revenue growth it delivered in the first quarter, and its 
rev
enue growth was again meaningfully above cloud overall. GCP growth 
was again led by our infrastructure offerings and our data and analytics 
platform. Overall, the lower Google Cloud revenue growth in the second 
quarter relative to the first quarter reflect
s the fact that G Suite lapped a 
price increase that was introduced in April last year. G suite maintained 
healthy growth in average revenue per seat as well as in seat growth, which 
does not include customers who took advantage of our free trials as they 
shifted their employees to work
-
from
-
home.
 
Other revenues were $5.1 billion, up 26% year
-
over
-
year primarily driven by 
growth in Play and YouTube non
-
advertising revenues. Within Play, app 
revenues in the second quarter benefited from the impact of very st
rong 
growth in the number of active buyers with more people at home looking for 
entertainment. Within YouTube subscription revenues, we continue to 
benefit from subscriber growth across its various offerings. Total traffic 
acquisition costs were $6.7 billi
on or 22% of total advertising revenues and 
down 8% year
-
over
-
year. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising 
revenues, was up slightly year
-
over
-
year.
 
Google operating income was $7.6 billion, down 26% versus last year, and 
the operating margin was 
20%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was 
$4.8 billion, reflecting investments in servers, data centers and office 
facilities.
 
Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. For the second quarter, 
revenues were $148 million primarily generated by Fiber a
nd Verily. The 
operating loss was $1.1 billion.
 
Let me end with our outlook. As I said earlier, ads revenue gradually 
improved during the quarter across Search, YouTube and network. However, 
we believe it is premature to gauge the durability of recent tren
ds, given the 
obvious uncertainty of the global macro environment.
 
As we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, global macroeconomic 
performance has tended to be correlated with ad spend and is a key signal 
to monitor. Over the long term, we remain opt
imistic about the underlying 
strength of our business. In terms of Google Cloud, we are pleased with the 
traction we're having with large customers who are making multiyear 
commitments with us. This is reflected in the strength of our backlog, which 
ended 
the quarter at $14.8 billion, substantially all of which relates to 
Google Cloud. This performance is a result of the investments we are making 
into the cloud go
-
to
-
market organization. Google Play's Q2 results reflect 
growth in the number of new buyers wi
th accelerated adoption as people 
stayed home. Performance also reflects the significant investments we have 
made in the ecosystem to support developers and users, such as successful 
promotion and adoption of our partners' apps and games in new locales 
aro
und the world and expanding the availability of local forms of digital 
payments.
 
Moving on to profitability. The decline in our Search revenues put significant 
pressure on profitability, which was further impacted by our ongoing 
investments for long
-
term g
rowth. As I discussed last quarter, much of our 
expense base, both in cost of revenues and OpEx is not directly correlated 
with changes in revenues. For example, although TAC and content 
acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there's a sizable p
ercentage 
of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature, 
such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as 
well as for activities like customer support and content review. We remain 
focused on the 
user and customer experience, and we'll continue to invest to 
support our products. .
 
With respect to operating expenses, although we still expect the pace of 
headcount growth to decelerate somewhat in 2020, we're continuing to hire 
aggressively in priorit
y areas like cloud. We still expect that headcount 
additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. 
Consistent with prior years, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be 
more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part
 
to support 
product launches and the holiday season.
 
Turning to CapEx. We continue to expect a modest decrease in the level of 
total CapEx in 2020 compared with last year. This is particularly due to our 
decision to slow the pace at which we acquire office
 
buildings in the near 
term as we focus on reimagining the optimal work environment. This also 
reflects the slower pace of ground
-
up construction for both our office 
facilities and data centers due to COVID
-
19. In terms of technical 
infrastructure, as we d
iscussed last quarter, we anticipate investment to 
remain at roughly the same level as in 2019 with relatively more spend on 
servers than on data center construction and benefiting from our ongoing 
focus on server efficiency. With respect to capital alloca
tion, our primary use 
of capital continues to be, to support organic growth in our businesses 
followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We 
complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in 
our press rele
ase today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to 
an additional $28 billion of our Class C stock. Thank you, and Sundar and I 
will now take your questions.

efforts. I want to understand some of the moves you're making strategically 
and how you think that positions you broadly against, obviously, an e
-
commerce landscape that's seeing a lot of pulled forward penetration given 
the current environmen
t. And second on YouTube, obviously, a fairly volatile 
brand advertising environment and TV advertising remains in flux. What are 
the opportunities both in the U.S. and globally to go after sort of TV ad 
budgets under the YouTube umbrella?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On
 
Shopping, I spoke a little bit in my remarks, but really excited at the 
potential there. The team has been executing very well. Overall, users come 
to Google a lot to find the products they are looking for, but we see an 
opportunity to invest and make the
 
experience better. Sometimes the 
journeys may fail because they don't find what they're looking for. So we 
want to make sure it's comprehensive.
 
Next when people find what they like, we want to make it simple for them to 
transact. And so working on that e
nd
-
to
-
end experience has been a big 
focus. And obviously, making sure for merchants, really making sure we are 
open to business for merchants, and we are giving value to them has been 
the focus. The early indications are that users are responding positivel
y, 
both in terms of user engagement and more importantly, giving value back 
to merchants for their investment there. So in some ways, it's a return to 
our first principles. We want to ensure that Google is the best place for 
merchants to connect with users
. And so I'm excited by it, and you'll 
continue to see us focus in this area.
 
The second was on YouTube brand. Obviously, YouTube has been doing well 
in terms of engagement and watch time. And so we see a long
-
term 
opportunity there. We've had strength on 
direct response as well through 
this quarter. But on brand, which was your question, we are obviously 
investing not just in YouTube main product, YouTube TV as well. And so 
areas where we can offer a bundle, advertisers are interested in streaming, 
and so 
bringing that bundle together, especially to advertisers and upfronts 
through YouTube Select is a big opportunity as well. So we are focused on 
that.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
I have two. Just 
first, Ruth, curious if you can just talk about the cost 
structure a little bit more. We know you'll continue to invest to drive growth 
over the long term. Just curious how you're thinking about it as the top line 
starts to recover more hopefully over comi
ng quarters. And then secondly, I 
know you said that search trends were flat to last year by the end of June. 
Just curious if there's anything you could add in terms of what you've seen 
more recently over the last month as well.
 
Ruth Porat
 
Thanks for this,
 
Doug. So in terms of cost structure, as we talked about last 
quarter, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency in the 
near term. And that being said, as Sundar and I both noted, what you're 
seeing is the fact that we do remain focused on
 
investing for the long term. 
So sort of breaking that down in cost of revenues, while TAC and content 
acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable 
percentage of other cost of revenues that are not directly correlated with 
revenue g
rowth, as I noted in opening comments, and we are very focused 
on the user experience and the overall ecosystem. So we are investing to 
make sure that we're supporting our products so they remain reliable in all 
environments.
 
And then in OpEx, much of our 
operating expense is generally less variable 
and not necessarily correlating to revenues in the near term. So in terms of 
a couple of the items, although we do continue to expect the year
-
on
-
year 
headcount growth rate to decelerate, as I noted, we are hiri
ng aggressively 
in priority areas like Cloud. And so we're taking near
-
term steps to enhance 
efficiency but still investing for the long term. So we're trying to make sure 
that we're getting those tradeoffs right. And as I noted, we do expect the 
year
-
on
-
y
ear headcount growth rate in 2020 to be down somewhat from the 
20% year
-
on
-
year rate last year, and that's even adjusting for 2 items that 
put upward pressure on headcount growth. The first, we're moving certain 
customer support roles from third
-
party vend
ors to Google's in
-
house 
operation center. That is actually OpEx neutral, but does increase reported 
spend. And then second, the pending acquisition of Fitbit. So we're trying to 
navigate it appropriately.
 
In terms of your second question, in terms of sear
ch trends and what we 
saw throughout the quarter, I would say that following a rough end to the 
first quarter, ads revenue gradually improved in the quarter, not only in 
Search, but YouTube and Network. And so for Search, we ended March at a 
midteens perce
ntage decline in year
-
on
-
year revenues. And then as we 
progressed through the second quarter, we saw a gradual return in user 
search activity to more commercial topics, and then that was followed by an 
increase in spending by advertisers. So that resulted 
in a gradual 
improvement in year
-
on
-
year Search revenue trends in the second quarter. 
We ended basically flat to last year by the end of June and you know to 
carry it forward, although we're pleased that ads revenue gradually 
improved throughout the quarte
r.
 
As I said, we do believe it's premature to say, they were out of the woods 
given the fragile nature of the macro environment. And as you're aware, ad 
spend does tend to be correlated with macroeconomic performance. And so 
the macro backdrop will continu
e to be a key signal to monitor. But to your 
question, based on our estimates from the end of June through last quarter, 
there has been a modest improvement in July.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
 
Heather Bell
ini
 
I just wanted to ask a question on 
--
 
two questions related to Google Cloud, 
if I could. One, Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us how 
you've seen the change in pace of customers migrating workloads to the 
cloud given COVID? And I'm also 
wondering if you could share with us kind 
of the puts and takes, and Microsoft talked about this a little bit last week 
with their Azure business, but for those that have accelerated workload 
migration to the cloud, how much has that offset the impacted in
dustries or 
companies that you might be serving where they're seeing lower utilization 
than what they normally do of cloud capacity? So if you can kind of talk 
about the puts and takes to the growth as well, that would be great.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Thanks, Heath
er. Overall, from my vantage point, obviously with Google 
Cloud, we've been investing to scale up, especially on the people side, on 
engineering, go
-
to
-
market and then, obviously on our investment side with 
data centers, cloud regions and so on. And so for
 
me, it's been good to see 
as we are scaling up, we are executing more effectively. I've been personally 
involved in many, many conversations last quarter. We had many large 
customers come on to cloud, big telco deals and banking deals, Deutsche 
Bank, as a
n example. So overall, I felt the momentum was strong. 
Generally, felt like things were continuing well through the course. Felt like 
more a secular interest in our digital transformation companies are deeply 
thinking long term and planning for us. So over
all, I felt at the moment, 
almost there. And I felt our execution as we are scaling up. Obviously, we 
are scaling up a lot. And so it's 
--
 
the combination is working well.
 
Your second question in terms of puts and takes. Overall, I think there are 
--
 
I won
't 
--
 
I don't know whether there's anything significant worth for me 
highlighting. Obviously, you are right to point out that it doesn't affect 
everyone the same, but nothing significant for me to highlight here today.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes 
from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two. The first one, Sundar, we try to always figure out changes in 
consumer behavior. I guess as you have sort of been studying what people 
have been doing through shelter
-
in
-
place and from the way t
hings are 
changing from a consumer perspective, talk to us about areas you're most 
focused on, investing in and driving your teams to create new products to 
really help consumers with their changing habits. And then the second one, 
Ruth, I know as we sort 
of we look ahead with potentially a larger 
percentage of the workforce, work remote or work from home, without 
looking for quantification, maybe just talk to us about some puts and takes 
to areas where you could see either efficiency or higher potential co
sts from 
a larger percentage of the workforce being remote over the long term.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Yes. On the first one, when there is 
--
 
the shift to online is profound. We see 
people engaging a lot, doing newer things than they did before. People's 
interests 
have 
--
 
are broadening, I would say, across the board. And so for 
example, we are 
--
 
for me, I'm looking at different types of user journeys 
and making sure each of them is getting deeper and better. So for example, 
in Google, as people have started coming
 
for more health
-
related 
information, how is that experience working, thinking about that for the 
long
-
term and investing in it. I obviously spoke about Shopping earlier, and 
that's been a big focus for us. Education in general. And when we think 
through s
mall, medium businesses and bigger companies thinking through 
collaboration, where G Suites' potential is, the investments we are 
undertaking, all that is very exciting to me.
 
But I would say cutting underneath all that, maybe while we didn't talk 
about it
, really focused on our AI teams doing the investments they need, 
evolving our next
-
generation TPUs and the team's building better models 
and better algorithms. All that, I think, our ability to do more things is 
something I'm really interested in and focu
sed on as well. So that's 
something I'm excited about 
--
 
for the longer term.
 
Ruth Porat
 
And then in terms of your question about work
-
from
-
home, I think it's a 
great point because it obviously feeds so much into a lot of the product work 
that we're doing 
in Cloud through G Suite, et cetera. So that's where I would 
actually start, but I appreciate what you're asking is how are we looking at 
our own cost base. And we called that out last quarter, in particular, with 
respect to CapEx, and you can sort of see 
it here this quarter. The main 
change in CapEx has really been we slowed the pace on the office facilities 
front. And what we're looking at is really how to reimagine what the 
workplace will look like. We continue to be very much focused on the fact 
that p
lace and space are important. We believe in collaboration. Serendipity 
is key to innovation. So we do view space in office as important and are very 
focused on what does that mean over the long term.
 
We've actually opened quite a number of our offices, in 
fact, in 40 countries 
and do hope to reopen in many more. But your question to what does it 
mean for overall cost structure, we're looking at that with the place you see 
it now is in our CapEx, and the way we've been looking at it and our 
indication that w
e do expect 2020 will be lower CapEx on the facility side as 
a result.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.
 
Brent Thill
 
I was just curious if you could just comment in terms of some of the near
-
term business trends and 
anything that's changed as you've gone through 
the month of July versus what you saw in June?
 
Ruth Porat
 
Sure. I already commented on that with respect to Search, but to broaden it 
a bit more, and again, this is based on estimates from the end of June 
thro
ugh last week. So for YouTube, we ended March with a year
-
on
-
year 
growth rate in the high single digits, and that's reflecting a substantial 
headwind from brand. The headwind from brand moderated modestly at the 
end of the second quarter, and then we saw a
 
further improvement in July. 
Direct response has been consistently strong.
 
For Network, revenues improved toward the end of the second quarter, and 
we have seen a further slight improvement in July. Obviously, 3 weeks is not 
a quarter, but that's based on
 
the estimates here from the end of June. And 
then as Sundar and I both said, when you look at, for example, Cloud, it has 
maintained its strength consistently. And I'd say that with a business that's 
growing at this pace, it's really much more about a sec
ular trend to the 
move to cloud. So really nothing to comment on there.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. Sundar, I don't know how much you can comment on the regulatory 
environment, but it's obv
iously top of mind with the hearing yesterday. 
Maybe just characterize it for Google right now. And are you seeing any 
progress with the regulatory environment? And then secondly, we saw the 
YouTube TV price increase, a pretty interesting business model. B
ut longer 
term, do you see that as really strategically important for the YouTube 
brand? Or do you think you can have a really profitable business on that?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
On the regulatory front, we've obviously been operating under scrutiny for a 
while, an
d we realize, at our scale, that's appropriate. And we've engaged 
constructively across jurisdictions. And from my standpoint, I'm confident in 
the approach we take, our focus on users and in the evidence in almost all 
areas we operate in. We expand choice
 
or overall lower prices. And it's 
--
 
overall, there's a very fast pace of innovation. So it's dynamic and 
competitive.
 
Having said that, obviously, we will operate based on the rules. And so to 
the extent there are any areas where we need to adapt, we wil
l. And as a 
company, I think we will be, I think, being flexible around those things is 
important, I think. I think the scrutiny is going to be here for a while, and so 
we are committed to working through it. On the second question around 
YouTube TV, yes, 
there is 
--
 
I mean, it's a good question. I spoke earlier 
about even from a brand and how people think about it, they are interested 
in streaming. So as YouTube TV gets more scale, I think we will see more 
opportunities there. We are obviously still in the
 
early stages of building out 
the product. And just recently, we've added a bunch of new channels and 
making sure it's working well.
 
In the U.S., the TV market is a big part of the advertising market, too. So 
overall, if we can invest here and scale up, I 
think the synergies with 
YouTube will become more meaningful over time. And so excited the traction 
the product is getting. But still too early.
 
Operator
 
And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore.
 
Kevin Rippey
 
This one is for Sundar. I wa
s hoping you might be able to expand on the 
earlier comment you made about the AI strategy. I'm particularly 
wondering, if there's been things over the past 5 months since the pandemic 
began, that you thought an expansion of a very high strategy or an 
evol
ution of the past strategy might be able to solve for whether that relates 
to commercialization or monetization or really anything across the business. 
Just really, really curious.
 
Sundar Pichai
 
An area which 
--
 
first of all, across the board, the progress
 
is steep. So I'm 
very happy with the pace at which our R&D on AI is progressing. And for 
me, it's important that we are state
-
of
-
the
-
art as a company, and we are 
leading. And to me, I'm excited at the pace at which our engineering and 
R&D teams are workin
g both across Google and DeepMind. So I'm excited 
about it. Specifically, we are making good progress in areas like language 
understanding. And you saw some improvements last year, significant 
improvements with BERT and Search. But BERT took us a few years
 
to get 
there. But things like that, I see more stuff in the future. And so excited by 
it.
 
An area where I think we are still under
-
tapped vis
-
à
-
vis potential is 
definitely Cloud. We see the potential there. But 
--
 
and I think it's a bit 
related to Heather
's question, too. I think companies are thinking about 
migrating workloads and so on. But the longer run opportunity of actually 
using AI to truly have business solutions for you for whatever industry you 
are in, that feels like there's a lot of potential,
 
and we are still very early 
there. And so part of it is, for us, connecting the dots internally and bringing 
it as solutions to our users. We have done it in certain product areas, but I 
see there's a bigger opportunity in the future.
 
Operator
 
And our nex
t question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. I just had two questions. First, on YouTube subscription. So can you 
talk about the size of that area of the business relative to that $15 billion? 
We had it at about 15% of total YouTub
e revenue. And then how is the 
faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long
-
term 
profitability goals at YouTube? And then the second question is on Search. 
So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year
-
on
-
year is pretty encouragin
g. If 
we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you 
characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside 
of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre
-
COVID levels in 
those areas?
 
Ruth Porat
 
So in
 
terms of the first question, we haven't broken out the specifics within 
the YouTube subscription revenues. YouTube subscriptions are in Other 
revenues, it's not in advertising revenues. And overall, as we think about the 
opportunity 
--
 
our view is 
--
 
and 
we talked about this when we were 
launching the subscription product, it was really responsive to what we were 
hearing from users. And as we look at it, music is a key part of the overall 
YouTube experience. It's an important component of watch time. And w
hat 
we found is that users wanted 
--
 
they wanted choice and some wanted a 
premium YouTube experience with ad
-
free viewing and the ability to 
download songs and videos. And that was really the impetus.
 
In addition, YouTube Premium provides additional revenu
e streams for music 
labels and publishers. So for example, in 2019, YouTube paid the music 
industry over $3 billion. And what we've done is meaningfully ramp our 
geographic presence from 5 countries in the beginning of 2018 to 94 
countries today. And earli
er this year, we announced that YouTube Premium 
had more than 20 million paid subscribers, up more than 60% versus the 
prior year. So our subscriber numbers have continued to grow there, and it 
really was driven by the goal to give users choice.
 
Operator
 
A
nd our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
I guess maybe a follow
-
up to the earlier question on commerce. Beyond the 
marketplace functionality and some of the free year promotional 
transactions, I wonder how some of the 
other initiatives are going to play a 
role. And things I'm thinking specifically are, were you focused before on 
Google Checkout and Maps and some of the assistant functionality, how 
those may play a changing role in commerce on the Google platform.
 
Sundar
 
Pichai
 
Yes. Great question. I think the bar is to have that super simple experience, 
which is delightful and that you have peace of mind and satisfaction in terms 
of getting the product and being able to return it and so on. So the end
-
to
-
end funnel matte
rs a lot. And part of the reason why through the changes, a 
couple of things we have done. As you saw, we changed and we removed 
the commission for merchants to be on the platform. And part of it is by 
removing that. They can take that and invest in, be it
 
shipping, be it 
delivery, be it the customer experience. And so that matters, matters I think 
in the overall experience.
 
And from our standpoint, the Buy on Google experience is something which 
deeply investing in. Obviously, our integrations with PayPal,
 
our investments 
are underlying it to make sure for a lot of users that it's as close to a one
-
click experience as possible is a big part of the investment as well.
 
Operator
 
And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
I want to ask a broad question about Google. Google's place or position, 
whatever, in online retail. And I asked this because Google has also 
--
 
obviously been central. Search has been central, but also YouTube has been 
central to commerce, online commerce
 
for the last 20 years. We've gone 
through this pandemic where there's a real inflection point. We see it in 
Amazon's results. We see it in Shopify's results. And I'm not sure I see it in 
Google's results. So just talk about how you think, broadly, Google 
is 
positioned for what's really been like a 2 or 3 year pull
-
forward in 
accelerated ramp up of online retail demand. And are you positioned the way 
you want to be positioned now? Are there things you need to make to the 
--
 
changes you needed to make the pr
oducts and services to be better 
positioned?
 
Sundar Pichai
 
Obviously, I think as a company, our strength comes from the diverse 
categories in which we serve users, right? And it's not just product, it's 
services, it's wide areas, including areas like trave
l. So it's diversified. And 
--
 
but it also means through a pandemic, there are areas of strength, but there 
are areas of 
--
 
areas where you get impacted as well. So I think that's what 
is reflected in what you see. On e
-
commerce, you're right, direct e
-
com
merce providers are seeing a big inflection point. But in it are essential 
categories like groceries and stuff, which are built in, which we don't directly 
play in. But to us, the reason we are doing this long
-
term focused effort on 
shopping with the new l
eadership team is to precisely make sure as a 
platform, we are improving and as the shift continues, Google continues to 
be an important place by which people come and participate in those 
journeys.
 
So long run, I see a growth opportunity with related to w
hat we are 
investing in there as well. Not just through Search, but a Search in the 
Shopping investments we are making, but in YouTube, and also helping 
retailers on the cloud side. It's an area where there's naturally a lot of 
interest to work 
--
 
to partn
er with Google, and so we see that as a big 
opportunity as well.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Q3 2016 
earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen
-
only mode. Later we 
will conduct a question
-
and
-
answer session, and instructions will follow at 
that time. As a 
reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West (0:33), Head of 
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Unverified Participant
 
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third
 
quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and 
Sundar Pichai.
 
While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Dua 
Lipa, a rising new pop star from London, whose most recent single on 
YouTube has found fan
s all over the world and cracked the top 40 in the U.S. 
ahead of her debut album release early next year.
 
Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking, including statements 
regarding ou
r future investments, our long
-
term growth and innovation, the 
expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital 
expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results to differ ma
terially. For more information, 
please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10
-
K for 2015 filed with 
the SEC. Any forward
-
looking statements that we make are based on 
assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.
 
During
 
this call, we will present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
today's earnings press release.
 
As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor 
Relations website locat
ed at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast 
from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.
 
And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.

Alphabet, Inc.
 
Thank you, Ellen (2:06).
 
Our revenue of $22.5 billio
n in the third quarter underscores the terrific 
performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated 
revenue grew 23% in constant currency versus last year, notwithstanding a 
challenging year
-
on
-
year comparison. Once again, the primary
 
driver was 
Mobile Search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and important 
contributions from programmatic advertising and Play.
 
I'm going to present to you in the following order. First, review the quarter 
on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, revi
ew the results for each of 
Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will 
then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which 
we will take your questions.
 
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consol
idated financial performance, 
total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year over year and up 4% 
sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year 
over year of $196 million or $91 million after the benefit of our hedging 
program. Hold
ing currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 
23% year over year and increased 5% sequentially.
 
Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business 
around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 22% year over year to $10.6 billion
. 
UK revenue was up 5% year over year to $1.9 billion, reflecting the 
meaningful impact of the decline in the British pound relative to last year. In 
fixed FX terms, the UK grew 18% year over year. Rest
-
of
-
world revenue was 
up 22% versus last year to $9.9 
billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 
25% year over year.
 
GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.5 billion, up 30% year over year. Non
-
GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year over year, 
primarily driven by Google
-
related expenses, spec
ifically costs associated 
with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content 
acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
 
GAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over 
year. Non
-
GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 bi
llion, up 13% year over 
year.
 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last 
year. The operating margin was 26%. Non
-
GAAP operating income was $7.6 
billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%.
 
Stock
-
based compensa
tion [SBC] totaled $1.9 billion, up 30% year over 
year and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step
-
up from our 
annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3.
 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 69,953, up 3,378 people from last 
quar
ter. Headcount growth is typically seasonally highest in the third quarter 
as new graduates join. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of 
new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in 
priority areas such as cloud.
 
Other in
come and expense was $278 million. We provide more detail on the 
line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.
 
Our effective tax rate was 16%.
 
Net income was $5.1 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.3 billion on a non
-
GAAP 
basis. Earnings per diluted sh
are were $7.25 on a GAAP basis and $9.06 on 
a non
-
GAAP basis.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was 
$2.6 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google 
segment. Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion, with f
ree cash flow of $7.3 
billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $83.1 
billion, of which approximately $50 billion or 60% is held overseas.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google 
segment. Revenu
e was $22.3 billion, up 20% year over year, which includes 
the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was 
$16.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% year over year and up 4% sequentially. 
Year
-
on
-
year growth reflects strength in Mobil
e Search. We continue to have 
decent growth from desktop and tablet search.
 
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven 
primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution 
from buying on DoubleClick Bid Mana
ger.
 
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 1% year on year and flat sequentially, 
reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob, offset by 
the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.4 
billion, up 39% year over year 
and up 12% sequentially. Year
-
over
-
year 
growth was driven by Play and Cloud.
 
Finally, we provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and 
volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in 
our earnings press 
release. Let me remind you that these metrics are 
affected by currency movements.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs [TAC] were $4.2 billion or 21% of total 
advertising revenue, up 17% year over year and up 5% sequentially. The 
increase in both Sites TAC as a
 
percentage of Sites revenue as well as 
network TAC as a percentage of network revenue reflects the fact that our 
strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry 
higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was u
p 
slightly sequentially as a result of higher TAC for Mobile Search offsetting the 
benefits of a revenue mix shift from network to Sites.
 
Operating income excluding SBC was $8.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, 
for an operating margin of 38%. Google's sto
ck
-
based compensation totaled 
$1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year over year. Operating income 
reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 17% versus last year, and 
the operating margin was 30%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, 
reflecting
 
investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center 
construction.
 
Turning to Other Bets, as we said previously, we think it remains most 
instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon 
because, as you have seen, qu
arterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy 
for three primary reasons. First, the Other Bets are early
-
stage. Second, 
they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different 
industries. And finally, they may be impacted by one
-
time items like 
par
tnership deals.
 
For the third quarter, Other Bets revenue was $197 million, primarily 
generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $665 
million in the third quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was 
$865 million. Ot
her Bets CapEx was $324 million in Q3, primarily reflecting 
ongoing investments in our Fiber business.
 
I'd like to close with a few observations on our progress since the creation of 
Alphabet just over a year ago as well as a review of our key themes. As 
w
e've frequently noted, our move to Alphabet was motivated by our belief 
that revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas. Long
-
term success 
requires a commitment to making bets, putting the right talent and 
resources behind those bets, and remainin
g flexible and dynamic as we 
pursue them. We believe our structure provides the transparency and 
oversight needed to make smart choices about our investment opportunities 
both within Google and across Other Bets.
 
As we reach for moon shots that will have a
 
big impact in the longer term, 
it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that 
some efforts will be more successful than others. Over the past year, for 
example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some 
areas while repositioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the 
steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future.
 
Looking ahead, first regarding revenue, our revenue growth reflects our 
sustained investment in innovation. Within Google,
 
this relentless focus has 
led to innovations across our advertising platforms that have driven 
continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we're 
building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth. Most 
notably, G
oogle Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting 
the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity 
in this area. And earlier this month, we launched a new line of hardware 
devices that, for the first time, brings cons
umers the best of Google through 
both hardware and software developed by Google.
 
As discussed previously, because most of our Other Bets are pre
-
revenue, 
the Other Bets revenue line provides only partial insight regarding our 
progress, which we aim to supp
lement with insight regarding product 
progress. For example, at Nest, product innovations and improvements, 
including the new outdoor version of the Nest Cam, are leading to increased 
consumer adoption of its suite of products for the home. Our self
-
drivin
g car 
team is making terrific progress in transforming mobility, with our fleet of 
test cars recently passing the 2 million
-
mile mark of autonomous driving. We 
are now testing our cars in four cities, enabling us to experience varied 
weather and driving co
nditions.
 
Second, as to expenses, as I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of 
factors driving higher TAC in both our Sites and network businesses, and 
those factors persisted in the third quarter. The shift to mobile in Q3 
remained the largest drive
r of the increase in Sites TAC as a percentage of 
revenue. We expect Sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of 
Sites revenue. The growth in network TAC in Q3 was due to the ongoing 
adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are sub
ject to a 
higher TAC rate, a trend we expect to continue. Furthermore, with respect to 
Google's operating expenses, we remain committed to investing in the 
compelling opportunities we've identified.
 
Turning to Other Bets, we're building out these businesse
s systematically 
and thoughtfully, investing commensurate with requirements given the 
opportunities we see.
 
Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth 
quarter; as discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically 
weighted m
ore heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday 
season. Relative to last year, we have an expanded portfolio of hardware 
products, and therefore expect marketing costs to increase in the fourth 
quarter to support the line.
 
Third regarding C
apEx, at Google the team continues to drive meaningful 
efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. With 
regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment remains 
the primary driver.
 
Fourth, our balance sheet; ou
r balance sheet remains a powerful tool 
reflecting the strength of our cash flow and thereby giving us the ability to 
invest aggressively to support our long
-
term growth. Our primary focus is 
just that, investing in the breadth of opportunities across Alph
abet. As 
discussed previously, our capital allocation framework begins with our 
outlook for the businesses, including a sensitivity analysis regarding 
potential CapEx and M&A, as well as a view regarding working capital and a 
prudent liquidity buffer. This
 
framework further considers complementary 
uses such as the share repurchase. As announced today our board has 
authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up 
to $7,019,340,976.83.
 
In conclusion, in the third quarter we again deli
vered strong revenue growth 
while broadening our portfolio of products and services. Thanks to all of our 
colleagues around the globe for their ingenuity and passion for pushing the 
frontier.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.

Google,
 
Inc.
 
Thanks, Ruth.
 
I don't think I can remember a busier time in Google's history than the past 
few months. We introduced the world to the Google Assistant, powered by 
our state
-
of
-
the
-
art machine learning technology. We unveiled a beautiful 
lineup of new
 
hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel phone, 
which is getting great reviews. We launched a new messaging app, Allo, and 
a new video chat app, Duo. It's been an incredible quarter. Through it all, we 
are laser
-
focused on the priorities I ou
tlined earlier this year, and in the next 
few minutes I'll quickly go through our progress this past quarter.
 
We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing. This new 
era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally a
nd 
seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and 
the cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade 
from desktops to mobile devices.
 
As we've rolled out products like the Google Assistant, Pixel,
 
Google Home, 
and Allo, we have gotten a glimpse of that future. And with our growing 
cloud business, we are helping our enterprise customers take advantage of 
this new era of computing as well. Today I want to walk through our 
progress across Google's key
 
focus areas and the success of our growing 
advertising business.
 
First, making knowledge and information accessible to everyone, we have 
long aimed to help people find the information that they want right when 
they need it and sometimes even before they t
hink to ask for it. We reached 
an important milestone in that journey this quarter with the launch of the 
Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural 
conversational way to help you get things done regardless of the device 
yo
u're using. We first introduced it in our smart messaging app, Allo, which 
lets you chat with the Assistant. You can even add it to a group conversation 
to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner. Early adoption of 
Allo and Duo has been gre
at and has exceeded our expectations.
 
And the Assistant is core to the Pixel phone and Google Home. With Google 
Home, you can ask the Assistant to cast a song to your living room speaker 
or turn on the lights in your kitchen. And with Pixel, by simply hold
ing the 
home button, you can ask the Assistant to send a text to your mom or pull 
up pictures of your cat in Google Photos.
 
I hope you all get to try them out soon. The Assistant is simple, easy to use, 
and it is just the beginning. It's going to get so mu
ch better. We are excited 
to bring new features to you across more of your contacts soon.
 
The Assistant all possible thanks to our years of investments in computer 
science and machine learning. Our knowledge graph now understands over 
70 billion facts abou
t people, places, and things in the real world. And just 
last month, we announced our latest research on neural nets, which has 
given us a huge leap in translation quality. This breakthrough will help us 
provide even more accurate translations for people a
round the world.
 
And before I finish talking about access to information, I want to highlight 
the important work that our teams are doing to help American voters stay 
informed about the upcoming election. We've launched improved search 
tools to help voters
 
get registered, find key deadlines and learn how to vote 
early or by mail. We launched these in both English and Spanish. I don't 
speak Spanish, but I checked Google Translate, and I wanted to remind 
everyone, no se olviden de votar. [Don't forget to vote
.]
 
Second, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places, key to 
making information accessible is helping people find more great content 
across platforms like the web, YouTube, and Google Play. Just recently, one 
of our key efforts to make the
 
mobile web faster, the open
-
source Project 
AMP [Accelerated Mobile Pages] celebrated its first birthday. It's being 
embraced by a very broad range of publishers and sites around the world, 
covering more than 700,000 domains. One example, tens of millions 
of 
WordPress sites now have AMP pages with page load speeds up to 90% 
faster than normal in some cases. We are also working on an initiative called 
AMP for Ads, a new approach to creating and selling ads with speed at the 
heart of the experience.
 
On YouTub
e, we continue to invest in bringing engaging content to the 
platform. We worked with many news organizations to livestream all three 
U.S. presidential debates, and we saw record
-
breaking interest from the 
YouTube community. In fact, the three debates rank
ed as the three most 
viewed political live streams of all time on YouTube, with over 8.5 million 
hours watched live, a 5X increase from the 2012 debates. Elections
-
related 
searches on YouTube are also at an all
-
time high, with searches for U.S. 
election co
ntent up almost 550% compared to this time in the last election.
 
And YouTube originals like the recently released Single by 30 remain 
incredibly popular and continue to drive subscriptions for the YouTube brand.
 
And in Google Play, earlier this 
summer we introduced Family Library, a way 
for up to six family members to share app, game, movie, TV show, or book 
purchases.
 
Third, powerful computing platforms and hardware; we have long been 
committed to building powerful computing platforms like Andro
id, Chrome, 
and now Daydream in VR, so that people can have great experiences 
regardless of their device.
 
Taking a step back, we have always believed that an open, horizontal, free 
platform like Android breeds more innovation, more options for users, and 
b
etter business models for partners. We open
-
source our code, we build the 
most open APIs possible, and we work to create a sustainable open 
ecosystem. With over 4,000 distinct Android devices, we are really proud of 
how so many partners are having success 
on the platform.
 
This quarter we began rolling out our newest update on Android called 
Nougat and shared that we are bringing Android apps to Chromebooks. We 
can't wait to see all of the incredible experiences that developers will build 
on Daydream, our ne
west platform for high
-
quality virtual reality 
experiences via smartphones.
 
We also think there's an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate 
software and hardware together to deliver great experiences that we hope 
will also contribute to future innovat
ion and development of the ecosystem.
 
Earlier this month, we launched a family of hardware products, made by 
Google, which in addition to the Google Pixel and Google Home, include: the 
Daydream View headset and controller; our premium TV streaming device, 
Chromecast Ultra; and the new connected Wi
-
Fi system called Google Wifi. 
This portfolio of products is an example of how we can marry the best of 
hardware and software to deliver the best Google experience to people.
 
Fourth, our increasing momentum in clou
d; as we focus our efforts in the 
cloud, we continue to see strong customer engagement. Last month at our 
Horizon event, we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud, our unique 
and broad portfolio of products and services that let our customers operate
 
easily in a digital world with the performance they demand.
 
Google Cloud includes Google Cloud platform, our user
-
facing collaboration 
and productivity applications, now called G Suite, all of our data analytics 
and machine learning tools and APIs, and th
e enterprise
-
ready Android 
phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that access the cloud.
 
Our Cloud team has also been busy delivering new capabilities for our 
customers. We announced plans to expand to eight new cloud regions in 
2017, from Mumbai to Singapore to
 
São Paulo to Frankfurt, with more to 
come. We announced an enhanced media conference experience in Google 
Hangouts with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 
50 participants, and a seamless integration into Calendar. We've been us
ing 
the same technology to power meetings at Google, and are so excited to 
share the improved experience with our customers.
 
We also significantly upgraded Google BigQuery, our fully managed data 
analytics warehouse, and made Google Cloud Machine Learning 
available in 
beta to help businesses easily train quality machine learning models.
 
In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are 
partnering with great companies. This quarter, we forged new partnerships 
with OCTA [Orange County Trans
it Authority], Box, and Accenture.
 
Our investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage 
for Google Cloud, and we are helping customers apply ML in very concrete 
ways. For example, Ocado, the world's largest online
-
only grocery retailer
, is 
using machine learning to categorize and prioritize customer emails, which 
will help their support center respond to customers faster.
 
As we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same. 
We want to build the most open cloud for
 
all businesses and make it easy for 
them to build and run great software. The team is firing on all cylinders to 
create the best cloud products in the industry for our customers.
 
Now moving on to growing advertising business, which is thriving in a mobile
 
world. Our proposition to marketers on mobile is simple and is resonating. 
Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are 
where people turn when they are actively interested in something. They are 
using our services because they wan
t to actively watch something they are 
passionate about or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something. 
They are super
-
attentive and engaged. It's just like people used to be glued 
to their TV screen during prime time.
 
Our services are prime time f
or the mobile world. This matters for marketers 
because those prime time moments when people are actively interested and 
attentive are the perfect time for a brand to place their ads. For instance, 
hotel chain La Quinta now sees a third of their website tr
affic coming from 
mobile, and they use our hotel ads to help them reach travelers right when 
they are looking for hotel stays. They have found conversion rates to be 
twice as high with hotel ads compared to regular mobile traffic, which is 
helping them cap
italize on those prime time moments when travelers are on 
their phones and ready to book.
 
In video, YouTube continues to shine. More than 1 billion monthly users are 
watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. YouTube has 
become the platform o
f choice for major brands, with a highly engaged 
audience, the best formats, and industry
-
leading measurement tools. Recent 
research found that nearly half of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 54 
say that at least once a month, YouTube helps them in m
aking a decision 
about buying something.
 
One format that's been working really well for ad prices are bumper ads, 
which are snackable, 6
-
second videos that help brands drive incremental 
reach and frequency. Brands like Universal Pictures have been pairing 
these 
shorter videos with their standard length ads on YouTube, and they're seeing 
great results, especially on mobile.
 
We also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how 
TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for
 
their 
brand. From early tests, we have seen that YouTube generates almost twice 
as many searches per impression than TV generates.
 
In fact, across our advertising business, measurement is a critical 
investment. We want to give marketers the best tools out
 
there to close the 
loop between television and digital, online and offline. For example, global 
retailer IKEA, with their agency iProspect UK, used our store visits 
measurement tools to see how effective their digital marketing campaigns 
were at bringing 
shoppers into their stores. By incorporating store visit data, 
they realized that more than 10% of the people who clicked on their search 
ads went on to visit a physical store, and that their ROI from online ads was 
actually five times higher than they had
 
previously estimated.
 
We introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising 
Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with newer tools like 
location extensions and store visits measurements for the Google Display 
Network.
 
We ha
ve thousands of great partners who are getting terrific results from 
our products. I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working 
closer than ever with their advertising partners, agencies, marketers, and 
publishers. We can't succeed unless the
y do, and we have made a huge 
push to develop deeper partnerships and long
-
term win
-
win relationships. 
It's a big focus for us.
 
To wrap up, it's been an incredibly exciting few months and a very 
successful quarter. We feel extremely confident as we move in
to a new era 
of computing and are thrilled to be working with our partners as we embark 
on the journey together. I want to thank all of the Googlers around the 
world who work tirelessly to turn ideas into reality for our users and 
partners. It's an honor t
o work alongside you every day.
 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.

Thank you. And our first question come from Eric

Thank you so much for taking the question. Sundar, maybe for you, on the 
enterprise, thanks for laying out all the vision for the medium to long term 
on the enterprise and cloud.
 
I think one of the big questions we get from 
investors all the time are where are the key areas you need to invest going 
forward in both capabilities, go
-
to
-
market, and how those might evolve over 
the next couple years.
 
And then maybe a second question fo
r Ruth, which is more a housekeeping 
matter, Ruth, with highlighting the increased marketing expense behind the 
product launches this year, were you referencing quarter
-
over
-
quarter or 
comparing year
-
over
-
year when you also launched products a year ago? 
Th
anks so much.
 
Sundar Pichai

Google, Inc.
 
On cloud, let me talk about a few areas. We have stepped up our partnering 
considerably so that we can offer our customers everything they want, and 
we have more vehicles for going to market. So scaling up through
 
partnerships is a big area of focus and investment for us. We are also 
establishing a large cloud machine learning group so that we can take 
advantages of working with our cloud customers and make machine learning 
more accessible to all of them. I would s
ay other areas are hiring across 
sales, engineering, and marketing. And as we head into 2017, I expect cloud 
to be one of our largest areas of investment and head count growth.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And then on your second question, there were really
 
two parts to the 
statement. One, the obvious, is that sales and marketing is seasonally 
higher whenever we go into the holiday season. And so year on year, I 
wanted just to accentuate the point that we expect this trend to be 
pronounced this year because 
we're expanding. We're launching an even 
more expanded suite of hardware products. So it's really emphasizing the 
fact that the fourth quarter is higher and even more so this year with the 
expanded suite.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman

Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Thank you. I also wanted to ask a follow
-
up on the cloud. I guess I was 
wondering, Sundar, if you could share 
with us. What milestones should we 
be watching for in this business? And then also, if you had to characterize 

 
you mentioned a couple different ones, but I'm wondering. What type of 
workloads are you having the most success with in GCP, and what's on you
r 
customers' wish list? What's the top one or two things that your enterprise 
customers for cloud might be asking for? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Heather. In general, the way we see it is that customers don't want 
to be locked in and they
 
want to make sure their workloads can work in and 
be managed by containers that run on any platform. So our virtual machines 
and containers, including excellent open
-
sourced container management 
Kubernetes, which was developed by Google, offers that solut
ion. So 
Kubernetes manages the provisioning, reliability, and auto
-
scaling of 
workloads. So we want to pursue a hybrid strategy, including on
-
prem and 
in all public clouds. So from a customer standpoint, they will want to use an 
open source workload manage
ment product, and Kubernetes can work with 
multiple customers. So that's broadly how we think about it.
 
Operator
 
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche 
Bank. Your line is now open.
 
Ross Sandler 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thanks, guys, two questions. Sundar, first on the Alphabet structure high 
level, so there's been some incredible innovation that's come out of Alphabet 
and the various businesses. If we look at something like Otto, which was 
acquired by Uber, or Niantic, 
which was the old Google Maps team, those 
were teams that were inside of Google that left Alphabet to start a new 
company and could have been potentially wholly
-
owned businesses of 
Google in a parallel universe. So do you think this structure is ideal for 
entire 
companies, or is it just new products and new technologies that you see as 
the vision here for Alphabet long term?
 
And then, Ruth, the second question is just on 

 
core operating margins for 
Google have declined a little bit versus the prior quarter
 
trend of increasing. 
Can you give us some color on how much of that was due to mix towards 
cloud and other things that might carry lower margin versus margin 
compression within the advertising business? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
Ross, on the
 
first question, I would say overall when I look across Google 
and Alphabet, the number of areas where we have been able to build world
-
class products and achieve scale and success, we today have over seven 
products which serve 1 billion users each, so I t
hink our track record speaks 
there. And we generally want to encourage a culture of innovation and that's 
what we focus on, and I think it is fine that some of them happen outside. 
So we don't view it as a zero
-
sum game, and we're very comfortable with 
how
 
we approach it.
 
Ruth Porat 
-
 
Alphabet, Inc.
 
And then in terms of the margin trends, so overall operating margins year 
on year are up modestly on both a GAAP and non
-
GAAP basis, and that 
primarily reflects trends in Other Bets. I think your question was pr
obably 
more within Google. The operating margin on a non
-
GAAP basis is down 
modestly year on year. That's primarily to other cost of sales as distinct from 
TAC. The Google GAAP operating margins year on year and quarter on 
quarter do reflect the impact of 
the equity refresh that we called out last 
quarter that I talked about.
 
I think one of the core things to your question is just how we're looking at it, 
and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities and our 
commitment to long
-
term re
venue growth, as we've talked about, quarter 
after quarter we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of 
opportunities. And we've spent a lot of time trying to manage that revenue 
growth, and as I said, manage expense growth with the utmost re
spect for 
the resources deployed and getting the best return on those resources.
 
So there are a number of different factors in here. I think I mentioned one of 
the things as you're looking forward was the sales and marketing. And just 
to make another point
, which I said my opening comments, we do expect 
ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with Mobile 
Search and with programmatic. That does still result in more revenue and 
gross profit dollars but at a lower margin, and that's the other 
really 
important point with our starting point. We are continuing to invest, and we 
would point you to the revenue and gross profit dollars that come from that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is now open.
 
Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. With Google Home and the Pixel phones, are you rethinking at all 
your go
-
to
-
market strategy in terms of distribution and marketing? Google 
over the years has put out different h
ardware products. Have there been 
learnings from that that make you approach those two particular areas in 
Google Home and the Pixel phone lineup differently? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Mark. As you point out, we have done hardware pro
ducts over the 
years, but we saw an opportunity to bring all our display hardware efforts 
together in a thoughtful structure. I'm glad Rick [Osterloh] is here, and 
we've been very focused on how we approach everything end to end so that 
we can bring togeth
er software and hardware for a great user experience.
 
So along those lines, both Google Home in Google Pixel are important new 
efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go
-
to
-
market 
strategy as well. These are important areas. And you alr
eady see with 
Google Pixel we have a deep partnership at Verizon with which we are going 
to market in the U.S. And so we are constantly thinking about how to do this 
well, and you will see new approaches as we go through it more.

Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you talked about a lot of products 
a
cross advertising and hardware. I think one thing we did not hear about 
was Maps. And I think you've talked about it in the past as 1 billion
-
plus 
users and pretty massive engagement. So can you talk a little bit more 
about the monetization strategy here a
nd how you can really sell more 
advertising here but also preserve the user experience at the same time? 
And maybe talk about a timeframe that we could see more here. Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
That's a good question. Today, a big part of what yo
u're seeing with our 
transition to mobile that's working really well. The reason Mobile Search and 
mobile monetization works really well for us is because a lot of it is 
inherently local by nature. And the thing which helps us deliver a great local 
search 
experience is Maps. And so that's the direction we have always 
pointed in. We want it to be a great experience for consumers as Google 
Maps, but in terms of also really enhancing the local search experience. And 
I think you'll continue to see us perceive i
t that way. And over time to the 
extent there are opportunities to create value within the application itself, 
we'll pursue that as well.

Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about 
Voice. Sundar, you talked about the success you've had in improving your 
natural language recognition, and we know that voice queries are
 
growing 
quickly. I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts on how the increase 
in voice queries may or may not impact monetization going forward. Is it a 
risk, or is the growth of voice queries much more skewed to less commercial 
activity? Just any t
houghts there, thanks so much.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Peter. From my standpoint, I look at it as 

 
and if you look back in 
time, all this is 

 
computing is becoming more and more important to 
people, and so they are engaging with it more and 
more. So as we went 
from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other. The sum total 
of all of this, it expanded the pie. I approach this the same way. I think as I 
see people using Voice, et cetera, they are interacting more with computing 
and
 
with Google too. So we view this as providing users more access across 
many different surfaces, many different contexts, being there for them when 
they need it. So in that view, I think it will all be a big positive for us going 
forward.

Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just to go back to the Voic
e 
Search question, Sundar, could you just talk a little bit about if we do 
continue to migrate toward a world of Voice Search, just talk about 
infrastructure, potential build you think you need to put in place to continue 
to monetize search in a voice worl
d as well as you do in a phone or a 
desktop world.
 
And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit about where you are on the 
rollout of extended text ads? I know you talked about a 20% bump to click
-
through rates. I was just curious for where you are 
now, a push
-
out, and is 
there any update on the click
-
throughs? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
On the first question, I think I briefly answered it before. In terms of 

 
we 
are thinking about the voice experience deeply end to end. A lot of it is 
going 

 
because of how we are approaching our core investments both from a 
software and hardware standpoint, so we leverage it all to make it better. So 
for example, even things like TP usage we talked about at Google I/O play a 
role into something like Vo
ice Search you're talking about. And as we evolve 
the Google Assistant, I think voice is going to play a major role that way as 
well.
 
So we are in very early days of all of this in relation to our overall volumes 
we see, and so I think we will be thoughtfu
l about it. For example, the 
Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we 
can integrate third parties into the Voice experience. So it's early days, and I 
think we will evolve it a lot in the coming years.
 
In terms of your second
 
question around expanded text ads, I would say 
again it's early. It's being adopted by advertisers across the board. We see 
both large and small advertisers using it. For us, we find advertisers who 
actually spend their time being thoughtful about the ad 
creatives and 
extensively testing and optimizing for this new format, they find strong 
performance. So we are pleased with the progress so far, but the transition 
is going to take some time as advertisers get comfortable with it, but we are 
excited about i
t.

Good afternoon and thanks for taki
ng my questions. First one for Ruth, 
heading into this quarter's results, you had called out the ad format change 
in the third quarter of last year, which had driven a step up in the year
-
ago 
growth rate. I wonder, is there anything specific on the revenue
 
side that 
you'd like to call out in terms of comparisons versus the fourth quarter of 
last year as we try to calibrate our revenue expectations for the fourth 
quarter, either in terms of Mobile Search, YouTube, or ad tech 
programmatic?
 
And then my second 
question is either for Ruth or Sundar. Can you just talk 
about the decision to pause efforts for Google Fiber? I'm wondering, was 
that decision more about financial discipline, as you I think explained, Ruth, 
in your prepared remarks for the Other Bets, or
 
does it more have to do with 
the shift to wireless Internet technology or point
-
to
-
point wireless, which 
ultimately can take the place of a Fiber or facilities
-
based infrastructure over 
time? Thank you.

estions. So in terms of Sites revenue, we are very 
pleased by the strength. It was broad
-
based. It had two real drivers, first, 
our ongoing focus on improving the experience for advertisers and users. 
And we introduced a number of enhancements, including f
ormat changes in 
ad tools. I think the most important point is that no one enhancement came 
close to the magnitude of the changes that we made in the third quarter of 
last year. That's why we kept calling out the 2015 change. And what's been 
gratifying is 
in the aggregate the results reflect the benefit of ongoing 
innovation. But very importantly, it wasn't one particular item.
 
The second contributor is the secular shift to mobile, and we continue to 
benefit from that, be an important part of enhancing oppo
rtunities for 
engagement.
 
As we look forward to the fourth quarter, I think that was part of your 
question as well. I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at 
growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year, so 
that t
o us is an important point. It may be obvious, but important to note 
there.
 
In terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that 
we see to focus on innovation, and what does that mean if the objective with 
Other Bets is really thes
e 10X opportunities. And when you go back to the 
initial impetus for creating the business, it was the founders' view that 
there's a sizable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity on 
networks that are always fast and always open, and we do co
ntinue to be 
committed to that vision.
 
The team had some important breakthroughs in new technologies. You 
noted the most important in our view, all that we're doing with wireless, but 
also technologies that are key to implementation. And we believe that bo
th 
of those, a number of things they're doing enhance both our effectiveness 
and efficiency. And so we wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts 
before we reaccelerate deployment. And it was about ensuring that we can 
take advantage of those befo
re again pushing forth.
 
We were very active in a lot of cities in the third quarter alone. We rolled out 
four new cities, so that brings us to 12 cities across the U.S. where we're 
deployed, in construction, or in development, and we're making great 
progre
ss in those cities. We remain very committed to growth across those 
cities. And then we also have a presence in six cities with our wireless 
acquisition, Webpass. So we're pausing for now our work in eight cities 
where we've been in exploratory discussions
. But very much to your 
question, it's to better integrate some of the technology work we've been 
developing, and there's more detail on the cities on the Fiber side to the 
extent you want to go into those.

Okay, 
thank you very much. So, Sundar, it seems like from the outside 
looking in, the pace of product development and release seems to have 
accelerated, while at the same time it seems like you're gaining efficiencies 
with the assets you're deploying to run your
 
business and as your CapEx 
growth is moderating. So I'm wondering what concrete steps you may have 
taken to increase productivity or focus at the company and what you're 
doing now to continue to drive those gains going forward.
 
Then separately, as you cal
led out earlier, you are shipping an 
unprecedented amount of hardware devices. So as you think about what 
your product portfolio might look like over the next five years or even the 
next decade, does the Pixel phone market change in direction for Google to
 
become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company? 
Thanks.

Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Stephen. On the first thing, I would say we are very focused on our 
core mission. And we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way, 
than
ks to what we view as a point of inflection with machine learning. So 
refocusing the company on a set of initiatives, recognizing that point of 
inflection is what has helped us really focus on things. And things like the 
Google Assistant are a manifestatio
n of that, and you will see us continue to 
stay focused and innovate that way.
 
In terms of hardware, I think in our vision, computing is becoming more and 
more integral. It's going to be there for users in many different contexts. 
And so to really think an
d evolve it, you need to think about software and 
hardware together. That's where a lot of innovations happen. And so for us 
to push the paradigm, push the boundary, we are very committed to doing 
that. So it's a thoughtful effort from us. But overall, as 
I said in my remarks, 
we deeply remain committed to building an open ecosystem because at the 
end of the day we want Google to be there for every user everywhere. And 
to do that well, we want to work with partners and build a great ecosystem 
to make it hap
pen.

And just to add a bit more to Sundar's first answer or first response to your 
question about efficiency as it's expressed through CapEx spend, I think it 
will probably be helpful to add. The pace of spend reflects the 
ongoing 
success of the team driving meaningful efficiencies in planning and 
operations for our technical infrastructure. And that's enabled us to support 
growing demand but at a stable investment level. We've talked about that 
on prior calls as well, but I
 
think we're proud of what they've been doing 
there.
 
Some examples of efficiencies include improvements in server utilization and 
the use of machine learning that Sundar has talked about, and the 
deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Units t
hat he has 
commented. So the main thing is we're building greater productivity with 
existing machines. And what's important to note is that's not only good for 
Google products generally, but it's also valuable to our cloud offering for our 
enterprise custo
mers.

Thank you. Sundar, you mentioned a point of inflection within machine 
learning. Can you talk a bit more about the trade
-
offs in the productization 
and sale of that inflection through Google Cloud versus leveraging that 
innovation yourself through Goo
gle Assistant?
 
And maybe for Ruth, just any thoughts on potential future disclosures 
around the cloud business, that would be great. Thank you.

Google, Inc.
 
On the first one, look, I think we are 

 
it's a big platform shift, and it has to 
b
e available for everyone. So we've always, just like we have done with 
things like Android, when we see platform shifts, we provide Android to 
everyone. So that's the way we think about Google Cloud. We want to make 
sure that all these new capabilities for
 
machine learning and AI are available 
through Google Cloud to all our partners. We don't see it as a zero
-
sum 
game. I think internally, core to our mission, we see areas where we can 
execute and we will continue to do that, but we want to do both and we c
an 
do it thoughtfully well.

On your second question, we constantly look to assess if or when additional 
data makes sense given specific performances. And when we went through 
the third quarter results, that has been our intent w
ith all of the color 
commentary on cloud. I guess the only other thing to add is that the largest 
percentage growth year on year in our other revenue line, actually even 
across all of our revenue lines, was in our Google Cloud platform, and that 
reflects s
ignificant momentum in compute and storage.

Thank you. Sundar
, I apologize if I missed it. But could you talk about 
machine learning in search and how much it's making a difference over the 
past few quarters and how much you still have to go, how important that is 
to revenues?
 
And then, Ruth, a couple questions, any
 
thoughts on whether hardware 
sales could make a difference to margins going forward, and also on the 
stock
-
based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally? Thank 
you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Google, Inc.
 
On machine learning, in areas like search and e
ven ads, on search we've had 
an effort called RankBrain, which is bringing Google Brain in the context of 
search. And we've made great progress on it, but I would still characterize it 
as very early stages in terms of the long
-
term impact we can have. 
Gene
rally and similarly, we are in very, very early stages of incorporating 
machine learning, the newer machine learning systems in ads. And again, 
that's the beginning of a long journey as well.
 
Overall, I think all of these systems are incredibly complex sys
tems, and 
they are handcrafted systems over many, many years. And so over time, I 
think machine learning will surface newer approaches and newer insights. 
And so we see it as a huge area of opportunity, but it will play out over a 
period of time.

And then in terms of the hardware family, I think Sundar has given a lot of 
color on that. It's still early days with the rollout of some of these newer 
lines that we're super
-
excited about. And so early to make a call on that, but 
certa
inly investing meaningfully in the line given the importance we see in 
this.
 
And then in terms of stock
-
based compensation, we've always said we're 
going to remain focused on long
-
term revenue growth, and that does require 
investing in talent. And we do be
lieve equity ownership is a really valuable 
part of our overall compensation, consistent with alignment of interests. It's 
something we keep an eye on and we're mindful of the full cost of equity
-
based compensation and certainly look at that as part of the
 
overall costs 
that we're investing in, in and across the businesses.

Hey, guys. Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Sundar, last 
month Google was part of the founding group for the Partnership for AI. And 
I was just curious to hear your thoughts on what your go
als are for the 
group and how you may take lessons back to your leadership at Google. 
Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Google, Inc.
 
Look, I think I'm very, very glad to see the group come together. We are in 
extraordinarily early days for AI and it's super
-
importan
t, but we approach it 
thoughtfully as an industry. I am encouraged to see the commitment across 
these companies. Our goal is to promote open collaboration, help the public 
understand AI, and establish best practices in R&D. Without something like 
this, I t
hink ideas would develop in silos, and so I think it's good to do this to 
promote an informed dialogue on AI.
 
And so I'm pretty excited all along, just like with TensorFlow, where we are 
doing this in an open way and all the other things we have done at Go
ogle. I 
think it's important as we work on new technology to contribute and to give 
back. And so in that context, I think all of this is personally very meaningful 
to me.

Thanks, Ellen. Our revenue of $21.5 billion in the second
 
quarter 
underscores the great performance of our businesses globally. For the 
quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency versus 
last year. Once again, the primary driver was the increased use of Mobile 
Search by consumers, benefiting 
from our ongoing efforts to enhance the 
Mobile Search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in Desktop 
and Tablet Search as well as continued strength in YouTube and 
programmatic advertising.
 
I'm going to present to you in the following order: fi
rst, review the quarter 
on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of 
Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will 
then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which 
we will take your questions.
 
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, 
total revenue was $21.5 billion, up to 21% year
-
over
-
year and up 6% 
sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year
-
over
-
year 
of $113 million, or $35 million after the benefit of our hedging 
program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 
25% year
-
over
-
year and increased 5% sequentially.
 
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the str
ength of 
our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds 
continue to have on our non
-
U.S. business relative to last year. U.S. revenue 
was up 25% year
-
over
-
year to $10 billion. UK revenue was up 14% year
-
over
-
year to $1.9 billion
. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year
-
over
-
year. These results do not reflect the movement in the British pound 
subsequent to the results of the referendum on June 23. Rest
-
of
-
world 
revenue was up 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion. In fixed FX terms
, 
revenues were up 26% year
-
over
-
year.
 
GAAP other cost of revenues were $4.2 billion. Non
-
GAAP other cost of 
revenues was $3.9 billion, up 28% year
-
over
-
year, primarily driven by 
Google
-
related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our 
dat
a centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for 
YouTube, and hardware costs.
 
GAAP operating expenses were $7.4 billion in the quarter. Non
-
GAAP 
operating expenses were $6.2 billion, or 29% of revenue, up 15% year
-
over
-
year and u
p 2% versus Q1. The year
-
over
-
year growth was primarily 
driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to 
head count growth.
 
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 billion, up 24% versus last year. 
The operating margin was 28%. Non
-
GAA
P operating income was $7.5 
billion, up 25% versus last year. The operating margin was 35%.
 
Stock
-
based compensation totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% year
-
over
-
year and 
up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact 
of our senior 
executive equity refresh that occurs every two years.
 
Headcount at the end of the quarter was 66,575, up 2,460 from last quarter. 
The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product 
managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud
 
and apps. On a 
numbers basis, we are adding more head count in Google, while on a 
percentage basis, we are growing faster in Other Bets.
 
Other income and expense was $151 million [income].
 
As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line ite
ms impacted 
by market factors, which makes it inherently unpredictable. We provide 
more detail on these line items in our earnings press release.
 
Our effective tax rate was 20%.
 
Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.9 billion on a non
-
GAAP 
bas
is. Earnings per diluted share were $7.00 on a GAAP basis and $8.42 on 
a non
-
GAAP basis.
 
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was 
$2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google 
segment. Operating cash fl
ow was $9.1 billion, with free cash flow of $7 
billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 
billion, of which approximately $48 billion, or 61%, is held overseas. This 
performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offse
t by the impact of 
our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, 
completing the authorization under our share repurchase program.
 
Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google 
segment, revenue was $21.
3 billion, up 21% year
-
over
-
year, which includes 
the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was 
$15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year
-
over
-
year and up 7% sequentially. 
Year
-
on
-
year growth reflects substantial strength in Mob
ile Search due to 
the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad format and delivery that we 
launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth 
from Desktop and Tablet Search.
 
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significan
t rate, driven 
primarily by video advertising across TrueView and increasingly Google 
Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid 
Manager.
 
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year and up 1% 
sequentially, continuing to 
reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset 
by the traditional Network businesses.
 
Other revenue for Google was $2.2 billion, up 33% year
-
over
-
year and up 
5% sequentially. Year
-
over
-
year growth was driven by Cloud and Apps as 
well as Play, followed by
 
hardware.
 
Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of 
the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find 
the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these 
metrics are, of 
course, affected by currency movements.
 
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4 billion, or 21% of total advertising 
revenue, up 18% year
-
over
-
year and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC as a 
percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly as a resul
t of a 
mix shift between Sites revenue, which carries lower TAC, and Network 
revenue. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as 
well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenue reflects the fact 
that our strongest growth area
s, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, 
carry higher TAC.
 
Operating income excluding SBC was $8.3 billion, up 26% versus last year, 
for an operating margin of 39%. Google stock
-
based compensation totaled 
$1.3 billion for the quarter, up 33% year
-
over
-
yea
r. Operating income 
reflecting the impact of SBC was $7 billion, up 25% versus last year, and the 
operating margin was 33%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, reflecting 
investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center 
construction.
 
Tu
rning to Other Bets financials, let me again emphasize that the majority of 
these efforts are pre
-
revenue. We continue to invest across these 
opportunities and are doing so in a disciplined way. We think it remains most 
instructive is to look at them over 
a longer time horizon because, as you 
have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary 
reasons. First, they are early
-
stage. Second, they represent an aggregation 
of businesses operating in different industries. And third, they may
 
be 
impacted by one
-
time items like partnership deals.
 
For the second quarter, Other Bets revenue was $185 million. Reported 
revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. 
Operating loss excluding SBC was $709 million in the sec
ond quarter. 
Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $859 million. Other Bets 
CapEx was $280 million in Q2, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our 
Fiber business.
 
I'd like to close with a few observations on our key themes. First, regarding
 
revenue, our Alphabet structure, announced nearly a year ago, gives us the 
framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google 
and in Other Bets in a disciplined way. You've seen over the past few 
quarters how our focus on innovation
 
can drive strong revenue growth. We 
are continually working to enhance the search experience and making 
changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing. We 
have repeatedly highlighted the 3Q 2015 change in format given the 
meaning
ful step
-
up it drove in our revenue growth rate. That benefit is 
evident again in the second quarter. As we've always said, we have been 
and remain committed to long
-
term revenue growth through innovation, but 
the timing and scale of the impact of innovati
on is inherently difficult to 
predict.
 
Second, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long
-
term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses. We 
invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue 
grow
th with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on 
getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas 
secular trends are creating margin headwinds.
 
As I mentioned last quarter, there are number factors driving high
er TAC in 
both our Sites and Network businesses. For Sites TAC, there are a number of 
factors that contribute to fluctuations, in particular, changes in the relative 
use of mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. For each of these devices, Sites 
TAC also refl
ects an interrelated set of factors, including the mix of paid 
versus organic distribution points, partners, and agreement terms. Over the 
past year, the shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in 
Sites TAC because more mobile searches 
are subject to TAC.
 
When looking at Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it's important also to 
remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our Sites 
line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of 
revenues
, not TAC. In addition, Sites revenue includes hedging gains with no 
associated effect on TAC.
 
The growth in Network TAC is due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic 
platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate.
 
In operating expenses,
 
people are our biggest area of investment. We 
continue to attract, develop, and retain the best people to drive our 
businesses forward. As you would expect, head count additions primarily 
align with our priority areas, such as cloud and apps and machine l
earning.
 
Two important points regarding the third quarter; first, you will see the 
impact in the third quarter of our annual equity refresh for our employees. 
As you have seen in prior years, the annual refresh results in a sequential 
step
-
up in SBC.
 
Secon
d, head count growth tends to be seasonally high in Q3 because that is 
when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our 
marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of 
the year due to the holiday season.
 
Third, regarding CapEx, at Google the team has been able to drive 
meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical 
infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable 
investment level. These efficiencies include 
improvements in power and 
server utilization, the use of machine learning, and deployment of 
innovations like our Tensor Processing Unit. With regard to CapEx 
investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment continues to be the driver.
 
Fourth, about our ba
lance sheet, we remain focused on optimizing our 
capital structure, recognizing the strategic value of our balance sheet. We 
completed Alphabet's $1.7 billion debt exchange in the second quarter, 
which gives us flexibility, including the ability to use deb
t financing if 
appropriate. In light of the interest rate environment, we may 
opportunistically access the market to term out our commercial paper.
 
In conclusion, in the second quarter we delivered very strong revenue 
growth and improved operating efficien
cy. These results reflect the 
tremendous talent and hard work of our teams around the globe.
 
I will now turn the call over to Sundar.

Thanks, Ruth.
 
As you heard, we had a very strong second quarter. The
re's an amazing 
energy right now at Google. The strength of the quarter is about Mobile. It's 
transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's 
products have become a central and much
-
loved part of their experience. 
Our investment in Mobile
 
now underlines everything that we do today, from 
Search and YouTube to Android and advertising. Mobile is the engine that 
drives our present. And now to our deep investments in machine learning 
and AI, we are building the engine that will drive our future
.
 
Since the last earnings call, we had Google I/O, our biggest event of the 
year, and I also wrote our annual Founders' Letter. Both of these allowed me 
to reflect on our past and look to our future. We are at a pivotal and 
transformational moment. Thanks 
to advancements in machine learning, we 
have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 
years. In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our 
mission. Today, I'll walk through the six sections of the Founders' L
etter and 
discuss our progress in each area. And then I'll call out three key highlights 
from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the 
future.
 
The first thing I highlighted in the Founders' Letter was information. At 
Google'
s core, we remain focused on making information and knowledge 
available for everyone. This of course starts with Search, where we now 
have trillions of searches every year. We continue to invest in making 
Search smarter and more useful. In the U.S., we rec
ently introduced a voter 
tool, so when you search to register to vote, you will get a detailed state
-
by
-
state guide with information on how to register, requirements, and 
deadlines.
 
Our new keyboard for iOS, called Gboard, is off to a great start. People l
ove 
the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and 
quickly send emojis. And after just one year, Google Photos is now helping 
over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and 
memories.
 
At I/O, I was excited
 
to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We 
want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices 
and context. This is possible thanks to advances in machine learning, voice 
and image recognition, and natural language processi
ng, which we have 
invested in for years. You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in 
products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice
-
activated device, 
Google Home, and we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in 
this area.
 
Second, machine learning; as I said, machine learning is the engine that will 
drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping 
users every day. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine 
learning at Google, from Stree
t View to Gmail to Voice Search and more. For 
example, in Search, we use a ranking signal called RankBrain, which relies 
on deep learning to improve results. It's already enhancing the search 
experience in 40 languages. And based on user testing, RankBrain
 
can 
accurately guess which results users will favor with about 80% accuracy. 
Advances like this help us make our search results even more relevant.
 
Machine learning is also creating an impact in other ways. Just last week, we 
announced a test that applied
 
DeepMind's machine learning to our own 
Google data centers, resulting in up to a 40% reduction in the energy we 
use for cooling. This will greatly improve efficiency. And when we publish our 
research, we hope it will enable others to reduce emissions, too
.
 
Third, content; a big part of making information available is making great 
content accessible, such as on Google Play, YouTube, and the web. Our 
efforts to make the mobile web better for everyone with Accelerated Mobile 
Pages, or AMP, has seen phenomenal
 
global momentum. We now have over 
150 million AMP pages in our index and with over 4 million new ones 
published every week from nearly 200 countries. Last week, we announced 
AMP for Ads, which helps advertisers build fast, simple, and beautiful ads 
and la
nding pages. This will help make the mobile web experience much 
faster for everyone and help fund it more sustainably.
 
Video is a huge component of digital content, and YouTube continues to 
shine. It's a thriving home for creators, with more than 1,000 cre
ators 
crossing the 1,000 subscribers mark every single day. Our content diary 
(20:25) system has now paid out over $2 billion to partners who use the 
system.
 
A big part of video, of course, is live, which we have invested in since 2011. 
YouTube is the 
first major platform that supports live content in 360 
degrees, and we recently announced the ability for creators to go live from 
their phones with the touch of a button. Earlier in the quarter, we teamed up 
with BT to livestream the Champions League and 
Europa League finals on 
YouTube in the UK. This special event was UK's biggest
-
ever livestream. All 
these innovations are a big reason why partner revenue has averaged 50% 
growth over the last three years.
 
Fourth, platforms; a key focus is building great c
omputing platforms like 
Chrome, Android, and our new virtual reality platform, Daydream, so that 
people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or stream 
they are using. Platforms are what make new computing experiences 
possible and also po
wer breakout hits like Pokémon Go, which I suspect a 
few of you are playing right now.
 
Android is thriving. In the last year alone, we have delivered over 65 billion 
app installs and are helping developers reach an audience of over 1 billion 
users every si
ngle month. Our partners are also seeing incredible successes 
with flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7. It's a hit with consumers 
and a shining example of how to build a great experience on Android. Our 
latest version of Android, called Nougat, foc
uses on performance, 
productivity, and security. And it also has a VR mode built in to help 
developers create immersive smartphone VR experiences.
 
Speaking of VR, we are already working with leading Android partners to 
build out the Daydream ecosystem, so 
stay tuned for more Daydream
-
ready 
phones, controllers, and headsets coming this fall.
 
Fifth, cloud; many tremendous digital experiences are being built in the 
cloud today, and businesses are working to take advantage of the cloud as 
part of their digital 
transformation. We've been integrating our cloud and 
apps products to create more unified solutions for companies large and 
small, and these efforts are paying off. We have strong momentum with 
businesses like Symphony, a secular communication and workflow
 
platform, 
who recently announced that its cloud computing business is available on 
the Google Cloud Platform [GCP]. We provide the high reliability and 
performance needed by Symphony's customers in the financial services 
industry.
 
Our data analytics produ
ct, BigQuery, helps mobile gaming company, 
Kabam, store and understand player actions within their games, from 
monetization and fraud to production bugs and level completion statistics.
 
As I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key 
differ
entiator for Google, and that's true for our Google Cloud customers as 
well. This quarter, we introduced Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which 
can deliver an order of magnitude better optimized performance per watt for 
machine learning projects. Google D
eepMind's AlphaGo was powered by 
TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves. 
We are now passing this benefit on to our enterprise customers to 
supercharge their machine learning applications.
 
Just last week, we introduced two 
cloud machine learning APIs for speech 
and natural language to help our enterprise customers convert audio to text 
and easily understand the structure and sentiment of the text in a variety of 
languages.
 
We also introduced a new undersea cable system, the 
highest capacity 
system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support 
our enterprise customers around the globe. This system has 60 terabytes 
per second of total capacity, more than any active undersea cable and is 10 
million times fas
ter than your cable modem. This is especially exciting as we 
prepare to launch a new Google Cloud Platform, East Asia region, in Tokyo 
later this year.
 
In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are also hard 
at work building the best
 
team to serve every aspect of our customers' 
businesses. We now have key leadership in place and centralized teams 
supporting customer
-
facing activities, including sales, marketing, global 
alliances, industry solutions, and professional services. We are b
uilding out 
our support at full scale as more and more Fortune 100 companies choose 
our cloud.
 
Sixth, building for everyone; since the Internet is one of the world's most 
powerful equalizers, we are committed to building technology and making 
information a
vailable for everyone, wherever they are. This has always been 
core to Google's DNA. As we have shared before, we are working with Indian 
Railways and RailTel to bring high
-
speed wireless access to the entire 
Internet to millions of people who travel throu
ghout India's top railway 
stations. There are already 2 million people logging in every month, and 
they are using as much as 15 times the data they would otherwise use in a 
full day on their cellular networks.
 
We are also working hard to ensure that our pr
oducts work well for 
everyone, regardless of where they live. We've been expanding better 
carrier building (25:55) in Google Play with more than 100 partners in 40 
countries. To give you a sense of the impact, in Indonesia alone, we have 
seen growth in mon
thly buyers quadruple in the last 18 months.
 
Switching gears from these six areas, it's our business success that enables 
us and our partners to grow and invest further. We are extraordinarily well 
positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we a
re already seeing 
strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business, Mobile Search, 
Video, and Programmatic. All of the momentum you're seeing is because our 
products are doing well in Mobile and our customers are getting great results 
from them
.
 
We offer advertisers and agencies the best ways to reach customers at the 
right moment of intent, the best reach in inventory, the best mobile formats, 
and the leading measurement solutions. And of course, we do all of this 
while making sure we are creat
ing a great ads experience for users that's 
helpful and unobtrusive. We know that people are constantly searching for 
things with commercial intent and are used to swiping and tapping. Our data 
shows that people respond really well to that, as we show. The
y are fresh, 
fast, and useful.
 
So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising 
business, number one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response 
marketers. We announced new Expanded Text Ads and bid adjustments by 
device type
, which are rolling out this week, as well as new local search ads 
in Google Maps. Thanks to the rise of mobile phones, the line between online 
and offline experiences continues to blur. This creates even greater 
opportunity for businesses to use Google Ma
ps to help bring customers into 
their physical store locations.
 
Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues 
to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential 
customers, whether they are visiting
 
your website, calling your business, 
walking into your store, or downloading your app. For instance, Walgreens 
partnered closely with Google to promote their app across Search, Google 
Play, and our Display Networks. In one month, they increased the number
 
of 
app downloads 87% from the previous month.
 
Number two, our annual Brandcast event for brand advertisers was a huge 
success. We announced breakout videos. The ability to advertise against 
fast
-
rising videos on YouTube as well as a deal with the NBA to b
ring their 
inventory to Google Preferred. At this point, the volume of Google Preferred 
bought this year is already more than double what it was at the same time 
last year.
 
Fast food chain Wendy's used Google Preferred to extend the reach of their 
TV ads. 
And thanks to our Brand Lift measurement solution, they were able 
to see that one of their campaigns drove an incredible 65% lift in ad recall 
and 146% lift in Google searches for the Wendy's brand. We are hearing a 
lot of the same feedback from many top b
rands who continue to invest more 
and more of their budgets on YouTube.
 
And number three, our DoubleClick Leadership Summit, held just last week 
for ad technology partners. We launched the ability to buy native ads 
programmatically across all screens in Do
ubleClick Bid Manager. Since we're 
providing fully designed creatives for each publisher, advertisers can simply 
upload the contents of the ad like headline, image, and text, and DoubleClick 
automatically assembles them to fit the context and format of the
 
site or app 
where they appear. Making native advertising simple at this scale will help to 
make ads faster, better, and less intrusive while driving great returns for 
publishers.
 
So there are my top three moments from our Advertising business this 
quarter
. As you can see, it's been extremely busy. More generally, from 
advertising, to cloud, to digital content, to hardware, and to so much more, 
we have tremendous long
-
term growth opportunities at Google. Today's 
great innovations are being driven by investm
ents in Mobile. Tomorrow's will 
be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing 
platforms. But one thing is constant. We'll continue to focus on building the 
best experiences for billions of people around the world.
 
I want to thank all
 
the Googlers around the world who help us create these 
opportunities every day and help bring them to life for our users and 
partners.
 
With that, I will turn it back over to Ruth.

Thank you, Sun

Question
-
and

Answer Session

And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is 
now open.
 
Carlos Kirjner

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Thank you. I have two questions. 
First is about Search revenues. Search is 
probably a $50 billion business, and from today's results it's clearly still 
growing strongly. Of course, as the business gets larger, it becomes harder 
and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing 
growth 
challenge on your product innovations in Search, including the recent 
changes and also those that you have in your roadmap for the next few 
years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenues growth 
and the trajectory over which they
 
will ultimately decelerate?
 
The second question is on Google Fiber. I think Ruth has been quite clear 
that we should expect an increase in Other Bets CapEx and that Fiber is the 
main driver, suggesting more investment. Yet, when we see the rate at 
which y
ou will have deployed in markets like Austin and some of the newer 
markets, they are quite slow. You also have started to talk about wireless 
technology, suggesting that you haven't fully figured this out yet, which in 
turn suggests that it's going to be s
low deployment. So the question is, 
which one is it? Is it faster, more aggressive deployment given the CapEx 
commentary, or is it going to be continuous slow multiyear deployment as 
your track record and the talk of new technologies suggest? Thank you.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
Thank you, Carlos, a lot in those questions. So starting with Sites revenue 
and where we see the opportunities there, obviously Sites revenue up 24% 
year on year includes the currency impact. And a
s Sundar and I both 
commented on, the biggest driver again this quarter was Mobile Search. We 
do continue to have solid growth in Desktop, Tablet. And we have strength 
in YouTube, particularly video advertising, both in our TrueView product and 
increasingl
y from Google Preferred. As we've talked about every quarter 
since the third quarter of last year, we have benefited from the change to ad 
formats on Mobile that we made in third quarter of last year, and that is 
evident yet again this quarter.
 
Then, as pe
r your question, going back to that third quarter of 2015 when 
we made the change in ad formats on Mobile, our growth rate meaningfully 
accelerated. And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change 
has been the primary driver of the higher year
-
o
n
-
year revenue growth rate. 
But importantly, as you've seen over the last several quarters, we're 
benefiting not just from the higher growth rate but also from the durability 
of the impact of the change. So that's really underscoring the efficacy of 
these 
ads for users, as per Sundar's comments, and it's reflected in 
revenues running at a higher level. And you can see where the revenue 
growth rate was prior to the third quarter introduction. I'll let you do your 
own forecasting, but when comparing growth ra
tes, we're obviously at a 
higher revenue base versus last year.
 
And then Sundar talked about some of the recent events that we've had. 
Innovation is core to everything we're doing. We've launched several 
changes to ad formats and tools just a few days ago.
 
As the team discussed 
at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in 
a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for 
advertisers. And so that just continues to be core to the way we're looking at 
the busine
ss with a lot of incremental opportunity.
 
And then on your Fiber and CapEx question, look, we continue to see Fiber 
as a huge market opportunity. We're focused on creating abundant 
connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, as we've 
tal
ked about, and we're continuing to work closely with cities given their 
excitement. We're also continuing to push the frontier with tech innovation, 
as you noted in your question, and different execution paths. So as you said 
in the question, we're explori
ng both Fiber and wireless, and you may have 
seen our recent acquisition of Webpass. So we want to make sure we're 
executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective 
and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte i
n July. And 
so again, we view it as a big opportunity. We're being thoughtful and 
deliberate in our execution path.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your 
line is now open.

Than
k you so much for taking the questions. Maybe following up on Carlos, 
his question on Search, and Ruth, your answer, I wanted to go a little bit 
deeper on the retail and the travel verticals. It's two areas where we see a 
lot of innovation from the company
 
right now, both on the product side that 
consumers are seeing as well as on the advertising side. How should we 
think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with 
your product in those key verticals as well as the ability for advertiser
 
conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the 
medium to long term?
 
And then maybe one second question would be, with the buyback 
authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, I would love to get 
your thoughts on how you
're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset 
and how shareholders should think about the ability for shareholder returns 
over the medium and long term. Thank you so much.
 
Ruth Porat

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
Okay, so why don't I
 
start on your second question? Then I'll pass it to 
Sundar on the first question. So as you know, we announced the share 
repurchase program relatively recently. It was just in the third quarter of 
last year, and we just completed it as per my opening comm
ents. As we 
discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet 
and capital requirements and opportunities with our board, and I'm not 
going to speculate about a potential for a future board decision, so really 
nothing more to add at
 
this point. And then, Sundar?
 
Sundar Pichai

Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Look, we obviously think generally across all types of verticals, and you 
highlighted a couple of important verticals. To give an example on travel, 
many users start their
 
travel inquiry on Google. And so we focus on doing a 
better job of getting them deeper information, new destinations, and 
compare costs through new features in Hotel Search [Hotel Finder], Google 
Flights, and the recently launched Destinations on Google. 
In all of this, we 
work closely with many different partners, including online travel agencies, 
and so we focus on product enhancements in partnership with them. And the 
better job we do at answering user queries, the more qualified leads we can 
provide to
 
our partners, and we think it's win
-
win arrangement. And the 
same concept applies for these other verticals as well. So we approach it 
very holistically.

Thank you very much. Sundar, I was wondering. I know you gave us some 
color on the Cloud business just a few moments ago in your prepared 
remarks. But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the 
cha
nges, if you could highlight some of them that Diane [Greene] has made 
since she's come onboard. And I'm wondering how some of those changes 
might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that 
you're having. In particular, I'm just tryi
ng to get a sense of, are you seeing 
Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your 
win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Thanks, Heather. Absolut
ely, I think Diane has initiated a set of changes, 
and essentially she has integrated our go
-
to
-
market strategy with our 
engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts 
on the cloud. So for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gma
il, Slides, 
Sheets, Hangouts, et cetera, is on top the cloud stack. Our enterprise 
customers and partners for them, now they have one enterprise face and 
internally from frictionless contracts to touch points across Google, to one 
person to work with them 
on our considerable enterprise technologies and 
products, so the big unifying one being Cloud. We now have new leadership 
in place across sales, professional services, marketing, and partnering plus 
new customer facing support in the form of professional s
ervices. We have 
an office of the CTO and customer reliability.
 
So it's a big set of changes, and it's obviously having an impact. Many of our 
customers are also partners since it's increasingly clear how much we can do 
together. So for me, I see a shift t
o a world
-
class enterprise approach, and 
it's definitely having an impact on the type of conversations we are having 
and the outcome of the RFPs we are engaged in.

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great. Sundar, I just had a question about machine learning. So you spent a 
lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole 
and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at I/O a few months 
ago. And you guys have men
tioned things like reducing the error rates in 
Search and improving relevancy. But are there tangible examples of either 
engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in 
Search and in YouTube that you could share?
 
And then, I think 
Google recently introduced Smart Bidding in AdWords 
using machine learning. So do you see something like this as a potential 
revenue driver? Any color there would be great. Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
So we definitely 

 
a core part of improving the user experience for the next 
many years will be driven by machine learning. To give a specific example, 
you asked about YouTube. YouTube watch time is something we focus on. 
We use machine learning increasingly to give recomme
ndations to users. So 
when they're watching a video in terms of what they could watch next, and 
that recommendation system is increasingly using machine learning, and 
that directly drives engagement. So there are several such examples I can 
give across the
 
company.
 
You mentioned AdWords, too. If you look at AdWords and the thoughtful 
changes we do, over time, we are dealing with paid commentarial space in 
terms of the kinds of changes and interactions that can happen. So 
deploying machine learning there ove
r time, over many years, I think is a 
more powerful and deeper way to explore the various possibilities that exist 
and I think will lead to long
-
term impacts. And so I'm very optimistic on it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas An
muth of JPMorgan. 
Your line is now open.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. First, Sundar, you 
talked about Expanded Text Ads. And my question is just as the number of 
characters here increases
 
somewhat, say, up to 50% through Expanded Text 
Ads, you're taking up more space on the page. How do you balance the 
higher percentage of clicks from these paid ads with the natural search 
experience?
 
And then secondly, on YouTube, do you think you're taki
ng share of TV 
dollars currently? And if not, what's needed to do that going forward? 
Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai 
-
 
Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
On the first one, we obviously, over many, many years, we always put users 
first. And as we present our sear
ch results, we have long
-
term metrics for 
user happiness around which we make, that's the framework for all the 
changes we make. Obviously, with the shift to mobile, the user experience, 
users are evolving in terms of how they use our product. And with tha
t as a 
guidance, we have made changes. We make many, many changes and I 
would look at it holistically. And even some of the changes you're talking 
about affect certain highly commercial queries, where users are actually 
looking for that commercial informat
ion. So the metrics is what drives how 
we change these things, and I'm being very, very thoughtful about it. But 
we always step back and make sure the overall load, et cetera, is really 
working for users. And I'm pretty comfortable with how we are approach
ing 
it.
 
On YouTube, I think about it as we are seeing strong growth. I mentioned 
the momentum behind Google Preferred and how we are double the rate we 
were last year. So to me, that implies strong growth. It's tough for us to 
assess whether it's from TV o
r just advertisers investing more because 
there's traction in YouTube, but we just see strong momentum. And as far 
as today, when I just look at how users are using mobile, video is the killer 
app, killer format on mobile, and I think that's what gives us 
the secular 
trend moving forward.

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. I just 
want to ask one question and it has to do with Mobile Search. 
And I want to throw an idea by you, which is we've been going through this 
mobile transition for four or five years. Consumers have I think dramatically 
led businesses and advertisers to mobile 
devices. I'm wondering if what 
you're now seeing is finally, as e
-
commerce and travel and other commerce 
activities have really become critical and material on mobile devices, you're 
finally starting to see ad budgets really shift over and you're starting 
to get 
auction dynamics start to pick up in Mobile Search. So could you just 
comment on whether you're finally seeing this kind of backswing for 
advertisers to engage with Mobile Search in a way that you really hadn't 
seen before; it just took that many ye
ars for this to happen? Thanks.
 
Sundar Pichai

Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Mark, thanks for the question. I would say at a higher level, this is a scale 
business. And you're right, as we have had this shift to mobile, there are 
second
-
order effe
cts which kick in too, which is why when you look at our ad 
improvements and our revenue improvements, I would focus more 
holistically. We do deeper changes across the board, not just visible changes 
on the page, and all of that contributes to it. So I do 
definitely think as the 
shift to mobile accelerates, we are getting some scale benefits, and that's 
part of it.

Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I was wondering if you could spend 
a little time talking about the launch of the My Activity site, which I think is 
an update to the controls that your users have over the use of their data. 
And, in particular, I'd
 
be interested to hear about the option to opt into 
greater personalization of ads from across the usership on Google Sites, as I 
believe that's the first time you've allowed, on an opt
-
in basis certainly, to 
have search data be used to target ads elsewher
e. And then maybe as a 
follow
-
up to that, what you're seeing in terms of early traction of users 
turning that on and where your expectations for that may be.

tter controls, and so we wanted 
to give users a single place to see and control ad settings. And that will be 
honored as the user moves across devices. It's completely opt
-
in. Users are 
absolutely in control. Consumers and advertisers have come to expect a
ds to 
work better across devices, and this new option could help us better deliver 
on that. So for people who choose to opt in, over time we could make sure 
they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones, so effectively put 
them in better control of th
e experience they get, and so I think that helps 
the whole ecosystem work better. We are in very, very early days, but we're 
being thoughtful about how we do this for users.

Great, thanks. I guess two quick questions. First off, we understand that 
Google Shopping in particular 
continues to see strong growth, and I was 
hoping you could add some color on the relative mix or growth rates of TLA 
[Text Link Ads] contrasting to other ad types along with the adoption of 
transactional capabilities.
 
And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow u
p on some of the conversational voice 
applications and devices that you have in the pipeline, and more generally 
how you envision voice really fitting in across the board, across the Google 
platform. Will this be a centerpiece as you also utilize machine l
earning and 
artificial intelligence? I'd like to hear more about your vision for that. Thank 
you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
Let me quickly 

 
on the first one, we don't comment on the relative mix, et 
cetera, so I'll probably giv
e more color on your second question.
 
Voice is obviously very, very exciting for us. I mentioned this at I/O. if you 
look at Android, the Google app on Android in the U.S., 20% of the queries 
are voice queries. So today in terms of evolving to a conversati
onal 
assistant, we have a big head start. People do this. We get millions of 
queries every single day. And it's incredibly exciting to see how people 
interact with voice differently from text. It's more intuitive. It's more 
personal, and it's a bit more em
otional and an engaging experience for 
users.
 
And so I think to do this well requires deep computer science, just 
understanding what they are saying, the natural language processing 
involved. These are areas in which we have now been working for over 15 
ye
ars, and we believe we are the best in class. And so bringing all of that 
together I think is what will help us do this at scale globally, but it's still very 
early days in terms of getting the conversational assistant right. You will see 
us launch this th
rough our products as we go through the second half of this 
year, and I'm excited to see how users respond to it.

Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Sundar and one for 
Ruth. Sundar, in terms of messaging, you mentioned Allo, your mobile 
messaging product, and
 
Duo, which is your video messaging product. Why is 
it important that Google is competitive in mobile messaging? And what gives 
you the confidence that you could take market share from the other players 
in the messaging space?
 
And then, Ruth, in terms of t
he drivers of YouTube growth, you mentioned in 
your prepared remarks that one of the drivers was buying on DoubleClick 
Bid Manager. I just want to maybe hear a little bit more about that. Why has 
that been so successful recently, and do you look at that as
 
an incremental 
forward driver of YouTube revenue growth? Thank you.
 
Sundar Pichai

Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
On your first question, I think messaging is obviously an important area. We 
approach these areas if you believe we have insights by 
which we can create 
something very differentiated for users, that we are actually approaching it 
in a new and unique way.
 
The core underlying insight we have is, in the context of mobile and using 
state
-
of
-
the
-
art machine learning, can we rethink some of t
he areas for our 
users? So that's the underlying framework with which we have approached 
this space of being really enjoying using these products, and we'll get it out 
to users soon. For example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I 
think especi
ally on Android, high
-
quality messaging is an experience that's 
still lacking for users, so we clearly see an opportunity there. And it's at the 
core of our mission, bringing information experiences to users. And so that's 
why we are investing and we are o
ptimistic about this space.

And I think on the other part of your question, I think the key point is we've 
talking about programmatic for quite some time. We're just seeing strong 
momentum across the board, and we continue to benefit from that.

Sundar, can you broadly discuss the Google hardware strategy and perhaps 
some of the lessons learned from previous Google hardware launches? And 
then relatedly, can you j
ust discuss a little bit about how you're thinking the 
auto strategy? Do you build your own vehicles, license technology? How do 
you determine which direction to take there and how long until we might see 
any auto
-
related revenue? Thanks.
 
Sundar

On our overall hardware strategy, we've always, we have done devices like 
Nexus or Google Pixel, et cetera. We realize a lot of computing innovations 
happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as
 
we are building 
ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward. And 
so that's the context in which we do.
 
There are areas where we have done it very seriously. Chromecast is a great 
example. We now have over 30 million Chromecast devi
ces sold, and that's 
an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas 
emerge like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience 
possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that's how we 
think about it. We are
 
being much more thoughtful in how we approach it, 
and we're building a world
-
class team so that we can do this for our users. 
But we are very thoughtful about how we approach it, and we make sure to 
work with the ecosystem to accomplish what we are trying
 
to do.

And then on cars, self
-
driving cars is in our Other Bets area, so just a brief 
update there. We're now testing in four cities, Mountain View, Austin. Most 
recently we expanded to Kirkland
, Washington and to Phoenix. We've self
-
driven over 1.6 million miles. And the focus here for us is we're solving a 
really big need, safety, access, and city efficiency.
 
The other thing that's really motivating for us is when you look at over 
30,000 car de
aths in the U.S. alone, that's what really inspired the founders 
to start working on this issue. And our approach is quite different from most 
others. We're focused on fully
-
autonomous cars because in early testing we 
saw the risk of depending on drivers t
o remain engaged once you give them 
the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there. We're testing 
extensively based on this approach. And more specifically to your question, 
we're pleased to be working with FCA to advance the development of the 
se
lf
-
driving cars. With them, we're more than doubling the number of cars 
that we have, but we do have huge respect for the expertise required, so we 
do expect we'll work with many partners in this area.

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
Thank you, a couple questions. First on YouTube, just thinking about 
premium content, a lot of activity with streaming deals out there. Obviously,
 
YouTube would be a natural place for streaming content, but even 
professionally developed content. Do you think you're letting an opportunity 
get by? How do you think about that?
 
And then, Ruth, I know you had a lot of experience dealing with regulatory 
a
gencies in your last CFO role. There have been some new filings. Can you 
talk at all about how Google is thinking about that right now? Thank you.
 
Ruth Porat

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
So I'll start on the second question. Look, we c
ontinue to work constructively 
with regulators. We don't have an update on timing on any of those specific 
issues. But the main points in our view are that regulators have found that 
our businesses do help consumers. And the key mantra here is if we do the
 
right thing for the user, all else will follow.
 
With respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities 
that create great experiences and improve their lives. And we're empowering 
small businesses globally by providing greater reach t
o customers, not just 
in their towns, but across countries and around the world. And in our 
discussions, one of the very important points is we operate in a very vibrant, 
competitive environment, and we're also proud of the fact that we're 
investing meanin
gfully in the ecosystem. For example, Android has helped 
foster a remarkable and sustainable ecosystem of manufacturers and app 
developers and entrepreneurs based on open source software and open 
innovation. That's really the thrust of it, and the emphasis
 
is we're 
continuing to work constructively with regulators, no additional update.

And, Justin, on the livestreaming question, I already mentioned that 
livestream is a big focus for us. We've been at it
 
for a while, and we've built 
a great, robust, and mature platform for big events. We just announced at 
VidCon our plans to make mobile livestreaming features available within our 
core YouTube app on all mobile devices. Our stream time, livestream time 
has
 
increased 3x since the beginning of the year alone. And YouTube is the 
first major platform to support live content in 360 degrees. And recent 
examples, even the RNC in the DNC conventions, they have been 
livestreamed on YouTube in 360. So there's a lot o
f momentum there and 
we are absolutely committed to this space.

Thanks for taking my questions. I
 
have two. The first one is on the U.S. It 
accelerated pretty nicely. Any specific buckets of advertisers or any of the 
innovative products that you'd call out as driving that acceleration in the 
quarter?
 
And the second one, Sundar, you talked about using 
machine learning for 
better suggestions on YouTube. Can you help us all think about what the 
level of engagement is on YouTube right now, whether it's minutes or maybe 
growth in images? How do we think about engagement on YouTube now? 
Thanks.
 
Ruth Porat

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
 
So in terms of the U.S., the 25% year
-
on
-
year growth reflects strength 
across products. There's really nothing to call out. It's modest acceleration 
consistent with what we saw overall, but it's really about 
Mobile Search.
 
Sundar Pichai

Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc.
 
On YouTube, at a high level I would say we don't have any new metrics. But 
on mobile alone, as I've said before, we reach more 18
-
to
-
34 and 18
-
to
-
49s 
than any other TV network, broadcast 
or cable. And every indication we see 
is that the growth is very, very strong, being driven by mobile, and it's 
growing globally as well. So overall, I think engagement is very, very 
healthy. I'm pretty excited about it.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. First Quarter 2012 
Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like 
to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Ms. 
Jane 
Penner. Please go ahead, ma'am.
 
Jane Penner
 
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's first quarter 2012 
earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; 
David Drummond, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, and Chi
ef 
Legal Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial 
Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
 
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor 
Relations website located 
at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR 
website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that 
accompany the call.
 
This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call 
will be available on our websit
e in a few hours.
 
Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward looking, including statements 
regarding Google's future investments, our long
-
term growth and 
innovation, the expected performan
ce of our business and our expected level 
of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note 
that these forward
-
looking statements reflect our opinions onl
y as of the 
date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or 
publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward
-
looking 
statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our 
SEC filings for a more de
tailed description of the risk factors that may affect 
our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this 
call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a 
non
-
GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude cha
rges related to stock
-
based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by 
operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free 
cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP to GAAP 
measures can be foun
d in our earnings press release.
 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.
 
Larry Page
 
Thank you. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. It's great to 
be here with all of you. I'll talk about our new class of stock at the end of my 
re
marks, but first, I want to focus on our performance. We had a very strong 
quarter with revenue up 24% year
-
on
-
year at $10.6 billion. Since becoming 
CEO again last April, I've pushed hard to increase our velocity, improve our 
execution and focus on the big
 
bets that will make a difference in the world. 
Google is a large company now, but we'll achieve more and do it faster if we 
approach life with the passion and the soul of a startup. This has involved a 
lot of cleanups. We've given many of our products inc
luding Search a visual 
refresh. They now have a more consistent look and feel. When we've closed 
or combined over 30 products, we have so many opportunities that without 
hard choices we end up spreading ourselves too thin and don't have the 
impact that we 
strive for.
 
Creating a simpler and more intuitive user experience across Google has 
been another important focus. I have always believed that technologies 
should do the hard work, but just takes scheduling and communications, so 
users can get on with what 
makes them happiest, life. Our products work 
seamlessly together so people don't have to navigate Google to get stuff 
done.
 
Chrome for Android, which launched this quarter, is a great example of this 
kind of simplicity we're shooting for. It does mean swit
ching between 
devices painless. All of your tabs are there across your desktop and Android, 
you can even click the back button on a different device and it just works. 
Just try it out, it's a great experience.
 
It's the same with Google Play, which we also 
shipped this quarter. You can 
now access all your movies, your books and apps and games from the web 
or from your Android device, no cables, downloading or syncing required. We 
spent years working with partners to get all of this great content. So it's 
rea
lly exciting to see it brought together in a beautifully simply way that 
people can enjoy.
 
Now Google+ is truly at the heart of our efforts to create a simpler, more 
intuitive experience for all of our users. You should think of it in 2 parts. One 
is just 
our social spine. Once you're logged in and have upgraded to 
Google+, you're just using one Google, not a series of disconnected 
products. It's still early days, but with over 120 Google integrations to date 
-
-
 
Google+ integrations to date, we're on the ri
ght track. And your user 
experience on Google just gets better. You can see friends' 
recommendations when you're using Google Play and you don't think about 
that as Google+, but it just comes from that infrastructure. And we're seeing 
a positive impact all
 
across the web. Google users can now recommend 

company.
 
The other part is the social destination, which is accessed on your mobile 
client or on plus.google.com. This social destination p
art grew from a base of 
0, not starting with all Google users like the part I was previously talking 
about, and is growing quickly. In fact, we see impressive engagement in fast 
growth here. It's just not all of Google. We are starting up a new 
community.
 
We're excited about the amazing speed with which some people have 
amassed over 1 million followers, and I have just been lucky enough to pass 
2 million. I get high
-
quality feedback on the public post I make, which I 
really enjoy. And every day we make Goog
le+ better. Just yesterday, we 
took another big step forward with a beautiful new UI for Google+. And the 
new customizable navigation driven in that redesign makes it much easier to 
access your favorite apps. There's better discoverability for Hangouts and
 
you'll love the larger images that you see across that interface.
 
Now last time, there's a bit of confusion over the metrics I gave about 
Google+. I want to be clear about these 2 parts of Google+ and the fact that 
we have made great progress on both part
s. As you would expect, the social 
spine is proportional to Google and all of the usage across Google. And 

Google+.
 
So to summarize, there are 2 parts to the Google+ experience: the
 
part that 
is the social spine, and the other part that's the social destination part of 
Google+ exclusively. Both of these are growing fast, but the social 
destination part of Google+ is growing as a new product with very healthy 
growth.
 
I'm also excited 
by our big bets. We have some amazing new products that 
were seen as crazy when we launched them, but now have phenomenal 
usage. They can easily pass the toothbrush test. They're important enough 
that millions of people use them at least once or twice a da
y. Chrome has 
over 200 million users. Our Display business has reached an annualized run 
rate of over $5 billion and 850,000 Android devices are activated every day. 
And YouTube just keeps on growing. These are just staggering even by 
Google standard. They
 
had over 800 million monthly users uploading over 
an hour of video per second. I'm incredibly proud of these achievements. 
They wouldn't have been possible without an amazing team of Googlers and 
the long
-
term focus with which we are able to run the compa
ny, which 
brings me to this afternoon's announcement about our stock.
 
Now throughout our evolution from being privately held startup to a large 
publicly listed company, we have managed Google for the long term and 
enjoying tremendous success as a result, e
specially since our IPO in 2004. 
The founders, Sergey and I, really hoped but we did not expect that Google 
would have such significant impact. And that this progress has made us even 
more impatient to do important things that matter in the world. Our 
endu
ring love for Google comes from a strong desire to create technology 
products that enrich millions of people's lives in deep and meaningful ways. 
To fulfill these dreams, we need to ensure that Google remains a successful 
growing business that can generate
 
significant returns for everyone 
involved.
 
When we went public in 2004, we established some clear well
-
publicized 
expectations for investors around our governance. We wrote a couple of 

w 
investors will fully share in Google's long
-
term economic future, but will have 
little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights. 
And we are creating a new corporate structure that is designed for stability 
over the long
-
ti
me horizons. By investing in Google, you're placing an 
unusual long
-
term bet on a team, especially Sergey and me.""
 
I wanted to quote all that because these are the clear well
-
publicized 
expectations we established for investors. And while this decision was
 
controversial at the time, we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the 
right thing to do. Eight years later, these still 
--
 
statements are still 
remarkably accurate and everyone involved has realized tremendous 
benefits.
 
Given Google's success, it's u
nsurprising this type of dual
-
class governance 
structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology companies. In 
our experience, success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term. 
Technology products often require significant investment over
 
many years to 
fulfill their potential. For example, it took 3 years just to ship our first 
Android handset and then another 3 years on top of that before the 
operating system truly reach critical mass. These kind of investments are 
not for the fainthearte
d.
 
Long
-
term product investments like Chrome and YouTube, which now enjoy 
phenomenal usage, were made with a significant degree of independence. 
However, day
-
to
-
day dilution from routine equity
-
based employee 
compensation and other possible dilutions, such
 
as stock
-
based acquisitions, 
will likely undermine this dual
-
class structure and our aspirations for Google 
over the very long term. We have put our hearts into Google and hope to do 
so for many years to come, so we want to ensure that our corporate 
struc
ture can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the world.
 
Today, we announced plans to create a new class of nonvoting capital stock. 
These shares will be distributed via stock dividend to all existing 
stockholders. The owner of each existing sha
re will receive one new share of 
the nonvoting stock, giving investors twice the number of shares they had 
before. Effectively, a 2
-
for
-
1 stock split, something many of our investors 
have long asked us for. These nonvoting shares will be available for 
corp
orate uses like equity
-
based employee compensation that might 
otherwise dilute our governance structure.
 
In November 2009, Sergey and I published plans to sell a modest 
percentage of our overall stock ending in 2015. We are currently halfway 
through those 
plans and we don't expect any changes to that, certainly not 
as the result of this new potential class. We both remain very much 
committed to Google for the long term. It's important to bear in mind that 
this proposal will only have an effect on governance
 
over the very long term. 
In fact, there's no particular urgency to make these changes now. We don't 
have an unusually big acquisition planned, in case you are wondering.
 
Investors and others have always taken a big bet on Sergey and me, and 
that bet will 
likely last longer as a result of these changes. We are honored 
that so many of you have put your trust in us and recognize the tremendous 
responsibility that rests on our shoulders. We think this is a good thing 
because users rely on Google to produce and
 
operate amazing technology 
products and to safely and responsibly store their data. That is our passion.
 
Thank you very much, and I will now hand over to David to explain some of 
the more technical aspects of this proposal.
 
David C. Drummond
 
Thanks, Larry. So first of all, I wanted to say that we'll be filing a proxy 
statement soon, which will have more details about today's proposal. But for 
now, I want to give a few broad strokes.
 
First off, as Larry said, what we announced today is basicall
y a 2
-
for
-
1 stock 
split, and here's how it works. What we're doing is creating a new class of 
stock, Class C. That new stock will have equivalent rights to our existing 
Class A and Class B stock, except it will have no voting rights, and it will also 
be is
sued through a stock dividend on all Class A and Class B shares. So 
after the dividend, a stockholder who currently owns one share of Class A 
common stock with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one 
share of Class C capital stock that does 
not have a vote. Our existing Class A 
shares will continue to trade as they do now and the new class C shares will 
also be listed, so stockholders will be able to trade those shares, the class C, 
just as they can with the Class A shares today.
 
Now one thin
g to emphasize, because all stockholders will be treated equally 
and will receive one share of Class C for every share they now hold, 
everyone, including Larry, Sergey and Eric, will retain the same voting 
interest they had immediately prior to the dividen
d. And it's also important 
to note that as part of this, Larry, Sergey and Eric have all agreed to subject 
their shares to a transfer restriction agreement. This agreement maintains 
the same link between their voting and economic interest that exist today.
 
So if any of Larry, Sergey or Eric sell or transfer their nonvoting Class C 
shares, there's a stapling provision in the agreement that requires them to 
either sell an equal number of Class B shares or convert an equal number of 
Class B shares into Class A
 
shares. Now the stapling requirement will end 
when their ownership levels fall below certain thresholds. So the basic thing 
to understand here is that the stapling provision is designed so that subject 
to these thresholds, the votes held by the founders a
nd Eric will be reduced 
proportionally as their economic interest in the company declines.
 
Now a word about the process we used. Our Board of Directors carefully 
considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a 
decision. The proces
s the board followed was robust and the deliberations 
were extensive. Back in January 2011, the board established a special 
committee comprised of independent non
-
management board members to 
consider this new class of stock or other alternatives. The commi
ttee met on 
numerous occasions over the 15 months that the special committee 
considered the proposal and that, that was separately from the board. The 
committee recommended and the board unanimously approved today's 
proposal.
 
In terms of next steps, the pr

of the voting power of Google's common stock and they'll vote together as a 
class that will happen at our Annual Meeting on June 21 of this year. Given 
that Larry, Sergey and Eric control the majority of votin
g power and support 
the proposal, we expect it to pass. Following that, the board will set a record 
date for the dividend to move the process forward.
 
So for more detail on the proposal, you can find the Founder's Letter that 
Larry and Sergey issued this m
orning as well as a postscript from me on our 
Investor Relations site. And as I said, next week, we'll file a preliminary 
proxy statement with the SEC, so you'll have even more details about 
today's proposal.
 
So with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick to t
alk about the quarter.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Well, closing this first year with Larry leading Google as CEO, all of us at 
Google feel a renewed sense of velocity, focus and optimism in ou
r Q1 
operating, but also financial results are a good reflection of this spirit.
 
So let's jump right into the financials. Our gross revenue grew 24% year
-
over
-
year to $10.6 billion, 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, and our Google 
websites also grew. Revenue grew 2
4% to $7.3 billion, with strength across 
most major geographies and verticals. Google's Network revenue was up 
20% year
-
over
-
year to $2.9 billion, 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And Network 
revenue was still negatively impacted by the search quality changes we 
b
egan to make a year ago in late February, otherwise known as Panda. 
Other revenue was up 56% year
-
over
-
year to $420 million and 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our aggregate paid
-
click growth was very strong, just shy of 
40%, up 39% year
-
over
-
year, and up 7% quar
ter
-
over
-
quarter. Aggregate 
cost
-
per
-
click growth was down 12% and down 6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
So given the recent trends in CPCs and clicks, allow me to spend a bit of 
time today addressing this. The most important thing for you to understand 
is that ou
r business is healthy. We believe that shifts in CPC and paid clicks 
taken independently really do not reflect the fundamental health of our 
business. Now allow me some details on this. In general, we attribute these 
trends to a combination of really 5 cor
e factors. Those include FX, and then 
there's 3 mix effects. For example, the mobile versus tablet versus desktop 
shifts, emerging markets versus developed markets shifts and even the 
basics of google.com versus our network. And then finally, ads quality 
c
hanges which is also a huge factor. So as you can see, it's a complex set of 
dynamics with multiple variables at play.
 
Many in the financial community have tried to isolate or often I hear pick 
one of these among these factors as the primary driver for CPC
 
or click 
trends. Some even say it's about 
--
 
all about mobile. Others suggest that it 
indicates weakness in demand for Google advertising. Well, on the latter 
point, I want to be very clear that that's not the case. One important signal 
we have for advert
iser demand is bidding behavior. And in fact, our 

 
So the dynamics around CPCs and paid clicks are just simply very complex 
because of all of these big factors and change continually. So trying to
 
pick a 
horse, so to speak, just doesn't make sense. We internally track all these 
factors with the help of a number of statisticians, economists and engineers 
who dig into all these details on an ongoing basis. So we won't go into that 
level of detail eve
ry quarter, but again, the key thing to understand is that 
we believe that shifts in CPC, or paid clicks taken independently, simply 
don't reflect the fundamental health of our business, which we believe is 
actually very healthy. If anything, the recent lo
wer CPCs present a great 
opportunity for advertisers to get an even better return on their ad spend. 
And lower cost, better ROI attract advertisers and thus, this is good for 
Google for the long term as well. So enough said on CPCs and paid clicks.
 
Let's j
ust turn to geographic performance. The U.S., U.K. and rest of world 
are growing still at good pace as reflected in our results. In our earnings 
slides, which you'll find on our Investor Relation website, you see that we've 
broken down our revenue by U.S.,
 
U.K. and rest of world that showed the 
impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to 
those slides for the exact calculations.
 
Our revenue in the U.S. was up 22% year
-
over
-
year to $4.9 billion. Our 
non
-
U.S. revenue accounted f
or 54% of our total revenue or $5.8 billion, up 
26% year
-
over
-
year, which includes modest $37 million benefits from our 
hedging program. The U.K. was up 19% year
-
over
-
year to $1.2 billion.
 
Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $2.
5 billion 
or 24.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.2 
billion, excluding stock
-
based compensation of $74 million. And finally, 
operating expenses excluding SBC again, totaled $3 billion. SBC totaled 
$482 million for the quarte
r, and the increase year
-
over
-
year in OpEx was 
primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and 
professional services.
 
So as a result of all this, our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $3.9 billion for 
Q1, resulting in a non
-
GAAP opera
ting margin slightly above 37%. These 
robust margins give us the confidence to continue to fully fund the strategic 
growth areas such as mobile, Android, YouTube, Chrome, all the areas that 
Larry talked about. And Nikesh will go into more details of these 
initiatives in 
a minute.
 
Turning to headcount, which was approximately 610 for the quarter, and we 
ended up the quarter with roughly 33,077 employees, full time. Our effective 
tax rate was lower this quarter, 18%, and this reflects the mix of earnings 
betw
een domestic and international subsidiaries and hedges and also some 
capital gains offset by carried over capital losses.
 
So now let me turn to cash, cash management. Other OI&Es or other income 
and expenses was $156 million for the quarter, positive, and 
it reflects a 
higher realized gain on our investments, offset somewhat by lower interest 
income and by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging 
program. For more details on OI&E, once again, I refer you to the slides that 
accompany us on our IR 
website.
 
Operating cash flow was very strong, $3.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 
$607 million versus last quarter at $951 million. The majority of our CapEx 
spend was related to production equipment this quarter, as well as data 
center operations and 
facilities. And as a reminder, we will continue to make 
significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter, mostly depending on when we're able to make these 
investments. So in total, very pleased with our free cash flo
w, $3.1 billion.
 
Let me close with my usual reminder that our revenues typically exhibit 
seasonality in the first half of the year, while our expenses do less so. So it's 
just a forewarning for everybody who's kind of tuning their models.
 
I'll hand off now
 
to Nikesh who will cover in more detail our business 
performance in the quarter. Additionally, since Susan, who is typically on the 
call, is on a well
-
deserved spring break with her family this week, Nikesh will 
also cover some of the product highlights, 
primarily in Ads.
 
With this, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. I will now give you an update on our business activities. 
As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, we had another quarter of excellent 
performance, resulting in $10.6 bi
llion of revenue this quarter. Our results 
are actually reflective of 3 major trends that are happening in the online 
advertising space, so let me just touch upon those.
 
First, we're seeing a big move to solutions. Our clients and partners more 
and more wa
nt complete solutions that work across all screens: desktop; 
mobile, tablet; and in the future, television. And also work with all kinds of 
formats, whether they're search, display or video ads. It's like having 
individual solutions for different devices a
nd formats. So we're driving our 
teams to sell solutions across the entire marketing funnel. From building 
brand awareness to conversions, we are converging our teams of over 8,000 
people to setting these complete solutions in 60 countries, making us one o
f 
the largest online solutions player.
 
Secondly, the big trend is we're seeing a breakthrough on brands. More than 
at any point in the last decade of online advertising, we're at a point where 
major brand advertisers, from movie studios to CPG 
companies, are finally 
looking to digital media as a central part of their marketing efforts. We are 
making huge progress. YouTube has gone from an interesting ad buy to key 
buy for brands. In May, we'll be hosting our first upfront for brands and 
agencies
, showcasing the latest channel content and opportunities for 
marketers, something television has been doing forever. We will do that for 
YouTube in New York.
 
And third, we're beginning to see a trend on cross
-
media measurement. 
Social advertising has alwa
ys been highly measurable, and we have been 
leading the industry in extending the measurability, not only in Search, but 
in Display, Mobile and live video. We are actually taking that one step 
further and trying to move that measurability into offline sale
s. Our 
experience is that businesses may allocate experimental budgets to new 
areas, but they invest serious money only when they can measure the 
results. We are rolling our best
-
of
-
breed measurement technologies so all 
clients can measure their ROI, wheth
er their goals are online conversions, 
brand lifts or just the ability to compare offline and online media.
 
Let's talk about some specific product areas. Search, our Desktop Search 
business has maintained robust growth with strong traction with our top 
par
tners around the world even in the face of economic uncertainties that 
we've been noticing in Europe. I think search advertising has broken through 
that sound barrier of being an online channel, which now finally proven to 
drive in
-
store sales. For example
, we partnered with IKEA in Italy in a study 
showing that each click on a paid search ad generates $7.60 of revenue. And 
then interaction with paid search in conjunction with television drives 20% of 
contribution to sales. And there's a lot of room to impr
ove on that, but it's a 
cut clear demonstration of how online advertising is no longer just restricted 
to online sales but also having a huge impact in the offline world.
 
Last week, we launched a range of features to improve location targeting so 
that mark
eters can reach users by zip code or have their physical location 
show up more prominently in their ads.
 
In sales, I want to highlight Google Analytics, which is an unsung hero. Over 
10 million marketers and websites globally use Google Analytics to measur
e 
the effectiveness of their online presence in real time. From large e
-
commerce sites to small blogs, that means that our technology is at the 
heart of over 10 million businesses, helping them get the most out of the 
Web.
 
Last quarter, we made several imp
ortant improvements to Google Analytics, 
helping marketeers to measure the impact of the traffic from across over 
400 social networks. I didn't even know there are 400 social networks.
 
Let's talk about Display. On Display, we saw a robust revenue growth as
 
our 
clients continue to see the value of integrated advertising solution in driving 
business results. For example, we signed a deal with Unilever in Brazil for a 
campaign that ran across all Google properties, including YouTube, Search, 
Google Display Net
work and Gmail. We also recently partnered with leading 
sportswear company, Reebok, to develop a global display campaign across 
YouTube, Mobile 
--
 
YouTube and AdMob 
--
 
and mobiles, YouTube as well.
 
On the platform side in Display, we continue to make progr
ess. We are now 
the leading platform provider for agencies and publishers to help drive their 
business using display advertising. We are focused in building unified buying 
and selling platform that helps them manage their advertising across all 
media much 
better than they have been able to in the past.
 
Our good relationships with our clients are helped by rapid product 
development and innovation. Last quarter, we launched the Google Display 
Network app in AdWords, which makes it easy for all AdWords clients
 
to 
build, monitor and find display campaigns across millions of sites in our 
network. This is helping bring the world of search and display even closer.
 
Let's take a minute to talk about YouTube. As I mentioned, YouTube is an 
amazing success story. It's g
one from an interesting buy to an obvious buy. 
Our watch paid sales have accelerated, particularly in key emerging 
countries, but also in mature ones. Today, most of our in
-
stream ads in 
YouTube are skippable, while our TrueView ad format, which is fast 
be
coming an online video standard. It's great for users and it's great for 
advertisers. For example, the U.K. mobile operator O2 is actively now using 
YouTube to support their brand launch. They're using several YouTube 
products, including TrueView YouTube M
obile. They even live stream the 
New York 
--
 
sorry, the New Year Eve's concert from the O2 arena in London 
globally in YouTube.
 
In addition to this, we're also rolling out our 100 new original channels in 
YouTube, featuring top talents like Jay
-
Z, Madonna,
 
Tony Hawk, as well as 
innovative new media companies and YouTube's new own successful 
partners. We think YouTube is fast becoming the platform for the next 
generation of talents, which is great because we're also seeing initial success 
selling the sponsor
ship for these channels to large advertisers such as 
Toyota, Unilever, GM as all in anticipation of the big upfront event coming up 
in May.
 
Let's change gears and talk about mobile. Mobile is quickly becoming a 
backbone of many clients overall advertising 
strategies and has huge 
headroom to grow. We continue to innovate with our product offerings with 
a number of new tools for advertisers. One development we're particularly 
excited about is our new enhanced click
-
to
-
download formats. This format in 
Search h
elps marketeers and developers promote apps. These things help 
improve ROI to provide users with more relevant download information 
about apps such as star rankings, pricing, et cetera, and all this happens 
right in the ad creator [ph]. So we keep actively
 
working to help develop the 
mobile ecosystem from enabling mobile commerce to empowering local 
businesses.
 
In Q1, we began to scale our GoMo campaign, which is our Go Mobile 
campaign. This initiative helps businesses get more and more assertive and 
set up
 
great mobile websites so they can keep driving traffic to those 
websites and expand their businesses. We've done these efforts across the 
world in North and South America, in Europe, in Asia and Africa.
 
Moving beyond advertising. Our Enterprise business a
lso saw excellent 
progress as large organizations and small businesses continue to see the 
value of Google Apps as a cost
-
effective and feature
-
rich productivity suite. 
Some of our top customers to go Google in Q1 include global pharmaceutical 
company Roch
e, more than 90,000 users; the State of Colorado, which 
announced they intend to move 26,000 employees and users to Google; also 
the University of Pennsylvania and Rome have gone Google. Not only that, 
small business adoption of Google Apps is on fire, wit
h SMB signups almost 
doubling in the past 6 months. So we're happy with the business and we're 
happy with the way Enterprise continues to progress.
 
Let me go back and show some more color on the country performance, as 
Patrick also talked about. From a reg
ional perspective, we saw generally 
stable performance in the Americas. We saw a sustained traction in most 
parts of Europe and we saw acceleration in Asia, all this was driven by 
strong performance from our long tail Sense sales channel. Growth in North 
A
merica was steady and this certainly was boosted by seasonal events such 
as Super Bowl, Valentine's Day, tax season. Canada was a little slower. Of 
course, Western Europe was robust in spite of the macroeconomic 
conditions. We continued seeing good growth 
in the U.K. Germany, France 
and Italy grew slightly less quickly than before. We saw strong acceleration 
in Asia. Japan grew faster this quarter, led by successes again, in our small 
and medium client base.
 
Let's talk about marketing and our partnerships b
usiness. Our marketing and 
partnership teams continue to support the fantastic growth we've seen this 
quarter across all of our business lines, products and services. We continue 
to roll out initiatives to support of Google+, which Larry talked about. We 
r
olled out our That's the plus campaign with spots airing during the 
Grammys, the Oscars. Google+ and Hangouts are getting great traction. We 
have President Obama, we have Governor Romney, they both conducted 
very successful Hangouts in the platform. Even N
ASCAR held a Hangout 
ahead of the Daytona 500. But the most interesting was Seaview Survey, it 
had underwater Hangout live from the Great Barrier Reef. It's amazing to be 
able to see our great products like Hangouts be so successful. I recommend 
that all o
f you try Hangout soon.
 
As Larry mentioned, we also launched Google Play, which provides users one 
place to find, enjoy and share apps, music, movies and books instantly 
anywhere across the Web and on the Android devices. To support the 
launch, we are on a
 
7 days to Play promotion, offering discounts and apps 
and media, and our YouTube video has received over 3 million viewers to 
date. Our partnership teams also kept its great work, supporting our 
products by being very close to our partners. For example, w
e launched 
Google Street View in Russia, which lets users walk around the historical 
centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg. And we are also thrilled that this 
quarter our Google Cultural Institute help bring Nelson Mandela's archives 
online. We expand our s
uccessful art project to include new museums from 
the Getty Museum in L.A. to the museums in Paris and Qatar. Project now 
provides access to more than 30,000 ultra
-
high resolution images, paintings, 
sculptures and photographs in 151 museums and other insti
tutions in 40 
countries.
 
So in closing, I think Q1 was an excellent quarter. It has led us off to a very 
good start for 2012. We look forward to continuing to serve our users, 
customers and partners for the rest of 2012 and beyond. Also, I want to say 
than
k you to all the Googlers and our global business team, all of our 
partners in the product and engineering teams that allow us to make these 
wonderful things happen and allow us to continue to drive the business.
 
With that, thank you, and I'm going to hand
 
you back to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you. So Jamie, our operator, is going to give us the instructions to get 
to the Q&A. So Jamie, why don't we just jump right in?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our fir
st question from Spencer Wang 
with Credit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang

Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
 
Two quick questions. First for Patrick. You mentioned the headcount growth 
was only about 600 this quarter. That's obviously slower than what you saw 
in 20
11. Should we 
--
 
is this roughly the pace we should expect for 2012 or 
were there perhaps some timing factors? And then secondly for Larry, you 
talked about Google+ unifying the Google product. So when you think about 
things like Google Wallet and Offers, 
the mobile strategy maps, do you think 
of these as individual products or are they part of perhaps a broader local 
strategy? And if so, how do they fit together?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Perhaps why don't I just jump on the technical question, then let Larry get 
t
o the second one. So look, I think that the headcount fluctuations, you'll 
remember last year when Larry said that we were at what was the kind of 
the edge of what was tolerable. And look, this short
-
term variability is 
actually the very best proof point t
hat we don't manage kind of quarter
-
to
-
quarter and try to smooth things out. It just happens that in the first 
quarter, at this time of year, it's a bit different than when you come back in 
Q3 when you have all of the graduate students that actually start 
with us, so 
there's a bit of fluctuations there. So I wouldn't read that much into the 
numbers, but we're basically continuing to push on plan for hiring for this 
year.
 
Larry Page
 
And the question, I guess, about our products. I think we're working 
very 
hard, and I've talked a lot about this to make our Google experience be 
more unified and feel like one great experience for people. And many of the 
products you mentioned, Google Wallet, Offers, Maps, I mean, they apply 
kind of across many of the thin
gs we do. And so I think you'll see better 
integration of those products over 
--
 
through the rest of our products has 
already exist with Wallet, for example, across many different parts like 
Google Play and so on. And I think you'll see that increasingly h
appen over 
time just as we make these experiences better. They'll come up when you 
expect them to come up and when they make sense for users. I think that's 
definitely a big area of focus for us.
 
Operator
 
And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
Mark S
. Mahaney

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
Two quick questions. First, in terms of appealing to major brands, and 
Nikesh I think you talked about how you're seeing major brands engage 
more with YouTube and other assets. Could you talk about how you're tr
ying 
to go after those dollars? Are there new things that you're doing now that 
you weren't doing 2 years ago to kind of accelerate that momentum? And 
then just real quickly on the mobile CPC issue. Can you just comment again 
on over time, over what period
 
of time you would expect mobile and desktop 
CPCs to merge or do you think that's a realistic expectation? What would 
cause that to happen or not?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Let me take the first question quickly, then I'll give you a little color on the 
second one, the
n Patrick can jump in. In terms of what we're doing 
differently, as I mentioned, YouTube has gone from being an interesting 
place where brands to be to being a must
-
buy. So we're seeing tremendous 
demand for inventory, which is brand related. And for the m
ost part, the 
online world in the past has been more performance related i.e., people 
wanted to get some transactions, they wanted to get more people to their 
website. Now they're seeing the benefit of using the Web for brand affiliation 
and for brand reco
gnition. So we are beginning to have a different sales 
pitch with the large brands, which is oriented towards them coming and 
getting their brands seen a little bit, and YouTube is a phenomenal tool in 
that regard, which acts sort of like an anchor propert
y. Then we're able to 
package our demographic base inventory around the Google Display 
Network, around YouTube and actually get the brands to engage in the large 
campaigns, which can run the millions of dollars. This was a capability we 
couldn't have a few
 
years ago because the inventory didn't exist or the 
demographic tools didn't exist. So clearly, this is a new space and a new sort 
of pitch to our brand advertisers. As I said, we are trying to light this up 
across our sales force around the world in 60 c
ountries.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
No, we just have 
--
 
let's go through the mobile CPC question. So Mark, I 
think that this one is 
--
 
think of it as so much upside for us because 
essentially mobile is exploding in query growth and the formats themselves 
are just a
dapting already a lot and from a relatively crude base to so much 
more in the future. So that you're absolutely right that right now they don't 
monetize as well because we're kind of in what search used to be in 2002, 
2003, 2004. So as these formats kind o
f continue to get better and better, 
we'd expect much better performance on them.
 
Larry Page
 
This is Larry. I'll add something, Mark. I think the mobile CPCs 
--
 
I mean, 
people always spend their most effort on the major 
--
 
whatever the major 
source of traf
fic or revenue is, and those are growing really quickly, albeit 
currently, obviously, there's more on desktop. I think over time as a 
reverse, and I think that the ability to kind of on your mobile to do local 
kinds of transactions, to really easily commun
icate with people and to do the 
kind of capabilities you have on your mobile device. And the fact that you 
spend most of your money locally, I think that over time that may actually 
reverse and the CPCs action may get better. But I think we're very bullish
 
about that. We're making a lot of investments in that area, in things like 
Offers and so on and Wallet. And we're very, very excited about the 
potential there, and also Click

Call and other things that we do. So I 
think, for example, it's a lot easier 
to call someone from your mobile than it 
is from your computer right now. And so if that's how you're relying for 
transactions, actually mobile CPC should be higher for that. So I think you 
just haven't seen the focus on it and we're moving more and more f
ocused 
on to that, both on our sales side and our customers are moving focus onto 
that, but I'm very, very bullish on that.

Larry, in your 2012 update le
tter, you speak of all these notions of changing 
the world and ambitious goals on risky projects and having a healthy 
disregard for the impossible. Without getting into too much detail, at a high 
level, what types of projects is Google working on that woul
d really surprise 
us? And are you remaining committed to the 70/20/10 rule where these 
noncore areas might get only 10% of the investment? And then separately, 
just on the google.com TAC, please, that continues to increase as a 
percentage of Google revenue
. Is most of that coming from payments to 
mobile partners? And given the growth of mobile, should we expect that to 
continue to increase meaningfully?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Do you mind, Larry, why don't I answer the last one first because it's really 
easy and t
hen you can jump on the rest. Look, on TAC, if you look at our 
percentages 
--
 
as a percentage of revenue year
-
over
-
year, I mean it's 
basically stable. I mean, it moves a little bit here and there and you have 
partner mix and FX mix between mobile and other
s, but it's not actually 
changing in any dramatic way. So what you have to see in there is just the 
regular mix of both traffics and partners that come in and out all the time as 
well, so that I wouldn't read too much into that. I'll let Larry answer the r
eal 
sexy question.
 
Larry Page
 
I think I didn't mention specifically the 70/20/10 in my letter. I should have, 
that's a good addition. So we definitely still see a 
--
 
most of our resources 
should be going to our core businesses, which really Search and Ads 
and a 
few of those things I mentioned that's really fallen to that core, I think. And 
then there's 20% kind of near things and maybe another 10% on the really 
speculative things. Through our whole history, we've really struggled this 
and have 10% kind of o
n the speculative things. Generally, it's much lower 
than that. I think the real thing that's needed on those projects is some 
management. Those take up bandwidth. You saw our announcements of 
Google Glass last week, which I was very excited to go out. You
've seen the 
driver with his car kinds of things. And it does our take our executive time to 
deal with those things and so on, and so I think that's the real investment 
we make rather than being huge amounts of dollars on those kinds of things 
generally. W
e've got a limited number of things we can do. As I've been 
saying, we've been trying to focus. So trying to make sure that we have the 
right speculative bets as well as the right bets we're making on our core 
products and so on. And I'm pretty excited abo
ut our ability to do that. And I 
think it's hard coming from the outside because I mentioned in the letter I 
published today that Android took 3 years, plus 3 years kind of to really get 
to where it is today. That's 6 years, and you all haven't seen androi
d, right, 
for those 6 years. We've seen it for those 6 years and we really invested in 
it. It's not so much money at the earlier stages, but attention. And that's an 
important, I think, discipline for the company to have.

Similar to detail on cost

per

click, would you discuss the key drivers of 
higher paid
-
click growth? Is it quality changes, Product Listing Ads or 
something else? And m
ore broadly, maybe you can discuss how Product 
Listing Ads do impact results as we're tracking a substantially higher number 
of these ads on your site?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Without giving 
--
 
look, the short answer is yes, and that's what the core 
answer of my 
message to the market was today. I think that you have a 
combination of international factors. You have a combination of new formats. 
Ad formats drive a lot in terms of paid clicks. If you think of even the 
sitelinks' extensions that we've 
--
 
like we have 
a new generation of sitelinks 
for this quarter, right? This is a perfect example of a product where by 
adding additional lines that are more targeted, so instead of having just kind 
of, trucks or 
--
 
and then you go down into the second layer, right, you ha
ve 
less CPC for that additional sitelinks. But if it's a better ad, people click a ton 
more on them. So it is really all of those 5 factors that actually drive them. 
And that's why we're continuing to kind of be pretty happy with the health of 
the net effe
ct, which is real growth. Certainly, internationally, I mean it also 
--
 
you can see our mix between international and non
-
international. And 
that's driving it as well. So you have all these factors at play. And we're 
pretty happy with what we're doing ther
e.

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Two things. First, just want to follow up on the question on mobile and TAC. 
If you could help us understand beyond 
CPCs how the economics of mobile 
are different and perhaps a little bit more detail on how you're paying OEMs 
and carriers. And then secondly, any updated thoughts on the cash balance 
and an update perhaps on the split of U.S. and international cash?
 
Patri
ck Pichette
 
Let me start with the last one first. We don't give the breakdown of our U.S. 
cash. We do it kind of irregularly, so we haven't done so of late. We have 
--
 
we continue to have a very strong cash balance, both U.S. and international. 
You'll noti
ce, if you go into the details of our cash balance and on our 
balance sheet, right, we have just slightly under $2 billion of sec lending 
programs. So when you really, really look at our net cash balance, you got 
to take that sec lending out because it's o
n both sides of the balance sheet. 
But for the rest of it, incredibly healthy cash balance, both domestic and 
international. And Nikesh, do you want to give a quick update on the mobile 
CPCs and their mix?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes. I mean, again, I'm not going to 
talk about specific of the TAC on 
mobile. But as you know, we get people using our devices both organically 
as well as through our distribution partnerships with carriers and OEMs. And 
typically, the OEMs and carriers participate in some of the economics t
hat 
are on the Android marketplace or Google Play and some of them participate 
in the economics around Google Search just the way we would do 
syndication on the Web platform, which you do with many partners around 
the world. We have similar deals on the mo
bile front. I think in the mix, it 
comes out. This sort of washes out and it sort of adds up into our number 
which we show in 
--
 
our total number of green desktop and mobile. But 
mobile is no different from the way the desktop business operates out there.

Two questions, if I may. If you think of the future of Internet sear
ch 3 or 4 
years out, how important will the social signal be and how important your 
personalization be? In other words, would the company with the best social 
signal be able to offer the best search? And if the answer to that question is 
no, why is Google 
investing so much in Google+? And second question, if I 
may, you probably end the year with about $50 billion in cash and 
marketable securities and that will give you quite a lot of strategic flexibility. 
Given that, what's the rationale to continue to inc
rease that amount on 
market on cash to shareholders?
 
Larry Page
 
I'll take the first part, Carlos. I think the 
--
 
this is Larry, and I think it's a 
very good question. And I think one of the things actually had in my remarks 
when I took out was to talk a li
ttle bit about Search and just enough time to 
put it all in. And I actually covered the question you're asking. I think one of 
the most amazing things I think we can do today that we couldn't do even a 
few months ago is to really 
--
 
I have this friend Ben 
Smith, right, who's a 
person at Google. He has kind of a common name. Now when I do a search 
actually, it finds the right person and it puts him in the search box. So for 
the first time, the search box isn't really doing searching a string, just the 
sequen
ce of letters. It's actually searching for that person that I know. Now 
it's not, obviously not all the searches you do, but being able to search for 
people well is important. And knowing 
--
 
having real feedback from users 
about what they like and don't li
ke and things they're sharing and so on is 
very useful for search. And we have a lot of those signals already, but we 
can always use more signals. We can always use better relevance and we 
can always use more data to generate that. So I think it is very im
portant. I 
think it's not 
--
 
think social data about identity and ability to easily share 
things with other people and comment on them and things like that is a 
basic utility for people in all of our products. And that's where I was talking 
about Google+ r
eally working across all of Google for identity and sharing 
and notification and other things that it does really well. So that all applies 
to Search and I think it's important for Search. I think search is going to 
change a lot. We're going to make it a l
ot better over the next 5 or 10 years 
as it's changed a lot in the past. And it will include a bunch of those signals 
and a bunch of other things as well.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Carlos, why don't I take the next one, the issue of our cash balance. We 
have a heal
thy cash balance, I had mentioned a minute ago, and we still 
believe that it's an incredible strategic asset for us. You saw it last year 
when we decided to make the purchase of MMI, and we continue to monitor 
this cash balance. And for the time being, we 
really believe that, that 
strategic asset has a ton of value. So we'll continue to monitor it and we 
have a process by which we actually review it on a regular basis with the 
board, and those questions are always asked. So we have a good 
governance process
 
around it. But for now and the time being, we have 
nothing to announce on it.

I was wondering, Larry, if you c
ould walk us through your view on Google's 
tablet strategy via Android and the relative importance of having success 
with these devices in terms of achieving your long
-
term goal?
 
Larry Page
 
Heather, that's a good question. I think that we're very excited a
bout 
tablets. I think there's a number of Android tablets out there and obviously, 
we have strong competition there as well. I think you've seen us really 
invest substantially also in things like Google Play, which really give you 
great access to entertain
ment, media, books and videos and so on, and as 
well as the apps. And we think that's an important component of what we're 
doing. I think there's also 
--
 
obviously, there's been a lot of success on some 
lower
-
priced tablets that run Android, maybe not the 
full Google version of 
Android. But we definitely believe that there's going to be a lot of success at 
the lower end of the market as well with lower
-
priced products that will be 
very significant. And it's definitely an area we think is important and we're
 
quite focused on.

I have one for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, Android is obviously a key 
focus. You talk about it a l
ot in your letters. Can you help us understand the 
strategic value for Google since you're not licensing it? Do you see more 
revenue per device if it runs on Android or lower TAC or what else can you 
tell us about what the real advantage to Google's advert
ising businesses? 
And then Patrick, obviously, higher in CapEx in Q1 this year, a lot lower than 
Q1 last year. Can you tell us if you factor in your revenue growth when you 
make that spending decision, your outlook? Does that 
--
 
give us any clues 
on your o
utlook for revenue growth over the next couple of years?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Why don't I jump on the 
--
 
because mine again is not a very strategic one, 
it's more how we proceed. Look, it's lumpy because there's just timing 
decisions, right. We would 
--
 
there'
s probably a few areas where we would 
have like to actually make investments in Q1 and for a bunch of logistics 
reasons or otherwise, we couldn't. And so 
--
 
and you'll notice that's why 
there's kind of like $350 million difference between Q4 and Q1. And yo
u 
should just expect it to be lumpy and that's just the nature of 
--
 
data centers 
are kind of big and clunky. And when you buy some piece of real estate, it's 
big and clunky. So there is quite a bit of variability into it. But we're 
--
 
again, 
I wouldn't ta
ke any one data point to start making a trend out of. So it's 
tough for, but I think that you can see we're committed to capital. If you 
look at the last couple of years, we've really made kind of significant 
investments and we'll continue to do them becau
se it's a real strategic asset 
to us as well. So I'll let Larry answer the first question.
 
Larry Page
 
Justin, I think on your questions about Android, I think they're pretty short
-
term focus and I think it's good to think about the longer
-
term 
issues. We 
don't get very many new operating systems, kind of only a few in my 
lifetime, and I think they're pretty important. And I think Android's really 
about increasing the pace of innovation, usage of mobile devices and our 
ability to get a great user
 
experiences out to our users, which I think we're 
doing a great job of. I mentioned over 850,000 devices per day are going 
out. And it's important to remember we're very early stages of that like 
we've only 
--
 
I'm amazed the computer that I'm carrying in 
my pocket is as 
good as the one I had a few years ago on my desktop. And I think we're 
only at the very, very early stages of what's possible with those devices. And 
I'm excited about a whole bunch of things we're doing in that area. We 
already mentioned k
ind of things like I said I'm very bullish about CPCs will 
improve on mobile over desktop due to all those capabilities. And so I think 
the benefits we get from Android are a lot. I mean, obviously, we have great 
integration with our products and Search an
d Google+ and photo uploading 
and there's a hundred things that we do really well on Android that benefit 
us across the board and across our users across the board and our products 
across the board. And I think that's going to continue to be the case. And 
I 
think it does lead to better economics for us too because we're providing 
amazing experiences for people that are well integrated and work well and 
they demand. So that's 
--
 
I'm very positive on all those things.

Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
 
Larry, just wondering as you look out on a very long term kind of 5
-
year 
view, do you see tablets taking perhaps the majority of home Internet 
usage? And if so, how strategically 
imperative is it for Android to have a big 
success in the tablet space given partner TAC could impose a high cost to 
the extent Android doesn't have a hit?
 
Larry Page
 
Yes, I mean, I think I've sort of already answered this question previously 
about tablets
. I think the 
--
 
I mean, like I said, I think it's an important 
area. I think your computing experience, obviously, if you have an Android 
phone or use Google a lot online or you care about all those things in terms 
of your experience. And so I think you'r
e thinking about your user 
experience. You're thinking about across all the devices use. I think people 
are going to get a lot more devices. We see kind of a convergence between 
all the services on those devices. And right now, I feel like each device you 
got is kind of a hassle the deal with and you're thinking about each 
individual device and all the issues with it. And I think that's not really right. 
I think you're going to have a pretty unified experience and a great 
experience from a user point of vie
w and you won't have to manage all 
these devices. So I think you want to think about all these screens around 
you working seamlessly and working well for you. And I think, obviously, 
tablets are important. We have Google TV obviously. Big screens are 
impor
tant, computers are important, phones are important. Everything, all 
those devices are important. And I expect that they'll work well together. So 
I think that's kind of how we would think about it, and I think it's 
--
 
I don't 
think any single device there
 
is going to drive all the usage or all the kind of 
convergence that needs to happen.

RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
 
I had a question for Nikesh. Can you give 
us an update on the growth rate 
you're seeing today in your core Search business by small, medium and 
large advertiser tranches? I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks 
that Japan had strong growth, primarily due to smaller advertiser tranche. 
So how
 
does that growth look in the various advertisers' size buckets across 
your GOs? And then is the speed of small advertiser adoption increasing 
right now versus prior periods given all the new local products that you 
have?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes, I mean, I 
think the one way to think about it is that fundamentally we 
have one auction, and that auction every advertiser participates, whether it's 
the small advertiser or large advertiser. So they way we think about it is 
that we try and go ahead and get more and
 
more advertisers to see the 
benefit of online advertising and the solutions that we offer. So as more and 
more advertisers come into the auction, it drives the price up of the auction 
for both large and small advertisers. And the way to think about it is 
that 
there's a price as we talked about CPCs and paid clicks, but it's really the 
third variable that goes into it, how many advertisers can we bring into the 
auction and how many various things can we get them interested in, 
whether it's mobile, whether i
t's YouTube, whether it's Display, whether it's 
Search. So there has been a lot of effort we have put in from our end, both 
to get more small business online. We've been adding GXBO campaigns 
around the world where we get small businesses online. We've als
o been 
cleaning up our signup flows for our adverts products, which is a self
-
served 
product where really small business can sign up. We have been working on 
getting people to have more mobile sites and getting people out in the 
mobile campaign. So effecti
vely, it's a lot of effort towards getting more and 
more advertisers into the ecosystem. And as that happens around the world, 
you will see seasonal patterns or some sort of spikes when we work harder 
on small businesses in one quarter in certain parts of 
the world. But 
eventually, it all benefits the auction and we see the trend over time ends up 
working the same way for large and small advertisers.

Barclays C
apital, Research Division
 
Just one question for Nikesh or whomever wants to answer it. It seems like 
even though as you're shifting to mobile, you have this presumably double
-
digit pricing step down for CPCs. But in the Display world, certainly, that 
prici
ng difference could be even more dramatic. In some cases, by half or 
2/3. Prices getting cut on that shift to mobile. And so you guys at Google 
have the unique ability to compare and contrast the difference in price 
between like Search and Display and how 
the 2 are monetizing relative to 
desktop. And so any color on that comparison would be appreciated because 
I think there are folks out there that have a view that actually Search, core 
Search, monetizes better on that shift to mobile than Display does, and
 
I 
would love to just understand that better.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yes, I mean, I guess 
--
 
let me try to just explain to it from the advertiser 
perspective. So what we're striving towards is advertisers are interested in 
ROI. Advertisers actually are not intereste
d in whether they're on the mobile 
product, the Display product, the Search product on the Web or the Search 
product on mobile. So what we are fast converging towards is we're basically 
sitting down and understanding ROI targets of our advertisers. And the
n we 
have immense amounts of inventory at our behest, whether it's mobile 
inventory, on Display or Search or desktop inventory or even inventory to 
our network. And what we are trying to work towards is being able to 
dynamically allocate across these vario
us products, what allows them to get 
the maximum ROI. In that case, they are sort of 
--
 
they don't really care 
about whether they got that transaction to happen off one platform, one 
format or the other. So that's what we want to aspire, and that works rea
lly 
well in performance advertising because there is a specific objective the 
advertiser has. On Display, on brand, it works slightly differently, obviously, 
because you're talking about CPMs. But generally, that's the way to think 
about it. In the long te
rm, we think mobile will monetize better. And we 
usually don't see the difference happening on Display and Search as you 
alluded to. Larry, you want to add something?

With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric.
 
Eric Schmidt
 
Thank you very much, Jane, and thanks, everybody, for getting on our call. 
Your time's very valuable. 
I'm really glad that you all could join us for our 
quarterly call as reasonably scheduled. We've jumped on the call to talk 
about the other announcement of this afternoon, which I think everybody is 
getting a chance to read.
 
We've had a very strong quarter
 
and a very strong year. And I think as our 
resultS show today, our outlook is very, very bright. Larry and Sergey and I 
spent the lot of time talking about how to run everything. The last decade, 
of course, had been fantastic and we anticipate this will c
ontinue. How can 
we run the company even better? And just after a long series of 
conversations, we decided to make some changes in the way we are 
structuring, the way we actually operate things.
 
Historically, we've always been running the decisions togethe
r. And 
ultimately, it adds delay and so forth in the way we make decisions. It's 
actually better to clarify it. So the proposal, which would ultimately now the 
board has completely approved, is by elevating me and by having Larry 
running things day
-
to
-
day,
 
Sergey focusing on the areas he's going to talk 
about. We think that this will produce even better success for the 
corporation. And of course, we're going to do all this by April. So, Larry, do 
you want to introduce a little bit about your thoughts?
 
Larry
 
Page
 
Well, first, I want to really congratulate Eric. He's done an outstanding job 
leading Google for the last decade. I don't think when Sergey and I started 
the company, we would have imagined, we could have possibly have 
imagined we would have a better
 
leader for the company. And we all are in 
great debt to Eric. And I think the results really speak for themselves. There 
is no debate about that at all. And there's really know one else in the 
universe that could have accomplished what Eric has done. And 
Eric is really 
a tremendous leader, and I've learned a ton from him over the years. And I 
think his advice and efforts going forward as Executive Chairman would be 
invaluable to me and to the company as I start this new role.
 
Google and I want to say is ju
st incredible opportunity. And when we started 
Google, people actually thought we were coming in too late, that there were 
already a lot of other search engines. And the Internet and really people's 
computing life is really still at the very early stages. 
And I could not be more 
excited about moving us forward, and we're really only at the beginning. I 
just can't wait to get it started
 
Eric Schmidt
 
Thank you, Larry. Sergey, do you want to talk a little bit about what you 
would like to get done in this new s
tructure?
 
Sergey Brin
 
I'd like to, first at the outset, mention that I had a great time working 
together with Larry now for about 15 years and with Eric for about a decade. 
And both of them have really inspired me and moved me, and I'm looking 
forward to m
any more decades of work together.
 
Now as we have tried to make, to clarify our respective roles now, I would 
like to work more on my personal passions, which corresponds of several 
significant new products that I hope to tell you about in the future. I'm 
not 
going to, I know it's been accused of vaporware just recently in the press 
and what not, so I don't want to repeat that error. And I hope to tell you 
about them in the future when I'm ready to show you something.
 
But nonetheless, it's really a privileg
e to work with these two gentlemen, to 
continue to work with them, and at this company that I've been really proud 
to be part of all this time.
 
Eric Schmidt
 
Thank you very much. And as for myself, I want to get a chance to work on 
the things that I'm most 
interested in, taking a more strategic view of 
things. And I'm going to focus on customers, partners, various government 
communications, external issues more than the internal issues that I've 
historically been focusing on. So that's a significant, I think
, improvement in 
the kind of things that I could do with my time.
 
And I want to say very clearly that I believe Larry is ready. He's been 
working on this area for a long time. His ideas are very interesting and 
clever, and it's time for him to have a shot 
at running this and doing it. And 
I'm sure he'll do a fantastic job.
 
It's interesting that a decade goes by very fast when you work in a 
partnership as wonderful as this has been, and I'm quite sure that this 
partnership will continue. We're friends, we're
 
co
-
workers, we're computer 
scientists, we have a common vision. I don't anticipate any material change 
in any of our strategies or anything. We tend to agree on pretty much 
everything. But I do believe that as a result of this, we'll operate and 
execute t
he business even better. So with that, I thought maybe what we 
should do is have a few questions before we rush off. And then, Patrick, 
thank you so much for accommodating us on to your call.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
It's our pleasure. Jay, if you don't mind, what
 
we'll do is we'll have two sets 
of questions for this afternoon. We'll just take a few questions now because 
we have Larry, Sergey and Eric. And so we'll take a few questions. And then 
after that, we'll close that section of the call, let them run back, g
o back to 
work, guys. And then we'll take the regular call as we usually proceed.
 
So, Jay, if I can ask you to give us the instructions to take a couple of 
questions for Eric, Larry and Sergey?

[Operator 
Instructions] We'll go first to James Mitchell of Goldman Sachs.

I guess one question I have just stemming from the results from the 
movements perhaps, when I look at the investments in 1118 Avenue in New 
York City
, do you feel that Google is now at a point where in order to 
continue facilitating the growth of the Internet, that there will be a land grab 
for desirable physical locations?
 
Larry Page
 
I think our primary reason for purchasing the building there was not
 
the 
Internet infrastructure there but rather the office space that we really enjoy 
using. The Internet tenants are great, well
-
paying tenants. We appreciate 
having them there, but that's not the primary reason why we purchased the 
building.

Our n
ext question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.
 
Spencer Wang

Crédit Suisse AG
 
Just a big picture question for Eric. You mentioned that one of your areas of 
focus will be on government outreach, and it seems like Google's maybe 
come under a littl
e more regulatory scrutiny over the past several years. So 
I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about your strategy with 
regulators to just ensure that Google can continue to expand as necessary?
 
Eric Schmidt
 
The simple answer is that we're ta
lking to them. An awful lot of the problems 
that we've been having are people don't actually understand what we really 
do and what we don't do, and some of our competitors are assisting in that 
misinformation. And so part of our core strategy is literally 
to communicate. 
This is what we're doing. We're trying to be as transparent and collaborative 
as possible. I will tell you very clearly that the regulators have a proper job 
to do. They're there for a reason and we respect that. And so far, we've 
been quit
e successful by just taking the time to get people to understand. 
And we're sensitive to the close lines. This is where we get too close to 
something and we try to stay away from that. We try to stay well within the 
safety zone of the way we're operating, 
with respect to the legal issues and 
the competitive issues. We also argue very strongly that the things that 
we're doing are very pro
-
competitive. And I genuinely believe that, and I'll 
be telling people a lot of that for a long time as expected.
 
Operator
 
Our next question will come from Imran Khan with JPMorgan.
 
Imran Khan

JP Morgan Chase & Co
 
Larry, as you become the CEO, I think it was just very interesting juncture 
of Google's life cycle. And I think there's a lot of questions that we get from 
invest
ors that the proliferation of social networking and how the traffic, more 
and more traffic source to the social networking platforms are becoming. So 
as Google get to the next level, how do you think about the realtime search 
in the social networking platf
orms that are becoming a better brand and the 
Web applications and the Mobile apps? How do you think Google will become 
the point of play and you can send traffic to other places?
 
Eric Schmidt
 
Sergey, you've been driving most of this, and maybe, Larry, you
 
could 
comment as well.
 
Sergey Brin
 
Yes. I think that you point out two important trends, I think. One is the 
notion of realtime. And the other, the broad notion of social in terms of 
identity, relationships and so forth. And I think both of those are very
 
important to search. In fact, you've seen over the past year or so us roll out 
functionality along those lines. First of all, of course, we have the realtime 
updates now built into our Search, which includes Twitter and other sources. 
You've also seen us 
to deploy social search, which allows you to find search 
results that are related to people who you know and friends of their friends 
and so forth. And you see those right in the main Search Results of the Web. 
But I think that this is really just the tip 
of the iceberg. And I think there is 
far more opportunity. We've touched just 1% of the capabilities that could 
be deployed in that realm. And I think you should expect us to continue to 
develop those kinds of capabilities.
 
Eric Schmidt
 
Larry, did you want
 
to add anything to that?
 
Larry Page
 
I mean I have the last part of what Sergey said really resonates with me. I 
think that there's 
--
 
if you think about the next five years of what your life 
will be like, online and socially, and what kind of things the t
ools would be 
able to do, we're only at the very, very early stages of that. And I'm 
incredibly excited about the possibilities to come.

Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America.
 
Justin Post

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
We've 
noticed a lot of changes on the site, moving you farther down the 
purchasing funnel. And we've heard some regulatory pushbacks, so maybe 
this is a question for you, Eric, but also potential some advertiser 
complaints. So I'm just wondering how the changes 
in your Search Ad 
results, are they really driving your revenues and helping drive the strong 
growth? And how are you dealing with the advertisers and the regulatory 
environment on some of those changes that might be replacing some of the 
functionality of 
other websites?
 
Eric Schmidt
 
There's no question that our extraordinary results are partly coming from 
algorithmic improvements that we do all the time. Our basic strategy, of 
course, is to have the right ad and the right spot done exactly right every 
time
. And we do, literally, billions of these every day. And so that's sort of 
the great magic of Google, if you will. We've looked very, very carefully at 
how we make the decisions as to which ads go where, and so forth. And 
we're pretty happy with the choice
 
that we make in terms of ranking ads, 
and so forth. There have been some competitor complaints and so forth of 
that, and we're doing a pretty thorough review. But so far, we're pretty 
happy with them, we think it will pass the necessary complaints and so 
forth 
that people are hearing.
 
So I think with that, I think we sort of run 
--
 
Patrick is saying we really run 
over our time. I really appreciate everybody sort of letting us come in and 
do this. I wanted to say to you that it's been a great privilege to b
e the CEO 
for 10 years, literally, a decade. And a decade is a long time to be a CEO. So 
I'm very much looking forward to this new role, a more strategic role in 
something where I can work on some new things, which I'm excited about. 
And I'm even more look
ing forward to working with my, literally, best friends 
and partners, Larry and Sergey. And I hope you all understand how powerful 
this triumvirate has been and how for us personally, and how much it means 
to us as individuals.
 
So thank you all and, Patric
k, do you want to sort of take over?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Absolutely. Thank you so much, Larry, Sergey, Eric, to take the time to join 
us this afternoon.
 
So with that, what we'll do is, if you don't mind muting your buttons, we're 
going to jump right into it. 
And we'll go to our more regular conversations. 
So I will start with my opening remarks and the financials, Jonathan is going 
to give us his read of the year, and then we'll be joined by Nikesh for our 
Q&A section.
 
So how else to talk about 2010 in Q4 as a
 
phenomenal ending to the very 
good year at Google? I mean, our incredibly strong performance in Q4 and 
2010 overall, is really a testimonial to the fundamental trends in a digital 
economy. Those trends, they're fueling huge opportunities for innovation, f
or 
growth, both at Google, but also in the entire ecosystem. One of these 
profound trends is the shift from advertising offline to online, and it 
continues at a quite rapid clip. And you've seen it fueling growth both in our 
core Search business but across
 
the board as well. A case in point is revenue 
growth has in our core accelerated strongly in the second half of 2010, 
which is really particularly impressive, if you think about it, given that in Q4 
2009 was itself a very strong quarter.
 
So in addition, i
nvestments in our newer businesses, the usual suspects of 
Display, Mobile, Enterprise, they are also in parallel, creating a second 
powerful growth engine for Google. Jonathan will give you more details on 
that in a minute. But at a high level, I just want
 
to make it clear that how 
can we not be happy with the overall performance and trajectories of 2010 
and on that basis, be excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond. So 
let me turn for the specifics of the performance of the quarter now.
 
Let's go thr
ough the results. Gross revenue, we grew 26% year
-
over
-
year to 
$8.4 billion. Our Google website revenue was up 28% year
-
over
-
year to 
$5.7 billion, and we saw strengths across most major geographies and 
verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 22% year
-
over
-
ye
ar to $2.5 billion, 
again, with continuous strength in our Google Display Network. Our other 
revenue was up 31% to $273 million.
 
Our global aggregate paid clicks growth was very strong, up 18% year
-
over
-
year, and up 11% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. This is really
 
reflecting, as I 
mentioned, the acceleration shift of offline to online, without a doubt, as 
each year shows there is more and more holiday shopping happening online. 
Our aggregate cost
-
per
-
click growth also was pretty healthy, up 5% year
-
over
-
year, and 4
% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And note that FX had a negative 
impact on CPC growth year
-
over
-
year, although a positive impact quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number and that 
includes the dot
-
com and AdSense properties.
 
If I turn to
 
our geographic performance, the U.S. and the rest of the world 
are both growing at a very healthy pace, and our results clearly show that, 
while the U.K. continue to lag a little bit in the global economic recovery. 
Revenue from the U.S. was up just shy o
f 30% at 29% to $4.1 billion. And 
in our earnings slides, that you can find at our investor website, you'll see 
that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show 
the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So I 
enc
ourage you to go to these slides for the exact calculations.
 
The international revenue accounted for 52% of our revenue, $4.4 billion, 
and up 25% year
-
over
-
year. And it includes $25 million of benefits from our 
hedging programs so a relatively small number
. Using fixed exchange rates 
though, our international revenue would have been roughly $132 million 
higher year
-
over
-
year. As I said, the U.K. was a little slower, and it was up 
14% year
-
over
-
year to $878 million.
 
If I turn to expenses, traffic acquisition
 
costs at $2.1 billion, or 25% of 
advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $877 million, including 
stock
-
based compensation of $45 million. And finally, all operating expenses 
totaled $2.5 billion, including approximately $351 million in stock
-
based 
compensation, SPC.
 
The increase year
-
over
-
year in OpEx was primarily due to our increases in 
payroll, advertising and promotion spend and professional services. As a 
result of all this, our non
-
GAAP operating profit, which excludes our stock
-
based compensa
tion, increased at $3.4 billion in Q4, resulting in non
-
GAAP 
operating margin of 40%.
 
Our headcount was up approximately 1,000 for the quarter. And we ended 
the year roughly at 24,400 full
-
time employees. Our effective tax rate, you 
should note, was 19% in
 
Q4, and this reflects the R&D tax credit legislation 
that passed in December in the U.S. and for which we recognized the full 
benefit in Q4.
 
Now let me turn to cash management. OI&E was $160 million for Q4, which 
reflects the continued good portfolio mana
gement performance, and it was 
offset a little bit by our FAS 133 expenses. For more detail again on OI&E, I 
just encourage you to refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR 
site.
 
Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.5 billion for the 
quarter. 
CapEx for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, I mean, obviously significantly 
above the last quarter, but remember that the majority of this increase was 
from the purchase of the New York building. The remaining balances was, as 
usual, primarily 
related to our data center and operations.
 
As a reminder, we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments and 
yet, you have another data point to show that they do tend to be lumpy 
from quarter
-
to
-
quarter depending on when we are able to make these 
in
vestments. We're very pleased with our free cash flow. Despite having 
purchased the office building in New York, right just shy of $1 billion, and 
the office building is obviously a one
-
time event.
 
So with all this being said, Google is in an excellent fin
ancial performance for 
2010, incremental revenue for the year of $5.7 billion and operating cash 
flow, around $11 billion. That is a phenomenal performance, plus, a digital 
economy that's clearly on high gear. So why 
--
 
in that context, you can 
understand 
why we're so optimistic. And it's with confidence that we're 
pursuing an aggressive growth agenda.
 
We talk about growth agenda means investing. And so here's a couple of 
places where we have decided to invest in and will continue to invest. First, 
we talke
d about the intense competition, if you remember on our last call, in 
for labor. So as part of this strategy to answer this challenge, we have 
announced a compensation change in Q4, which will affect all of our 
employees.
 
We've made two changes to attract 
and retain the best talent. First, we 
raised all base salaries by 10% across
-
the
-
board. In addition to that, we 
shifted some compensation from bonus into base salary for non
-
execs, and I 
repeat or non
-
execs, which will result for them in more stable income
 
for our 
employees. And please note that all those changes are really becoming 
effective on January 1 of this year, so they're not included into our Q4 
results. Remember also that with salary increases come ripple effects, such 
as 401(k)s or employee taxes
 
or other that will actually flow through as well.
 
So if that's for compensation, we've also made and continue to make 
strategic investments in sales and marketing for both new products but also 
advertiser acquisition. Product areas like Chrome and Chrome 
OS, which are 
such part of our future, follow our core philosophy of building these open 
platforms with big optionality and creating infrastructure where everybody 
on the Web can succeed. We'll continue to push on those but also, acquiring 
advertisers will
 
and continues to remain a top priority.
 
We're also investing in our long

term infrastructure, including both facilities 
and our core computing network. As you've seen in Q4, the purchase of New 
York City office was not only a wise investment but a clear c
ommitment to 
our New York City site and frankly, a reflection of our optimism about our 
growth prospects. Investing in innovation is also about making tough 
choices. And we've made them throughout 2010 as well by choosing to close 
products or initiatives t
hat weren't working as well as we would have liked or 
just had run their courses.
 
So for examples, we did shut down the Wave product, and we've also shut 
down our consumer channel for Nexus in 2010. And also, many other 
smaller projects that we wouldn't ta
lk usually on the call but things like 
GOOG
-
411. And yes, we're investing aggressively but with discipline. Really, 
as we mentioned in the last call, pouring a lot of resources on what we call 
our hockey sticks, with a clear focus on long
-
term ROI. And yes
, we'll 
continue to invest heavily but with the same proven discipline and results 
that you've witnessed from us over the last few years.
 
So in summary, we are incredibly pleased of our performance of 2010, 
optimistic of our trajectory for '11 and beyond. 
Accordingly, we continue to 
invest aggressively in a bold, innovation agenda. So with that, I'll turn it 
over to Jonathan to speak about the product muscles in Q4 in 2010. And 
then we'll take it over to Q&A. Jonathan, all yours?
 
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
Well, thanks, Patrick. So we certainly did have a great year at Google. And I 
really like to think some of it stems from the unique way that we manage 
our product and engineering machine. When we hire product managers, they 
often come in and they ask me, t
hey say, ""So how do we measure success 
at Google?"" And I always told them it's simple. At the end of the year, we 
make a list of all of your successes and your failures. You're then measured 
on the sum of your successes and by how much you learn from your 
failures.
 
So at the beginning of 2010, one of our concerns was that as we scaled, this 
approach might lead to our being spread too thin. Instead, we thought, 
maybe we needed to put more wood behind fewer arrows. So we made 
some changes. And I think they ad
dressed this concern without actually 
affecting the basic philosophy of how we've always run product and 
engineering at Google. So let's talk about what we changed.
 
At the beginning of the year, we decided to double down on the core, so 
that's Search and S
earch Ads, And I think the financial numbers that you 
guys are seeing today reflect the fact that, that was a successful bet. But 
behind those numbers is a really relentless stream of new features and 
product innovations. For example, we made a big effort 
this year to make 
Search more interactive, and you can see that with Google Instant. And then 
more recently, we made previews instant as well. And earlier in the year, we 
launched new user interfaces for both Web Search and Image Search to 
make it easier a
nd to make it more intuitive to work with the results after 
you run a search.
 
And we're also making Search more intelligent. We made several changes to 
results. So you now you can see things like a concert schedule, or the 
answers to the questions highligh
ted right in the snippet. And we're also now 
starting to roll out Place Search. So when we know that you're looking for 
something that's in the neighborhood like an ice cream shop or something, 
we'll pull reviews, webpages, the address and the photo, altog
ether for you.
 
We also doubled down on the Ad side of the house. In the past year, we've 
launched several new ad formats, which we've told you about, Sitelinks, 
seller rating ads. Recently, we just added this product listing ads with photos 
and prices. It 
makes sense that if I'm shopping for something like a coffee 
maker, it's helpful to see more information in the ad. But the biggest boost 
of all came from good old
-
fashioned ads quality improvements. Q4 was our 
best quarter in years from a quality standpoi
nt. We launched over 20 
updates, which led to gains that were nearly double those that we would 
normally see in a strong quarter. So although we've been at this for years, 
we're still finding lots and lots of ways to make ads better.
 
The other change in 20
10 was that several of our new businesses started to 
achieve escape velocity. And our philosophy is to encourage lots of 
innovation, and then we see feed the winners and starve the losers. And this 
creates kind of a Darwinian, but sort of Google
-
y, environ
ment in which new 
businesses emerge and grow. And in 2010, it's really clear that some new 
winners started to emerge, like Display. We now have over 2 million 
publisher partners. The number of transactions on the DoubleClick Ad 
Exchange tripled, and publis
hers who sell their ad space via the Exchange 
are nearly tripling their revenue when the Exchange wins the auction.
 
YouTube revenue more than doubled. We began adding features like live 
streaming to help partners deliver and ultimately, of course, to monet
ize 
content in new ways. Enterprise added impressive customers like the U.S. 
government's General Services Administration. And we expanded 
distribution with partnerships like the deal with Softbank in Japan. Android, 
now activating over 300,000 phones per 
day. This helped drive a 10x year
-
over
-
year increase in the volume of searches from Android devices.
 
Then finally, in 2010, I think we we're more structured in our approach to 
our business. The product and sales teams are working together more 
closely than
 
ever, thanks in large part to my buddy here, Nikesh. Patrick's 
rigor helped us dynamically reallocate resources and as he mentioned, 
cancel a few projects like Wave and Nexus One direct to consumer that 
weren't achieving their goals.
 
So what does all thes
e mean for 2011. I think you can expect more of the 
same. We're going to double down again on the core of Search and Search 
Ads. We're going to feed the 2010 winners, Display, YouTube, Enterprise and 
Android, and we're going to do it all with even greater 
financial rigor and 
cross
-
functional coordination all over the world.
 
But I'm also excited about the prospect for a couple of our newest 
businesses, Local and Commerce. In Local, over 5 million businesses have 
claimed their Google place pages. And we recen
tly started testing a new ad 
product, which we called Boost, and that gives businesses a really easy and 
fast way to promote themselves online and to connect with the people who 
are searching for them.
 
In Commerce, we're investing a lot to close the loop f
rom online to offline 
shopping. I think I've mentioned on four different earnings calls in the past 
couple of years, the key to unlocking mobile commerce was to make it 
easier for people to both search and then to consummate their transaction 
from their mo
bile device. Someone in my team actually counted back on the 
calls and it was four times. I think as smartphones become ubiquitous and 
local businesses put their inventory online, I think this is the year where 
phones will play the big role in commerce tha
t I've long predicted.
 
There will be some important differences in 2011. We will invest in hiring 
even more product managers and engineers. We're going to give them 
greater autonomy, and we're going to push them to work faster. In fact, 
we're asking everyo
ne here to do more and to do it faster.
 
Through the year, we'll tally our successes. I'm sure you all will probably 
remind us of any failures, so we can keep learning from them. I hope you all 
now better understand our sense of optimism from a product pers
pective for 
2011. I'm confident you guys will help us keep track of how this year's 
product efforts play out on the important score card of financial progress.
 
Thanks a lot and back to Patrick

Jonathan, I wanted to ask you question about Mobile, and specifically how 
Google thinks about the differences between tablet users and smartphone 
users, and how those differences are really influencing the high
-
level view of 
how you'r
e viewing the overall evolving mobile market. And then Patrick, if 
you could address the sales and marketing line, which I think was somewhat 
unexpectedly high.
 
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
Sure, Ben, we can take that in order. I'll go with the first question. I thi
nk 
it's probably easier to talk about initially how tablets and smartphones are 
similar, right? Both of them are growing at a terrific pace. As is the case of 
Mobile, what we see on these devices is that search usage on the tablets 
tends to peak on the wee
kend and it dips on the weekdays, so it's generally 
complementary to desktop, which we've talked about before. What does that 
suggest? Maybe, the people are using them more for personal usage as 
opposed to business. We do see on tablets the weekend peak is
 
a little bit 
more pronounced than it is on phones. I think that's probably the case 
because people pretty much always carry their smartphone during the week. 
Some of the bigger differences, the tablet users tend to search more for 
things like news and the
y tend to do more shopping
-
related topics when you 
compare them to smartphone users. I think there's some anecdotal data 
that they may convert better, but I haven't actually been through all of that 
in detail. I tend to think that the tablets behave a litt
le bit more like desktop 
devices than do smartphones because it's a little easier to input information 
into them like a credit card. I think the other major difference is the UI 
approaches are different, right? Apps, like the Gmail App for the tablet, is 
m
ore designed for the big screen. So I think they're both taking off, and the 
revenue from tablets as well as smartphones reflects that. Patrick?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
All right, I'll take the second question. If there is a good proof that we just 
don't kind of 
like streamline our lines in terms of expenses, but we go 
opportunistically and in a smart move, I think sales and marketing is a great 
example of that. And if you think of the last 12 months, what we've clearly 
shown is how much in high gear is the digita
l economy. And when that 
opportunity shows up, right, we just needed to jump on it and decide to fuel 
it. And on the marketing side, and even on sales, I mean Nikesh 
--
 
I'll 
actually ask Nikesh to give you a bit of color on the sales side. But on the 
marke
ting side, when you have big platforms like Chrome and Chrome OS, 
that can and will be incredibly successful if promoted. Why wouldn't you do 
it now? I hear from the financial community, the other side, which is what 
are you doing with your money? Well, we
 
have great opportunities, why 
wouldn't we jump on it with this kind of market? And on the sales side, 
Nikesh, you could probably give a color commentary as well.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. I think what is important for you to understand, we 
decided 
to put our sort of foot to the pedal later in this year. And there was 
an area of our customer that advertises we decided to continue to put more 
focus on which is the small to medium
-
sized advertisers because where 
that's where a lot of our growth engine 
is going to come form in the future. 
And effectively, a lot of the sales costs there are advertiser acquisition's 
costs because once you bring them into our system, they stay there for a 
while. And they continue to work and continue to generate more revenu
es. 
And some of the revenue performance you're seeing has been across the 
small channels or the mid
-
tier channels, and that investment is sort of 
already beginning to bear fruit.

Citigroup Inc
 
If I can ask a question on the local advertising play and it's sounds like 
you've got a couple of products you've been working on, rolling out for a 
while, and I think you also may have attempted an acquisition inter
-
quarter. 
Can yo
u maybe quantify the opportunity for us, is this something that has 
always been part of the build up plan? Is there something you saw in the 
last 12 months that really indicated that this was the time to accelerate the 
efforts against local advertising? An
d then, do you already feel like you got 
all the assets now in place, or are you still going to look for more assets in 
order to have that play viable?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Let me just 
--
 
as a preamble, all right, we do not talk about M&A. Local has 
always bee
n part of our strategy. And Nikesh can talk about the initiatives, 
or just about the initiatives we're doing there in terms of the boost in the 
products that we have, or maybe Jonathan, the boost product. And just it's 
one more of the initiatives we have i
n local. But local is, just to kind of give 
you a sense of framework, right? It's one out of every five searches have 
some form of local kind of tendency or factor. So it's not kind of side event 
for us. Jonathan?
 
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
Sure, Mark. I mean, I t
hink we've been very focused on Local since, wow, 
going all the way back to maybe my second year when we acquired Keyhole 
here with the Google, which was basically the original company that built 
Google Earth. And really, the idea was that ultimately the W
eb should be 
this virtual mirror of the world at all times. And that mirror of the world 
becomes much more useful. And when it's more relevant 
--
 
and it's more 
relevant to the users when you get everything organized around places in 
the physical world. And
 
I think the other thing which has come into play 
more recently is that technology has made it possible through the use of 
GPS and smartphones for us to understand where you are. And so I think 
what we've recognized more recently is that because smartphone
s have 
become deployed more aggressively, that we can supply you with relevant 
information about the places that you're near with the appropriate 
contextual
-
oriented search. So if you're at a restaurant, you want to pull up 
a menu, you don't want just the 
menu that the waiter handed you, you want 
the one in there that has the reviews and the picks from your friends. So I 
think what's basically changed over the course of the last year is it's become 
easier for local businesses to identify themselves in conte
xt on Google, and 
it's become easier for us to find out where you are. And then, of course, 
we've mapped that with Nikesh's team, which is working on selling Boost 
and Tags and some of the other ad formats that we've developed specifically 
for Local.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.
 
Douglas Anmuth

Barclays Capital
 
Patrick, can you talk a little bit more about your philosophy just around the 
New York headquarters? I think this is the first time where you've actually 
really come out and confirmed the purchase. And why do you need to own 
the New York headquarters rather than sort of getting access to it in some 
other way, and why is this a good use of capital? And then secondly, can you 
just talk, just following up on L
ocal, discuss whether you really are building 
out more of a local salesforce in addition to obviously, the local products 
themselves?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I'll take the first, and then I'll let Nikesh about the initiatives we're doing on 
the Local side. Look, 
we have 2,000 employees on site today in New York. 
And our business and our engineering center, it's a big engineering center, 
by the way, it's not only a big kind of sales center but it's a big engineering 
center. So if you think of the eastern hub being 
in that place, with 2,000 and 
growing at the pace at which we're growing, it's actually very difficult to find 
in New York, a place that would accommodate that number of employees in 
an environment that fits Google's standards and Google's needs. We do not
 
-
-
 
I mean, we actually believe that living in a tower where there's a very 
small footprint on the floor to floor is terrible for the Google culture. So 
there's very few buildings in New York that actually can accommodate our 
needs, right? Replacing that b
uilding for us or moving out of there would 
actually be probably very difficult to find another place and then be 
prohibitively expensive. And then finally, it gives us a lot of control over 
growing into that space. So all this to say on top of what we bel
ieve will be 
is a very good investment. So for all these reasons, coming back to the 
previous, it's not about carrier hotel owning. Everything is about the Google
-
iness. So for all of these reasons, I think it did make sense. And we called it 
a one
-
time it
em because it just fitted so well our strategy. For the Local 
salesforce, I'll turn it to Nikesh to give you a bit more details on our strategy 
there.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think there's more to understand that Local, the way you define that 
actually ends up in t
hree different interpretations. One is we've always had 
local features to our adverse products. You can always localized to your 
advertising towards users who are in a certain area, certain territory. So you 
always have the ability to localize. The other t
hing we've done in Local is the 
way I think local is sometimes synonymous with smaller advertisers and 
smaller territories. And towards that end, we have created the most 
simplistic set of products around Tags and Boost, which is more amenable to 
the adver
tisers. They don't have to do a lot of work. Sometimes they don't 
even have their own websites. And that allows them to still participate in the 
online economy. And third, we, for the longest of times, had partnerships 
with other companies who've been sell
ing advertising on our behalf to 
smaller advertisers, be it in small local areas, or we've been using other 
partners who will use their salesforce to call on smaller advertisers for us. So 
we are going to use a combination of all of these three efforts to 
continue to 
pursue our Local strategy going forward.

UBS Investment Bank
 
Patrick, would you give us a rough organic revenue growth rate, excluding 
acquisitions? And then secondly, a qu
estion on Ads, are you guys seeing any 
competitive share shifts in dollars from Search or Display towards other 
social platforms or applications?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So on the second one, I'll let Nikesh give you a sense. On first one, I don't 
have the breakd
own and we don't provide the breakdown. But I can tell you 
that all of our core properties are growing very well, and not only our core 
properties but also our new growth businesses as well. When you look at the 
numbers for just the google.com growing year
-
over
-
year, 28%, right? How 
can you not be happy with that kind of performance? And so overall, we're 
very pleased with our growth rate of revenue. I'll let Nikesh talk about the 
second piece.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think it's important to understand that Search f
or the longest of times had 
been performance advertising. And so has the large chunk of Display, it's 
been performance advertising. Some of the newer players you're talking 
about are sort of playing the brand display space. So overall if you look at it, 
th
e stronger trend is shift of brand dollars from the offline world into the 
online world and continue of shift to some of those dollars, of sales and 
marketing dollars, into performance
-
based advertising. So we're seeing that 
shift both on our Search side. 
We're seeing that shift both on our Display 
side and also, seeing some brand dollars in the Search side and some brand 
dollars in Display side. So I think it's more than fair to say that right now, 
the bigger trend is the shift from offline to online. And 
there has been less of 
an allocation shift within the online world because all these measures, all 
these means are measurable, and you're seeing better ROI for these 
measurable events in both in the performance Display, performance Search. 
So that's where 
the trend is.

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.
 
Ross Sandler

RBC Capital Markets, LLC
 
Patrick, a question on the Display business. If you look out and analyze the 
financial statements for just about any 
publicly traded ad network out there, 
these businesses seem to peak out, and the operating margin seem to peak 
out in the 20% to 25% range, do you think there's anything structurally 
different about Google's approach in the Display business that could allo
w 
Google to achieve higher operating margins? Or is it that just the peak for 
that kind of business model? And then, Nikesh, just the quick question on 
the ROW acceleration. So 31% year
-
over
-
year, can you talk a little bit about 
which regions that's coming
 
from, or is it across the board? And is there any 
acceleration from new revenue areas like Display or is it just the core Search 
business?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
The fundamental 
--
 
on the first one, let me answer the Display and then I'll 
let Nikesh talk 
about the performance worldwide. I think in Display, the most 
fundamental issue is if you're on your own network or if you're optimizing for 
other's network and participating in other's network. So if you think of 
YouTube, it's our own property. And theref
ore, you have a completely 
different set of economics. And so you just got to make sure you don't 
compare apples and oranges. So one, obviously, has a much higher margin 
than the other, and the question then is the mix. So if you think of us in 
Display whe
re we have the whole suite of services from what used to be 
Teracent and all the other pieces, then you have the mix of properties. And 
that's how you have to think about it. In terms of geographic split and 
performance, it's a fantastic story, so why not 
let Nikesh give you the color 
commentary on it.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Just before this, adding to what Patrick said on the Display side, I think it's 
also important to understand the contribution of the Ad Exchange, which 
basically allows you to bring buyers and se
llers together. And we are seeing 
a serious uplift for people who are participating on the Ad Exchange in terms 
of revenue. So whilst your traditional Display business, you might be seeing 
margins profiles are different and I can't predict the future margi
n profiles 
but clearly, there's an uplift and a benefit to advertisers who participate in 
the Exchange or publishers who participate in the Exchange. So that's also 
beneficial...
 
Patrick Pichette
 
To tell it differently, we have three resources in that beca
use you have the 
Ad Exchange on top of that.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
So in terms of the sort of rest of the world performance, I think there are 
some things which are notable this quarter in addition to our usual stalwarts 
where the U.S. continues to be strong and th
e rest of the world is strong. 
Germany has maintained its strength because of its economic development, 
which has been different from the rest of Europe, so that has showed up in 
our results as well. I am very particularly excited about some of the 
turnaro
und we've achieved in Japan because we've been putting in a 
considerate effort over the last many months to try and put an aggressive 
foot out in the marketplace in terms of bringing in more partners, more 
advertisers and generally, upgrading the entire ef
fort in Japan from our side, 
so we are seeing the results of that. In addition to that, some of the 
commodity markets, markets where the commodities are strong, are Brazil, 
Australia. So those have been strong in general. The U.K. continues to be 
weak, as 
you notice, but it is very strong market for us, it's a big market for 
us as well.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
In closing on that topic, I think it's worth noting if you do your financial math 
and you move rest of world into constant FX, so if you take out the fact t
hat 
we had crosswinds over year

over

Scott Devitt

Morgan Stanley
 
Paid click growth on a percentage basis was the highest rate in two years, 
and you mentioned a few things on the call, better ads, better targeting, 
even local monetization. And I was just wondering to what extent some 
othe
r factors came into play as well, particularly Google Instant and the 
rollout of that product, as well as the incremental nature of smartphone and 
tablet queries.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So I think that for paid click growth, that you really have to look at a cou
ple 
of factors. And I just want to start by kind of debunking a myth on Google 
Instant, right? Everybody seems to have 
--
 
there's kind of a buzz out there 
that Google Instant is the driver for a lot of the revenue growth. And in fact, 
Google Instant is neu
tral. It is not making any significant contribution to our 
revenue growth. What's really making the contribution is that there's really 
-
-
 
our growth is driven by three interdependent drivers that are all acting and 
tooling together. One is, clearly, the s
trength of the economic recovery and 
the consumer shift online. And you can look 
--
 
ever since Thanksgiving, and 
you've seen it from external sources as well, people have moved online. 
They're spending a lot of time shopping online, looking for coupons. So
 
the 
behavior is strong economic recovery, which brings a lot more auction into 
these 
--
 
a lot more participants into the auctions because they want to be 
where the users are. In addition to that, right you have a second 
compounding factor pounding on it w
hich is platforms are changing, right? 
The use of mobile phones, iPads, Instant Search tool, but also GEO, the fact 
that you get instant location, you can get coupons, all these things, right, 
just from a platform perspective are driving it on top of it. A
nd then finally, 
right, it is true that Jonathan's teams fantastic job at making great ads 
tuning and monetization like the VizURL, and Jonathan you may want to 
take a second to talk about VizURL. It's those factors that are really driving 
the CPC growth a
nd the click through rate growth rather than instant search. 
So I just want to be clear because I know there's a rumor on the street 
running that it's all about Instant search. And Instant search is about the 
user. It's people spending 10% faster, that is 
a huge number, 10%. And 
that's why we did Instant search. So maybe VizURL is a good example that 
you want to talk about, Jonathan?
 
Jonathan Rosenberg
 
Sure. I guess other than the ads quality improvements, which I can cover in 
a second, I think the only oth
er area that Patrick didn't cover would basically 
just be the new ad formats, all of which are boosting click through rates. 
And I mentioned those in my prepared remarks, the product listing ads, 
more recently, offer ads, coupon
-
based ads. The seller ratin
gs, which we've 
also launched, have significant impact in click through rates as well as the 
Sitelinks. But I think that probably the most significant thing in terms of 
what impacted the whole ads area this quarter was this concept that we call 
Visible URL
. And basically, what we did was on the top ads, we moved the 
advertiser's URL down to its own separate line below the creative rather than 
having it be part of the creative. And that obviously makes it easier for 
people to see where they will go as they c
lick. It's actually a little bit of an 
interesting story. I'll give you some of the background because this is by far 
the most significant change that we had from ads quality perspective in a 
very long time. It turned out early in the quarter, some of the 
engineers in 
Japan noticed that it was really hard to read the creative because we 
actually had the ads URL, which was in Latin characters, mixed in with the 
ad creative which was in Kanji. And it didn't really take brilliant research to 
figure out that hu
man perception gets really confused when characters 
switch like that in the middle of a sentence. People just sort of skip the 
whole sentence. And if they skip something, that's sort of really bad when 
that sentence is a text ad. So we ran this experiment 
in Japan and we 
moved the URL down to its own line, and click through rates went up 
dramatically. So we launched that feature pretty expeditiously in, I think, 
Japan, China, Korea and Russia. And then what happened is the engineers 
kind of said ""Well, hey,
 
just for fun, let's try that in the rest of the world. "" 
And we actually didn't expect so much because we didn't have the same 
dynamic of Latin characters versus Kanji, but it turned out that people skip 
sentences with long, unusual words in it. So people
 
were tuning out that 
line. And we quickly launched this feature globally. It was one of the fastest 
things that we ever launched after the ads testing. I believe we launched it 
right around Thanksgiving. And that had a very significant change in the 
click
s that we saw in the course of the quarter.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So just to close on that, just to kind of say, it is, and I know that Jonathan 
has used that trumpet a number of times in the past, but just continues to 
illustrate how much more innovation there
 
is left in both formats and in just 
all the things that we do in terms of innovation in the ad space.

Our next question comes from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.

If we look at your kind of a revenue line from a k
ind of customer base 
standpoint, whether it's Fortune 500 or Ad Age 100 versus Internet pureplay 
indemics, and then the small to medium
-
size business category, I guess the 
SMB category was weaker during the credit crisis and you had a hard time 
coming back
, I'm curious as to your thoughts as to how it's coming back 
today. And do you think there is a different way of approaching that SMB 
market as you look ahead into this year and going forward in terms of 
products or maybe ways to help drive leads or sales 
in that segment of the 
market?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I'll let Nikesh answer the question. Just one point of clarification on your 
statement though and during the recession a couple of years ago, I think 
you mentioned that we thought that SMBs were kind of going
 
down. And in 
fact, Nikesh will clarify, they were going the other way. So Nikesh, I'll leave 
it to you to answer the question.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think the important thing to understand is we're seeing such a 
disproportionate amount of strengths from the very
 
large advertisers across 
the board because effectively what's happened over the years is that they've 
gone out and really strength their e
-
commerce offerings, they've gotten 
their act together, they've got all the logistics in place. And given that this 
w
as the quarter of Christmas and Thanksgiving, you saw a tremendous 
amount of strengths from large advertisers wanting to play against the 
pureplay Internet players. Now in addition to that, what has also happened 
is we've put an effort over the last six mo
nths on the SMB and mid
-
market 
side. In the mid
-
market side, we've basically gone ahead and adopted a 
higher touch strategy. I even spend more time on the phone with our 
customers. We even go and visit some of our mid
-
tier customers because to 
be fair over
 
the years, they have grown to be larger mid
-
tier customers than 
they used to be in the past. So we have put in sort of a conscious higher 
touch strategy. And last but not the least, for the smaller advertisers, we are 
working very closely with our product
 
team and Jonathan and his team to try 
and look at various systemic and algorithmic improvements we can make, 
working with them in large direct marketing campaigns and where we can 
continue to sort of reduce churn to that the area and continue to acquire 
m
ore, which is related to the other comment on slightly higher sales 
spending on trying to acquire smaller advertisers. So we have efforts across 
the board, across all three categories. We don't think that effort is done and 
fully over with.

Deutsche Bank AG
 
Do you think the business model or pricing model has to be different there, 
whether it's percentage of sale or some other kind of approach to going after 
the spend in that segment?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
No, I think to be fair, if you look at the simplifications we have done on the 
ad work side and local products, which is another way of thinking about 
smaller advertisers, that is a way to create a simpler product for them where 
they don't have to put in a
 
lot more effort or we have things like keyword
-
less ads where they don't have to go ahead and sort of work towards 
creating keywords or will work. On the Display side, we've got contextual 
targeting where you can create ad groups very, very quickly. So we
 
may 
continue to make product improvements which allow things to become more 
and more simple so advertisers can sort of go and do their daily business as 
opposed to spend time understanding more complicated stuff on our side. So 
yes, you're right, they are
 
different, simpler products we create for them, 
which have slightly different pricing, so that they can continue to participate 
in the online economy.

I had a question just on the Mobile business. Last quarter, obviously, you 
saw some increased momentum. I'm curious just from a pricing perspective, 
what you're starting to see from the advertisers? And what kind of progress 
did you se
e over the last 90 days? And maybe more importantly, as NFC 
starts to become more prevalent in smartphones, I mean how do you think 
that changes the dynamic in terms of what type of effective monetization 
you're going to see from the Local Commerce side?
 
P
atrick Pichette
 
So let me give you just a few starts to kind of continue to keep the contacts, 
right? Mobile search grew 4x on Mobile devices for web browsers in the last 
year. So there is no doubt that this market is just absolutely cranking. And 
there's 
a lot of work, and I'll let Jonathan talk about it, about ad formats are 
still kind of nascent and building, both on the Display side and on the regular 
side, and we see a lot of upside. Jonathan, you probably want to kind of 
cover those.
 
Jonathan Rosenber
g
 
Yes. We don't really actually break out the details in terms of the exact 
difference. It's certainly the Click
-
to
-
Call ads are generating millions of calls 
every month. A lot of advertisers are running these campaigns. I think one 
you can see if you trie
d is DirectTV. We did launch a call
-
only option where 
the only clickable link in the ad is actually a phone number, which not 
surprisingly substantially increases the click through rates on mobile devices. 
And we've extended some of the desktop formats pre
tty successfully to 
Mobile. Sitelinks is one. If you try a query on Oakley, you'll see one, if you 
seller ratings on something like running shoes. So I think there's a lot more 
to learn there, but the advertisers are very excited and engaged. At the 
moment
, I don't have any specific comments on NFC other than to go back 
to the statements that I've made in previous calls, which is when people are 
completing transactions with these devices, it becomes much more tractable 
and obviously significantly more valua
ble.

Our last question comes from Steve Weinstein with Pacific Crest.
 
Steve Weinstein

Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.
 
First, you commented that you're going to be shifting more compensation to 
base pay from bonus. I was wondering if you could let
 
us know what the 
ratio had been historically as far as those two components of comp? And 
finally, obviously, the acceleration of all the metrics is pretty exciting, pretty 
positive for the outlook. I was wondering if you could help us understand 
though ho
w much acceleration is happening within the core business? And 
how much of the acceleration is maybe some of the newer businesses really 
starting to get some scale, and maybe tipping the overall momentum in the 
business?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
On compensation fi
rst, as I said, we raised all salaries. So if you think of 
kind of financial modeling for a second, all salaries had been raised 10% 
across
-
the
-
board, January 1. And that has a ripple effect on 
--
 
the kind of 
ripple effect of the employee taxes, 401(k)s an
d all the rest of the benefits. 
It will also impact, obviously, everybody that we bring on this year as well. 
So as we bring in new people, they are costing us now slightly more. In 
addition to that, what we've done is part of the bonus is kind of calculat
ed 
without giving you the exact number. We had two components to our annual 
bonus. One, which is a company multiplier, and one which is an individual 
multiplier. And what we've done for the non
-
execs, because we want execs 
to actually continue to be treate
d differently, the non
-
execs are treated in 
that what used to be a company multiplier, which didn't really have a lot of 
influence on, we shifted over to base pay. And their individual multiplier 
component of the bonus continues to be a very kind of direct
ly involved into 
their calculation of their personal bonus. So by shifting that company 
multiplier we didn't have a lot of influence on, right, it just moves into more 
predictable cash flows for them all through the year rather than waiting for 
the end of 
the year, and that was the rationale for doing it. In terms of 
revenue growth, I mean, last quarter, we gave kind of two syndication 
points on Display, on Mobile, right? We've talked about the fact that our core 
--
 
if you look at our Enterprise Business, 3
0 million users, 3 million 
businesses on apps, the kind of magnitude of numbers we're talking about in 
each of our growth areas, whether it be Mobile, whether it be Android, 
whether it be YouTube, where we continue to have YouTube, right. I mean 
to give yo
u a snippet, YouTube's revenue more than doubled in 2010, right? 
So that's why we're optimistic across
-
the
-
board, and that's why we're very 
kind of open about the fact that when you have such a digital economy 
running in high gear, why don't you take the o
pportunity to invest at the 
time where it is actually transforming itself. And that's what we're doing, and 
we're delighted in fact to continue to push hard on that. And that's what you 
see also in sales and marketing.
 
With that 
--
 
let me reiterate, so I p
robably hope I got your attention back 
because the front end of this conversation got totally sideswiped by the big 
three, you guys showing up and taking over our seats and phones, but 
phenomenal year end to what has been a terrific year. I have to thank a
ll of 
our Googlers. They do an amazing job every day. It looks easy when I show 
up with Jonathan and Nikesh and talking about these fantastic results, but 
our Googlers do an amazing job all around the world, and so does our 
partners. And so to them, thank 
you so much for your fantastic efforts in 
2010, and we'll just set up for a fantastic 2011 again. With that, I'll let Jay 
close the call.

Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you,
 
Willa, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. 
So, well, this is a special call as we enter into a new chapter in our history at 
Google here with our recent acquisition of Motorola, and with it comes a new 
set of financial information for a
ll you both at a consolidated, but also at the 
segment level.
 

transaction, we can expect this specific segment of our financials to continue 
to show some accounting variability. 

period, so meaning it only reflects the results since the acquisition dates 
rather than the full quarter. And as a result of the close, we did a number of 

ll try to do our 
best to answer your questions on this call. And our investor relations team 
will also continue to support the analyst and the investor community during 
this transition.
 

ed 
reporting for both Google and Motorola.
 
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 35% year
-
over
-
year to $12.2 
billion and 15% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. So again, please remember that these 
total consolidated numbers include the stub period for Motorola. Add
itionally, 
there was a significant year
-
over
-
year currency headwind in Q2. In fixed FX, 
revenue would have grown to 39% year
-
over
-
year instead of 35%.
 
Google on a standalone gross revenue grew 21% year
-
over
-
year to $11 
billion and 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. 
Our Google website revenue was up 
21% year
-
over
-
year to $7.5 billion and 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, which 
trends across most major geographies and verticals.
 
Google network revenue grew 20% year
-
over
-
year to $3 billion, and 2% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our other
 
revenue line grew by 42% year
-
over
-
year to 
$439 million and 5% quarter
-
over
-

fixed FX our revenue would have grown 25% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Motorola grew revenue for the stub period since May 22 at $1.3 billion. Our 
mobi
le devices revenue for that period was $843 million, encouraged by the 
strength of the North American Verizon franchise driven by the RAZR MAXX 

declining international sales of feature
 
phones and mid
-
tier smartphones; 
the home business, revenue was $407 million.
 
So the core metrics of Google standalone business continue to perform very 
well against the backdrop of a somewhat difficult global economic 
environment. Our global aggregate pa
id
-
click growth was very strong, up 
42% year
-
over
-
year, and also up 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our aggregate 
cost
-
per
-
click growth was down 16% year
-
over
-
year, and up 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And please remember that the currency headwinds also 
obviously had
 
a quite negative impact on the CPCs in Q2.
 
Turning to geographic performance of Google standalone business, U.S., UK 
and rest of world are growing at a good pace as reflected in our results. In 



show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please 
refer to those slides for those exact calculation.
 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year
-
ov
er
-
year to $5 billion. Our non
-
U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $6 billion, and was 
up 22% year
-
over
-
year, which includes $81 million benefit from our hedging 
program. The UK was up 20% year
-
over
-
year to $1.2 billion, and then fixed 
F
X term; in fact the UK grew 22%.
 
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business; other 
cost of revenue was $2.3 billion in Q2. Our non
-
GAAP operating expenses 
totaled $3.3 billion, which excludes stock
-
based compensation and charges 
related to the severance and benefit arrangements in connection with the 
Motorola acquisition of $652 million. Our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $4 
billion in Q2, resulting in non
-
GAAP operating margin of 32.3%.
 
For standalone Google, our traffic acquisiti
on costs were $2.6 billion or 
24.7% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.3 
billion, and that's excluding SBC of $82 million. Our non
-
GAAP operating 
expenses were $3.1 billion, also excluding SBC of $470 million.
 
Finally, non
-
GAAP 
operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin of 36.4%. This continued strong margin in our 
standalone Google business segment gives us the confidence to continue to 
fully fund our many strategic growth areas, such as mobi
le, Android, 
YouTube and Chrome. Obviously, Susan and Nikesh will go into more details 
of our initiatives in a minute.
 
At Motorola, our non
-
GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue for 
the stub period were $1.3 billion. And keep in mind that, inta
ngible 
amortization of expenses and the step
-
up cost attributed to standalone 
Google and Motorola are included in these non
-
GAAP measures. And as a 
result, the non
-
GAAP operating loss at Motorola was minus $38 million in Q2 
resulting in a non
-
GAAP operatin
g margin of minus 3% for that specific 
segment.
 
Headcount increased roughly 21,500 in Q2, obviously Google itself added 
about 1200, while the remainder of this number includes the Motorola 
employees who joined in the acquisition. In total, the consolidated
 
company 
ended the quarter at around 54,600 employees, full
-
time employees status.
 
Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q2, and that reflects not only the mix of 
our earnings between domestic, international subsidiaries and our hedges, 
but also capital gains 
offset by carried over capital losses.
 
Let me quickly turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was 
$254 million for the quarter, which reflects gains related to a divestiture of a 
business, offset somewhat by lower interest income and by the 
impact of our 
FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details [underway 
any], please again refer to the slides of the company or call on our IR 
website. Operating cash flow was very strong at $4.3 billion for the second 
quarter. CapEx for the q
uarter was $774 million versus last quarter at $607 
million. The majority of our CapEx was spent really related to production 
equipment, facilities, and man purchases. And obviously, we're pleased with 
our free cash flow, which was $3.5 billion.
 
So now, le
t me hand it over to Nikesh, who will cover more the details of our 
business performance in the quarter, then Susan will cover our product 

please note that Nikesh and Susan will 
discuss only the standalone Google 
business and not cover Motorola.
 
So let me turn it over to Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick, and hello everyone. Our business had a very strong 

 
talk 
about three broad themes today. First, how our recent big bets in the ad 
business are coming together into integrated platforms. I think digital 
advertising is really in defrag mode.
 

 
and 
search advertising adds quality by helping our search business accelerate. 


driving success for our cu
stomers and some marketing highlights.
 
So first, our big bets. In about four years, DoubleClick has gone from 
strength to strength at Google. Now it is the foundation of our display 
business. this quarter, we announced DoubleClick digital marketing, the fi
rst 
modern ad platform for the modern digital world. This was the biggest ever 
overall for DoubleClick ad platform. It is used by thousands of agencies and 
marketers and we managed billions in marketing spend across the world on 
this platform. It now spans
 
the best of display, rich media, exchange buying, 
surge and measurement.
 
Some of our recent display acquisitions, Teracent and Invite Media, which

For brands, this quarter we unveiled the Brand Activate initiative
. As seas of 
measurement and planning solutions baked directly into our platform, with 
our partners are building an online measurement for GRPs or gross rating 
points in a way to measure viewable impressions. Effectively what we want

Another big bet as part of our integrated solutions i
s YouTube. I think in 
2007 it was when newspapers frequently said YouTube is groping for an 
effective business model. I think we can declare we found our model. 
YouTube now unites the world through video from the Human Rights channel 
launched this quarter 
to a (inaudible) study confirming YouTube as a major 

live streaming of the Olympics in the U.S. while also live streaming the 
games in London to 64 territories around the world.

uploading over 72 hours of video every minute. This quarter we released a 
new YouTube app for Android helping users to find videos and follow 
channels from a mobile or tablet devices. We belie

proven winner for the whole video ecosystem. Thousands of partners are 

Hollywood studios on this platform.
 
In fact, earlier in May, we saw an incredible digital upfr

highlighting our YouTube programming partners. Slightly over 13,000 clients

digital media and new se

The amount of effort our product engineering teams put into the quality and 
precision for ads, that just keeps getting better. This quarter made 72

advertisers, effectively what results it improves the relevance of our add and 
making it more useful to consumers, it drives better results for our partners, 
clients and advertisers and it helps i

Imagine if every single search ad was a perfect answer that drove the

In Q2, our improvements included better triggering of site links and ads and
 
improved ad rotation system, better geographical targeting, expanded 
match for keyword variance and a whole host of other improvements. As an 
example of benefits of these changes, the advertisers taking advantages of 
new close variance feature and exact a

roughly a 2% increase in clicks in average.
 


small, but growing business, which 
is going to be a future growth engine for 
Google. I hope you read this week about a company, who said competition 
was 50% more expensive than Google, and not as cool. That company is 
now $200,000 a year Google apps customer.
 
Companies, schools, governments

performance accelerated in non

Europe driven by the UK.
 
Our clients span a full range of industries that are making the web work for 
their business. Let's take a few examples. Take the hotel and travel sector; 
in France
, we work with (inaudible) to revamp and improve the search 
investment allocation across 23 countries. In Denmark, top travel site, 
(inaudible) shifted some of their TV budgets to YouTube and other Google 
branding solutions.
 

our achievements in the automotive sector 
from Detroit to Bavaria. This quarter's highlights included a contract with 
Tesla, and a (inaudible) deal with Audi to embed Google Earth in all of their 
cars. In Canada, we partnered with Ford around online video 
content and GM 
and Toyota is investing significantly in YouTube.
 
Switching gears to our agency partners, they are leading the charge in the 
digital era. I think we have the best relationships with agencies around the 

e are being able to more those 
relationships to real partnerships that allows them to work with their 
customers to make the web work for them.
 

Starcom MediaVest Group to develop a 
global joint account planning project 
across 50 top accounts. We lunched a digital training curriculum, covering 

people.
 
(Inaudible) sectors are good examples, but our partnerships perm
it all the 
industries and across all countries. Spanish Health Insurance, Sanitas, made 
a major investment in search, and now that's become our most efficient 
channel from customer acquisition online accounting for about 25% to 30% 
of their new customers.
 
In France, Denon is working with us on a global initiative across our display

his family and his school from Googlers all around the world, and thanks to 
all the Googlers that allowed us to 
have such a wonderful quarter.
 

 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Thanks, Nikesh. We also had a busy and productive second quarter for all of 
our consumer products. Let me start with Search.
 
Our goal is to deliver technology that just works
. Larry has described the 
perfect search engine as something that understands exactly what you mean 

intelligent search, thanks to the Knowledge Graph which understands real 
world thing
, their defining characteristics and their connections to one 
another.
 
Our Knowledge Graph currently includes more than 500 million thing, people 
and places, more than 3.5 billion facts about them. This includes entities like 
landmarks, celebrities, sport 
team, works of art and a lot more. For a 
summarizing related content all at one place people not only find what 

 
For example, I was checking [films] this weekend, so I searched for the 
movie The Dark Knig

showed up on the right hand side of my search results, I was able to find out 
that the movie is coming on tomorrow, some information about the film and 

 
the actors, I clicked on 
the photos displayed and I was able to see biographical information as well 

 
The Knowledge Graph results also should need related movies that other 
people have searched for. I discovered a number of
 
movies, including 
movies scheduled to come out later this year and next year that I also want 
to see.
 
The Knowledge Graph also works great on mobile. If you voice search for 
Julia Roberts movies on your phone, you will see a list of her latest films in 
th
e search results. And if you are running an Android device with Jelly Bean, 
our latest Android release, Google will actually say the list of movies back to 
you, powered by the Knowledge Graph in addition to giving you the 
traditional search results.
 
Also o
n Android, we introduced Google Now, a feature that intelligently 
brings you the right information at the right time, just for you even outward. 
For example, one morning last week, Google Now told me that (inaudible) 
16 minutes longer than normal based on 
current traffic. All my schedules 

just showed up as a notification. Google Now also shows me other things I 
may care about like weather, driving directions, my next appointment, cool
 
places nearby, slide updates and scores for my sports.
 

moving beyond the search engine that just matches strings of words to one 
that understands the people, the world where peo
ple do. Just as a 
knowledge graph connects real
-
world thing; Google+ is a social spine that is 
starting to connect everything across Google. With a new Google+ local 
feature accessible from desktop and mobile on Maps, Search and Google+, 
the users can find
 
and share nearly 100 million places and local businesses 
like restaurants and museums.
 
You just can make decisions about where they want to go based on Zagat 
scores, summaries and reviews from friends and people they trust who are 
on Google+. Once they de
cided where to go, they can use the New Events 
tab in Google+ to plan their activity and to share photos and comments 
before, during, and after the event.
 

recently announced a Google
+ experience for Google, for Android tablets 
and the iPad. More users are now accessing Google+ from mobile devices 
than from desktops. Today, 250 million users have upgraded to Google+ 

cited 

community on Google+.
 

more quickly turn their intentions into actions. In May, we announced a new

have product summaries and larger product images. These new format
s are 
clearly labeled sponsors and they help shoppers more easily find and 
compare different products, or refine their searches by brand or product 
type. Try searching for camping tents to see an example of these new 
results.
 
Users can find special offers 
and deals with Google Shopping, and can shop 
with confidence when they see a Google trusted store badge on retailer site.
 
On the platform side, we had a lot of key announcements and launches at 
our Google I/O developer conference. Let me give a quick summa
ry of the 
highlights. We announced 1 million new Android devices are being activated 
each day with more than 400 million devices now activated worldwide.
 
We showed our Jelly Bean, our latest version of Android and the Nexus 7, a 
tablet that is build for Go
ogle Play. More than 20 billion apps have been 
downloaded from Google Play. We announced that Chrome has 310 million 
users worldwide, which is up from a 160 million last May.
 
We brought Chrome for Android out of beta and we introduced Chrome for 
iOS which 
became the most popular free app in the Apple app store within 
hours of its availability.
 
We launched our new infrastructure service product called Google Compute 
engine, which lets developers and businesses run Linux virtual machines on 
the same infrastru
cture that powers Google.
 
Google documents became editable offline and we announced Google Drive 

available even without an internet connection, and it functions across 
Windows, Mac, Android, Chrome OS and now iOS.
 
We released 3D cityscapes in Google Earth for mobile, announced that 
travelers with an Android device can now access offline map of more than 
150 countries. And expanded our Street View maps, our Street View fe
ature 
in Google Maps to provide panoramic imagery in more than 3,000 cities, 
across 40 countries.
 
And then of course there was Sergey surprise demo of Google Glass, with a 
live video hangout with skydivers wearing Google Glass and jumping out of 
an airship
 
nearly a mile above downtown San Francisco, and then landing on 
the roof of the I/O Conference Center. To see this demo for yourself, you 
can search on Project Glass demo on YouTube. I definitely recommend this 
video.

Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we will take o
ur first question 
from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney

Great. Thanks. Two questions please. First on Motorola, the comments at 
the time of the acquisition is that it would accretive, do you still feel that 
that asset can be in any thoug
hts would give us as to how you would make, 
what has been pretty consistently a loss leading asset that Motorola Mobile, 
how you make that accretive? And then a product on Search and what you 
find in terms of the appetite with the interest in voice search,
 
Google has 

people are more interested in using that less the quality of that versus 
whatever regular search. How interesting do you think that is as a growth 
area for Google in th
e future voice search? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 


opportunity that we have with Motorola, and our manag
ement team has 
been there only a few weeks. Clearly, everybody should expect some 
changes at Motorola that we have already talked about in the public domain 
and when we said, Dennis and the management team is there resetting and 
retooling it. but we have n
othing really to announce right now. I think we 
have to let them do their work. but I can tell you that was a probable 
excitement in MMI for all the employees, but also for the clients.
 
So I just want to come back, Mark to your point on accounting. If you 
actually took out the accounting issues that were related to closing the 

some of the adjustments that were related to the acquisition, in fact on the 

 

 
they had a pretty stable and good quarter, 

one or two quarters before all that noise comes out. Susan, do you want to 
comment on the voice search?
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Sure. Yeah
, so I mean voice search has been an area that Google has been 
investing in for a number of years. we believe like we have really good 

mentioned in my 

 
when I talked before hand, now wi
th the Jelly Bean 
release, we have the ability not only to ask a question, but also to have the 
answers given back to you. And so, I definitely recommend that you test it 
out. it is very powerful and we think in the right circumstances, users will 
want to 

 
some users will want to type and some users will want to have 
voice. And so in the circumstances where they do, was developed a really 
amazing technology that is leading edge on that.

Spencer Wang 

 
Credit Suisse Securities
 
Thanks, I guess one question and two parts for Patrick on Mot
orola. You 


rough sense of the purchase price allocation in terms of the hard assets, 
versus goodwil
l versus other intangibles so we can sort through some of that 
noise.
 
And the second part is, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about 
the Motorola home business in terms of how that fits in, if you guys consider 
that strategic? Thanks.
 
Patr
ick Pichette
 

the asset and obviously the IR team can follow up with you on that, but I 
think in our disclosures the press release like, you will see like for example, 
intangibles wa
s 30 some million in the case of Motorola and 32 I believe for 
Google. Just on the intangibles, so it gives you a sense of numbers for the 
step periods. As it relates to the home business, I mean, again a bit of the 
same story that I told Mark prior, which
 



just need a bit of patient for us to complete our home wo

there just for a few weeks.

And we will take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with 
Sanford 
Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions, one on mobile and 
one on YouTube. On mobile, have you conducted any studies on the impact 
of mobile adoption or search query demand 
by end users. And do you have a 
perspective on what portion of mobile queries are incremental versus 
cannibalistic for handsets and tablets.
 
And on YouTube, I think one or two quarters ago, Nikesh referred to Google 
Analytics as the unsung hero of the busi
ness. Thinking about YouTube brand 
advertisers, how do you give them visibility into brand advertising ROI in 
YouTube, and do you think you will be able to do that to get the dollars to 
flow and overcome the obvious challenges that you may have there?
 
Patr
ick Pichette
 
So, Nikesh would answer the second question; Susan on cannibalization of 
mobile versus desktop.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 

understand how those two different types of devices a
nd how those searches 
are interactive with each other. And this is very complicated, but I will say 
we believe that mobile searches are mostly incremental. For example on 
weekend, when you 

 
those are out and about, you usually see a raise in 
mobile activi
ty. And then when users are back on Monday, we see a raise of 

-
for
-
one, we do believe that they are 
mostly incremental.
 
Carlos Kirjner 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
And does it value Susan between handsets and tablets
.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
In terms of queries?
 
Carlos Kirjner 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
No, on the incremental versus cannibalistic.

analysis and trying to figure 
that out. I mean I think that the thing that 

are willing to take their mobile, people use tablet certainly in the office 

alysis on that.
 
Carlos Kirjner 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Okay. Yeah, so we have a clear view on the handsets and on the tablet 

 
Nikesh Arora
 
(Inaudible) Carlos, hi, so in YouTube there are two dif
ferent issues. And if 

YouTube versus other performance media on the online space. I guess more 
interesting when you start talking about brand, because brand is not just 
about the 

done very exciting things, with single source panels, where we worked in 
Germany with thousands of users and try to look at advertising effectiveness 
and efficiency, not just on YouTube and 
online video, but also compared to 


doing at higher ROI, but we also get higher reach and higher frequency 
capa
bilities on YouTube, because you are looking at users on a very large 
online platform.

are

we sort of 
think about them as moon shops a lot of time, like projects that we think

to our next question please.
 
Operator
 
And we will go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott Devitt 

 
Morgan Stanley
 

referenced the Talent or in last year increased the cash compen
sation by 
10%. I was just wondering given the transition of a number of companies 
that you compete with for Talent into the public markets, could you just give 
an updated view on the cost and availability of the Talent in the Valley? And 
then secondly on a
 
last 12 months basis, Google has generated $12.5 billion 
in unlevered free cash, so you now have an 8% unlevered free cash yield 
and you are generating cash at an run rate that equates to about 30% of the 
current cash positions. So I was wondering if you 
could just talk a bit about 
the way that you are currently thinking about capital allocation or specifically 
a share repurchase? Thanks.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Okay. So let me start with the second one first. We continue, and I know 
that sound a bit like a broken re
cord on this, but on a very regular basis, we 
actually debated with our board. In our 

 
our cash position is really a 
strategic asset to us given all of the innovation that's happening, and all of 
the options that are available to us.
 
I mean it has been su
ch, and you just take Motorola, which we just closed, I 
mean it was a real strategic asset to us to actually be able to pounce. So we 
haven't changed our position in terms of share repurchases or dividends or 
any of the others for a time being, which does 
not mean we don't evaluate. 
We do take a good look at it. We just think that it continuous to be a 
strategic asset for us, and so that's why we haven't changed our position 
yet.
 
In the case of the talent, I think that the Valley continues to be hot, I mean
 
it's a hotbed of innovation. There's a lot of need for that talent, especially 
the very high, the engineering front, and we're delighted by our strategy. I 
mean we continue to see really benchmark levels for our retention purposes, 
and we continue to attr
act the very best talent. So for us, it is an absolute 
strategic asset again for the company. I mean, Googlers, the engineers that 
are here in the salespeople and they've really make a huge difference to the 
velocity of the company. So the Valley has not c
hange, it content despite 
everything else is going on in the world out there are. The Valley continues 

out so well. So thanks for your question Scott. Very good question.
 
Let's go to our next question please Jamie.

And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.

Goldman Sachs
 
Hi, great, thank you. I had two questions. First, what are you seeing in 
terms of mobile CPC trend, and how do 
you see these trends playing out 
over the course of the next 12 months. And then, the second question is, 
with the Nexus 7 on the market, can you talk a little bit about your plan to 
accelerate content acquisition in particular in video and book? Thank you
.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I think Nikesh is perfectly suited for both.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Hi, Heather. Thank you for your question. Well, I think the good news is that 



whether we are seeing phenomenal amounts of mobile queries across the 
board. I think as I said, mobile is right now where Search was in 1999. we 

t 
innovation to keep driving more and more efficiency for the advertisers. we 
were working with advertisers to get them to get better landing pages, 
better sites, get them to understand truly the opportunities on the mobile 
space for example. You can make 
phone calls, so we have a product called 
Click
-
to
-
Call. Now the Search takes on a whole different meaning, because 

 
So we are seeing mobile CPCs are healthy and we expect them the l
ong
-
term that they will continue to be healthy and sort of follow this trajectory 
that Search has followed, more inventory, more effectiveness, more ROI for 
the advertisers, better pricing in the market. In terms of your second 
question on Nexus 7, I think
 
we have made tremendous amounts of 
headway in the content space that we have a lot, lot of content on Google 
Play. we are working very closely with the music industry, with Hollywood 
studios et cetera, to get more and more content on the platforms, so I t
hink 
given that there are models out there where other people are offering 
content to the platforms. it is becoming to the standards that you can have 
the ability to offer content to the end user and we are making tremendous 
amounts of progress across the 
board.

first following up on the mobile CPC question, can you just give us some

just help us understa
nd the accounting around the Nexus 7 tablet and how 
we should be thinking about that on a growth versus net basis and the 
impact it may have going forward? Thanks.

Nikesh

Yeah, actually I think I already said that in my prepared remarks that we 
have over 1 million advertisers working with us in mobile advertising and it 

of number of advertis
ers are involved in mobile space. And I think usually 

smartphones and tablets, they actually, they want to find the most effective 
ROI they can get and they want to capture as many queries 
as you get on 
these device. Patrick?

No, the issue for the Nexus S, Nexus 7, the

right, we book the revenue and then we book the cost as well and the cost 


 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Yeah, and this is Sus
an, just one more thing I would add Doug on your 
question about the mobile CBCs and the percentage that are bidding, is a lot 
of campaign structures are setup so that when an advertiser participates in a 
bid, they actually bid, they can instead of one camp
aign and it can run 
across everything. And we adjust those prices dynamically for them, we 
have 

 

on mobile and then some advertisers have bundled campaigns and we 
adjust those prices. 

mobile that are participating in mobile.

And we will go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post

Great. When you look at your international result ex
-
FX, they actually were 
stable or even accelerated. Yeah, we are hearing a lot of issues over there. 
Can you talk about geographic mix, what countries are doing
 
well or vertical 

are really helping your revenue growth there. And then secondly, TAC to 
distribution partners was up about $40 million quarter
-
over
-
quarter and 
continues to be a bigger
 
chunk of your Google website revenues. What drove 
the quarter
-
over
-
quarter increase, was that mostly mobile or are there other 
factors? Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So, let me jump on TAC, and then let Nikesh answer to the first question. So 
TAC, it's real
ly a mix, right, obviously TAC reflects a mix of the different 
distribution methods that include toolbars, chrome distribution, mobile 
distribution, and also obviously the AFS business as well. So there's a 

 
if 
you look at our revenue mix between Google p
roperties and network, right 
network will attach stronger, so that will drive TAC as well. And then, mobile 
is also one of these contributing factors. So we don't break down all these 

 
that 

 
Nikesh Arora
 
Yeah, I alluded to some of this in the prepared remarks. I think, as I said 
growth in the Americas and Asia has been steady this quarter. The U.S. and 
Canada ha

been some issues internationally. Southern Europe, we saw slide dip as we 
think it is hampered both by pure macro economic conditions and all ad 
industry concerns. Spain was a notable sort of 
lowlight or highlight 
depending on how you look at it in that conversation. On the other hand, 
performance accelerated for us in northern Europe driven by the UK and the 
UK has been a little depressed over the last few quarters. So it is finally 
coming bac
k and sort of we are seeing strength there again.
 
In terms of your question and on the sectors, I think travel has been strong 
pretty much across the board in the U.S. and the UK and around the world. 
Auto was strong in the U.S. for us, healthcare has been
 
strong in the UK, 
and generally across the world, we've seen strong sort of performance both 
in finance and local, and we're seeing more and more sort of excitement and 
enthusiasm in sectors like CPG and entertainment given the shift to brand. 

, this is the snapshot in time and these things change quarter
-
over

quarter.

Hi, thanks. One, I think for Susan, just if you can help us with the order of 
the magnitude the drivers of the divergence that we continue to see 

ed about, of course 
mobile is one of those drivers, but then FX, we have a sense of that, 
property mix, emerging markets and add quality changes, all driving that. 
So I was wondering if you guys could give us like a ordered magnitude of 
how important each 
of those key drivers were in the quarter and then how 
we should think about those trending going forward, if we should expect that 
divergence to normalize or should we actually expect it to continue to 
diverge? It will be helpful. Thank you very much.
 
Patr
ick Pichette
 
Susan, do you want to give some comments on it or Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 


important metric for us, b

necessarily a reflection of the fundamental health of our business. This 

five factors that impact CPC, but the biggest impact this quart
er was FX. We 
have clearly an impact of mobile versus tablet versus desktop, we have an 


on google.com versus n
etwork, so as you see the network playing a bigger 

say this quarter the impact has been felt because of FX, but from a positive 
perspective we see any time there was a change in
 
CPC, which is more 
attractive for the advertiser that allows the advertiser get a bit of ROI, but 

 
Patrick Pichette
 

was CPC versus 
the last quarter. I mean, as the euro kind of went down 9% 
year
-
over
-
year, I mean it obviously makes a big difference. So thanks for 
your question.

Hi, thank you. Can you just maybe talk a little bit more about the Offers 
business and do you feel 
strongly about that business as you did in the past. 
And maybe how that business actually will come into play with Google+ or 
on payments or (inaudible)? Thank you.

Hi, Ken. So yeah Offers continues to be an area that we are investing in, we
 
have, I mean we think that there is a lot of things that are really important

Ronald Josey

Great, thanks for taking my question. Going back to mobile and the 
opportunity there, Nikesh I tho
ught that might be interesting if you could 
talk a little bit about, perhaps what you are seeing in terms of the 
campaigns and there has been an acceleration, now that AdMob is fully 
integrated in AdWord, knowing that there is over a million advertisers an
d 

happened? Thank you.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Hi, thanks for the question. I think as I said, we are seeing phenomenal 

d

also comfortable with the devices and using them more often. So with the 
number of questions they asked on the AdMobs. so AdMobs just got 

rly to say, we're seeing acceleration. 
but generally, our performance throughout that integration has been very 

months ago, as we took all of our sales efforts and we took our specializ
ed 
mobile sales people, we had them trained all of our sales forces around the 
world. So that impact has even contributed more than just that integration 
part. but we think the integration is just going to turbocharge that effort and 
hopefully continue to 
help us drive mobile. and mobile is going to be here for 


our sales people around the world are fully equippe
d and working with every 
advertiser, not just 1 million to make sure that people can see ROI in both 
mobile and desktop simultaneously.

Hey, good afternoon. I have one question just on the shifted mobile and 
specifically around this will be both Nexus as well as Motorola. How 
important d
o you think it is for ultimate mobile modernization to actually 

sorts of different competitors some who subsidize evidently, some obviously 
telling full price, hardware, software comb
os, what do you think the right 

little bit more declarative in the market with your intentions? Thanks.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think, hi this is Nikesh again Jason. thanks again for your 
question. And as 



well as Motor
ola acquisition.
 
So we believe that mobile us very and very important critical to the future. 
Now, I know it seems a little complicated when you look at the different 
competitors, and how you talked about subsidies et cetera. We simplify that 
by focusing o
n, how do we provide the best experience to the user. Now 
providing the best experience to user, is effectively working really hard with 
Andy Rubin, Stephen Android making sure he is getting the best experience 
for the end
-
user and in that process he works
 
with the best OEMs in the 
marketplace to make sure that the combination of hardware and software 
allows for the best experience to be delivered. I think, for us what's 
important as to get that experience delivered and we will work with 
whatever the indust
ry models that are out there, either we work direct with 
operators, trying to make sure that happens behind the end
-
user and more 

experience in the hands of the end
-
user. I think th
at's what we're going to 
focus on. So, I think that's quite declarative in terms of intention.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yeah. I mean just to close, open is really important to Google and in that 
context you see our strategy is very focused on end
-
users and 
been open 
and we are going to get a lot of benefit that we already have and continue to 
get a lot of benefit out of that. So, it's a complex question, there is no doubt 

question please.

Lloyd Walmsley 

 
Deutsche Bank Securities
 
Thanks, I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the rollout of the 
shift to paid inclusion for Google shopping and 
when you expect it to be fully 
rolled out and kind of what you're seeing today in terms of Paid Clicks and 
CPCs, now that some of the shopping links have been moved to high end 
results and where do you think CPCs there can go relative to just core paid 
sea
rch?
 
Patrick Pichette
 

?
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Yeah, so Lloyd, so we made this decision to move to a commercial model 
because we saw that ultimately this would drive a better experience for 
users and having more up to date info
rmation and more accurate price and 
inventory availability and so we are in the process of rolling that out. We 
think it will be rolled out. We expect probably completed around the Q4 
timeframe. And we are working really hard with all the merchants to get 
them all on board, and again we think this is actually really good for both 
the merchants and the users.
 

a term from the people who have been in the industry for a really long
 
time 
meaning putting in, paid things into the search results, in a non
-
marked 

very clearly as sponsored, and again we believe that actually moving to this 
model is good for both the 

looking forward to this transition.

Hi, thanks. Could you give us a sense of how big your mobile search queries 
are, as a percentage of total search queries? And also on Motorola, I kno
w 

Android unit growth was in the quarter on a pro forma basis? Thanks.

And on the search
 



 


question, Jamie?

Oppenheimer.
 
Jason Helfstein 

 
Oppenheimer & Co.
 

about 
the growth of Google+ number growth, are you happy? I think you 
alluded to how that's going. What can you do to drive faster member growth 
and is that kind of part of the strategy or you just led it organically evolve. 
So kind of a push versus, I guess the
 
pull strategy there. And then second, 
can you give us the breakdown of depreciation between Motorola and MII for 
the quarter? Thanks.
 
Patrick Pichette
 

after the call, so this 
is for your second question, Jason. On the issue of 
depreciation, I think that the team can circle back which would give you the 
split, because we do the segmented reporting. On the first question, which is 

et Susan cover that one.
 
Susan Wojcicki
 
Sure. Yeah, so, overall we've been really pleased with the growth that we've 

accounts. And I do think it's also really important to 
remember that Google+ 
just celebrated its one
-
year anniversary. We actually celebrated that at IO. 
And so, we see that Google+ account growth has growing really well. We 
think that one of the most important things is that when you have a 
Google+ account yo
u have the ability to share. And we've talked about 
Google+ being the social spine across all of our products ability to make all 
of our products better. Not just the stream, which is an important part, but 
also for example your search experience. So that 
if I have a friend, a friend 

would you be able to see that information at the time that I'm doing that 
search. And so we have many, many use cases where we think being part of 
Google

to make sure that our products are integrated, we have a number of 
integrations across the products, probably local with the most significant one 
that we did this quarter, and we find tha
t having those integrations by 
making the products better, also tried to more usage of Google+. So yeah, 
so thank you Jason, that was an important question.

Patrick Pichette
 

to invite Larry to give us the first round of 

some comment before we turn to Q&A. So here you go, Larry.
 
Lawrence Page
 
Thank you, Patrick. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 

on the call today and to share our progress since we last spoke six months 
ago. As you can hear my voice is still hoarse, so I will keep my remarks 
reasonably short. I am sorry for the scramble earlier today. As our printers 
have said, the
y hit send on the release just a bit early.
 
We had a strong quarter, I am really happy with our business. Revenue was 
up 45% year
-
on
-
year, and at just 14 years old, we cleared our first $14 
billion revenue quarter. Not bad for a teenager. Today, we live in
 
a world of 
abundance; abundant information and abundant computing. Most of us carry 
at least one device, all the time, every day. In fact many of us would feel 

and mobile commerce 
are growing dramatically across the world.
 
And we use these devices interchangeably, depending on our situation. I 
switch between my Nexus phone, my Nexus 7 tablet and my new 
Chromebook that we just announced today many times a day. While this 
abundance ca
uses disruption, it also creates amazing opportunity. And 
Google is super well
-
placed to take advantage of these disruptive 
opportunities.
 
Why? Because our search query volumes have grown this quarter as 
measured year
-
over
-
year. And we are seeing tremendou
s innovation in 
advertising, which I believe, will help us monetize mobile queries more 
effectively than desktop today. Indeed, our mobile monetization per query is 
already a significant fraction compared to desktop. In short, as we transition 
from one scr
een to multiscreens, Google has enormous opportunities to 
innovate and drive ever higher monetization, just like Search in 2000.
 
Now we took a big bet on Android back in 2005. We believed that aligning 
standards around an open source operating system would
 
drive innovation 
across the industry. Most people thought we were nuts. Today, there are 
over half a billion Android devices, half a billion, with 1.3 million more being 
activated every day. You should all run out and buy the Nexus 7 tablet for 

 
had rave reviews and recently won Gadget of the Year from T3, 

amazing device.
 
This time last year, I announced that our run
-
rate for mobile advertising hit 
$2.5 billion. That seeme
d like a pretty big number even for Google. But now 
we have built up additional mobile revenue from users paying for content 
and apps in Google Play. Including these new sources grossed up, I can 
announce our new run
-
rate for mobile is now over $8 billion.
 

business.
 
We have so many opportunities today, that unless we prioritize we spread 

closed or have combined 60 products and features in the last year. And 

on of energy into ensuring that our remaining products work 

ever that we converge our services.
 
Users want one consistent, beautiful and simple Google experience. 
Technology should
 
do all the hard work, liberating users to get on with the 
important things that matter in their lives and this screen independence is at 
the core of our strategy.
 
Take Chrome on Android, for example. We only launched in February, but 
the experience is alr
eady amazing. When you are using Chrome, switching 
devices is truly painless. All your tabs are there, ready to go. Search on your 
desktop and the result is right there on your smartphone. You can even click 
the back button, and it just works. And as more 
users upgrade to Google+, 

devices like instant photo upload.
 
In the same way, we want to make advertising super simple for customers. 
Online advertising has developed in very device s
pecific ways, with separate 
campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for advertisers 
and agencies, and means mobile opportunities often get missed.
 

very hard on th

while we do the hard work of dynamically adapting their campaigns across 

 
I talked at the start about the abundance of information. In the early days of 
Goog

deeply and you expect us to turn your intentions into actions in the blink of 
an eye.

You might have a really important even

the traffic is bad. You need to leave early to avoid being late. Or maybe

d on 
Android in June, gives you all that information and more automatically, with 
zero effort required on your part.
 

powerful. They really save users time and hassle. This is 

excited about the opportunities ahead, given our expertise in Search and 
Mobile, and our track record monetizing high usage products.

And now, you will hear from Patrick some details about our quarter.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thanks, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
Ov
erall, we are very pleased with the growth trajectory of our business this 
quarter and this in fact despite significant currency fluctuations in many of 
our international markets.
 
So for example, if currencies had remained constant year
-
over
-
year, our 
cons
olidated revenue growth would actually have been 6% higher. On a 
positive note, our U.S. growth continues to be strong. And as Larry noted, 

of critical areas.
 
So before I dive into
 
the financials, I just want to give you a bit more detail 
on the new $8 billion annual mobile run rate that Larry mentioned. The new 
run rate is different from the one we gave you a year ago. And more 
specifically, last year, it included only our gross re
venue from mobile ads, 
but this year, in this number we also added the gross revenue from the 
mobile sales of Google Play content. And finally, it also includes the 
consumer spending on the Play apps.
 

ancial performance. 
Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 45% year
-
over
-
year to $14.1 

-
over
-

revenue grew 19% year
-
over
-
year to $11.5 billion, 5% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. In that, our Google W
ebsite revenue was up 15% year
-
over
-
year to 
$7.7 billion, 2% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, with strengths across most major 
geographies and verticals.
 
Our Google Network grew 21% year
-
over
-
year to $3.1 billion and 5% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And our other revenue gre
w 73% year
-
over
-
year to 
$666 million, 52% quarter
-
over
-
quarter and this driven by the Nexus 7 
sales.
 
If it were not for these currency fluctuations, Google Standalone revenue 
would actually have grown 24% year
-
over
-
year. As Larry mentioned, Google 
Standalo
ne business continues to perform very well. A dramatic growth in 

days, some of our existing ads have better monetization in desktop already 

ransition opens a whole new space for 
innovation and new format and future monetization.
 
Turning to MMI, Motorola gross revenue was $2.6 billion. The mobile device 
division revenue for that period was $1.8 billion and the home division 
revenue was $797 mil

in its 150 days.
 
As indicated in our public filings, our team has made a lot of operational 

streamlining of software operations 
and we scale back the markets in which 
we operate. But that said, we are just at the beginning of the Motorola 
Google story. And we should expect, as I mentioned before, results from this 
segment to be quite variable for quite a while yet. Remember that we
 
inherited an entire product pipeline where hardware business cycles are 
typically in a 12 months to 18 months.
 
At Google, our aggregate paid click growth was very strong again this 
quarter up 33% year
-
over
-
year, 6% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our aggregate 
CPC 
or cost
-
per
-
click was down 15% and down 3% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. 
But once again please remember that currency headwinds also had a 
significant negative impact on our CPCs in Q3. In fixed FX terms, aggregate 
CPC would have been down only 8% almost half of t
he 15% and down only 
1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Turning to geographic performance of Google Standalone business, we 
continue to see robust performance in the U.S., the UK and Japan. On the 
other hand, we felt the continued impact of the economic situation in
 

 
In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations website, 

world, to show the impact of
 
FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So 
please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 23% year
-
over
-
year to $5.4 billion. The UK 
was up 16% to $1.2 billion, which includes $6 million of benefit from our 
hedgi
ng program and in FX term; in fact the UK grew 20%. The non
-
U.S. 
revenue excluding the UK accounted for 42% of our total revenue or $4.9 
billion, up 15% year
-
over
-
year, but in fixed terms, in fact was 26%. And all 
this includes a $56 million benefit from o
ur hedging program.
 

Our other cost of revenue was $3.6 billion in Q3 excluding our stock
-
based 
compensation. Non
-
GAAP operating expenses totaled $2.9 billion, which 
again exclude
s SBC and the restructuring and related charges recorded in 
our Motorola business. And our non
-
GAAP operating profit was therefore 
$3.8 billion in Q3, resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin of 27%.
 
For Google Standalone, our traffic acquisition costs wer
e $2.8 billion or 
25.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.6 
billion and that excludes $103 million of stock
-
based compensation. The 
increase year
-
over
-
year in this other cost of revenue was driven by data 
center costs, equipmen
t costs and including costs associated with the sales 
of the Nexus 7, and finally, content acquisition costs.
 
Non
-
GAAP operating expenses were $3.2 billion, excluding again SBC of 
$585 million. And finally, our non
-
GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q
3 
resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin of 34% for Google Standalone. 

on PPE for standalone Google, which was $465 million for this quarter.
 
If we flip to Motorola, our total non
-
GAAP operating expenses including cost 
of revenue totaled $2.7 billion for the quarter. And keep in mind, that 
intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and 
Motorola are included in these non
-
GAAP measures. And as a result, the 
n
on
-
GAAP operating loss of Motorola was $151 million for Q3, resulting in a 
non
-
GAAP operating margin of 6% for that segment.
 

by roughly 1,000 in Q3. Standalone Google added about 1
,800 people. And 
remember that historically, we often see some seasonal effects on the hiring 
in Q3 as folks that we hired in the spring and early summer actually start 
working in September. In total, the consolidated company ended up the 
quarter around 53
,500 full
-
time employees.
 
Our effective tax rate for this quarter was 22% in Q3, the changes from last 
quarter reflects the mix shift in earnings between the domestic and 
international subsidiaries and our hedges, but finally, fewer capital gains 
offsets v
ersus last quarter.
 
If you allow me to turn to cash management, OI&E or other income and 
expenses was $62 million, which reflect the continued impact of our FAS 133 
expenses of our hedging program, but also fewer capital gains versus last 
quarter. For more
 
detail on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that 
accompany this call on our IR website.
 
Operating cash flow was very strong, $4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 

spent is in
 

 
continues to be related to production equipment and facilities 
related purchases. All this actually delivers us a free cash flow, which was 

 
The success of our product really gives us the confidence to continu

the strategic growth areas, areas that Larry talked about such as Search, 
YouTube, Android, Chrome, and as always we continue to show our 


een a number of these decisions including the 
sunset of our Google TV Ad as an example.
 
So with that, I will hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more detail on our

strong quarter with $11.5 billion in Google Standalone gross revenue. I want 
to talk to you about our focus and progress on four major t
rends that are 
actually helping to drive our business growth.
 
First, a trend Larry already talked about, the rise of the multiscreen 
consumer. This is creating huge opportunities for us especially in our 
advertising business and focus on video and 
mobile. At the moment, 
everybody thinks about the online world is divided into desktops and mobile. 
Larry shared the amazing $8 billion run rate. And I believe in the medium
-
term, these screens will continue to diverge, but advertising opportunities 
will c
onverge to allow our marketers to run common campaigns across all 
these screens.

unique approach that helps advertisers succeed across media. We allow 
them to use and leverage the attributes of each media and adapt their 
campaigns for online success. YouTube energized by new professional

In addition, we also continue to make progress in our end

We are also working on creating more video premium inventory without 
channel strategy in YouTube as more and more viewers move to online 
video, we expect more and more brands will do the same.
 
Our brand business is actually creating quite a 
buzz in the industry because 
we have great media and our solutions really work. For example, on 
YouTube, we looked at about 92 different ad campaigns with sales impact, 
we found that an average spending on YouTube was approximately 2.4 
times more efficient
 
than the equivalent television spent.
 
We have 200 times more video advertisers than the average U.S. television 
network. In our TrueView format, in which advertisers only pay for ads that 
users watch has really taken off. We have twice as many advertisers
 
using

Last trend I want to talk about is the trend of cloud computing in the 
enterprise. Our enterprise business continues to thrive. We saw especially 
great traction 
in retail and education sectors this quarter with Dillard's, 
Kohl's, and Office Depot, all using Google Enterprise products.
 
In education, there are over 20 million students, faculty and staff, non

of Education which has over 600,000 users.
 
With the recent launch of Google+ for enterprise customers, organizations of 
all size 

 
sizes including capital and Banshee Wines
 
are starting to use our 
Hangouts and other tools to work together 
and get things done from 
anywhere.
 
In addition to all these trends, our marketing team continues to do an 
excellent job. We launched a global cross

product initiative to bring the 2012 
Olympics to our users worldwide. YouTube streamed the games like to 64 
countries. Also YouTube was the efficient live streaming provider with over 1 
million hours of live content for the democratic and republic of national

Thanks guys. Nikesh, one quick question on revenue and Patrick one on 
expenses. The international and rest of world organic growth was 26% 
pretty strong, but down from 29% last quarter. So is there any incremental 
weakness that you saw or was this 
just mostly from a tougher comp? And 
then Patrick, your sales and marketing expense was up 18% from last 
quarter that's a bit higher than the typical increase in 3Q, can you talk about 

 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay

marketing expense listen, I think what you see is the impact of the support 
for the Nexus 7 that we launched in Q3. Otherwise everything was pretty 
much in line with what we would expect. 
We just got such a great review of 
the Nexus 7, we won the support of the market and that's the biggest delta 
you will see in that number.
 

 
Nikesh Arora
 
I think it's fair to say 
that, our revenue growth internationally has been 
pretty strong. You are seeing some pockets of difference in performance 
partly because of seasonal reasons and partly because of the continuing 

oing better 
than the economy in most markets in Europe, but it does get impacted a 
little bit with some of the fluctuations you see there. So from our perspective 
there is no any cause for concern.

Hi, thanks. Just wondering if you could ta
lk a little more about the strategy 
behind the decision to monetize product listing ads and then more broadly 
about the retail strategy for the company? And then secondly, Google 
website revenue net of distribution tax lowered to 13% from 20% last 
quarter,
 
I was wondering if possible you could Patrick normalize that for 
currency to get a better understanding of FX neutral for website growth? 
Thank you.
 
Lawrence Page
 
Hello Scott, this is Larry. On this question about the strategy and product 
listings, I thin

for our customers. When they search for something I mention boots on the 
call, now you search for that, I think you'll see a well organized set of 
product information, ways to buy it and reall
y have a great experience there. 
And we see, our ability to do that on the ads or monetized product listing 


 
are 
still in the early stages of that. We just launched, I think yesterday really 
and we still got ways to go. So I'll let Nikesh or Patrick take the next 
question.

you suggested the 600 basis point 
effect from currency and I was just wondering if there is a better
 
way to 
understand the way that currency effected Google site revenue, if I should 
think of that any differently than the overall currency?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
I see, so no, it's even the, I mean we have 

 
our network is slightly skewed 
to the US versus our G

because our network is slightly skewed to the US, but overall I think that it 
still gives you a good sense of proportion as to what's going on in the 

t from a model point 
of view.

really trying to provide answers to people and so, and the strategy for the 
company really looking at very detailed information and giv
ing you the exact

get you, as a user in the right answer. And I think that's a very exciting sort 
of a new
 
strategy for us.

Next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 

 
Citigroup
 
Great, thanks. Two 
questions please mobile searches are really strong, 


the expense side if we just looked at the core Google it loo
ks like the 
margins are coming down, but if you did roughly $200 million may be in 
Nexus revenue and if you really sold those devices at cost then margins are 
actually better than they have been in two year, which is the more accurate 
interpretation? Thank
s.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Actually, let me start with the margins and then I will answer your first 
question. On the margins you actually have a couple of effects this quarter, 
one of them, is clearly as you said the cost of the Nexus that will flow into 
our 
other cost of revenue, but also it's the first time that you have the full 
quarter effect of the amortization of intangibles from the Motorola 
transaction.
 
So that is also another big kind levered that actually kicked in. and it should 
noted just for the f
inancial community that the amortization of intangibles 
for Motorola flows to both the Google segment and the Motorola segment in 

have a lot of kind of noise in the data, I thin


of mobile.
 
Lawrence Page
 
So I guess, I feel like you are asking the wrong question a little bit. I think 
we are really starting to live in the 
new reality, one where the kind of 
ubiquity of the screens helps users really move from intent to action much 
faster and more seamlessly. So I think this will create a huge new universe 
of opportunities for advertisers where they can focus on platform. Foc
using 

will be dynamically adopting across a whole bunch of different devices to 
reach the right audiences at the right time.
 

uded to changes that 
we'll make 

 
to our ads system to improve the advertiser experience and the 
user experience around that. And I also think that, we are just seeing 
tremendous growth in the Android, which really obviously we have 
tremendous ability to i
nfluence and to improve the user experience, to add 
location, to notify your things as I mentioned around different kinds of non
-
commercial experiences. We can notify you of commercial experiences as 
well.
 


that monetization on mobile queries right now is a significant fraction of 

our existing ads, our existing monetization over to mobile. And lastly in 
o
rder to really innovate using Android and our strength of having ads on 
other mobile platforms and really move advertisers and consumers who into 
a new world. So I think we are uniquely positioned to get through the 

t. So I am just incredibly excited about 
that.

Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
 
C
arlos Kirjner 

 
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
 
Hi, two questions, if you run a website with proprietary high quality content 
today and have to choose a protocol to add, meta data about this content, 
why would the clear choice would be the Open Graph protoc
ol instead of RDF 


disadvantage to achieve the vision that Larry laid out in the beginning of the 
call. The second qu
estion is what do think is the future of vertical search and 
why is that there are sites that specialize in certain vertical such as travel 
and local, that seem to do a better job than Google today and if this is going 
to change over time and what happens 
with vertical search? Thank you.
 
Lawrence Page
 

-
 
I'm not an expert on 

investment in knowledge graph and really understanding in de
tail about 


the past to get all the labeling aligned and all those things. I think we have a 
big p


space.
 
Vertical searches, as you asked about, I think our goal has always been to 
get you to the right
 
place, but we also 

 
to do that we need to really 


what do they cost, products, some one selling we need
 
to know how much 
they cost to get to know what the shipping is and so on. So I think any place 
we can get that information accurately, we can present it to our users. 
However we are very happy to do so.
 

 
more of that experience 
in order to provide a really high quality experience to our users. But again,

And we will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
 
Ben Schachter

One question for Larry and then a couple of housekeeping points on the 
Apple relat
ionship for Patrick. Larry, there is a lot of this talk about internet 
use on mobile devices, but switching gears a little, I just wonder if you could 
talk about the potential for internet access on television screens and how 
Google might benefit from that
? And then Patrick, just two quick 
housekeeping questions on Apple. One, is 100% of the TAC that you pay, 
Apple recognized in the Google.com TAC line, and then on iOS 6 there is a 
seemingly small change in the default search bar right now, says the word 
se
arch where they used to say Google. How does if at all that change the 
economic relationship between Apple and Google? Thanks.
 
Lawrence Page
 
Okay, so Ben thanks for the question. I mean, obviously we were exited 
about television, television 
screens, displays and we have been for a while. 


television, easily access You Tube and all those kind of th
ings.
 
YouTube is integrated on many, many devices from DVD players and so on 
to game consoles and things like that. So we obviously are working hard to 
get distribution for YouTube, for Chrome and for the internet as a whole on 
television screens, as well 

about that. I think we are obviously still in the early stages of that, 
something we really has a great user experience, and we work hard to make 
that happen.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
On the 

 
sorry, just want to talk ab
out the TAC line and just to say that, yes, 
I mean obviously all the TAC that we paid to Apple, it is just another partner 
for distribution, so it all is tied to our 

 
the TAC line that we have for 
Google.com. On your question of the default, I mean althou
gh there is 

 
nothing is changed, right, I mean, when you use Google, we are a great 

so, when you do search, I mean we have a great, we have the 

 
the fact 

Google to search is still kind of run by our 
engines. So I hope that clarifies the point Ben.

Next question come
 
from Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.
 
Anthony Diclemente 

 
Barclays
 
Hi, thanks. I started to harp on the CPC question, but you mentioned them 
being down 8% XFS. Can you just Patrick, talk a little bit about the other 
drivers, I think everybody assumes th
at the bulk of the down 8% is mobile, 
but I know there are other factors driving that down 8%, so if you could just 
kind of give us order of magnitude in emerging markets and so forth if 
possible?
 
And then secondly, on allocation of your sizable free cash 
flow and on your 


talked about your cash balance being a strategic asset for Google, just 
wondering if you could g

thinking on allocation of capital and use of your cash balance? Thanks for the 
question.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yeah, listen, on the CPC trends nothing has changed from last two quarters. 
And in fact, I think people
 
have a tendency just to harp and assuming that 

 
Anthony Diclemente 

 
Barclays
 
Right.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
And if you look through our results, I just kind of point to a few areas, if you 
look at our mix between our Google 
properties and our network, right, our 
network grew quite a bit again this quarter and that would drive a lot of pack 

tell and remind everybody that just all of these mix effects w
hether it would 
be mobile versus laptop versus desktop, but also emerging market versus 
developed markets and also our Google.com versus network.
 

actually can change quite a bit as
 
well. So I think that matters a lot, and I 



 
just endless.
 
So for us, the real issue for us is, but what really matters is, they are going 
down, but on the flip side of that, right, given all these mix issues, what we 
really see is our pay clicks going up at a pretty healthy rate at 33% again 
this q
uarter, which actually gives you a sense of people who are engaged, 

-
devices and in fact that there is a little bit less CPC is not a concern 
compared to all the offside that we s
ee on the other side.
 
On the issue of our cash and capital balance, I think, you get the same 
answer and maybe Larry wants to kind of chime in if he wishes to, but we 
just review this on a constant basis. We ask ourselves the question, is there 
real option
s for us actually to use the cash from a strategic perspective and 


our capital structure to where i
t is as we speak.
 
Lawrence Page
 
We have nothing to announce at this time.

Great. Thank you for the question. I have two for Patrick and then one for 

dea of the 
run rate that you are talking about, the $8 billion for mobile, can you give us 
an idea of what that is on a kind of same
-
store sales basis, you gave us the 
$2.5 billion run rate last year, what is the mobile advertising piece, I think 

mething people are really interested in, so extra stuff from Google 
Play? The follow
-


question for Larry is, I guess just in li

was wondering in this new reality you mentioned in response to his question, 
how does Google Fiber play into this vision to have your content and search 
capabilities go across multiple screens? Thank you.
 
Lawrence Page
 

 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay. So on the $8 billion, so let me give you just a bit more information on 

kind of give you a sense of proportion

three categories I gave you, ads continues to be the bulk of it, the vast 


at is whether 
a book, a movie content is actually booked on our books on a gross basis.
 

kind of number in all cases. So without giving you, I just want to give you 
that, so tha

book to revenue in our result that you see, but in fact, two of the three are 
there, the third one is done on a net basis, just because of our accounting 
rules. So and the vast majority is
 
still ads.

are in the early stages, obviously rolling that up.

pushing for the next chapter of the internet in the U.S. with Google Fiber. 
People, there is such a demand for

that kind of connectivity in the U.S. and elsewhere as well.

Douglas T. Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great, thanks. Just want to ask two 
questions. First is just following up on 

an acceleration on network side. But hoping that you could talk about a little 
bit beyond the U.S. and the international mix, is there an
ything else that you 
would attribute those dynamics to. And then secondly, you talked a lot about 
multiple screens and ambiguity of devices, how concerned are you that in a 

-
based 
envir
onment and Google might not be that starting point for people on 
mobile devices. Thanks.
 
Lawrence Page
 


ind of 
apps versus search. We obviously have a great position in apps, we have the 
Android Play Star, which has a huge number of apps. And I think that those 
experiences are good experiences and there are some things that are better 
than them, but to us so
me things that are better than the web of the apps. I 
think over time, we do our jobs right, you have the same capabilities in both 
places, and we have such ability in apps, you built some more usually good 
apps, the same way you go to webpage and so on. S
o I think anyway I think 
those differences will emerge or where it is tenures over time. I think we 
obliviously have a strong position in both.
 

that goes out of mobile and we talk
ed a little bit about all the different 

carrying a device with you and those things are very powerful. So you want 
all that when you are on desktop seller on the web, you want that same
 
information. And so we wanted a seamless experience that goes across both 

we are building. I think that we are going to see tremendous in these things.
 
The other point I make is that,
 
there is a small, relatively small number of 
people right now that have Chrome on their mobile devices. And I find 
Chrome on my mobile device like the same is having a desktop computer a 

hings. 


number of people, but it will be increasing quickly.
 
So I guess just seeing all those trends, I think i


Patrick, do you want the cover the detailed question?

was up and with strength across most geographies and most verticals. I 

the economy in the short term, so if there is a country that is slowing down 
a little bit then we clearly kind o
f see it in the result as well because Google 
is actually a pretty good protector of the present as far the economists are 


U.S. but really 

performing well. So nothing additional to kind of highlight apart from just a 
good general trends.

Arete Research Services LLP
 

for Larry if you could just expand a little
 
bit more on YouTube and maybe 
provide not only some metrics, but really your may be three to five year 
vision of its rolling video distribution between Google TV and the fiber 
project and some of the other options. For Nikesh, could you talk a little bit 
about emerging markets and where Android really is the dominant not only 
in scale, mobile computing platforms, and what may drive that to show 
faster international growth, if its having sales force or purchasing power or 
something else and maybe Patrick, c
ould you help us understand a little bit 
the FX headwind on the top line how it might have been expressed moving 
down the P&L especially in sort of net profit terms. Thanks very much.
 
Lawrence Page
 

, Nikesh 
mentioned Google TV for a while, I think recently kind of YouTube transition 
from maybe a year ago, to be really something that keeps me entertained 
for hours on the TV. It can play back, lots of really high quality, highly 
exciting things, they a
re now kind of tailored for me, my channels and so on 
and I think we have tremendously increasing YouTube usage, continues to 

causes people to put more content on it, and to monetize it 
worldwide, kind 
of in a blink of an eye you can put things up.
 
So I was just, the recent video of horse dancing, came in style. I have been 
watching, its 400 million views now 

 
500 million. And that kind of thing to 
really just put the switch, turn it on,
 
get a worldwide distribution and sort of 

 
almost without doing any work, if you are a provider of this content is an 

continue to grow that. It is going to be available everywhere
 
on your mobile, 


experience, and provide a great experience for the advertisers, true view is 
exploding, 
which gives us high quality ads from an end user standpoint, 
because they can skip some if they want. So it encourages paths that are 


 

excited about all that.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks Richard. As far as the emerging markets in Android, I mean I think 

platform in many markets, outside the U.S. not 
just the U.S. I think in terms 
of what drive, I am not sure if your question is about faster growth of 
Android or faster growth of monetization on Android platforms. I think on 

prod
ucing Android devices on the bleeding edge and doing a phenomenal job 
of working with operators in those market and distributing them, so we think 
that will continue because and Android is providing to be a great platform for 
innovation for all the OEM.
 
In
 
addition to that as more and more people use mobile device, I think 

used, we are seeing an increasing in query growth and we are seeing our 
various new ad formats and ads where we b
ring context into account is 
actually helping us monetize. So I think both those trends are going in the 
right direction. Hopefully that provides more opportunity for us.

hedge a number of kind of major currencies like the Euro, the Pound, the 
Canadian Dollar, few others which is the core of our program, and not
 
only 
but actually our hedge program is certainly designed for long
-
term kind of 

way we should perform for three months kind of timeframe in our financial 

y also build to make sure, I guess you had a cost

term, you are not going to get 
us much benefit as it is a big dislocation. So for all t
hese reasons and then 

whole slue of currencies this quarter, which these smaller currencies just 

in the puzzle

over to Nikesh for the last question.

excited that we actually went on a full rollout for product listing ads and as 


Larry talked about getting more precise information. We believe that users 
when they search they come exploring on the web, when they have a better 
idea, what they are trying to buy. They start
 
expressing intent by being 
more precise of what they ask for.
 
And we believe being able to do product listing ads gets us closer to intent 
because if somebody types a Nikon D800 then we know they are looking to 
buy or looking to get more information about
 
a specific product and the fact 
that we can show them reviews pictures and pricing information gets us 

more monetization and a better monetization for us as opposed to having 
just 


comment whether that has an impact in Q4 or not.

Great. Thanks. Larry, bigger picture 
question on your mobile comments, 
would you give us some rough sense of how long it could take to close the 
bulk of the gap between desktop and mobile monetization, is this a matter of 
quarters or years that will see that come together. And then maybe just
 
you 
made a quick comment on travel weakness last quarter, I think you said 
travel was strong across the board. And then you came back today and said 
it sounds like that was a weaker category, just anymore color on the 
weakness of travel? Thanks.

Thanks Brian for the question. And we have kind of policy of not talking 

impatient and I think, I kind of reiterate what I said that we are positioned 
well, very, very well, 
and uniquely well, because we have hardly very 


for long, long time right, our mobile monetization is not 

significant number.
 


huge, to have us in a very good spot and I think we have opportunity 
to be 
higher monetization than where we are now. Put some innovation which 


advertisers are ads still requires th
ey spend some metric to deal with mobile 
in general.
 



 
happening relatively 
quickly, and I think advertisers will also react to that, and you will see them 
invest, more efforts in targeting those users, running apps for them in phone 
which holds obviously benefit our monetization there. Actually we have a lot
 
of trends working for us, so I am not worried about this in terms of our 

better positioned than most other companies. I guess (inaudible) estimate, 
short
-
term impact and I am quite 
impatient.

in there, one of them is clearly 

 
there is seasonality in travel, so obviously 

-
over
-
quarter, and then as we 

 
the same 
news you read about Eur
ope or other parts of the world that are in different 
economic situations. You will notice that if you kind of track Google Trends 
and you go and mine into the data, you will see that some sectors are 
performing better, others are not, and as I mentioned i
n my commentary, at 
the very beginning, travel and retail has been somewhat weak in Europe just 
given their situation, so no real surprises there Brian. Thank you for you 
questions.
 
Just before we close, I just want to take a ten seconds on behalf of Nikes
h, 
Larry and myself thanking in the amazing work of our Googlers, all our 

Motorola and Google.
 

to cl
ose the call.

Yeah, I just want to thank all of you after spending so much time with us

Gregory Brown
 
Thanks, Dean. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Motorola had a 
very good third quarter across all of our businesses. On a year
-
over
-
year 
basis, overall sales, earnings and total 
cash are all higher. Additionally, we 
also continue to make excellent progress on our planned separation.
 
Our reported sales were $4.9 billion, up nearly 13% over the same period a 
year ago. This excludes the portion of the Networks business to be acquired
 
by Nokia Siemens Networks, which is classified as discontinued operations. If 
we were to include sales from discontinued operations, sales would have 
been $5.8 billion, up 6% over the year
-
ago quarter. This is the first top line 
growth quarter for Motorol
a since the fourth quarter of 2006, and was driven 
by growth in Mobile Devices, Home and Enterprise Mobility Solutions.
 
Non
-
GAAP earnings, including both continuing and discontinued operations 
were $0.16 a share. This exceeded our guidance of $0.10 to $0.1
2 per share 
that we provided on the last earnings call. Ed will comment further on the 
reporting changes associated with our planned sale to NSN and our third 
quarter results in a few moments.
 
In the quarter, Mobile Devices increased smartphone shipments t
o 3.8 
million units and achieved operating profitability on a non
-
GAAP basis. In 
Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, 
sales grew 9% year
-
over
-
year driven by strong demand in the Enterprise 
markets. Operating margin and 
cash generation were very strong as well. In 
Networks, financial performance also continued to be very strong, again, in 
the third quarter. Solid operating profitability, combined with continued 
balance sheet management resulted in $502 million of operatin
g cash flow. 
As a result, total cash at the end of the quarter increased to $9 billion.
 
During the quarter, we made further progress in our plan to create two 
independent public companies, which included finalizing various company 
agreements and completing
 
further updates to Motorola Mobility's Form 10 
Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Separation of Motorola Mobility 
and Motorola Solutions remains targeted for some time in the first quarter of 
2011.
 
I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide addi
tional details on the financial 
results for the quarter. I'll then come back to review Motorola Solutions and 
then Sanjay will discuss Motorola Mobility. Ed?
 
Edward Fitzpatrick
 
Thanks, Greg. I'll begin today by outlining the changes we have made in our 
fin
ancial reporting. First, financial results related to the portion of the 
Networks business to be acquired by NSN are now classified as discontinued 
operations. As such, they are not included in the Motorola reported sales or 
in earnings from continuing ope
rations. Second, the results of operations for 
previously disposed businesses, which were deemed to be immaterial at the 
time of the disposition, have now been reclassified from the Enterprise 
Mobility Solutions segment as discontinued operations. These bu
sinesses 
include an Israel
-
based wireless network operator, the biometrics business 
and good technology.
 
The assets and liabilities of the portion of the Networks business to be 
acquired by NSN and the assets and liabilities of previously disposed 
business
es prior to the disposal are now reported assets and liabilities held 
for sale in the applicable reporting periods. Third, the iDen Infrastructure 
business and certain licensing activities formally related to the Networks 
business are now reported as part 
of the Enterprise Mobility Solutions 
segment. Finally, certain operating costs, which historically have been 
allocated to Networks are now allocated to EMS segment since the 
underlying activities will not be transferred to NSN. This is an understanding 
of 
these changes on a historical basis a revised presentation in the results of 
Motorola and EMS segment for 2007 to the first half of 2010 we recently 
filed in 8
-
K and can be found on our website. Previously reported segment 
results for Mobile Devices and Ho
me are unchanged. With that, I'll turn to 
our financial results for the quarter.
 
Motorola sales from continuing operations were $4.9 billion in the third 
quarter, up 13% from the third quarter of 2009. As Greg mentioned, 
inclusive of discontinued operation
s, third quarter sales would have been 
$5.8 million, up 6% from the third quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, third 
quarter total earnings were $0.05 per share. These results include $0.00 per 
share from continuing operations and $0.05 per share from discont
inued 
operations, which I've described earlier.
 
On a non
-
GAAP basis, total earnings were $0.16 per share, which exceeded 
our guidance of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. In addition to solid operating 
results in Mobile Devices, Home and EMS, our strong earnings p
erformance 
reflected continued CDMA momentum and network favorable to other 
income and expense results and a lower tax rate.
 
Non
-
GAAP adjustments in the quarter totaled $0.12 per share, including 
piloted items, totaling a net expense of $0.08 per share. Th
is is comprised of 
expenses associated with restructuring and separation and a non
-
cash 
income tax expense related to anticipated capital reductions and certain 
foreign operations, partially offset by income
-
related to an IP reserve and 
stock compensation 
and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share 
consistent with prior quarters.
 
For continuing operations, non
-
GAAP earnings were $0.12 per share. This 
compares to $0.04 per share in the second quarter and $0.01 per share in 
the year ago quarter. Further de
tails on non
-
GAAP earnings are included as 
part of today's press release and available on our website. All remaining 
financial references will exclude discontinued operations, highlighted items, 
stock compensation expense and intangible amortization.
 
Gross
 
margin percentage in the quarter increased to 36.8% from 33.3% in 
the third quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by improvements in both 
Mobile Devices and Home. Sequentially, gross margin percentage was up 
slightly, reflecting margin percentage impro
vement in each business offset 
partially by a shift in business mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were 
flat sequentially and up 8% year
-
over
-
year. The increase was driven by 
investments in sales and marketing to support business growth and new 
product
 
introductions. Total other income and expense was a lower net 
expense and anticipated due to lower net interest expense and favorable 
results associated with foreign currency translation and investments held in 
the Sigma fund.
 
With the exclusion of networ
ks and other changes in the geographical mix of 
income anticipated for the year, we now expect a full year ongoing tax rate 
of 34% to 35%, down from our previous estimate of 36% to 37%. This 
change, along with the favorable tax adjustment, resulted an ongo
ing tax 
rate in the quarter of 28%.
 
Moving now for the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating 
cash flow of $502 million, including a third consecutive quarter of improving 
cash flow results in Mobile Devices. Total inventory increased by $28
0 
million sequentially, driven primarily by anticipated fourth quarter demand in 
Mobile Devices. Inventory turned 9x down, compared to 11 turns in the 
second quarter and flat with nine turns in the third quarter of last year.
 
Accounts receivable also incre
ased in the quarter, reflecting a sequential 
sales growth. Days sales outstanding were 60 days compared to 61 days in 
the second quarter and 58 days in the year
-
ago quarter. Total cash at the 
end of the quarter was $9 billion compared to $8.3 billion at th
e end of the 
second quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion 
compared to $4.9 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the third 
quarter of 2009.
 
Turning now to our outlook. We expect fourth quarter earnings from 
continuing ope
rations to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per share. This 
guidance excludes a portion of the Networks business that is held for sale, 
stock
-
based compensation and intangible amortization of $0.04 per share 
and items historically highlighted in our quart
erly earnings release.
 
With that, I'll pass the call to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions.
 
Gregory Brown
 
Thanks, Ed. In the EMS, third quarter sales were over $1.9 billion, up 9% 
compared to the year
-
ago quarter. Enterprise markets continued to 
perform 
well, evidenced again by double
-
digit sales growth in all four geographic 
regions. In the government market, sales were up slightly against the year
-
ago quarter. New orders, particularly in the Enterprise remain solid, resulting 
in an increase in t
otal overall EMS backlog compared to the end of the 
second quarter. Operating margin was 16.5% compared to 15.9% in the 
second quarter and 16.9% in the third quarter of last year.
 
Third quarter sales in North America grew 5% year
-
over
-
year. Growth was 
driv
en by Enterprise markets, primarily retail. On the government side, sales 
were higher and orders included major public safety wins with the U.S. 
Marshals Service, Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, 
Nashville
-
Davidson County Metropolitan Govern
ment in Tennessee and the 
State of Arkansas. Demand for the recently announced ES400 Enterprise 
Digital Assistant has been strong. The ES400 offers Enterprise grade 
durability and functionality for business critical applications, and it recently 
began ship
ping and will be available globally during the fourth quarter.
 
In the EMEA, total sales were up 13% in the quarter. Growth continue to be 
driven by Enterprise markets, including personal shopping and field Mobility 
Solutions for retail, manufacturing, tran
sportation and logistics customers. 
Radio solutions sales were also higher due in part to continued analog to 
digital transition.
 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to a year ago. Enterprise 
markets and Public Safety continue to perform very
 
well. And finally, 
yesterday, it was announced that we signed a three
-
year extension to our 
iDEN Infrastructure supply agreements with NII, a leading provider of mobile 
communications for business customers in Latin America. In the quarter, we 
expanded ou
r mobile computing portfolio with the MC65, a compact, rugged 
Enterprise mobile computer with integrated GPS and data capture. The MC65 
is aimed at improving productivity and task
-
oriented environments including 
Field Service, field sales, transportation a
nd Public Safety.
 
We also announced MOTOTRBO connect plus, a scalable two
-
way radio 
system designed to accommodate high
-
volume, wide
-
area communications 
for mobile work teams. We expanded our APX P25 mission
-
critical two
-
way 
radio series with additional mo
biles and portables, including radios designed 
for extreme situations and single
-
band users and the first encrypted 
mission
-
critical Bluetooth earpiece, enabling secure communications when 
paired with our APX Portable radios.
 
Finally, we had the next
-
gener
ation interoperability solution, which increases 
the effectiveness of first responders by connecting disparate radio systems 
and allowing them to operate as one.
 
Regarding Public Safety broadband on our last call, we announced that we 
were awarded the firs
t phase of a 700 megahertz LTE Public Safety network 
to serve multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement 
represents the initial step in deploying a unified state
-
of
-
the
-
art private 
mission
-
critical broadband network. As Public Safety s
ystems are expanded 
to include broadband data, they will need to inter
-
operate with carrier 
networks. To this end, we recently signed a significant partnership with 
Ericsson. In this arrangement, Ericsson will provide LTE
-
based station 
equipment to Motorol
a. We will configure it. We will harden it for Public 
Safety use, and we will provide the overall broadband network solution 
architecture for our customers.
 
With respect to the Networks business in July, we announced that NSN 
would purchase the majority of
 
our wireless network assets, including CDMA, 
GSM, WiMAX and LTE. In this transaction, which is expected to close by 
early 2011, we will receive approximately $1.35 billion in value, including 
$1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts re
ceivables. In 
the third quarter, the portion of the Networks business being acquired by 
NSN accounted for $871 million in sales and $177 million in GAAP earnings. 
The strong results were again driven primarily by the CDMA business in 
North America.
 
Before 
we move to our outlook for EMS and Networks, I want to provide 
some background on the EMS cost structure. As Ed mentioned earlier, there 
are costs associated with certain activities previously allocated to Networks 
which will not be part of the NSN transac
tion. These costs are now allocated 
to EMS. So as we head toward separation, we are identifying and taking the 
appropriate actions to better align our cost structure for the remaining 
businesses. These actions may include facility rationalization, discreti
onary 
spending reductions and where necessary, staff reductions. We do not 
expect these actions to impact our critical R&D priorities or our critical 
customer facing operations.
 
Regarding our outlook for EMS for the fourth quarter and taking into 
considera
tion the impact of our discontinued operations reporting, we expect 
sales and operating margin to be higher on a sequential basis, and we 
expect full year sales growth of 7% to 8%, with full year operating margin of 
approximately 16%.
 
For the Networks busi
ness classified in discontinued operations, in the fourth 
quarter, we expect sequentially higher sales, including the higher WiMAX 
sales and lower CDMA sales. With the change in product mix, we expect 
operating margin to be lower, resulting in approximatel
y $0.03 per share for 
discontinued operations. This is not incorporated in the guidance Ed provided 
earlier of $0.14 to $0.16 per share, which comprises only continuing 
operations.
 
And with that, I'll now pass the call over to Sanjay to discuss Motorola 
Mo
bility.
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Thanks, Greg, and good morning. Mobile Devices reached a major milestone 
in the third quarter. We were profitable for the first time in over three and a 
half years. Our sales surpassed $2 billion and were up 20% year
-
over
-
year. 
Total shi
pments were 9.1 million units, including smartphone shipment of 
3.8 million units. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $223 from $207 in 
the second quarter, driven by smartphones, which continue to account for 
over half of our total sales.
 
In North Ame
rica, smartphone sales remained strong, led by our family of 
DROID devices. Devices at other U.S. carriers continue to perform well also. 
In a recent JD Power survey of smartphone users, Motorola ranked number 
two in the U.S. in customer satisfaction, reco
gnition of our focus and high
-
quality consumer experiences.
 
Sales outside of North America grew 10% sequentially and accounted for 
32% of total sales. Operating profit in the quarter of $3 million compares to 
a loss of $109 million in the second quarter. T
he sequential improvement 
was driven by a higher smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross 
margin percentage. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined 
also.
 
Since our last earnings call, we have added 12 devices to our smartphone 
portfo
lio, all of which will be in stores for the holiday season. This brings the 
number of smartphones we have introduced this year to 22. In North 
America, DROID X continues to sell extremely well. DROID 2, which features 
an improved keyboard and faster proces
sor compared to the original DROID 
also sold well in the quarter. Earlier in the month, we announced DROID 
PRO, our first device optimized for both personal and business use. Usable in 
over 200 countries, it features a one gigahertz processor, candy bar fo
rm 
factor, QWERTY keyboard and Adobe Flash 10.1. To address corporate 
connectivity and security needs, we have added security features on top of 
Android OS. This makes our devices more secure and more manageable in 
using standard Enterprise tools and techn
ologies. As a result, we expect 
DROID PRO to be very competitive with other devices in the market aimed 
at business users.
 
Finally at Verizon, we announced CITRUS, an entry
-
level pocketable device 
with an eco
-
friendly design for first
-
time smartphone users
. At AT&T, we 
launched three more devices: BRAVO, FLIPSIDE and FLIPOUT. With a variety 
of screen sizes and form factors and affordable retail price points, these 
devices give consumers added choice in their smartphone experiences.
 
Another device that we be
lieve will gain strong consumer acceptance is 
DEFY. Optimized for active lifestyle, DEFY is compact, water
-
resistant, 
scratch
-
resistant and dust
-
proof. It draws on our successes in designing and 
delivering rugged, durable Mobile Devices.
 
In addition to T
-
M
obile, DEFY is also available in a number of markets 
outside of U.S. Outside North America, sales growth was driven by a 30% 
sequential growth in smartphone revenues. In China, our second
-
largest 
smartphone market we're one of the leading Android Smartphon
e suppliers. 
Unit shipments were up over 70% sequentially. We launched five new 
Smartphones, including three marketed under our well
-
known MING brand. 
MING has been a Motorola brand in China since 2006. It represents devices 
developed specifically for Chin
ese consumers that featured distinctive 
designs, including a signature transparent flip cover. This devices bring our 
total China Smartphone portfolio to 13%, all released in less than a year.
 
In Latin America, the Smartphone market is gaining traction as 
mid
-
 
and 
low
-
tier devices become available. Unit shipments in the quarter were up 
over 20% sequentially. Earlier this month, we announced SPICE, an 
affordable smartphone, which we'll launch initially in Brazil and then expand 
into other markets. This bring
s the number of smartphones we have 
introduced in the region to 10.
 
In Western Europe, we are making good progress. Sales increased 
sequentially across a broad range of devices, including the recently launched 
Milestone 2 and DEFY. The majority of our new 
devices feature enhanced 
MOTOBLUR capabilities. Improvements to MOTOBLUR provide consumers 
with increased control over their mobile experiences, device customization 
and device management. In addition, with over 3 million users, MOTOBLUR 
provides us with i
mportant feedback for our future product and experience 
development.
 
Finally, we added to our portfolio of Bluetooth companion devices that allow 
consumers to stay productive and hands
-
free. Device shipping in the fourth 
quarter feature advanced noise
-
canc
ellation technology and include the first 
device to give consumers the option to respond to text with their voice.
 
As we look ahead, we will continue to enhance and broaden our smartphone 
portfolio. With the belief that one size does not fit all, our smart
phone focus 
will continue in three primary areas: First, high
-
performance smartphones as 
the leading edge of innovation that deliver the best experiences to 
consumers who enjoy everything that mobile Internet has to offer, including 
multimedia, gaming and 
social collaboration; second, devices with broad 
appeal that meet the browsing and social messaging needs of consumers 
who are interested in intuitive, easy
-
to
-
use, pocketable devices with 
affordable data plans; and third, devices that address the rapidly 
growing 
opportunity with business users. These consumers want to stay informed 
and connected in their work life and their personal life and make their own 
technology choices.
 
Increasingly, CIO support giving employees a choice. If giving that choice, 
we be
lieve a large number of business users will seriously consider an 
alternative to their current device brand.
 
Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter on a sequential basis, we 
expect unit shipments and total sales to be higher. The sequential increase
 
in smartphone shipments will be driven largely by our mid
-
ranged devices. 
We expect operating earnings to be higher due to higher sales offset 
partially by an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support the large 
number of new product launches. Fo
r the year, smartphone shipments are 
now expected to hit the upper end of our 12 million to 14 million unit range.
 
Launching over 20 Smartphone devices and achieving profitability have been 
major goals for us in the transition of this business. Attaining t
hese 
milestones has been made possible by a tremendous amount of work by a 
dedicated team of people here at Motorola. These accomplishments are 
reflective of the innovation and determination of the Mobile Devices 
organization.
 
Turning now to the 
results for the Home in the third quarter. Home sales 
were $912 million, up 3% sequentially. Sales of digital entertainment 
devices were higher and reflected an improved mix, including higher demand 
for Mocha enabled set
-
tops for whole Home digital network
s. Sales of video 
and access infrastructure were up over 30% year
-
over
-
year and continue to 
account for over 25% of total Home sales.
 
Looking regionally, sales in North America were flat year
-
on
-
year. Sales 
outside of North America were higher and accounte
d for approximately 25% 
of total Home sales. We continue to improve profitability, with operating 
margin increasing to 8.4% from 5% in third quarter of last year. 
Improvement in the quarter was driven by a more favorable product mix and 
a reduction in oper
ating costs.
 
In Home, our R&D effort continues to be directed towards leveraging our 
video leadership to deliver solutions that support the trend towards more 
personalized content and services. This includes digital Home networks, 3D 
TV, interactive servic
es and converged experiences. That said, with 
continued macro
-
environment challenges, we are also focused on prioritizing 
our current product portfolio and tightly managing the cost structure.
 
With respect to enhancing the portfolio, during the quarter, we
 
launched the 
Motorola EDGE software solution. With these applications, operators can 
more easily manage broadband services in a multi
-
screen digital Home. 
They also help operators to reduce operating costs and accelerate revenue
-
producing services. We als
o announced a hosted switch to digital video 
solution. This solution will enable independent video operators to achieve 
bandwidth efficiencies previously available only to operators with on
-
site 
capabilities.
 
Finally, we supported Verizon with the launch o
f its multi
-
screen video 
service by providing our Medios software suite. This solution facilitates the 
preparation of content for distribution and enable subscriber to share video 
mix devices such as set
-
tops, personal computers and smartphones.
 
Turning to
 
our outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect Home sales and 
operating earnings to be sequentially higher. For the full year, despite the 
top line decline, we continue to expect to deliver higher operating margin 
compared to 2009.
 
In closing, Motorola's 
business has performed very well in the quarter and 
have good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. We also continue to 
focus on our preparations to create two public companies in the first quarter. 
Motorola Mobility will be well positioned to address 
the growing opportunity 
in Smartphones and converged experiences. And Motorola Solution will be 
poised to leverage its leadership position in mission
-
critical and business
-
critical communication solutions.
 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Dean 
to start the Q&A.
 
Dean Lindroth
 
Thanks, Sanjay. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can you now provide our 
callers with instructions on how to ask a question?
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] It looks like our first question is c
oming from Brian 
Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
 
Brian Modoff

Deutsche Bank AG
 
Sanjay, a question for you. Verizon as a percent of your Smartphone 
revenues, obviously, they got an iPhone. And a lot of speculation of an 
iPhone in Q1, and I'm curious as what is
 
Verizon represents as a percent of 
your total smartphone sales? And how do you plan to deal with that new 
competition and the key customer in Q1 time frame, which is around the 
time you also wanted to?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Verizon has been a very important customer
 
for us. I don't think we have 
broken out our revenue partition to Verizon, in particular. But to address the 
substance of your question, we expect to continue a very meaningful 
relationship with Verizon. We think the DROID franchise is economically very 
v
aluable for Verizon, and they will continue to invest and foster the DROID 
franchise. And as you know, we are a meaningful participant in that 
franchise. We will also diversify our portfolio within United States with other 
operators. We are also focused on
 
diversifying our portfolio outside of the 
United States. As we said, we have seen meaningful increase in our revenue 
in China, and we expect that we will focus in expanding our presence in 
China and Latin America, and to a certain extent, in Europe also. 
We have, 
as I look into 2011, we have very multiple design wins with a number of 
operators, both in the United States and elsewhere. And as we look further 
beyond just the smartphone category, I see opportunities for us in the 
converged category as we see 
convergence between computing and 
mobility. So if you look at all of these factors, I feel that, clearly, in first 
quarter, there will be some seasonality and there will be competitive 
pressure as there is in fourth quarter. But we feel comfortable with ou
r 
position in light of some of the factors that you mentioned.
 
Operator
 
And we'll take our next question from the side of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
 
Rod Hall 
-
 
JP Morgan
 
Sanjay, I wonder if you could comment on the status of the MOTOBLUR 
project, particularly
 
the investment trajectory there? Have you guys reduced 
significantly investment in MOTOBLUR? And then, I also wonder if you could 
just comment on your view of the ability that you've got now to differentiate 
yourself on the Android platform itself as oppo
sed to via your hardware.
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Rod, as I mentioned, we have over 3 million subscribers now. And really 
close to a 12
-
month period, we have added 3 million subscribers to our 
MOTOBLUR service. We get tremendous satisfaction in our surveys from our 
cus
tomers with the MOTOBLUR service. And we get a great deal of value in 
understanding what our customers are doing and how we can serve them 
better. So MOTOBLUR service has been a good success for us, and our 
investment continues, if anything, at a higher pa
ce moving forward. We 
believe that providing end
-
to
-
end solution to our consumers is going to be 
important. To address the second part of your question, we see the following 
ways that we will differentiate. First of all, we will focus on certain key 
experi
ences on top of the Android ecosystem. One, you've seen the recent 
focus on Enterprise experiences. Second, I think you would see us focused a 
lot more on MOTOBLUR as a service and making sure that we provide end
-
to
-
end services from a point of view of per
sonalization, customization, as 
well as diagnostic support. These devices are getting more and more 
complex, and our consumers want support to make sure that their devices 
are working extremely well. So I think that will be very important for us. But 
beyon
d some of those differentiation, you mentioned our hardware 
differentiation already. I really believe that our brand, our distribution, our 
execution and time, our IP position and the combination of Home and Mobile 
Devices gives us competitive advantage in
 
the marketplace.
 
Rod Hall 
-
 
JP Morgan
 
And, Sanjay, if I could just follow
-
up on that. How supportive do you see as 
Google in your efforts to differentiate the platform, particularly in your 
MOTOBLUR developments? Do you feel like they're a supportive part
ner 
there?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
I think Google has taken the view that this ecosystem is better for the 
diversity that it supports. That, clearly, our points of views that this diversity 
fragments this ecosystem. I think we have taken the view that 
fragmentation, th
e definition of fragmentation as being the ability to run all 
applications on all devices. And we are very, in this ecosystem, careful to 
make sure all applications can run on all devices. And beyond that, the 
diversity of devices and the pace of innovatio
n in this ecosystem has been 
very helpful. And our ability to differentiate has actually helped the Android 
ecosystem in the shipment in this category. So I think that they're 
supportive.
 
Rod Hall

I just have one housekeeping question, 
which is EMS revenues, excluding 
iDEN. Is there anyway we could get that number, excluding the iDEN 
adjustment for the quarter?

It's, Rod, it's actually pretty minor. We had revenue growth of 9% all in, 
including iDEN Infrastructure. If 
you take out iDEN Infrastructure, revenue 
growth goes to 8%, 8.5% to 8%. So it's very modest.

Sanjay, does continuing with a meaningful 
relationship with Verizon next 
year imply a sharp increase in sales and marketing spend for Motorola? In 
aggregate, will carriers, their supported advertising it include others such as 
AT&T next year, will that be greater next year than this year? Or does 
Motorola have to make up the balance to push the incremental unit?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Mark, let me just restate the question so I got it. You're saying given the 
relationship with Verizon, I think the highest level question is, would you 
have to spend more marketi
ng to support your products as you diversify in 
U.S. Did I get that right? Okay well, I'll proceed with that assumption. I 
think that, let me just say it this way, that I think we will make sure that we 
support our products. As I said, from fourth quarter 
of this year, we will take 
special care to support our products. We expect this fourth quarter to be 
particularly competitive, and we will spend the marketing dollars to support 
it in fourth quarter. As we go into 2011, I really am quite pleased with the 
t
raction that we've got with our portfolio across a number of operators. Our 
relationship with Verizon continues to be very good, and the support that we 
expect from carriers continues to be very good. But my anticipation is that 
we will be flat to higher i
n our marketing spend in 2011 compared to 2010.

Sanjay, if I could just follow
-
up on that same line of thinking a little bit. You
 
talked about Europe growing a little bit sequentially. Could you just talk to 
us a little bit. Obviously, it's a very important smartphone market, and if you 
want to be really successful outside of the U.S., you're going to need that 
market. How do you go
 
about restarting a market where Motorola used to 
have a pretty strong position, but now is coming from a very low market 
share. What are the costs? And what's kind of the timing that you think that 
we could see Europe become more meaningful part of your b
usiness?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Throughout 2010, we've had products in France, in U.K., in Germany. And in 
Germany, in particular, actually we've done well. You would see going 
forward in fourth quarter, we will have DEFY and Milestone 2 in particular in 
a number of c
ountries with a number of operators in Europe. So we are 
making progress in Europe, even in fourth quarter of this year. In 2011, I 
think we will have opportunities to expand our presence. But the central 
question facing us is will we make a substantial in
vestment to make a big 
re
-
entry into European market? And I frankly can't tell you the answer 
today. We always have to make the calculation of whether those dollars are 
better spent in the U.S., China, Latin America or Europe. We will make that 
determinati
on as our relationship, continued improvement in our relationship 
happens in Europe. But second half 2011 is the earliest that I can anticipate 
making that decision, but we've not made that decision yet.

If I could start with a clarification. Sanjay, you talked about some 
seasonality in Q1, is that a commentary on total handsets or smart phone 
units? And then the question is that, you've done a great
 
job of lowering 
your break
-
even point in the Mobile Device business. If we assume that 
there is a decline in the handset units and revenue in Q1, even for this 
quarter's levels. And then, taking your comment about flat to up sales and 
marketing in 2011, s
hould we assume that Q1 might go back into the red? 
Or are there some other variable costs within the business where you can 
further lower your break
-
even mark?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Maynard, as you know, we tend not to guide two quarters in advance. So I 
will not gi
ve you precision, but I understand your question. I'll make the 
following comments. First of all, my comments with relation to seasonality 
where for industry seasonality, we have seen over the last few years 
between 7% and 10% seasonality, and we expect th

quarter, 
from fourth quarter to first quarter, we will see a decline in smartphone 
sales. As I said earlier, there are some particular competitive situations 
developing in first quarter. And of course, we have large number of new 
product intr
oductions, and execution and timing of those launches will be 
very important for us. But as I look more broadly at our portfolio in 2011, I 
feel extremely comfortable, extremely comfortable that we are well 
positioned. I won't guide you with specificity ab
out some of the particular 
things that you talked about. The only thing I would say is that we have 
been very diligent about managing our cost structure and optimizing our 
cost structure as the need has arisen. So we will keep that in mind also.

Sanjay, your pro forma profitable with ASP is up and units growing faster at 
the market. But if I heard you right, it seemed that you're point
ing more 
toward the midrange be forward. Was that a signal that ASPs have stopped 
going up, or just be going up more slowly, especially here in the fourth 
quarter? And I was also hoping we could just get a comment from you on 
integrating Androids' Gingerbr
ead 3.0 on tablets and maybe what the impact 
is there on the ASPs?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
A few comments there. First of all, your question was what is my 
expectation can I guide to ASP in fourth quarter. I've actually 
--
 
it really 
does depend, as you point out, to th
e product mix. We have some very, very 
good high
-
end products in the marketplace, and they're performing 
extremely well. But as we see our base expanding, we see more midrange 
shipments. So I can't, with precision, tell you what our ASP will be, but those 
are the factors that will drive that. Going forward, in terms of tablets, it's not 
clear if gingerbread is the right platform for tablets or not. I think that will 
become clear over a period of time. We are very engaged in the tablet 
market. And certainly,
 
I think tablets have the possibility, depending on the 
volume and mix, of driving our ASP higher.

The first one is this past quarter, you had 
system competition at Verizon 
with other Android devices. And in volume, and there was even a Buy One 
Get One free, I think for Samsung. So can you describe the environment, 
what happened at Verizon from all aspects kind of pricing, margins, 
advertisement,
 
money you had to put in? What happened when you had new 
competition coming from multiple vendors? So that's question number one. 
Number two is about accounts payable, cash flow was positive but majority 
or all of the increase was obtained from account pay
able increase. Can you 
elaborate on that?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
The first question I think was what happened with the competition in this 
quarter at Verizon. I mean, I think if you look at our shipment, I've felt that 
DROID X and DROID 2 continued to perform extremel
y well. There is clearly 
a big increase in Android shipment at Verizon going on, and I believe that 
was highlighted in their earnings call just recently. We see HTC and 
Samsung as our primary competitor in Android, and we feel like we're very 
well position
ed, both with our brand name, with our support, with the 
consumer satisfaction, with JD Powers satisfaction rating and the quality of 
our products at Verizon and other carriers in the United States. And I think 
that, that was reflected somewhat in our resu
lts. In terms of accounts 
payable, what was the...

What was the question? Can you please repeat the question in accounts 
payable, Tal, please?

BofA Merrill Lynch
 
So, Sanjay, my question was not about the success of Verizon bu
t about 
your changes. Did you have to change anything in the way you deal with 
Verizon during the quarter because you had new competition. So did you 
have to lower prices, or did you have to increase the marketing expenses? 
I'm trying to understand how to 
change behavior when you have a new 
competition with the carrier for the same kind of class of phones. About the 
account payable cash flow went up but all of the cash flow increase came 
from accounts payable, so I'm wondering if there's anything there or i
t's just 
quarterly fluctuations?
 
Edward Fitzpatrick
 
On the first question, accounts payable, it's strictly timing guided. It all 
relates to linearity of shipments and linearity of products coming in the door. 
We pay our bills as they come due like clockwor
k. So there's really no 
fluctuation there as a result of anything other than fluctuations in levels of 
business.
 
Sanjay Jha
 
And, Tal, with respect to how we respond to competitive pressure, I think 
probably a little of both. Certainly, there's greater ASP 
pressure, but also we 
look to support our products a little more aggressively with marketing 
dollars. But probably a little of both, on the other hand, I think the quality of 
our product has also shown through and the shipments support that.

Ehud Gelblum

Morgan Stanley
 
First of all, as we look at the various version of Android and it goes into 
gingerbread, honeycomb, et cetera, there's been some talk that you may 
not be able to do things like BLUR on future versions of Android. If you can 
just talk about, if there are modifications or future versions of Android that 
would limit your ability to do some of the overlays like BLUR and how you 
would treat that? Or if th
at's not really an issue that would be helpful to 
understand that. And then, following up with some other questions. When 
you look at your Q4 guidance, you're now talking about the high end of $12 
million to $14 million does that imply a certain number nor
th of $5 million 
for the fourth quarter? Can you talk about how you get there vis
-
à
-
vis your 
current main customer base? Obviously, the larger is AT&T, but how much 
more is China going to be in the mix? I believe China right now is 
somewhere around 12%, 13
% of your units. Where does that go in the 
fourth quarter to get you up almost 1.5 million to 2 million units from Q3? 
And if you can kind of, again, just talk about at least geographically, if not 
more specific as to how you get from the 3.7 million now i
nto the 5 million 
more, where they are coming from so we could feel comfortable that you 
can actually get there without relying continually on, essentially Verizon and 
the same guys that you have them? And then, just for Greg, North America 
seem to have sl
owed in government to decelerate let's say about 5% year
-
over
-
year growth versus I believe it was north of 10% last quarter. Is that 
just a function of how the seasons work and the ups and downs of the year
-
over
-
year, or is there something going on with No
rth America maybe going 
to the end of the year?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Ehud, I will take the first two part of your questions, Andriod OS. I have no 
indication from anybody that our ability to differentiate is going to be 
limited. I think that question has come up a c
ouple of times, and I've been 
consistent my response on that. In fourth quarter, what will drive our 
growth? Two things really: One, continued performance of our what we call 
high
-
tier performance category products; and then secondly, diversification 
in th
e mid
-
tier at other carriers in United States, but also China and 
internationally, Latin America and Europe. I think those are the things that 
will drive it. Generally, as you know, fourth quarter, there's general uplift in 
sales in our business. There's t
hat effect. But also the diversification with 
mid
-
tier products will be a very important part of our sales growth. And on 
the other hand, I don't want to minimize the importance of DROID X and 
DROID 2 for us also.
 
Ehud Gelblum

So should we
 
be looking for international perhaps getting as high as 40%?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
I don't know that I will guide you with that precision, but there will be 
growth in international sales, yes.
 
Edward Fitzpatrick
 
Ehud, as it relates to EMS, North America as you menti
oned, grew 5%. I 
think if you'd take a composite look for all of Q3 across EMS, government 
grew about 1.5% and Enterprise grew about 20%. So we had very strong 
performance from the Enterprise Mobility or traditionally the Symbol Group. 
But having said that
, backlog was up slightly, generally stable for 
government and up more strongly for the Enterprise Mobility group. So I 
think we're solidly positioned into Q4. And the annual guidance reflects our 
expectations for the fourth quarter.

Do you expect government to recover next year, or do you expect it to still

So cash

I'll give you kind of rough terms in the area of 45% U.S., the

Our overall cash flow. So, as you know, we have a $530 million thereabouts 
debt payment due in the quarte
r. We're going to offset that much of that as 
possible. If I had to arrange it for you, we're probably in the 8 7 to 8 8 range 
is where we are. And there are a lot of things that can happen with foreign 
currency fluctuations as we mentioned on the call tha
t could leave it out as 
far and as well as linearity in the business. So I think in the 8 7 to 8 8 range 
is where should be looking right now.

For Greg, this LTE deal, kind of curious as to why you selected Ericsso
n over 
Nokia. And then also, how will that partnership impact your Infrastructure 
business over time? And when do you expect that LTE with Ericsson to 
ramp?
 
Gregory Brown
 
So Ericsson was selected after a pretty comprehensive due diligence process 
of a coup
le of quarters with the Public Safety team. We picked Ericsson 
because they lead worldwide both in market share domestically in the U.S., 
as well as worldwide, they're number one in cellular
-
based wireless 
infrastructure. We also were very impressed with t
he quality of their LTE 
development. The Ericsson discussions were ongoing before we did the deal 
with Nokia Siemens. Now having said that, we're also evaluating Nokia 
Siemens, and there's nothing to preclude or prevent us from adding an 
additional partner
 
beyond Ericsson. But we were impressed with the 
capability of their technology. Obviously, their significant footprint and 
incumbency, and we think it's a great partnership. The interesting part of 
that, it doesn't 
--
 
so we're divesting of the net wireles
s Networks business, 
and what you'll see is Motorola Solutions have a very strong position in 
public safety LTE or private network LTE. So we're developing LTE 
infrastructure for private networks and for private broadband within our 
Public Safety group. As
 
we inter
-
operate or roam onto a carrier network, we 
will take the e
-
node B equipment from Ericsson, harden it, provide 
encryption and software, secure it and provide it as an overall Public Safety 
solution with the Ericsson
-
based station embedded in an ov
erall Motorola 
Solutions architecture and solution to our end
-
user customer. So we're very 
optimistic about it. We think it's a very important strategic alliance. But to 
the extent there's other opportunity with Nokia Siemens for us to consider 
their infra
structure, we are able to do that.

Sanjay, just as a couple of questions. One is if I got this numbers correctly, I 
think you said yo
u're international sales were up about 10% sequentially. 
And within that, you cited China shipments up 70% and Latin America up 
20%. Assuming I got those numbers right, that would seem to imply that 
either something else fell off quite a bit or that ASPs f
ell off. So can you just 
help explain the full picture there?

chs Group Inc.
 
I might not have gotten all the numbers right. But I think you said 
international sales in Mobile Devices were up 10% sequentially and China 
shipments were up 70% and Latin America shipments up 20%. And so since 
those two are the two biggest
 
chunks of international that would seem to 
have driven more than the 10% sequential growth. So just wanted to kind of 
see what helps it add up to that 10% overall growth?

And then the second question, Sanjay, was on the DROID PRO and you 
highlighted an increased focus on the Enterprise. Can you just 
expand on 
that a little bit? So is it going to be specific to introducing a product similar 
to this one over time? Or is it going to also include you investing in your own 
Enterprise
-
oriented sales force? Or do you think you're going to be 
leveraging more 
of the sales force in the marketing efforts of your partners 
like Google or the carriers as you ramp up your focus on the Enterprise?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Simona, it's going to be all three. We'll clearly leverage the efforts of carrier 
partners. And as you know, Go
ogle has a presence in this space as well. But 
we will invest modestly to grow and support Enterprise sales also from the 
point of view of making sure we have a specific call support for CIOs that we 
have sales calling on Fortune 500. So we will have that.
 
But remember, our 
strategy here is a very specific strategy in the first instance. The strategy is 
to deliver devices, which consumers like to use as a consumer device, but it 
has the Enterprise capability which allows the CIOs to accept it into 
enterpris
es. So our sales effort is to make sure that CIOs don't bar these 
devices or put it in an excepted list, but the sale is to the consumers. 80% of 
people in enterprises pay for their own device, and it is to that audience that 
we are selling primarily?

A question on cash flow and how it's going to be used. You've got $5.6 
billion of net cash. You'll probably generate $1.5 billion in separation, and 
you're going to get $1.3 billion from NSN. So that will take you to about $8 
billion of cash. I think you've implied that devices would get $3.5 billion. So 
a question for Greg is what are you going to use this cash pile, which should 
be approaching $5 bil
lion by the end of Q1. Is it something that we should 
think about cash distribution? I assume acquisitions of any significant value 
isn't something that you want, but maybe could comment on that?
 
Gregory Brown
 
So, Kulbinder, just a couple of things as it r
elates to some of the 
assumptions that you outlined. As Patrick talked about ending the year, call 
it at approximately $8.8 billion of cash. That assumes we paid down, and we 
plan to do that the $527 million note in November. But I think you're also 
--
 
in 
your calculus there, assuming that we would close Networks in fiscal 
2010. And we have guided that, that may occur in early 2011. So that 
shouldn't be assumed in the calculation of the cash end of your forecast that 
you're calculating. And having said that
, we obviously remain co
-
Motorola 
Solutions will be keeping the debt. We'll also have other obligations. We'll 
have to look at our net cash position as we exit Q4 and doing to next year. I 
think it's premature to speculate on how we ultimately make decisio
ns with 
Motorola Solutions in the optimal allocation of capital. But we want to finish 
the year strong across all of the businesses, which Sanjay and I want to 
successfully separate the firm sometime in Q1 of 2011. And then in terms of 
future capital alloc
ation plans and what we would do, we would update you 
accordingly at that point in time.

I just want to understand the comments of diversification. So I understand 
you're going to bring out new products, new devices, con
verged devices as 
well, and trying to grow international. But for all of this to play out, it's going 
to take some time. Is it fair to assume that we're looking at maybe a year 
from now until your sales split is much more resembling what invested in the 
ha
nds of the Smartphone industry looks like as opposed to this very 
significant Americas buyers that you have today?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Kulbinder, I caught most of what you asked. I think your question was with 
respect to diversification and the timing thereof. I wo
uld say that clearly, we 
have a North American buyers to our sales focus at the moment, and we're 
looking to diversify both within United States and as well as outside of 
United States. And you're right, it won't happen instantly. But I think we feel 
with 
the diversification, which is already happening and the increased focus 
on diversifying, combined with our opportunity that exist for us within the 
convergence of computing and mobility, I think that such competitive 
pressures as we may see in first quarte
r, we will be able to cope with that 
circumstance in a relatively good way. I would actually like to take this 
opportunity to say one more thing that I see what is happening in Home, 
and the convergence between ourselves and Home is being very important 
fa
ctor. And in fact, I'd like Dan to just comment on Dan's view on what is 
happening in Home and the convergence opportunities there.
 
Daniel Moloney
 
Thanks, Sanjay. I think we now have been at this combined Mobile Device 
and Home for a little over eight mont
hs. It's very clear that some of the 
ideas that led to putting these two businesses together really are becoming 
much more positive. We see many opportunities for content linkages 
between the set
-
top and the mobile device world, sharing content back and 
fo
rth and our focus on being able to deliver solutions in 2011 that 
demonstrate that capability. Sanjay touched on the tablet space and our 
future participation in this space, and that creates another new great 
opportunity in the converged world. When you th
ink about adding the screen 
in the Home and the ability to supplement your large viewing screen with a 
smaller viewing screen simultaneously around content. So collectively, we 
have energy today focused around expanding that capability that could be 
provid
ed on the set
-
top, as well as in the mobile space to enable it. And 
finally, I just say on the convergence piece, as we look at what MOTOBLUR 
is doing today and we talked about the EDGE capability from the Home, 
linking those together and being able to ena
ble us to manage and enhance 
those capabilities to the consumer and really bring this converged world 
such that the consumer gets their content on any of their device that they 
want creates some wonderful opportunities into the future. So you'll start 
begi
nning to see in 2011 some converged experiences from us. And then as 
we move forward more, more opportunity to differentiate our products, both 
Home, Mobile in this converged world.

A quick question on the handset side. Motorola really has a leading position 
in Android as an earlier adopter of it. But it's pretty clear that some of the 
bigger players such as Samsung and such as kind of for the first part 
of this 
year not come to market. Sanjay, can you talk a little bit about your 
positioning relative to as you see the additional competition heating up 
there? Do you think you can get to kind of industry average smartphone 
profitability longer term, I guess
, longer term should the industry average 
profit will it become lower? And where do you kind of see that industry 
average profitability going for the Android marketplace?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Jim, definitely I see Android ecosystem is expanding pretty dramatically, 
and 
Samsung has entered with some very good products in the marketplace 
galaxy. I think it's a very competitive good product in the marketplace. HTC 
continues to deliver good products in the marketplace. On the other hand, I 
think you're right in character
izing Motorola as the leading, if not, one of the 
leading handset manufacturers here. I see no reason for us not to get to 
industry standard profitability and gross margin and profitability over the 
long period of time. And I see in my guidance, I've alway
s said that this is 
going to be high single
-
digit, low double
-
digit kind of number is where we 
want to end up in terms of our operating earnings in the long term. But 
clearly, as I've said in a number of recent comments, I see that the job of 
transforming 
this organization is half done. We have some more work to do 
in terms of becoming a much more software
-
centric, experience
-
focused 
organization. But in one year, we have delivered 22 products. Our focus and 
execution, our focus and innovation and different
iation is far greater today. 
And I feel we've very well positioned, not just in the fundamental or 
transformation that we're making in the organization but the response we're 
getting to the portfolio in 2011 from our customers. So again, we can 
--
 
things t
hat we have a good portfolio. Until our customers accept our 
products and range our products, we don't have real basis to be optimistic. 
On the basis of that feedback, on the basis of ranging that we're seeing of 
our products not just in the United States 
but elsewhere, I feel pretty 
comfortable that we're making good progress. And more precisely, I feel 
that we should definitely get to industry level profitability.

ith it. Because, as you know, off the price 
points that has been said, $199 and $99, and the lifetime ownership costs of 
these devices is such that you're biased towards buying a higher
-
tier in U.S. 
I actually continue to believe that we will do well, if n
ot extremely well, in 
that tier. So I think in your question, you'll assume that the competitive 
pressure is there forced us to diversify in the middle. I don't think it's a 
matter of one or the other. I think that you will see us do both. You will see 
us 
focus very, very much in leading in the performance tier because the halo 
of performance tier is probably just as important in driving mid tier as 
anything else, and the performance in North America actually is just as 
important in driving outside U.S. sma
rtphone sales as anything else. You will 
see our brand name being relevant in China and Latin America, and we will 
focus there as a matter of first step. But Europe, I think is a very important 
marketplace. And the dynamics there, particularly right now, p
otentially 
create an opportunity for us to capitalize on. So we will focus on those 
things. But I think we have not, by the way, guided you to improving OpEx 
as our sales increase. But I really believe that performance tier is important 
for us to succeed o
n as I think you imply in your comments. But the 
diversification with mid tier is also important because the base of 
smartphone is increasing and more feature phone consumers are coming to 
smartphone. And we have to win in both places.

Maybe Dan should jump in here. It seems to be clear that Motorola's doing 
hardwork for this tablet, Google is using the software for it. And I could see 
that the thesis that kind of a converged solution like Apple is 
approaching in 
terms of their ecosystem would be beneficial. But doesn't this put you at a 
steep disadvantage if you're not controlling the OS in the software and then 
hold, look and feel from a UI point of view versus, let's say, Apple and 
maybe some of y
our other competitors?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Well, I think this goes back to the fundamental discussion around OS, but I 
think, Ed, we've had multiple times here. My view is that over a period of 
time, whenever we do what is called a Google experience device, clearly
 
Google is disproportionately responsible for developing the software. But 
over a period of time, we have demonstrated that we can build on that 
platform and differentiate. And I think tablet is no less open to that 
differentiation. And I think I'll let Da
n comment on his views in some of the 
possibilities as that convergence occurs with Home. And this is a place where 
I think we are better positioned than anyone else in the industry
 
.
 
Daniel Moloney
 
I think, Ed, when you look at the opportunity to provide 
the linkage up 
between the Home and the Mobile space whether it's a tablet or another 
mobile device, the fact that we have a beachhead today in the Home space 
it's continuing to evolve to an IP video world inside the Home. And that 
provides us with the opp
ortunity to add new software capability into those 
Home devices that we can then link together with the capability running on 
top of the OS sitting in the tablet gives us as strong a position as anybody to 
own this converged experience opportunity in the f
uture.

And then finally, Sanjay, I mean there was a lot of chatter in the last couple 
of weeks about softness in the end the part of the quarter from Motorola, a 
few of the OEMs. How linear was the quarter would, let
's say, have started 
stronger than it ended?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
Nothing remarkable to report there, Ed. I saw that, and I won't comment 
more precisely, except nothing remarkable in the development of this 
quarter.

We'll take our final question from the si
de of Tavis McCourt with Morgan 
Keegan.

Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.
 
First, a clarification for Sanjay. I think you said 32% of handsets were sold 
outside of North America. Can you give us the percentage of smartphones 
that are now outside
 
the U.S. or outside with America? And then for Greg, 
you mentioned you didn't want to talk about what you may or may not do 
with the cash. But can you at least talk about you believe the capitalization 
upon the separation is suboptimal? Can we at least ex
pect some desire to 
put the cash to work even if you don't want to talk about what exactly it will 
be used for?
 
Sanjay Jha
 
So, Tavis, first of all, I said that 32% of the revenue was outside of U.S. and 
in terms of the precise numbers, I don't think we've 
provided you with that 
guidance. Let me just take one second on the cash question and I'll turn it 
over to Greg. I really think that with the cash performance that Motorola 
organization has delivered this year, I think we placed ourselves in a very 
good po
sition to make both parts Motorola Solution and Motorola Mobility a 
strong, vibrant organization with solid balance sheet. And I think that that's 
the primary purpose right now for the organization is to make sure that both 
parts of the organizations are v
ery well positioned to succeed in the 
marketplace. In terms of what Greg will do the cash afterwards, I think he 
can comment.
 
Gregory Brown
 
Yes, Tavis, I think your question was more around Motorola Solutions 
balance sheet post
-
separation. And again, just 
to remind you that, as Sanjay 
just referenced, we want to position both businesses for sustainable long
-
term success. We have articulated that for Motorola Solutions at separation, 
we're targeting solid investment grade ratings. So that, by definition, dri
ves 
us to a certain cash position, and we will also look to optimize and maximize 
the U.S. cash disposition within the overall balance. Again, after that, I think 
we'll have other things to consider. The Motorola Solutions business is a 
market
-
leading busi
ness in Public Safety. Its market
-
leading in Mobile 
Computing and Advanced Data Capture, we'll have a very strong IPR 
position. And from an organic standpoint, has a solid path of growth, 
irrespective of some of the headwinds we've had with state and local
 
government budgets, we're still growing. And the business is still 
contributing a 16% operating margin business. So the organic business is 
strong. The opportunities to grow it organically are strong. After separation, 
we'll evaluate other uses to put to 
use for optimal capital allocation for 
shareholder return.

I want to remind everyone that an audio replay and this morning's slide 
presentation will be available on our website shortly after this call. During 
this call, we have made a number 
of forward
-
looking statements within the 
meaning of applicable federal securities law. Forward
-
looking statements are 
any statements that are not historical facts. These forward
-
looking 
statements are based on the current expectations of Motorola, and we c
an 
give no assurance that any future results or events discussed will be 
achieved. Any forward
-
looking statements represent our views only as of 
today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any 
subsequent date. Such forward
-
looking s
tatements include, but are not 
limited to, our comments and answers relating to the following topics: Plans 
and progress relating to the separation of Motorola's businesses into two 
independent publicly traded companies and the sale of our Networks 
busines
s; guidance from Motorola's earnings per share; future strategic 
plans; potential cost reductions; expected timing for the announcement, 
launch and shipment of new products; expectations for the volume and 
financial impact of handset shipments, including S
martphones; guidance for 
future sales, operating expenses, expected cash position, margins, 
profitability, ASP and demand trends or market share for each of Motorola's 
businesses and their products. Because forward
-
looking statements involve 
risks and unce
rtainties, Motorola's actual results could differ materially from 
those stated in these forward
-
looking statements. Information about the 
factors that could cause, and in some cases, have caused such differences 
can be found in this morning's press release
 
on Pages 17 through 29 in Item 
1A of Motorola's 2009 annual report on Form 10
-
K and in Motorola's other 
SEC filings. Thank you for joining us this morning. This now concludes our 
call.

Good day and welcome everyone to the Google Inc. fourth quarter 2012 
earnings conference call. This call is being recorded.
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Willa Chalmers, Senior 
Manager of Investor Relations. Please go 
ahead.
 
Willa Chalmers
 
Great, thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to 
today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 earnings conference call. With us 
are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice 
President and Chi
ef Financial Officer; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President 
and Chief Business Officer.
 
Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor 
Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR 
website for our ea
rnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that 
accompany the call. You can also visit our Google Plus Investor Relations 
page for the latest company news and updates. So, please check it out. This 
call is also being webcast from investor.google.
com. A replay of the call will 
be available on our website later today.
 
So, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we 
make today may be considered forward
-
looking, including statements 
regarding Google's future investments, our l
ong
-
term growth and 
innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected 
level of capital expenditures.
 
These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that t
hese forward
-
looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this 
presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the 
results of any revisions to these forward
-
looking statements in light of new 
information or futur
e events.
 
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk 
factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial 
measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating 
margin, are also express
ed on a non
-
GAAP basis and have been adjusted to 
exclude charges related to stock
-
based compensation.
 
We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to 
remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP 
results 
and reconciliations of non
-
GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in 
our earnings press release.
 
With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.

in revenue for the first time last year, not a bad achievement in just a 
decade
-
and
-
a
-
half.
 
We have talked a lot about excellence and velocity o
ver the last year. While 
many claim it's my nature never to be satisfied, we've actually made real 
progress creating more beautiful and more intuitive products.
 
Take Search. The perfect search engine would understand exactly what you 
mean and give you exac
tly what you want. Our Knowledge Graph brings that 
much closer.
 
Search for Nikola Tesla and you will get information about this great inventor 
that is beautifully displayed right from the results page. His basic bio, books 
he wrote, his photo, no extra wor
k needed, and we even recommend 
information about other inventors such as Edison and Marconi that you can 
easily browse through. Again, right from the results page.
 
And last quarter, we launched the Knowledge Graph in seven new 
languages, including Spanish
, Japanese and Russian. This is hard work. It's 
about way more than translating the words on the page. Google has to 
understand millions of different entities as well as their meaning and 
context.
 

earch. You're in 

you're running out of gas. Just pick up your phone and ask Google for 
directions to the nearest gas station and you'll be on your way immediately. 
It's a great ex
ample of how we can take the hassle right out of your life.
 
Our long
-
term investments in Google Maps have really paid off. The team 
has worked tremendously hard to create the most accurate and 
comprehensive maps in the world. Driving country

is core to your search experience. And with Google Maps for iOS, we have 
reinvigorated our product. It's more intuitive and beautiful, and users love it. 
Google Maps for iOS
 
was downloaded over 10 million times in the first 48 
hours.
 
In fact, six Google apps were included in Apple's App Store Best Free Apps of 
2012, including YouTube, Chrome, Google Search and Gmail.
 

, so you can get 

exciting to see our progress with Google Now. Launched earlier in the year, 

provide you
r flight times, or your boarding pass, or directions to your next 
appointment. We'll even suggest interesting places to visit nearby.
 
As we discussed on the last earnings call, we now live in a multi
-
screen 
world. People carry a supercomputer in their pock
et all the time. In fact, we 
feel naked without our smartphone and many users have more than one 
device, a laptop, a phone, and a tablet. We are living in unchartered 
territory. It's a new kind of computing environment. Everyone is really 
excited about the
 
technology and are spending a lot of money on devices 
driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before.
 
It's been a long time in computing since we had this rate of change. It 

e 
have put so much focus on devices. They have been one of our biggest bets 
in the last few years, along with software to go with these devices, Chrome 
and Android.
 
Our goal here is to push the user experience forward, so you get the best of 
Google in one 
easy to use package. The Samsung Chromebook, which we 
launched in October at an amazing price of $249 was a holiday highlight. I 
love mine. It is super easy to use and almost maintains itself. Open a 
chrome tab on your phone and everything syncs on your la
ptop with no 
extra effort required. We also launched two new Nexus devices to rave 
reviews, Nexus 4 and Nexus 10.
 
In six months after we first unveiled it, the Nexus 7 continues to define the 7 
inch tablet category making many best of 2012 and holiday gift
 
lists. Clearly 
there is work to be done in managing our supply better, as well as building a 
great customer experience and that is a priority for the teams. But 
considering all the excitement over the holidays for our devices, it is clear 
there is tremend
ous opportunity in delivering great value with amazing and 
simple user experience.
 
Google Play, another big bet is on fire. The growth is tremendous. This 
quarter we signed deals with Time as well as Warner Music Group. So we 
now provide contents from all 
the top Hollywood film studios, music labels 
and magazine publishers. We have not even reached Google Play's first 
anniversary.
 
Many of you have questions about Motorola, and Patrick will go into details 
of our accounting for the business so that you can d
o your models right. I 
am excited about the business. In today's multi
-
screen world the 
opportunities are endless. Think about your devices, battery life is a huge 

When you drop you

faster and easier.
 
There is real potential to invent new and better experiences. Our CEO of 
Motorola, Dennis, has built a world
-
class team and they are working on the 
opportunities. It is still early
 
days but I am excited about the innovative 
ways they are approaching product development and speed of their 
execution and they recently signed and agreement to sell more Motorola's 
home division for $2.35 billion.
 
2012 was an amazing year for Google 
and we are all set for a great 2013. I 
am incredibly optimistic about the opportunities we have as a technology 
company focused on user benefits. Every day I come to work excited about 
more and bigger opportunities and every day we work to have more and 
be
tter organized Googlers, those are employees, improving the execution 
and overall capabilities to deliver world the world changing products. I know 
it sounds funny but with the ambitious plans we have, we are only just 
getting started.
 
Our biggest challeng
e in this area is focus. We face so many opportunities 
and so it is important to thoughtfully invest in the right areas where we can 
have the greatest impact. We don't want to describe ourselves too thin, but I 
am quite optimistic that as we get better and
 
better in managing our product 
areas, we will be able to continue to grow our ambitions. That's why I am 
here and that's one reason why Google Earth, now working at Google. 
Google Earth remains our greatest asset and we are working hard to recruit 
and ret
ain the best employees. We've had a great start to the year, by being 
in the Fortune Magazine's, the best company to work for in the U.S. for the 
fourth time.
 
We worked hard to create a company, where everyone is part of the family 
and where the work is ch
allenging and rewarding, so I'm really happy to get 
that recognition. I want to finish by thanking all the Googlers who made this 
possible, and now I'll turn it over to Patrick. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and th
anks for joining us. So, 
let's dive in by reviewing the detail of our overall business financial 
performance. As we noted in a blog post last week, the Motorola Home 
business has been presented separately as discontinued operations in our 
financial tables.
 
This makes typical quarter
-
on
-
quarter or year
-
on
-
year 
comparisons a little more challenging this quarter, but I will provide some 
color throughout my comments. So without further ado, here we go.
 
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 36% year
-
over
-
yea
r to $14.4 
billion, and 8% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. As I mentioned, this figure excludes 
the Motorola Home revenue. Had we included Motorola Home, gross total 
consolidated revenue would have been $15.2 billion, a growth rate of 44% 
year
-
over
-
year and 8% quart
er
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Google standalone gross revenue grew 22% year
-
over
-
year to $12.9 billion 
and 12% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Our Google Website revenue was up 18% 
year
-
over
-
year to $8.6 billion and up 12% quarter
-
over
-
quarter with 
strengths across most geograph
ies and industries. Our Google Network 
revenue grew 19% year
-
over
-
year to $3.4 billion and 10% quarter
-
over
-
quarter, finally, other revenue grew 102% year
-
over
-
year to $829 million 
and 24% quarter
-
over
-
quarter driven by Play hardware and content sales. 
And
 
were it not for fluctuations in currencies Google standalone revenue 
would have in fact grown 24% year
-
over
-
year.
 
Turning to Motorola Mobility, its gross revenue was $1.5 billion for the 
quarter. And once again had we included the Home business, the total
 
gross 
revenue for the combined Motorola entities would have been $2.3 billion. As 
Larry mentioned, we are really pleased with the velocity of change at 
Motorola, but it's still at a very beginning of the Motorola Google story. No 
one should be surprised i
f results from this segment are a variable for quite 
a while as we restructure the business. And remember, we inherited a 12 to 
18 months product pipeline that we are still working through.
 
At Google Now, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong, 
up 24% 
year
-
over
-
year and up 9% quarter
-
over
-
quarter. As we said many times, 
there are several factors that impact the CPC click dynamics, including FX, 
geo mix, product changes et cetera, but this quarter specifically it's worth 
mentioning that we impleme
nted some policy changes that lowered our paid 
click growth, improved our CPC growth and lowered network revenue for the 
quarter. Nikesh will speak more about this in a few minutes, but the bottom 
line is, that these policies are part of many constant chan
ges that are 
focused on what's good for the user and advertisers, so we believe they are 
good for Google's business in the long
-
term too.
 
Our aggregate cost per click was down 6% year
-
over
-
year and up 2% 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. Once again remember that curre
ncy headwinds also 
had a moderate year
-
on
-
year negative impact on CPC in Q4. In fixed FX 
terms, in fact aggregate CPC would have been down only 4% year
-
over
-
year 
and up 1% quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
Turning to geographic performance of Google's standalone busin
ess we 
continue to see strong performance in the U.S. and the U.K. while the 
economic situation of Southern Europe continues to impact our rest of world 
growth somewhat. In our earning slides, which you can find on our investor 
relations website, you will 
see that we have broken down our revenue by 
U.S., U.K., and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from 
our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact 
calculations.
 
Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year
-
over
-
year to $6
 
billion. The U.K. 
was up 23% year
-
over
-
year to $1.3 billion which includes [an immaterial] 
[ph] benefit from our hedging program. In fact in fixed FX terms the U.K. 
grew 22%. Non
-
U.S. Revenue, excluding the U.K., accounted for 44% of our 
total revenue or 
$5.6 billion, up 24% year
-
over
-
year and includes a $36 
million benefit from our hedging program and in fixed FX terms rest of world 
grew 28%.
 
So now if I come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated 
business, our other cost of revenue was $3 
billion in Q4, excluding SBC and 
Motorola restructuring, our non
-
GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.1 
billion, which also exclude SBC and Motorola restructuring and our non
-
GAAP 
operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating 
mar
gin of 30%. For standalone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3.1 
billion or 25% of total advertising revenue.
 
Our other cost of revenue was $1.8 billion excluding $101 million of stock
-
based compensation. The increase year
-
over
-
year was driven by equ
ipment 
costs, including the cost associated with hardware sales on Play but also 
content acquisition costs and our data center costs. Non
-
GAAP operating 
expenses were $3.6 billion excluding stock
-
based compensation of $576 
million. Finally, non
-
GAAP operat
ing profit was $4.4 billion in Q4, resulting in 
a non
-
GAAP operating margin of 34%.
 
One last note. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and 
equipment for standalone Google was $493 million for this quarter. At 
Motorola Mobility, total n
on
-
GAAP operating expenses including cost of 
revenue were $1.7 billion and keep in mind that intangible amortization 
expense attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola mobility, they are 
included in these non
-
GAAP measures.
 
Of the $289 million in int
angible amortization expense this quarter, $153 
million was a result of the acquisition of Motorola and of which $116 million 
is allocated to Google and $37 million allocated to Motorola Mobility. As a 
result, the non
-
GAAP operating loss on Motorola Mobili
ty was $152 million in 
Q4, resulting in a non
-
GAAP operating margin of negative 10% for that 
segment.
 
Let me turn to headcount. Headcount for the consolidated headcount 
increased by roughly 300 people in Q4. Keep in mind that consolidated 
headcount include
s Motorola Home until it is divested and Home comprises 
roughly one third of the total Motorola headcount. Standalone Google added 
about 1,400 people and in total, the consolidated company ended the 
quarter at around 53,900 full
-
time employees.
 
Our effecti
ve tax rate this quarter was 18%. The change from last quarter 
reflects the mix in shifts of earnings between domestic and international 
subsidiary and hedges.
 
Now let me turn quickly to cash management. Other income and expense 
was 152 million for quarter
, which reflects realized gains on investments and 
interest income offset by the continued impact of FAS 133 expense from our 
hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please again refer to the slides 
that accompany this call on our IR website.
 
Our operat
ing cash flow was very strong, $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter 
was $1 billion versus last quarter of $872 million. The majority of CapEx 
expense was related to production equipment, data center construction and 
facilities related purchases. We are very
 
pleased with our free cash flow 
which was $3.7 billion and please note that cash flow and CapEx both 
include the Home business for now.
 
So finally the success of our products and our continued strong performance, 
as portrayed by Larry's comments continues
 
to give us the confidence to 
fund our strategic growth in areas such as search, YouTube, Android, 
Chrome as well as in our overall infrastructure with a view to the long
-
term. 
I will hand off now to Nikesh who will cover in more detail of our business 
per
formance in the quarter and after his remarks, we will open it up for the 
phone lines for any questions. Nikesh?
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thank you, Patrick. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, our business had a 
strong quarter with $12.9 billion revenue in Google st
andalone alone. We are 
very pleased with our year
-
on
-
year growth of 22%. I think our advertising 
business is firing on all cylinders. Companies of all sizes continue to embrace 
online advertising and our major players increasing their investments. In 
fact,
 
here's an interesting tidbit. Across search display, YouTube and more, 
our top 25 advertisers are now spending average of over $150 million per 
year. Did I deliver that number?
 
Our core business continues to be strong. Our investments in mobile 
shopping, 
our past holiday test with Flying Colors. As Larry mentioned, our 
vision is for search to understand exactly what you mean and give you 
exactly what you want in all devices that you live with throughout your day.
 
Talking about the devices, our queries from
 
wide ranging of new devices are 
continuing to power our overall growth in search volumes. Distinctions 
between devices, form factors are becoming less meaningful, particularly 
between desktop, laptops and tablets.
 
Our Search performed very well last quart
er during Black Friday and Cyber 
Monday. We still have greater proportion of queries with commercial intent 
and higher RPMs in areas like retail, computers and electronics. We launched 
a set of features to make shopping stress free and more fun. I don't kn
ow if 
you've had a chance to look at it, but there are some interesting things like 
360 degree toy imagery and integrating retailers' promotions and discounts 
into our shopping product.
 
Our investments in Search, particularly in mobile and shopping are rea
lly 
helping clients. Now, let me give you an example. Front End Audio. This is 
the company that offers recording and light sound equipment sales. 
Sometime in mid
-
September, the deployed product lifting ads, within weeks 
these ads were accounting for about 
15% of the total sales. They also tripled 
their click through rates and also reduced their cost per conversion by 75% 
to 80%. This is great for us, because the product we believe is in the 
interest of the end users. It's a great product for Front End Audio
 
improves 
their economics and improves our economy.
 
Major retailers like RadioShack and Home Depot, they use our Mobile Apps 3 
shoppers across devices, including click
-
to
-
call, click
-
to
-
map. For Home 
Depot, mobile commerce sales are quadrupled in a year. P
atrick mentioned 
some changes in policy and enforcement. These enforcements had the effect 
of reducing ad clicks on the sites of certain AdSense for search partners. 
These policy updates are part of our ongoing work to improve user 
experiences on Google an
d on site in terms of using Google Search. Since 
these policies improve the experience of both users and advertisers, we 
firmly believe they are good for our business in the long
-
term.
 
Switching gears to YouTube in display, we are continuing to make strong 
progress here, but there was a key language that brand speak, so it 
continues to be a key area of focus for us. Videos are baked into the core of 
all of our products whether it's searc
h, display, mobile, and of course 
YouTube itself.
 
YouTube is well positioned for the changing viewing habits of today's multi
-
screen world. The site's new redesign is focused on channels and that has 
led to major increase in engagement. In 2012, viewers wa
tched over 4 
billion hours of video on YouTube a month and it's now available across over 
400 million mobile devices, gaming consoles and connector PDs in addition 
to your desktop.
 
YouTube creators continue to vow and attract audiences. Outside estimate 
sa
y that video on which I am sure all of you have seen of PSY, his hit song, 
Gangnam Style, now the most watched YouTube video for all times, it 
generated over $8 million in all
-
in advertising deal. YouTube Partner revenue 
has doubled for the fourth consecut
ive year and thousands of channels are 
now making six figures annually.
 
YouTube is not only home for creators, but it's also home for major brand 
advisers. On YouTube, our top 100 global advertisers spent over 50% more 
in 2012 than they did in 2011. Clearl
y this is a strong signal of the power in 
YouTube to reach audiences. What's interesting is the significant factor into 
growth of YouTube has been our TrueView skippable ad format. Agencies 
and marketers are seeing real benefits. You only pay for the ad if
 
viewers 
watch them. In fact, 70% of our in
-
stream ads are now TrueView formats 
and this quarter TrueView came to Xbox, the iPad, and the Wii.
 
Putting all our advertiser solutions together, it is really helping us deliver 
greater returns and develop close 
relationships with major clients worldwide. 
Like McDonald's, who this quarter launched always on search in YouTube 
campaign to increase customer awareness and their ability towards their 
brands across all channels.
 
In Q4, we signed a new global deal with L
'Oreal, under which we worked to 
promote their brands using Google's digital offerings across the world in 
Display, Search, YouTube and more. While our complete solution for 
marketers not only applies to businesses, but we saw this in this quarter's 
2012 e
lection from the presidency to local races.
 
Google's mobile search, video and measurement products were the center of 
a huge number of Democratic, Republican initiatives and campaigns. Our 
election advertising revenues increased by five times over the 2008
 
election. 
Here is an interesting statistic for you. In nine of the top 11 Senate races for 
the U.S., the candidates who spent more with Google, was elected.
 
Well, 2012 was not just a big year for advertising, it was a big year for 
publisher business as we
ll. Working closely with major publishers, from 
weather channel to timing, bringing the DoubleClick Google ad technology 
stack together is really helping our clients increase their direct, indirect and 
programmatic CPMs. Our solutions for media companies n
ow (inaudible) be 
on advertising encompassing paid service, subscriptions and more.
 
That was about our business, our ad revenue. Other highlights looking at the 
geographic breakdown of our ads business. Growth in Northern Europe was 
robust, with strength i
n Germany and the U.K. Asia performed steadily and 
other regions were very pleased that Americas maintain steady growth 
driven by strength in mobile and YouTube. Southern Europe was somewhat 
softer as it continues to face macroeconomic challenges.
 
Our ente
rprise business continues to grow at an impressive pace. It's been 
gaining traction across some of the largest companies in the world. New 
customers this quarter include Nintendo, the Canadian Broadcasting 
Company, Shaw industries, Costco, Randstad and Hyu
ndai to name a few. 
Also signing in May is the U.S. Department of Interior, moved more than 
70,000 employees to the cloud during Q4 making it the largest federal 
agency to date using Google Apps.
 
I think I solid, we have had a good quarter. Our revenues co
ntinue to grow. 
Clients continue to see value with us and value in online advertising. We 
have been able to build significant new revenue streams at mobile, YouTube 
and display and clearly arising one in enterprise. We have weathered various 
economic storm
s and are benefiting from the shift in advertising spend 
towards digital media plus there is continued strong execution and client 
relationships.
 
I want to echo Larry's congratulations to our teams around the world for all 
their hard work in delivering a g
reat quarter and stellar year in a tough 
environment. Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Thank you, Nikesh. With that, I am going to turn it over to Jennifer who will 
open the lines for the Q&A. Jennifer, all yours.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
(Operator 
Instructions) We will take our first question from Carlos Kirjner 
with Bernstein.
 
Carlos Kirjner

Bernstein
 
Two questions. Last quarter we saw a material sequential decline of Google 
websites' revenues growth rate of more than 400 basis points. Even after
 
accounting for FX, this quarter we see another deceleration I think about 
250 basis points on an FX neutral basis in the Google websites' revenue line. 
Of these, in the context where YouTube is growing really fast based on your 
comments, so what have been
 
the major drivers of this continued 
deceleration of Google websites? Should we expect similar growth rate 
declines going forward?
 
Secondly on TAC, it seems TAC for distribution as a percentage of Google 
websites' revenues grew less than what we had seen e
arlier in the last 
several quarters in 2012. What has driven the stabilization of this TAC, 
distribution TAC and how should we think about distribution TAC in the 
future? Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Well, thank you, Carlos for the detailed question. I am going t
o turn that 
over to Patrick for, hopefully, a good answer.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes, thank you. So Carlos, on the first one, you are right that there is quite a 
bit of noise because of FX on the sites year
-
over
-
year between Q3 and Q4 
but overall I think that w
e are very pleased with the growth around 20%. 
You are right that in the last quarter there was a bit more headwinds than 
this quarter but overall the core search business is doing well and driven 
really by the strength in mobile and we are obviously addit
ionally pleased 
with the YouTube business, particularly the watch page. So, despite the fact 
that there is quite a bit of FX noise in there and that FX does carry over to 
sites, overall I think that we are very pleased with the overall growth.
 
In terms of 


fundamental trend that you see in TAC rather than change in the TAC rate of 

what's going on there but I think as 
we said in the previous calls we think of TAC in the way, there is a really 
positive story in TAC, which is, it is distribution and it is worth paying for.
 
This is the positive side of our business having much more dist
ribution of our 

of the mobile is thriving to the extent that it is and remember that, finally, 
TAC is not a new phenomenon for us. We have always dealt with distribution 
partne
rs and we'll continue to experience and manage it to make sure that it 
drives revenue and profit for both parties in a balanced way, so nothing new 
here but really excited by the trends.
 
Thank you Carlos. We will go to our next question, please.
 
Operator
 
We will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.

Two questions for Larry around the notion of Answers not linked. First on 
Knowledge Graph, can you just give us a high level view on where we are in 
terms of its im
plementation and how widely it's rolled out? And specifically, 
how if at all it impacts the economics of Google's businesses?
 
And then second Google Shopping, the PLAs and the interface changes, I 
think significantly improve the user experience, but the co
nsumer still needs 
to leave the site to transact. Do you anticipate a mechanism whereas users 
can actually transact on Google Shopping without having to leave? You 
know, as you said sort of no extra work needed? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Well, Ben, thank you for 
the questions. I think we rolled out Knowledge 
Graph very recently and I think we are still in the early stages of that. I 
think that, I mentioned some of the internationalization work that we did 
which is hard work and I think we'll continue to do that. I
 
mean it's still 1% 
or something where we should be, so I am really excited about what we can 
do in the future. I think the economics points, I think that the way we look 
at it is we provide much better answers for people really grow the business. 
We incre
ased the number times that you might want information, because 
you know you are going to get correct answers or increasing it for 
modalities, you can get answers like Voice, or Mobile or so on, so I am 
somewhat excited about that and generally we monetize 
those things. So, I 

about that.
 
The Knowledge Graph does run on the right hand side where the ads also 
run. [I expect] [ph] there could be some short
-
term impacts on that, but I 
t
hink the primary thing is getting people better answers is really good for 
our business.
 
Google Shopping, I guess you are asking about product listing ads I think 
that we are also in the early stages of that. We just rolled out Google 

tremendous uptake from merchants and from users 
and I expect that quality of the site, the ease of buying things will improve 
over time and I am really excited about that. I am not going to comment on 

our user experience 
better. So, can we have our next question please?
 
Operator
 
We'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Thanks. I guess, following up on Ben's comment regarding Answers versus 
Links. 
Larry, you recently quoted I think saying about the possibility of 
having a system that could basically vacation plan for you. And now that you 

flight explorer and Hotel Finder. Can yo
u talk a bit more about the strategy 
with travel in terms of the problem you are trying to solve there relative to 
this historic experience of Google sending you offsite for depth of 
experience. And then secondly, Patrick, I think last quarter you gave the
 
FX 
neutral CPC down 8%. I wonder if you could give that same number for this 
quarter, thanks. For the fourth quarter?
 
Larry Page
 
Yes, Scott. That's a great question. I'll take the first part, and I think that 
we've always done a very good job of sending p
eople to the right places and 
I don't think that being able to answer very complex information means 
necessarily that we wouldn't send people off to other sites, So I think the 
main thing for us is to be able to understand the complex problem. Like, I 
thin
k, I gave some example like finding a hotel that's near (inaudible) 
logistics for the flight, for a vacation you might take and the hotel and the 
activities we wanted to do, kind of solving that all at once in a way a human 
assistant might be able to do.
 
A

necessarily believe the assumption of your question, but we are looking at 

able to that for any area. Not
 
just travel and we have been working with as 

And where we needed to acquire companies, we have done some of that or 
work with other companies or make deals or whatever we need to do. S
o we 
are trying to be practical about it and I think we do have some amazing 
assets in travel and mapping and so on. I think those things will pay off for 
us in the future providing great experience. So, Patrick?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes, Scott, the answer to 
your specific question is, the CPCs have, on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis, they have gone down 4% and on a quarter
-
over
-
quarter basis, they are 1%. That is on a fixed FX adjusted and so that 
compares to the minus six and plus two that I mentioned a couple of 
min
utes ago. Thanks for your questions, Scott. Jennifer, let's go to our next 
question please.

Great, thanks. Two questions. Could you talk broadly where you are o
n cash 
about Google Maps and where do you think the monetization of that is today 
versus where you think it potentially could be? Then, Larry, I think you were 
quoted recently with some comments on competitive products out in the 
market. Any comments, in p
articular, on graphical search as it has been 

competitive with Google's core search? Thank you very much.
 
Larry Page
 
Well, I can say a little bit about Maps. So this is Larry. I think that peop
le 
are always focused on monetization of Maps but it's important to think 

long time ago and because we thought it was critical to your search 
experience.
 
It is actually finding wha
t you are looking for and if we look at our 

and always has been. So again, to understand those queries we have to 

the 
core part of our main web search.
 
We already make quite a bit of money on web search and I already told you 
that was a significant amount of queries. So we actually we already make 
quite a bit of money on Maps in that way as a part of our core business
, and 
a significant part, which really allowed us to make those investments.
 
We are in the early stages of monetization on the Maps themselves. I think 
we are doing some interesting things there. I think we will continue to do 
that. I think it is likely to
 
be a great source of revenue but still in the early 
stages on the Maps, but on the search side, we have significant revenue 
already.
 
I think you are asking about graph search, which was recently announced. I 
think that when leaving about search, our missi
on has been to organize the 
world's information and making it universally accessible and useful. We have 
been at that for quite a while and made investments in all sorts of areas, like 
Maps, as I just mentioned which turned out to be really important. That

the way we think about. There is knowledge search, there is all sorts of 
investments we have made, gathering different kinds of data and making 
sure we have everyone's data and we will continue to do that. That business 
has change a lot.
 
Only 10 years a
go, what you though Google should do, is almost 
unrecognizable compared to what it does now and the number of things that 
it understands. So we see just tremendous opportunity to make better 
products for users that really understand their needs and really 
grow that 
opportunity and if you look at voice, for example, which we have also made 
huge investment in, the importance of that to mobile for finding things. I 
mentioned you can ask Google where the nearest gas station is on your 
phone while you are drivin
g on your phones and it does all this work 
perfectly. So I think we see that as just all sorts of aspects on those problem 
and we have been very focused on that.
 
Now there is another great example. There is tremendous innovation there. 
It is 
actually answering your question before you even think to have the 
question and that's pretty incredible. I am super excited about that, so I feel 
very confident of our core business of organizing things, finding things, 
getting people information. I could
n't be more excited about that. Our next 
question?

We'll take our next question from Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.

Hi. First for Patrick on Motorola in terms of the lawsuit which widened in the 
quarter, I am wonde
ring if you could contextualize for us the financial 
direction of Motorola, both, in terms of the revenue declining and the 
growing expenses. I mean, I know this isn't something that Google typically 
does, but I think it would be helpful for investors if t
here's any way to kind 
of put a band or threshold around what the potential operating losses could 
be at Motorola.
 
And then second question for Larry around the commercialization of 
driverless cars. I just wonder if you could give us an update on that and 
your test that you're doing in Nevada and I am wondering if you could talk 
about Android as part of that? It sounds like the automotive, electronics 
suppliers are recognizing the importance of Android for the infotainment 
systems in those cars and so maybe
 
you can talk a little bit about that 
opportunity for Android as well? Thanks for the question.
 
Larry Page
 
I think maybe I'll take the second half of your question first. I think that, I 
would say also on Motorola and then I will let Patrick fill in. I mea
n we are so 
excited about them in this. I think that we're really in the early days of 
Motorola with respect to Google's acquisition of it, and I'll let him give you 
some details.
 
I think that on driverless cars, I think obviously it's still early days to 
answer. Although I'm really excited about what the team has got done and 
what that can mean for ordinary people and really substantially improving 
mobility and potentially really reducing the land area that we have to devote 
for cars which is incredible am
ounts in cities. It can really reduce parking. 
We are looking at that. Even for Google just as a major cost to reduce our 
parking costs in our facilities by having automated cars parked more densely 
and serve more people.
 
I think those things will be amazi
ng deals. Android I think that we are still. 
That's little bit different than the automated cars I think, but Android won't 
be used in cars probably before we get automated cars into the mainstream. 
I think people are really excited about that due to the i
ncredible success of 
Android and we are obviously working with those manufacturers to help 
them make that happen well. So, Patrick?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes, just a bit of color on Motorola. Right? First just to remind everybody, we 
do care about profitability
 
and that is our goal with every one of the areas 
where we invest, and we said that before and we are not in the business for 
losing money with Motorola or even cross subsiding it. But, we are really 180 
days into this journey and we've made a ton of progr
ess, including the sale 
of the Home business. And as I mentioned earlier also we are kind of 
outsourcing our manufacturing and so much more that has been done and 
the restructurings that you have heard earlier in the late summer and early 
fall.
 
So, and I j
ust want to remind everybody that we inherited kind of 12 to 18 
months of product pipeline that we have to work through and that's the 
reality of the business, that's kind of overhaul and then kind of rebuild the 
new product pipeline where Dennis's team ha
s kind of been really focused on 
in addition to the restructuring. It does take time before it shows up.
 
Having said that finally on the financials themselves, Anthony, it's really 
worth noting that Motorola is also hindered by a portion of the amortizatio
n 
of intangibles due to the acquisition, so the losses that you see are 
somewhat inflated by this amortization of intangibles which we've decided to 
kind of put through the P&L on a non
-
GAAP basis.
 
So, all
-
in
-
all, when we look at the losses like this quart
er, a negative $150 
million, you take out the amortization, these are not consequential losses 
relative to either Google or the kind of turnaround we are seeing and the 
kind of positive momentum. So, that's why Larry started by saying we are 
really optimis
tic, but it does take time and that's why I am also saying, be 
ready for a lot of fluctuations in our P&L over the coming quarters. It's just 
the nature of the bees when you reinvent business. Thank you for your 
question, Anthony. Let's go, Jennifer, to ou
r next question.

Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you. Larry, I think on your last call, you mentioned that you are 
impatient with mobile CPCs, not that they were not ba
d place but you 
wanted to get them higher. Can you talk about progress made in the quarter 
and do you feel like you are really making a positive inflection there or is 
that still a few quarters away?
 
Then as you as you look at your mobile business as far a
s the growth of 
queries or the growth of revenues and you look at it relative to maybe 
mcommerce growth, do you think you are gaining share of the market? Do 
you feel like your position in mobile is really secure and that you maybe 
even be gaining share in
 

Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
Thank you for your question. Let's see, the mobile business, it has been 
going very well. We have tremendous growth with the Android. We are 
serving our users really well. We are build
ing amazing products that are 
getting better at a rapid rate. The rate of improvement are obviously very 
high. So I feel pretty comfortable that my focus mostly on our products and 
assume that their usage will follow the great products.
 
I think that in som
e sense, some of you may consider mobile an extension 
over the desktop usage too. I mean, we have built a lot of great products 
that people use for the desktops like Maps which was transferred very well. 
And I think that one thing I was amazed by Chrome on
 
my Android phone, 
Chrome is just an amazing experience. So, using my Nexus phone or other 
more smartphones from the latest generation, those phones are almost like 
using a desktop of last year or something like that.
 
So I think the experiences are improvi
ng a lot and very, very quickly. So I 
think we have hit some uncharted territory, because of the rapid rate of 
change in these things but I am very, very optimistic about it. I think that 
CPCs will improve as these devices are improving as well. Obviously,
 
I 
mentioned that we are working to simplify our ad system for advertisers. In 
the light of all these changes and I am excited about our plans there.
 

efforts there. I think that we wi
ll make rapid progress in that area. So I think 
I answered both of your questions. So maybe we can have our next 
question.

We will take our next question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.

Credit Suisse
 
Thanks, guys. So I guess 
the pace of your headcount increases is used to be 
moderating as we take a look back 2012 and the same goes for CapEx as 
well. So do you feel like you are now at an appropriate level to tackle your 
three major areas of investment focus?
 
I guess another way
 
to ask the question is, are there any other large scale 
opportunities you have identified that would entail acceleration in terms of 
your hiring or CapEx? Thank you.
 
Larry Page
 
I think we have run a number of different businesses and I think that they 
all
 
have different needs and it's sort of like, we are looking at the sum of all 
those things. So I think it is a little bit hard to predict those things. I think 
you should ask us to do whatever is necessary to make the most business 
outcome. Having said tha
t, I think we have some time in the past we have 
had a lot of people, we are growing at the edge of what's been the modest in 

but I would say that we have also slowed our inter
national growth and 
products development a bit which is probably having some impact on that. 
So I guess, I will give it to Patrick for some more detail, perhaps.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Okay, just the comment on the CapEx side. We have always said and I think 
if 
you go back the last couple of years on CapEx, it has been really lumpy. 
We have gone from really highs where we were above $1 billion and then it's 
come all the way down to a few hundred million dollars.
 
Now it's kind of moved back up, so it's a real test
imony that it is lumpy, 
because as you add, just to use the example of a data center, as you will 
see CapEx, because we fill with equipment at data center. But once the data 
center is full and then we have to put an extension to the data center or 
then you
 
are into concrete again and power. So, it's just the nature of our 
business.
 
Certainly on the core businesses are quite lumpy, so we without giving any 
guidance forward, we have been as you've seen in this quarter $1 billion of 
CapEx, really very much ali
gned with the excitement we have around our 
products, whether it be social, whether it be pictures, whether it be all of the 
areas that you have heard Larry talk about and so that's why we are fueled 
as I said in my comments.
 
We are fueled by the positive 
momentum we have in many areas of the 
company and we believe now is the time to invest and that's why we are 
doing it with confidence, discipline with confidence.
 
Larry Page
 
Ross, I'll also just add briefly that when we run our business, we find that it 
wo
rks better if our hiring is reasonably smooth, so we have worked harder 
to manage that smoothness. We have recruiters in place and hiring staff in 
place for the long
-
term and make sure we'll provide a good consistent 
business growth there just makes us ope
rationally run better and we've 
probably been managing that a bit more tightly.

Deutsche Bank Securities
 
Thanks guys. I have got two questions, first for Nikesh on Mobile and then 
one follow
-
up for Patrick on the Google sites TAC. So, Nikesh, what percent 
of your several million advertising clients are biddin
g on mobile key words 
today and what percentage do you think have mobile
-
specific websites 
enabled already?
 
And then Patrick, the follow
-
up on TAC, the year
-
over
-
year growth rate for 
Google website's TAC decelerated from 45% to 43%, subtle but there is 
pro
bably some organic items in there that are helping it. Is that a function of 
smartphone installation growth rolling over or any partnership agreements 
or something else? Can you just give us a little color on that deceleration? 
Thanks.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Thanks 
for your question, Ross. On the mobile front, I think it's important to 
understand that a vast majority of our advertisers have opted into mobile 
from an advertising point of view. I think Larry said this a few quarters ago 
that we slowly have been working
 
over time to try and make it feel like a 
common experience across multiple screens for advertisers, because 
advertisers are more interested in the business benefit of advertising with us 
as opposed to specifically which form factor, which device they inve
st with 
us on, so our teams have been working really hard in the last few quarters 
to try and get us to a point where we can make it simple for the advertiser 
where they come to us with a business problem and we are able to solve it 
for them irrespective o
f device, irrespective of form factor or property that 
they are going to have advertise on. So, from that perspective, I think 
things are going in the right direction.
 
As far as specifically how many advertisers have mobile landing pages that 
they can send
 
their users to? That number is not as much as we would like 
it. Obviously, we've had programs, we have talked about in the past earning 
calls like GoMo which help businesses go mobile, so those efforts are bearing 
fruit but broadly speaking, I think we ar
e happy with the progress we have 
made both on getting advertisers to be more mobilized and also what we are 
doing from a campaign management perspective to get more and more 
campaigns that can run across all devices and form factors.
 
Larry Page
 
I'll just 

mobile sites some are too simple and I find I get kind of frustrated on my 
phone sometimes when I have these mobile specific sites because I am 
using a modern Nexus 4 that can actually view
 
up the full site and I just find 
it confusing.
 
So, I think as an industry, we need to improve these experiences and that 
will take a bit of time, but I'd almost say that we should be designing for 
mobile the kind of mobile phones that we had now the state
-
of
-
the
-
art or a 
little bit beyond and that those experiences should work on all devices pretty 
well, so I'd actually like to us go more in that direction perhaps, so Patrick?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Just on my side, I need Ross, I need you to actually call us af
ter this. 
Because, when I look at our TAC for the Google Web as a percentage of 
website revenue, it is pretty stable to us and every way we look at it is 
pretty stable. So I am not sure if there is anything you are looking into it 
that we are missing but d
on't hesitate to follow
-
up with the IR team 

website side. Thanks, Ross.
 
Larry Page
 
Great, can we have our next question?
 
Operator
 
Yes, we will take our next question from 
Richard Kramer with Arete 
Research.
 
Richard Kramer

Arete Research
 
Thanks very much. Larry, a couple of quick questions. First of all, just to 
polish up this Mobile and CPC question, how many years do you think it's 
going to take before CPCs on Mobile and
 
Desktop are roughly equal trading 
off location and display size?
 
Another question, looking broadly at the business, there are a number of 
geographical markets like China where you are simply not able to operate. 
Do you see any prospect for being able to e
nter some of those markets in 
the medium term? Or do you think that the business is still going to be 
geographically constrained?
 
Then a quick one for Patrick, will there be an impairment test coming up on 
Motorola especially with respect to the IPR given 
the FTC settlement around 
Standards
-
Essential Patent? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Thanks, Richard, for all the questions. I think that's a threefer. The problem 
seems to be, and I am not going to make predictions about when they will 
be equal; I don't think they wi
ll be equal, I think probably one will always be 
bigger than the other, though, not clear which way but I don't think this is a 
long
-
term problem. I don't think this is a long time in coming, and I think as 
I have said before, there's a lot of advantages t
o mobile.
 
You already know location quite clearly, you can call somebody easily, you 
have a camera, you can hangout with the business, you can be notified 
instantly. There's just a lot of things about mobile that are amazing 
opportunities for advertisers a
nd for businesses. So I expect that to 
revolutionize how people do marketing and we are working hard on that. I 
expect that that will work a lot better for users and for advertisers and 
businesses, and therefore more money. We will be able to generate a lo
t 
more money than we do now.
 
Okay, so maybe Nikesh can address China.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
I thought I was getting the mobile CPC question, Larry.
 
Larry Page
 
You can do the second one first, though.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
Okay, I think it is fair to say we do operate in 
China right now. We have an 
ad sales business. We have a display business in the market. We know there 
is many users who use Android devices in the market. I think what's 
important to understand is the reason we decided to not operate in China 
was because 
we believe that we wanted to make sure that users are able to 
have unfettered access to our products, and the products where we believe 
they have ability to access in an unfettered fashion we do operate in the 
market.
 
It's only the ones where they aren't a
ble to access in the way we would like 
to, in which case they are able to access it through our operations in Hong 
Kong. So we think we operate in China, not in the way you might perceive it, 
but users have access to our services and there is even a small 
revenue 
business that we have in China.
 
Larry Page
 
Oaky, so, Patrick, what might be an impairment to us for Motorola?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Obviously, every time there is any formal kind of transactions or events that 
occur, we have to look at our balance sheet
 
and if is any impairment test. In 
the case of Motorola, we don't think there is actually right now. We have no 
information even with the Standards
-
Essential Patent. There is no 
information right now that leads us to believe that we have to do an 
impairmen
t test on any of it.
 
Remember that the Standards
-
Essential Patent for Motorola is a very small 
portion of the entire portfolio pool of patents that we got out of Motorola. 
So, just put that in the context as well. So, thanks for your question, 
Richard. Why

We will take our next question from Neil Doshi with Citigroup.
 
Neil Doshi

Citi
 
Thanks. Can you provide more details around the policy changes that were 
implemented in the quarter, and whether they wil
l continue to have an 
impact on CPCs and paid clicks in Q1?
 
Then also we were recently at the NRF convention in New York and we saw a 
demo of the Google Zavers product where users can click coupons, and then 
use those coupons in the offline retail world. H
ow big of an opportunity is 
really bridging the online ads with off
-
line transactions for Google and this is 
something that's a key initiative as we go into 2013? Thanks.
 
Larry Page
 
Thanks, Neil, for your question. So I think that Nikesh can give us 
some 
color on the policy.
 
Nikesh Arora
 

has been that we want to make sure that whatever ads are presented in 
whatever way our traffic is routed to ads, it is done in the best i
nterest of 
the user and we began to notice that they were sites and pages whereas we 
had too many ads in a page, so it became more restrictive and updated our 
policies for better enforcement and that has resulted in higher quality results 
for end users, it
 
has reduced in some cases the monetization that some of 
our partners are seeing as a result of this enforcement and hence you are 
seeing the impact on the numbers.
 
We just announced this policy sometime early this quarter, in the past 
quarter that we just
 
went through, so you are going to see the impact over 
the next few quarters. We've also implemented more stringent policies 
around downloadable apps, and that's why I think both those effects are 
going to stay with us for the year, but we think in the lon
g
-
term is the right 
answer for us, it's the right answer for users and it's right answer for 
advertisers, so we think it's a good thing to do.
 
Larry Page
 
We've been doing things like that for a while just making sure we are 
focused on user experience in ou
r advertising products and we found that 
that's been a very good long
-
term focus for our business that has really 
benefitted us. I think that's kind of the ordinary course of it there.
 
You mentioned bridging online ads with offline transactions. As I said 
mobile 
will increase the value of these kind of businesses. That's an example of it, 
which can actually measure if somebody gets an offer that they redeemed it 
in a real store or they went in the store or whatever it is. And so, we are 
very excited about t

those solutions work for consumers, advertisers and so on, but I think it's a 
great area that you highlighted that.
 
So, can we go to our next question?
 
Operator
 
We'll take our next question from Hea
ther Bellini with Goldman Sachs.

Hi, great. I had a question for Larry. I was just wondering if you could share 
with us your initial thoughts on the Google Fiber rollout. And also if you 
could outline for us your vision for 
the product if you look out over the next 
few years and how this might fit into your opening comments about multiple 
screens and unprecedented change in the consumer compute arena?
 
Larry Page
 
Well, I think it's been great to see the success there with the 
initial Fiber 
rollout. We are still in the very early stages of it. Obviously, we are going to 
a small number of people and so on, but we are excited about the 
possibilities there of getting people kind of give you the experience and 
really great Internet 
experience.
 
Patrick, do you want to add anything there?
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Yes. We are really focused on Kansas City right now and you've probably 
seen in the press. It's called now the Silicon Prairie. It's got a lot of press, 
because we've started to roll 
out, we started the implementation and the 
installs. We are growing up in terms of installs weeks after week and people 
just love the product. So, you are absolutely right, Heather, that we are 
really excited about this product and it's been a great succes
s overall.
 
So, while we are going to continue and as we've said all along, and here is 
another great example of one where it's not a hobby, we really think that we 
should be making good business with this opportunity and we are going to 
continue to look at
 
the possibility of expanding, but right now we just got to 
nail because we are in the early days. We just got to nail Kansas City. It's a 
perfect place for us to kind of debug all of the elements of the product and 
the experience for the users, but all
-
in
-
all, what a great opportunity to 
deliver kind of 100 times the average speed and that's what people are just 
dying to get everywhere. We have time for probably one last question.
 
Larry Page
 
Sorry I missed the second part of the question too, but it's a pr
etty big 
question, you wanted me to outline the vision for the products looking over 
the next few years. I guess the best way to predict the future is to make it, 
so that's what we are trying to do. I don't have anything specific to 
announce this time, but
 
I couldn't be more excited about some of the things 
I mentioned on Google Now of really understanding what your question is 
before you have it. Wouldn't that be great at the earnings call if we just 
answered all of your questions without you asking them, 
because that will be 
less work for you all. So, I think some of those things could really be reality 
and I think if you look at knowledge panels and I recently asked like really 
obscure question I was looking at the height of a bridge. I was like what's 
th
e height of the bridge? And I typed into the Google and it just spit out the 
answer, and I was dumbfounded you know but I didn't have to go and 
research that.
 
So, I think some of those things would seem kind of like science fiction 
where we are really gett
ing to Google apps. Sergey has really taken on and 
he used to think that was science fiction and he is running around with it 
wearing it, as am I sometimes as well. So, I think we are just really excited 
about the future and I think the rate of innovation 
in the world is increasing, 
and also I think Google and that's just really exciting place to be.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
We actually saw Sergey in New York last weekend, in the subway with his 
plastic bags and all. So we have time for one last question.

We will take our last question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.

Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you about Display 
to start. I think in the last couple of years you have given a run rate in 4Q. I 
was h
oping you could do that again for this past quarter and then also just 
talk about the early feedback and contribution from the YouTube App on iOS 
and then lastly any update on the features, timing and the process there? 
Thank you.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
So 
let me just jump on display. As we said many times in the past, we will 
give occasionally kind of numbers here and there just to give a sense of 
momentum, but we don't give them quarter
-
over
-
quarter or year
-
over
-
year. 
So that's exactly the case for display
. And in the case of early feedback on 
the contribution for YouTube App on iOS, I will leave it to Nikesh.
 
Nikesh Arora
 
We are very excited about the iOS app that we put out there, not just for 
YouTube but also for Google Maps. We think they both have trem
endous 
amount of success and it's an illustration of how, if you focus on the user 
and produce a great experience, it doesn't matter what platform it is. People 
will adopt it and adapt it and take to it. I think our partners and we both are 
excited about t
hat fact that these apps are successful. I don't think it's just a 
unilateral view. Back to Patrick.
 
Patrick Pichette
 
Sorry, I just saw, Doug, your question on the C Shares. Look, as we said 
previously, this recapitalization is subject to (inaudible) pendi
ng litigation 
right now and once the litigation has been resolved, we expect our Board of 
Directors to determine the exact timing of issuing the dividend. So, we can't 
really predict it yet, because it's litigation, but we don't expect it to occur 
before t

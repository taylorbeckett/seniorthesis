Mark Zuckerberg
 
All right. Thanks, Deborah. Thank you all for joining us today. Before we get 
started, I want to talk about the announce
ment we just shared that Sue 
Desmond
-
Hellmann is going to be leaving our Board to focus on her health 
and other commitments. Sue has been a wonderful and thoughtful voice on 
our Board for six years and I'm deeply personally grateful for everything that 
she
 
has done for this Company.
 
This was a good quarter for our community and our business. There are now 
around 2.8 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or 
Messenger each month and around 2.2 billion people using at least one of 
our services dai
ly. The Facebook app had a particularly strong quarter, 
including in the US and Canada.
 
We also recently released 
-
 
now that we estimate that more than 140 million 
businesses, mostly small businesses are using our services each month to 
grow, create jobs a
nd become social hubs in their communities.
 
This has been a busy quarter on a lot of fronts. We launched a number of 
new exciting products like Facebook Dating in the US, which is doing quite 
well; Threads for Instagram, our camera first experience to shar
e with your 
close friends, Facebook News, our dedicated product for news that we built 
in partnership with news publishers, and we introduced Horizon, a new social 
experience for VR. We also released hand
-
tracking technology for Oculus 
and Oculus Link. So 
your Quest is basically now a Rift too.
 
We're making progress building out the private social platform across 
WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram Direct, and we have multiple exciting 
initiatives around commerce and payments that we're moving forward from 
ma
rketplace to Instagram Shopping to payments in WhatsApp and 
continuing our discussion on Libra.
 
This has also been a busy quarter on the policy and social issues front. We 
formally entered into a settlement with the FTC to make structural changes 
and build
 
a rigorous privacy program that will set a new standard for our 
industry. We're about a year out now from the 2020 elections and we just 
announced that the systems we've built are so advanced that we proactively 
identified and removed multiple foreign int
erference campaigns coming from 
Russia and Iran. And we found ourselves in the middle of the debate about 
what political speech is acceptable in the upcoming campaigns.
 
But today I want to focus on talking about principles because from a 
business perspecti
ve it might be easier for us to choose a different path than 
the one that we're taking. So I want to make sure that everyone is clear 
about what we stand for and why we're making some of the decisions that 
we're making.
 
Now I gave a speech a couple of week
s ago about the importance of 
standing for voice and free expression. I believe strongly and I believe that 
history supports that free expression has been important for driving progress 
in building more inclusive societies around the world. And at times of
 
social 
tension, there's often been an urge to pull back on free expression and that 
we will be best served over the long term by resisting this urge and 
defending free expression.
 
Today is certainly a historical moment of social tension and I view an 
impo
rtant role of our Company as defending free expression. Now this has 
never been absolute and of course we take our responsibility to prevent 
harm very seriously too. I think we invest more in getting harmful content 
off our services than any other company 
in the world.
 
Those who follow us closely know that we have more than 35,000 people 
working on safety and security, and that our budget for this work is billions 
of dollars a year, more than the whole revenue of our Company at the time 
of our IPO earlier t
his decade. And we're going to keep on investing more 
here.
 
But while we work hard to remove content that can cause real danger, I 
think we also need to be careful about adopting more and more rules that 
restrict the way that people can speak and what they
 
can say. Right now the 
content debate is about political ads, should we block political ads with false 
statements or should be block all political ads. Google, YouTube and most 
Internet platforms run these same ads. Most cable networks run these same 
ads 
and of course national broadcasters are required by law to run them by 
FCC regulations. And I think that there are good reasons for this. In a 
democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians 
or the news.
 
And although I've co
nsidered whether we should not carry these ads in the 
past and I'll continue to do so, on balance so far I've thought that we should 
continue. Ads can be an important part of voice, especially for candidates 
and advocacy groups that the media might not oth
erwise cover, so that they 
can get their message into debates. And it's hard to define where to draw 
the line.
 
Would we really want to block ads for important political issues like climate 
change or women's empowerment. Now instead I believe that the bette
r 
approach is to work to increase transparency. Ads on Facebook are already 
more transparent than anywhere else. We have a political ads archive so 
anyone can scrutinize every ad that's run. You can see every message, who 
saw it, how much was spent, and th
at's something that no TV or print media 
does.
 
Now since this is an earnings call, I want to talk about the business impact 
of all of this. Some people accuse us of allowing the speech because they 
think that all we care about is making money and that's wr
ong. I can assure 
you that from a business perspective the controversy that this creates far 
outweighs the very small percent of our business that these political ads 
make up.
 
We estimate that these ads from politicians will be less than 0.5% of our 
revenu
e next year. That's not why we're doing this. To put this in 
perspective, the FTC finds that these same critics said, will it be enough to 
change our incentives was more than 10X bigger than this.
 
So the reality is that we believe deeply that political spe
ech is important and 
that's what's driving this. Now other people say that this policy is part of a 
broader pattern of us building a system that incentivizes inflammatory 
content to fuel our business. And again, to the contrary, I think that we've 
done mor
e than any of the other major Internet platforms to try to build 
positive incentives into our systems.
 
We don't let any of our newsfeed or Instagram feed teams set goals around 
increasing time spent on our services. We rank feeds to encourage 
meaningful so
cial interactions, helping people connect with friends, family 
and their communities.
 
We have real people come in and tell us what content they saw that was 
most meaningful to them and sport valuable discussions and then we build 
systems to try to surface 
that kind of content. We've taken many steps over 
the years to fight clickbait and polarization, and now we're even testing 
removing like counts in Instagram and Facebook. And we do this because we 
know that if we help people have meaningful interactions t
hat they'll find our 
services more valuable and that's the key to building something sustainable 
and growing over time.
 
Now last year, you'd probably remember that we made a series of changes 
that emphasized friends and family and reduced time spent on our
 
services. 
The one change removed 50 million hours of viral video watching a day and 
we did this knowing that it would mean that people spend less time on our 
apps, which is not what you do if you're just prioritizing engagement over 
everything else. So I 
take getting these incentives right very seriously and 
we're willing to make huge sacrifices in the short term to do what we think is 
right and we'll be better over time.
 
Now finally, some people say that this is just all a cynical political calculation 
an
d that we're acting in a way that we don't really believe because we're 
just trying to appear conservative. That's wrong too. Now we face a lot of 
criticism from both progressives and conservatives. And frankly if our goal, 
we're trying to make either side
 
happy, then we're not doing a very good job 
because I'm pretty sure everyone is frustrated with us.
 
Core values on voice and free expression are not partisans, but 
unfortunately in our current environment a lot of people look at every 
decision 
through the lens of whether it's going to help or hurt the candidate 
they want in winning their next election.
 
Now a lot of people have told us, you've got to pick a side, or else both sides 
are just going to cause a lot of problems for you and sadly from 
a practical 
perspective, they may be right, but we can't make decisions that way. So 
over the next year of campaigns, we're going to be at the center of the 
debate, anytime there's content or policies on any of our services that 
people believe could advant
age or disadvantage their side. This may lead to 
more investigations and the candidates are going to criticize us. I expect 
that this is going to be a very tough year. We try to do what we think is right 
but we're not going to get everything right. This is
 
complex stuff and anyone 
you said that the answers are simple hasn't thought long enough about all 
the nuances and downstream challenges.
 
I guess that some people are going to disagree with our decision. I guess 
that some people are going to think that th
ese decisions may have a 
negative impact on things that they really care about. But I don't think 
anyone can say that we are not doing what we believe or that we haven't 
thought hard about these issues. I could be wrong, but my experience 
running this Comp
any so far has been that if we do what we believe is right, 
even when it's unpopular for years at a time, then eventually it has worked 
out best for our community and for our business too. And there's a lot at 
stake here. We were at crossroad, not only in 
our own country, but in the 
future of the global Internet as well. China is building its own Internet and 
media ecosystem that's focused on very different values.
 
And as these systems compete, the question of which nation's values will 
determine what speec
h has allowed for decades to come really puts into 
perspective the issues that we face today because while we may disagree on 
exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at least can disagree 
and that's what free expression is about. Voice and ex
pression have been 
important for progress throughout history, they have been important in the 
fight for democracy worldwide. And I believe that voice and expression are 
an important part of the path forward today and that's why our Company 
will continue st
anding for these principles.
 
As always, I'm grateful for all of your support in everything that we do and 
that's especially true today. In addition to these challenges, there are a lot 
of great things that are going on that I am incredibly proud of and exc
ited 
about and I'm glad that our community and business trends continue 
heading in a good direction.
 
I'm happy to talk about any of these things in the Q&A and now here is 
Sheryl to talk more about our business.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi everyon
e. It was a strong quarter for our business. Ad 
revenue grew 28% year
-
over
-
year and we saw strong performance in all 
regions and on both Facebook and Instagram. Mobile ad revenue was $16.4 
billion, contributing approximately 94% of total ad revenue. We kno
w we 
have a very important responsibility to keep people safe and continue 
innovating to help businesses of all sizes grow. We're working hard to 
demonstrate our commitment to the billions of people and the 140 million 
businesses who use our platforms ever
y month.
 
I want to start by talking about some of the protections we're putting in 
place to keep people safe. As Mark said, the 2020 elections are only a year 
away. We're continuing to invest in people and technology so that we can 
disrupt networks of bad 
actors, find and remove that content and stop fake 
accounts before people see them. We're also making political advertising on 
Facebook more transparent than anywhere else. In 2018, we started 
requiring ads about social issues, elections or politics to get
 
authorized 
before running. And this quarter we strengthen those requirements to ask 
for even more information. Helping people understand who is trying to 
influence their vote without becoming arbiters of political truth ourselves is 
critical to empowering
 
people and keeping them safe.
 
We're also holding ourselves to a higher standard when it comes to 
protecting people from discrimination on Facebook. Earlier this year we 
reached an important settlement with the National Fair Housing Alliance, the 
ACLU, the
 
Communication Workers of America and others to restrict 
targeting options for housing, employment and credit ads. Now advertisers 
in these areas are required to use a new buying process and by the end of 
the year people will be able to view all current ho
using ads in the United 
States.
 
While these changes could have a small negative impact on our business in 
the short term, we believe they are the right thing to do for people and our 
business over the long term. At the same time, we're continuing to innova
te 
to grow our business and help advertisers grow theirs. We did that by 
improving our ads products and creating new formats to help advertisers 
more easily reach their current and future customers.
 
From the biggest brands in the world to the local barber,
 
we are committed 
to leveling the playing field for businesses of all sizes. We give businesses 
free tools that previously only the largest companies could access. But we 
know this is not enough. We also need to ensure that small businesses have 
the digita
l skills to use those tools effectively.
 
With the holiday shopping season approaching, we launched a series of 
holiday boot camp training sessions in 17 of our offices around the world 
from New York to Philippines. We also simplified business managers, our
 
tool 
for managing campaigns to help businesses more easily create ads that align 
with their goals. We are continually making these basis point improvements 
to help advertisers save time and money and build their business.
 
We're also focused on developing 
products to help businesses reach people 
where they are. Stories are a great example and we're continuing to see fast 
adoption across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. To make it 
easier for more businesses to create ads for the stories format, w
e recently 
launched customizable templates for Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. 
After uploading existing photos and videos, advertisers can choose from 
different layouts, color and text options. This helps businesses more easily 
create more engaging stor
ies.
 
Messaging is one of the fastest growing areas for online communication and 
especially between businesses and people. We've seen businesses use 
Messenger to reach customers, generate new leads and even sell cars. For 
example, French automaker Renault u
sed a combination of Instagram 
stories and click to Messenger ads to drive sales of a limited edition vehicle, 
the Captur Tokyo. Facebook was their only advertising channel and over the 
span of 30 days, they sold 100 cars, 20 directly through Messenger. Th
is 
quarter we added a click to Messenger feature in stories so businesses can 
grab some of the attention in stories and then continue the conversation.
 
We also continue to build new formats that enable brands to interact with 
people in fun and engaging way
s and make commerce more convenient. 
Earlier this year we launched polling stickers for ads and Instagram stories. 
In this quarter, we introduced our next wave of interactive advertising to 
help build even stronger connections between people and businesses
.
 
According to eMarketer, 63% of Internet users surveyed in the US say 
they've tried an augmented reality experience created by a brand. To help 
advertisers experiment with this, we launched a small beta test this quarter. 
As part of the test, we make up a
n Italian cosmetics brand, used their ads to 
give people an easy way to try on different shades of lipstick and they saw a 
27% lift in purchases.
 
While it is still very early days, we are making it easier for people to browse, 
discover, buy and sell across
 
our platform. Take Facebook Marketplace as an 
example. We launched the commerce platform three years ago this month 
and we're now seeing millions of interactions between buyers and sellers 
every day. From furniture to used vehicles, people have an opportu
nity to 
discover the things they love and advertisers in nearly 100 regions have an 
opportunity to reach people where they shop.
 
I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners around the world 
that continue to give us valuable feedback and how
 
we can better deliver on 
our responsibilities and help them grow. I also want to thank the Facebook 
teams who are deeply committed to making progress on the major social 
issues facing the Internet and our Company and driving growth for 
businesses. Thanks 
everyone and here is Dave.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon everyone. Let me begin with our 
community metrics. We were pleased with the growth of the Facebook 
Community this quarter, daily active users reached 1.62 billion, up 9% 
compared to 
last year led by growth in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
This represents approximately 66% of the 2.45 billion monthly active users 
in September.
 
MAUs grew 8% or 178 million compared to last year. We're pleased with the 
growth trends in all regions
, including the US and Canada. In terms of our 
Family metrics, we continue to grow and estimate that on average around 
2.2 billion people use at least one of our apps on a daily basis in September 
and around 2.8 billion were active on a monthly basis.
 
As a
 
reminder, the Family metrics are best estimate of our de
-
duplicated 
audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe 
that these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact 
that many people are using more than one o
f our services. Over time, we 
anticipate Family metrics will play the primary role in our disclosures and 
how we talk about the Company.
 
Turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q3, total revenue 
was $17.7 billion, up 29% or 31% 
on a constant currency basis. As expected, we saw a deceleration in our 
constant currency revenue growth versus the second quarter. Had foreign 
exchange rates remained constant with the third quarter of 2018, total 
revenue 
would have been approximately $297 million higher.
 
Q3 total ad revenue was $17.4 billion, up 28% or 31% on a constant 
currency basis. In terms of regional ad revenue growth, APAC and Rest of 
World were strongest and grew 35% and 34%, respectively. APAC got
 
more 
of a revenue lift from our recent product optimizations while Rest of World 
benefited from favorable macroeconomic trends compared to the weaker 
environment in Q3 of last year. North America and Europe grew 27% and 
24%, respectively.
 
In Q3, the numbe
r of ad impressions served across our services increased 
37% and the average price per ad decreased 6%. Impression growth was 
primarily driven by ads on Facebook News Feed, Instagram Stories and 
Instagram feed. The year
-
over
-
year decline in average price p
er ad was 
primarily driven by the ongoing mix shift towards geographies and Stories 
ads which monetize at lower rate. Payments and other fees revenue was 
$269 million, up 43%. This year
-
over
-
year growth was driven primarily by 
sales of new products, notabl
y, Oculus Quest.
 
Turning now to expenses, total expenses were $10.5 billion, up 32%. We 
ended Q3 with approximately 43,000 full
-
time employees, up 28%. 
Operating income was $7.2 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. 
Our Q3 tax rate was 17%. Net inc
ome was $6.1 billion or $2.12 per share. 
Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion driven by ongoing investments in data 
centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. We generated 
$5.6 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with app
roximately 
$52.3 billion in cash and investments. In Q3, we bought back approximately 
$1.2 billion of our Class A common stock.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. As I indicated on our second quarter 
call, we continue to expect a more pronounced decelerat
ion of our revenue 
growth rate in Q4. We expect our Q4 reported revenue growth rate will 
decelerate by mid to high single
-
digit percentage compared to our Q3 rate. 
This deceleration is largely driven by the lapping of several successful 
product optimizatio
ns in Q4 of last year, as well as ad targeting related 
headwinds. Since these factors are largely unique to Q4, we would expect 
our revenue growth deceleration in 2020 versus the Q4 rate to be much less 
pronounced.
 
Turning now to the 2019 expense 
outlook. Due to the FTC settlement 
announced earlier this year, we are providing our expense outlook on a 
dollar basis for additional clarity. We anticipate 2019 total expenses will be 
approximately $46 billion to $48 billion. As a reminder, this range inc
ludes 
$5 billion in accruals we recorded in the first half of 2019 related to our FTC 
settlement. We expect 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $16 
billion compared to our prior estimate of $16 billion to $18 billion. Our 
capital expenditures a
re driven primarily by our ongoing investments in data 
centers, servers and network infrastructure.
 
Turning now to tax. We expect our Q4 tax rate will be in the range of 18% to 
20%. I'd also like to share our initial outlook on 2020 expenses. We 
anticipate
 
that our 2020 total expenses will be in the range of $54 billion to 
$59 billion. Our plan to re
-
accelerate headcount growth as well as growth in 
non
-
headcount related expenses like marketing factors into this guidance. 
We expect that 2020 capital expendit
ures will be approximately $17 billion 
to $19 billion driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities 
and our network infrastructure. Lastly, we anticipate our 2020 effective tax 
rate will be in the range of 18% to 20%.
 
In summary, Q3 was
 
a strong quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with the 
growth of our community and continued momentum in our ads business. At 
the same time, we continue to make investments in important areas like 
privacy, safety and innovation.
 
With that, operator, let's
 
open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
We will now open the lines for a question
-
and
-
answer session. [Operator 
Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from 
JPMorgan.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking 
the question. First off, Dave, can you just help us 
understand a little bit more on the 4Q on the revenue decel, just some of 
the product improvements from last year that you're lapping. And then also 
just how you're thinking about the ad targeting headwin
ds considering that 
they didn't seem to show up in the 3Q numbers that much. And then, Mark, 
can you just talk about Instagram Shopping. How that's ramping and how 
you're thinking about expanding that initiative as you're going deeper into 
4Q here. Thanks.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Hey, Doug, it's Dave. Yes, on the Q4 outlook, we are lapping a few different 
product optimizations. We made a couple of those that I would cite as 
optimizations and how the ad auction operates, which can have an impact 
and also an increase in 
ad load on IG feed and stories. And so, as I noted, 
these are factors that are largely Q4 related. And given that we would 
expect that 2020 revenue deceleration to much less pronounced.
 
And then in addition, in Q4, and over the longer term, we do continue 
to 
expect to face ad targeting related headwinds and uncertainties. And I just 
go back to the three factors that I cited in the past that the regulatory 
landscape is continuing to evolve. So for example, when GDPR came into 
effect, we saw a number of peopl
e who opted out on allowing us to use 
context from the apps and websites they visited for ad targeting.
 
And then the second factor is just we're seeing proposed changes from the 
mobile platforms that are more oriented towards privacy which could affect 
tar
geting and measurement and make that more difficult. And then finally, 
we are rolling out our own product changes such as the recent launch of 
OSA that's our user control on what data stored on Facebook activity. So I'd 
say those three factors still factor
 
in. And when it comes to this, I'd say the 
majority of the potential signal loss is still in front of us rather than behind 
us. So I think those headwinds are still real and out there and that factors 
into our outlook as well.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I'll take th
e Instagram Shopping question. We think there is a big 
opportunity over the long run here because 90% 
--
 
more than 90% of 
Instagram users are following a business. But on the shopping product itself, 
it is still very early days and we're working to improve
 
the product and it's 
quite small. We started testing in Q3 shopping ads, the idea that shoppers 
can tap on ad, see a product description page and can purchase from the 
business' mobile site.
 
Again, we think interesting product, but very nascent. Our overa
ll commerce 
efforts go across not just Instagram but Facebook and all of our properties, 
and our goal is to make it more convenient and accessible and secure for 
people and business to browse, discover, buy and sell. I think we have been 
and continue to be
 
a great place for people to browse and discover. That 
continues to drive the great, great majority of our business and well for the 
foreseeable future. But as we can help people reduce friction and close that 
loop, we think that's a good opportunity for p
eople and for our business.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
Great, thank you. Maybe one for Mark and one for Dave. First on Watch, 
with all the OTT launches, it's kind of intere
sting. Can you talk about your 
usage of the Watch tab and what your overall professional content strategy 
is and whether it could start contributing revenues going forward. And then 
Dave, you mentioned the headcount growth accelerating. Could you give us 
s
ome of the areas where you'll be adding headcount next year. Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I'm happy to talk about Watch for a little bit. I don't think we have any new 
status to share on this, but I mean overall we rolled out the tab for 
--
 
almost 
the first 
year we were really tuning it just to make sure that it would be 
retentive and very valuable for people. So they are in general 
--
 
the way we 
think about this stuff is, we try not to put something in front of a lot of 
people unless we're confident that the
y're going to find it useful and want to 
come back and use it multiple times and we can put a lot of things in front of 
people not to try it once, but we want to wait until things are kind of 
retentive and useful. So we got to there on Watch, it's growing 
well and that 
is 
--
 
so we're kind of still now focused on continuing to make it better and 
continuing to grow it.
 
The premium content part of it, yes, I think the right way to think about this 
is almost as marketing to help people try out the tab for the f
irst time. There 
are some good tent pole pieces of content that people really love that they 
come and they check out the product to experience that and then they stay 
for a lot of the other valuable content that's in there and that might not be 
talked abou
t as much in the news. So, that's I think the right way to think 
about that.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Hey, Justin, it's Dave. On the 2020 expense outlook, that includes headcount 
growth and also other expense growth sort of around infrastructure is a big 
factor as well
. We're seeing that large CapEx build over the last several 
years flowing through depreciation and cost of revenue. So that's a driver of 
the growth as well. We are planning to reaccelerate or accelerate hiring in 
2020 and that's really going to be focused
 
on the important priorities of the 
Company. So that includes our privacy, safety and security investments. So 
we are investing a lot in privacy related to building the products and also 
working on complying with the FTC settlement.
 
And then we're continui
ng to invest heavily in our innovation investments. 
That includes building products around Facebook and Instagram and 
continuing to improve those but also in new developing areas like AR/VR. So 
those are big factors in growth. And then we are planning on g
rowing non
-
headcount related expenses as well like marketing and ultimately that will 
depend on how the ROI of those investments play out over time.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for 
taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. You gave us a little bit 
of color on Asia and Rest of World and why those had accelerated. Any 
additional color you could give on sort of the US and Europe or things you 
saw in the quarter that might have impacted 
the growth rates in those 
regions. And going to the Q4 guide, is there any color you can give us on 
how different regions of the world might be impacted against the mid to high 
single
-
digit deceleration of the levels of Q3 just so we have a better 
understa
nding of where you might be seeing some of those tougher comps 
or product optimizations play out on a global scale. Thanks so much.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Thanks, Eric. We're not breaking out specific regional impact, but let me give 
you some color around the acceler
ation in areas like Rest of World and 
APAC. APAC benefited from some of the product optimizations we did in the 
quarter. One thing that I would cite there, it's just how we manage ad load 
and balance some of our internal promotion units and sort of use it 
as 
internal house spend and the nature of the changes that we made in that 
had a more pronounced impact in some of the lower ARPU countries and 
unlocked more impression growth in those markets. So that was one of the 
factors. And then Brazil was particular
ly weak last Q3. So that had a good 
compare on a macroeconomic basis.
 
In terms of the Q4 guide, not anything I would say specifically there. In the 
US, we will have a shorter holiday season, it's hard to know how that's going 
to play into it just given the
 
late arrival of Thanksgiving, but I think overall 
the product optimizations that we're comping against in Q4 were global 
changes. So I think we're going to see the deceleration impact all regions.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian N
owak from Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first on 
--
 
Mark, you 
mentioned Facebook app in particular had a strong quarter in the US and 
Canada. We can see it in the DAU numbers. We would be curious to hear 
about a
ny specific products or changes or types of behavior you're seeing 
that really is driving the stronger engagement on Big Blue. And the second 
one, you have so many monetization I guess call them almost products to 
come. You talked about commerce and IGTV a
nd Stories and Discover. Just 
as we sort of think about the timing of these, which one or two of those are 
you sort of most excited about to drive the business into 2020? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, I can take the first one on the Facebook app. It's a bun
ch of different 
places in which I think we made improvements. I would say globally 
especially outside the US, we saw good improvements around 
--
 
engagement around video. In the US, I think it was less video and more core 
feed engagement. So it's a bunch of
 
different factors and I think we're 
seeing good engagement from a bunch of cohorts in the US, which is good. 
But of course we are highly penetrated in the US and Canada. So we would 
expect that to bounce around. So I think we saw great growth this quarter
. 
We are quite penetrated.
 
In terms of monetization opportunities, I can speak to that and Mark can 
add color if you would like. Obviously 
--
 
and Sheryl would like to add color 
as well. So, Stories is obviously one of the big growing areas for us and 
conti
nues to be a big driver. We're also seeing opportunities around 
Instagram Explore going into 2020. We're now monetizing with that product 
and more advertisers are buying from it and then Sheryl is going to jump in 
and I think give some additional color.
 
Sh
eryl Sandberg
 
Yes, I think in terms of our core advertising products and growth, it's worth 
really remembering that our core feed products for Facebook and Instagram 
are growing nicely and well. And we see a lot of opportunity to continue that 
growth. Defi
nitely, Stories is a big part of the success. We've had I think a 
lot of success moving advertisers to where people already are. That's what 
happened with mobile ads. People weren't really doing mobile ads and we 
helped them get there. I think we've taken 
our experience on how to help 
advertisers migrate to the right places and been able to do that even more 
quickly in new formats like Stories.
 
So of our more than 7 million advertisers, we already have 3 million 
advertising across Facebook, Instagram and Me
ssenger Stories. And I think 
that's because we learned that we have to do a lot to help them move. So 
for example, advertisers can now buy Stories across Facebook, Instagram 
and Messenger all at once. We had automatic default templates which 
convert your f
eed ads into vertical Stories format and this quarter we just 
launched customizable templates, which help you save time and resources. 
So as we have to help advertisers move, we've learned how to make those 
investments in making the formats really easy, th
e measurement really 
easy, the buying really easy.
 
Now, the mix to Stories is a big opportunity for us. Stories still does 
monetize at the same rate as a News Feed right now. So, we're keeping an 
eye on that. But the growth over the long run is pretty exci
ting. And I think 
our ability to help people migrate is something that we're able to prove out 
quarter over quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital 
Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Mark, who would you want to add to t
he Board or what sort of voice would 
you want to add to the Board that would be particularly helpful for you in the 
Company now. And then, David, could you talk about that Stories 
monetization gap, to what extent it's closing the rate at which it's closing
. 
Thank you.
 
Dave Wehner
 
I can take the Stories monetization gap first and give Mark the second. So 
on that, I think what we're continuing to see with Stories monetization is, 
that is a product that's experiencing a lot of impression growth. And 
whenever w
e have a product that's experiencing high impression growth 
that puts pressure on the auction in terms of price. And we've also seen 
good impression growth on the feed side as well. So if you noted in the 
commentary when I talked about the drivers of impre
ssion growth, I listed 
feed impressions from Facebook first. So I think that's also showing good 
growth.
 
So I'd say overall not a big change in the gap there and overall the 
impression growth is really the story for Stories and will remain the story we 
thi
nk for the near future. So that will not be a price
-
driven revenue growth 
story, but rather an impression growth, revenue growth story.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, on Board members, there are a lot of great leaders who serve on our 
Board, who have served on our B
oard. It's been an incredible benefit 
running the Company. We face a very wide range of issues here from really 
hard technological problems to issues scaling large organizations to of 
course a lot of now major regulatory and social issues and having differ
ent 
people or different perspectives can help us navigate that and provide both 
advice and oversight to make sure that we're doing a good job is really 
important.
 
And I just want to add one more time, Sue really did an amazing job on our 
Board and I'm sad 
to see her go and she has really helped shape a lot of 
what we do and I'm just incredibly grateful, perfect to mentioned it here.

Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
Thanks. Two 
questions, if I can. First you mentioned a little bit earlier the 
OFA feature that you rolled out this quarter in just a few markets. So can 
you give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of early user response to 
this, how it may be impacting targetin
g in those markets. And then 
secondly, you've disclosed on occasion kind of daily search query volumes, 
you're now expanding ad inventory more into search. So I'm wondering if 
you can give us an updated sense of query volumes and then how we should 
think a
bout ad coverage ramping over time within search given a lot of the 
searches on the platform today are people searches and how we should 
think about that. Thanks.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Sure, I'll take those. In terms of the OFA roll out we initially launched that in
 
August and we've been continuing to slowly roll that out globally and we'll be 
doing that over the next several months through the end of the year. And 
we're rolling it out globally on a percentage basis. We've seen a positive 
reception to having this fea
ture as an option. It's too early to share adoption 
and we'll just have to see kind of over time how that gets picked up and how 
that gets adopted. But I think it's too early to really share much about it.
 
In terms of search, we are showing ads in Marketpl
ace in FB search results. 
But really the vast majority of searches on Facebook are for people, not 
topics related to retailer e
-
commerce. So, it's very early days. And from a 
revenue perspective, it's not material at this point.

Your next question
 
comes from the line of Youssef Squali from SunTrust.
 
Youssef Squali
 
Thank you very much. Two questions from me as well. Mark, with GDPR now 
over a year old, how has it impacted your business relative to your own 
expectations and how does that inform your 
views about the potential 
impacts from CCPA in 2020. And then on VR, it seems like your vision has 
taken a bit longer than expected to materialize. Can you speak to the gating 
factors there and do you feel that now that Quest is at $400 and there 
seems to 
be a lot more content out there, we're going to see potentially an 
acceleration in adoption. Thank you.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Youssef, I'll take the question. I think it was about GDPR and how that's 
gone relative to expectations. We've seen adoptions around people 
who are 
opting out of allowing us to use context from the apps. And so I'd say that 
was largely within the range of expectations that we saw and it is having an 
impact and the people who are opting out are seeing less relevant ads. And 
obviously that will 
impact both, I think, the quality of the experience in 
terms of the ads they get and also the monetization for us. So I think that is 
kind of playing out as we expected.
 
CCPA, I think is still a work in progress. So we're watching the developments 
on that 
closely. That's the California Consumer Privacy Act, and that has 
many similar provisions to GDPR, but it's a different line. We're going to 
have to watch how that evolves, but we do think that that's a factor that 
we're watching closely and we'll just hav
e to see how that develops. I think, 
Mark, question was on Oculus.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. And then also just add something on privacy. I think it's very 
important that there is federal privacy legislation. GDPR encodes a lot of 
important principles and in o
rder for businesses to be able to operate, 
especially starts to get started and keep the market competitive, you want 
to make sure that there aren't 50 different regulatory frameworks that 
companies need to follow. I mean, we could handle that if we needed
 
to, 
we're a big company. But in terms of for the market overall, I just think it 
would be a lot better if we had a very clear set of rules at the federal level 
on privacy. So we'll continue to try to work with folks to try to do what we 
can to help there.
 
On VR and AR, you're right. This is taking a bit longer than we thought. And 
I'm still optimistic, I think that the long
-
term vision and the reasons why I 
thought this 
--
 
we're going to be important and big are unchanged. So we're 
seeing a lot of people u
se these products and love them and because of that 
I think that we're still going to get there. Obviously, the fact that it's taking 
a little longer than we thought, it cuts both ways. On the one hand, that of 
course means that the future might be a few y
ears further out and that it 
might be more expensive to develop because we'll be funding this for a bit 
longer until it gets there.
 
But on the other hand, from our perspective, we're not a company that's 
traditionally done hardware or built operating syste
ms or these kind of 
products. So every year that we get to practice and get better and build our 
brand around Oculus in terms of building the best products that we can in 
this space, I just think that we're going to be better off when this is really 
ready 
to be a completely mainstream thing with hundreds of millions of 
people using it.
 
You're right that Quest is growing and doing quite well. We are selling them 
as fast as we can make them, the demand has been strong and the content 
is starting to pick up bo
th on the AAA, really high quality side and some of 
the [indiscernible] stuff that I think is quite good. I'm very excited about 
what we're seeing and very optimistic about the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Ba
rclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. So guys, just a question on the 2020 rev outlook, calling for a more 
modest deceleration. So, Dave, I guess what are some of the headwinds, 
tailwinds that you might see in 2020 that would cause the deceleration? Is 
this a functi
on of lapping some of the impression acceleration you're seeing 
now in some of these innovations that you've had in '19 or is there things 
like the drawing on both the late stage VC funding market and some of those 
companies potentially coming back on thei
r marketing plans. Is that a 
material factor? What are some of the other headwinds for next year?
 
And then one housekeeping question is, the 4Q mid to high single
-
digit 
decel, is that referring to constant FX growth rate or is that reported US 
dollar growt
h rate that you're expecting the decel from? Thank you.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Yes, sure, Ross. It's a reported number that we're giving that on, on a mid 
to high
-
single digit deceleration from the reported growth rate. I don't think 
there should be a huge difference
 
in them, but we're giving it on a reported 
basis. So in terms of the deceleration, we continue to expect deceleration 
into 2020, but it would be, we believe, more moderated and the reasons for 
that, that we expect the deceleration. We do continue to see t
hese ad 
targeting related headwinds, which have been playing out slowly, but we 
think are still in front of us. The majority of potential signal loss on targeting 
is still in front of us. And that's the three factors that I cited, the regulatory 
landscape,
 
potential platform changes and then the adoption of our own 
products like OFA that we're just rolling out now.
 
So all of those will play into the potential deceleration of revenue growth in 
2020. Obviously, we're lapping what's been good performance in 20
19 
where we've made a lot of product improvements and growing off a large 
base. So I think we are experiencing deceleration from that perspective. The 
specific sort of high level of deceleration going into Q4, we're signing the 
specific optimizations that 
we're lapping in Q4, which were more significant.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman 
Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. I just wanted to go back to the opening remarks about the 35,000 
people. I think you 
mentioned that you have working on safety and is that 
you're spending more, I think your budget for this area you said is more 
than it was back when you went public in 2012. So, maybe about $5 billion. 
I just was wondering if you could share with us your v
iew on how much 
you're using, you talked about AI in the past being helpful here. How long 
does this have to be as resource
-
intensive from a people perspective or do 
you see the ability over time as with technologies like AI potentially helping 
you to get 
more leverage out of this existing budget, so maybe you don't 
have to continue to ramp it as quickly as your user base and engagement 
continues to grow. Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So over time we may not have to ramp it as much, but I don't foresee 
a
ny time in the near future that AI is going to make it to that if the cost 
comes down. In general what we have to do is we use computers and AI for 
what they're good for which is looking at a lot of content very quickly and 
making quick judgments. And we h
ave teams of people doing what people 
are good for which is making nuanced human judgments. And so you build 
the computer system, in that way they can flag and get rid of some of the 
worst stuff, and so they can flag for human review, some of the stuff tha
t's 
borderline and then there's just so much content flowing through the system 
that we do need a lot of people looking at this. And I don't think that's going 
to change anytime soon.
 
Dave Wehner
 
And Heather, I would add that when you're using systems to l
ook at content, 
when you're using AI machine learning systems, it's a real benefit to have 
actual people looking and tagging that content, classifying it because it helps 
those machine learning algorithms be able to learn what they're looking at. 
So you ac
tually have 
--
 
we do have actually ramped in people who are doing 
the tagging and classification. So there is actually expense related to AI 
that's on the human side in the near
-
and medium
-
term as well. So very 
much in line with what Mark said. Over time i
t's an opportunity to maybe 
slow down the growth, but it's not going to change the dynamics in the near 
term.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Thank you. Mark, maybe a bigger picture question. I
'm wondering how you 
think about the increase in scrutineer oversights impacting your or the 
Company's ability to explore new services, new markets and ultimately 
remain competitive or is that not really a factor at this point? And then on 
payments, relate
d to the WhatsApp test, I'm just wondering how far off in 
the distance do you think we are from seeing a connected payments 
ecosystem across the family of apps and do the growing pains for Libra 
impact the timing of that. Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. S
o look, I think some of what you might be asking about are the 
antitrust questions that are out there in the investigations and I can talk a 
bit about this, if it's helpful. I mean, look, I think a lot of the antitrust 
questions that are out there that are
 
going to be about our acquisition of 
Instagram, right. And some of that 
--
 
how that might affect other things that 
we do today, but 
--
 
so there's going to be a lot of scrutiny of that acquisition 
in particular. And so I think if it's helpful I'll go back 
to what it was like at 
the time there when we did that acquisition just to kind of lay out how we 
were thinking about this.
 
And at the time of course in some way we considered Instagram to be a 
competitor, but we've always thought that the better way to ta
rget 
--
 
to 
think about Instagram was that it's complementary to Facebook and what 
we're doing. Back in 2012, people generally didn't think of Instagram as 
competing with our core service. We thought about Instagram in the context 
of this new mobile camera 
space that was complementary. If you remember, 
back then we were building the Facebook camera app. There were lots of 
different services. There is a camera plus VSCO Cam, Socialcam, Viddy, 
Snapseed. There were even apps like PAS [ph]. They were all in the 
same 
space.
 
We thought that mobile photos we're going to be important. So we were 
competing there with things like Facebook camera, but we ultimately 
thought that we were going to do better work if we were building with 
Instagram. But if you remember at th
e time, Instagram was focused on 
helping people take photos, apply creative filters and share them publicly 
across different social networks including Facebook. It wasn't a full featured 
social network itself. It only had about 30 million people using it a
t the time.
 
I mean, I remember specifically Kevin and I set a goal that we hope that one 
day Instagram might reach 100 million people. And I know that that seems 
quaint today compared to how well it's done. But remember that a lot of the 
other services tha
t were Instagram's peers and were growing quickly at the 
time including startups with strong teams and very talented founders like 
Path don't really even exist today anymore.
 
So look, I mean at the end of the day, the FTC makes its judgment on what 
we can 
do, the FTC had all this context when they made this decision in 
2012. And the reality is, it ends up being a lot more complementary than I 
think we ever expected. Look, I mean, building services like this is hard, 
right. Instagram wouldn't be what it is t
oday without Kevin and Mike who 
are just really incredible product leaders and of course did a lot of amazing 
work. But it also wouldn't be what it is without everything that we put into it 
and whether that's the infrastructure or our advertising model or 
spam and 
safety services and a lot more.
 
And I know it can be really hard given how well things have gone to look 
back and remember what the world was like at the time that we made this 
acquisition. But our outlook was really different then and the outcome
 
was 
not all guaranteed. So look, I mean I think for all the concern about whether 
there is enough competition, the space today continues to be incredibly 
competitive. We have different competitors in the space today like Snapchat, 
which shows that people 
are always building new ideas.
 
And on mobile phones. Of course remember that both Apple and Google has 
built cameras and private photo sharing and photo management directly into 
their operating system. So I think that kind of gives you a picture of how we 
think about some of the scrutiny that's coming and just how we think about 
doing these things in general.
 
Dave Wehner
 
About commerce.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Yes, sorry. Yes, how far off is a connected commerce 
--
 
payment ecosystem.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure well, I 
mean we do a lot of stuff around commerce. I mean, we have 
Facebook Marketplace is probably the most advanced and hundreds of 
millions of people use that to buy and sell things. Instagram Shopping of 
course a lot earlier. But we're very optimistic about it
. But we are optimistic 
on the timeframe of years, right not driving next quarter's business. And 
then in terms of payments, there's multiple approaches that we're taking 
there. We're of course working on payments in WhatsApp. We have our test 
going in Ind
ia. It's the test really shows that a lot of people are going to 
want to use this product. We're very optimistic that we're going to able to 
launch to everyone in India soon, but of course will share more news when 
we have that.
 
And we also differentiate b
etween payment systems that are built on top of 
the existing financial infrastructure like what we're trying to do with 
WhatsApp payments or when we make payments in Instagram Shopping, 
and our work with something like Libra that is trying to build some ne
w 
technological infrastructure for financial services. So they're working on 
different thing. If Libra works, then it will be able to make certain kind of 
payments whether they're micropayments or remittances across borders. 
We'll be able to be done much f
aster and much more affordably than it can 
happen today on top of existing rail.
 
So I remain optimistic that we'll be able to do work there, but we're just 
working across a lot of different fronts here because this is a huge space. It's 
one of the areas th
at I am most excited and optimistic about for the years 
ahead. There's a lot to do, which is why we have a lot of different projects 
that we're trying to push forward here.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Operator, we have time for one last question.
 
Operator
 
Your 
last question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from Moffett 
Nathanson.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Thanks. Let me as one of Mark, one of Dave. So, Mark, I mean, a couple of 
quarters ago we asked you about the embracing or maybe paying for news, 
and it looks 
like you've struck some deals with some publishers. Can you 
talk a bit about that pivot and what the rationale is and maybe how big is 
that vision for any news. And then for Dave, there's reports tonight about 
Cognizant who I guess [indiscernible] been the
 
Facebook screeners, Head of 
AI is dropping a contract. Do you expect to bring that job in
-
house or is that 
a third
-
party outsourcing opportunity?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Dave, do that and then I'll wrap on,
 
Dave Wehner
 
Yes. Thanks, Michael. No plans to bring that
 
in
-
house. We obviously have a 
lot of people in
-
house who work with the third
-
parties on that front. But we 
have a wide variety of different partners beyond Cognizant who work with 
us. So there is no change in model planned on that front. But we continue t
o 
obviously invest heavily in that work and we'll continue to work with other 
partners in that space.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
All right, so on news, there are two things that I'm quite excited about here. 
One is just building a dedicated product space for high qua
lity news. And the 
second is having a business partnership with news publishers that I think 
can be sustainable over the long term. So I'll talk a bit about both of them 
and why I think they are important. We'll start with the product, which is if 
you look
 
at the Facebook app overall, for a lot of years the app was 
synonymous with News Feed, right, the main tab in the app and of course 
everyone who uses Facebook pretty much uses News Feed.
 
And one of the questions that we had was, there are of course a lot 
of things 
that some people want to do, but not everyone and we weren't sure if we 
were going to be able to build a secondary tab in the app that could be 
meaningful even if most people didn't use them. But we started building 
things like Marketplace, that 
is a tab that and even if the majority of people 
on Facebook don't use it, it's still hundreds of millions of people are using it. 
So that's really, that's really valuable.
 
And we built Watch. We're seeing a similar trend there. It took us a little 
while t
o really get it to work the way that we wanted, but now it's growing 
quickly, that's going to be hundreds of millions of people who are using it. 
We rolled out Facebook Dating. I don't know if that will be many hundreds of 
millions of people just because o
f the size of that market, but it's going be 
very useful for tens of millions of people around the world, maybe a hundred 
million or more. And we are of course doing this with groups and there will 
be opportunities to do this in other places, including wit
h news.
 
So I think in the future if this works out, what we're going to see is that how 
people use the Facebook app is going to be, they're going to keep on using 
News Feed, they are going to keep on sharing with friends and family, but 
the average person 
will also probably have one, two or three other apps or 
kind of secondary tabs that they use that are quite useful for them in 
connecting with their broader community on Facebook. But those things that 
each individual use, they're going to vary from person
 
to person. So it's not 
going to be that everyone is using News Feed, they're going to have 
--
 
different people are going to care about different things, whether it's 
community, or marketplace marketplace for some or dating or news for 
others.
 
And surely e
ven though not everyone comes to Facebook, because they 
want high quality news , I believe that there are going to be, whether it's 
10% or 20% at a floor who I think would really want something like this. 
And, we're going to work with the news publishers t
o make this very 
valuable and I'm optimistic that we can get there. So that's the kind of the 
product strategy on the Facebook side. Produce publishers, the thing that 
I'm excited about is, look, I do think that we have a responsibility to help 
work with n
ewest publishers to fund high quality journalism. It's no secret 
that the Internet has disrupted the business model for journalism. And I 
think that that means that the major Internet platforms have a responsibility 
to form partnerships and help to fund th
is work.
 
And the challenge that we've had historically. Is that when most of the 
usage of the Act was a News Feed. What our community told us is that they 
really wanted more content from friends and family and less other stuff, 
right. So less public video 
is less of other content besides friends and family. 
So even though we were talking to a lot of news publishers and we wanted 
to find a way to support and they of course wanted more distribution and 
some kind of financial relationship. It didn't really mak
e a lot of sense in the 
past to pay for content to that a lot of our community was generally telling 
us that they want to see other stuff instead of that.
 
But now with the dedicated news tab. We finally have a space where the 
business model forward really 
works for us to be in a long
-
term sustainable 
financial relationship with news publishers, where we can pay them for high 
quality content that can go in there that will be what would fuels the tab. It 
makes it a great product. And I think in doing so. This
 
can be a long
-
term 
virtuous cycle and sustainable business model in way that we can help 
support journalism. And I'm really happy to do this.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This was 
another g
ood quarter, and we continue to grow the size and engagement of 
our community. 1.55 billion people now use Facebook every month and 
more than 1 billion people use Facebook every day. On mobile, we continue 
to have a lot of momentum. 1.39 billion people now
 
use Facebook on mobile 
devices, including more than 1 billion on Android. 50 million people also use 
Facebook Lite, our app for people on low bandwidth connections and one of 
our fastest
-
growing interfaces. This is a great sign for how our mobile 
strategy
 
continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms.
 
When it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our results. This 
quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion and advertising revenue grew by 
45% from a year ago. We've already accom
plished a lot this year, and these 
results show how we're getting stronger as a community and as a business.
 
But we want to serve the entire global community, not just the people who 
are on Facebook today. Connecting everyone is one of the fundamental 
chal
lenges of our time and to achieve this, we need to continue innovating 
faster and investing for the long
-
term. That means continuing to invest in 
our core products and services as well as technologies and strategies that 
allow us to achieve a truly global 
reach over time.
 
Let's talk about how we're doing this, and let's start with how we're 
improving our core products to better serve our existing communities and 
businesses. This quarter, we introduced some big updates on Facebook to 
give people more options
 
for expressing themselves. We began rolling out 
an improved mobile profile design, including the ability to add a profile video 
instead of just a photo.
 
We also started testing Reactions, a new version of the Like button that 
provides more ways for expres
sing love, awe and sympathy. We think this is 
going to provide a much more engaging experience.
 
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is 
by helping them to share many different types of content with different 
groups of peopl
e they care about. One example is our progress with Groups 
on Facebook. More than 925 million people now use Groups each month. In 
some countries, more than half of the population is participating. From a 
youth organization in Chicago to aid workers dealin
g with the refugee crisis 
in Europe, we've seen many inspiring examples of people using Groups to 
collaborate.
 
Video is another area where we continue to make progress. On average, 
there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more 
th
an 500 million people who are watching daily. To offer even more 
engaging video experiences, we've added live video to our Mentions app for 
public figures, and we now support interactive 360 videos in News Feed. 
We've also rolled out new video tools for pa
ges and begun testing a 
dedicated video section on Facebook.
 
Over the next few years, video is going to be some of the most engaging 
content online, and by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to 
build the best place to watch and share videos.
 
Whe
n it comes to serving businesses, we continue to create a lot of value. 
We now have more than 2.5 million active advertisers on Facebook and 
more than 45 million small and medium
-
sized businesses actively using 
Facebook pages. This quarter, we continued to
 
focus on helping marketers 
achieve results while using our ad product, including video and carousel ads 
as well as on Instagram, and as usual, Sheryl is going to talk more about 
this in a moment.
 
Now, let's talk about how we're working to develop our next
 
generation of 
apps and services. For Instagram, this was a busy quarter. The community 
celebrated its five
-
year anniversary and reached a new milestone of 400 
million monthly actives. More than 80 million photos are now shared on 
Instagram every day, and 
the pace of adoption among public figures, 
organizations and people around the world continues to grow really well. 
When President Obama visited Alaska in September, he used Instagram to 
document his trip, and this is a great example of how Instagram is ch
anging 
the way that people see the world.
 
With our efforts in messaging, we're also making progress at building 
WhatsApp and Messenger both into great platforms of global scale. Last 
quarter, WhatsApp reached 900 million monthly actives and continues to be
 
on a path to reach 1 billion people and beyond. Messenger has over 700 
million monthly actives, and we continue to focus on improving the core 
messaging experience. A good sign of our progress is the more than 9.5 
billion photos now sent monthly on Messen
ger.
 
We're also building many different tools that can offer useful experiences to 
people beyond just traditional messaging. One example is M, a digital 
assistant we introduced this quarter that over time will use AI to help people 
complete tasks.
 
Finally,
 
let's talk about some of our longer
-
term efforts in innovation to help 
connect the world. With Internet.org, we have a lot of momentum. We've 
now rolled out free basic Internet services to people in 29 countries, and 
overall brought more than 15 million p
eople online. As we rolled out the 
program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from 
communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic 
services to all developers who want to build.
 
Meanwhile, our work on new techn
ologies to connect people in the most 
remote regions continues to make progress. This quarter we revealed Aquila, 
our first aircraft designed to beam internet into communities down from the 
sky. And we also announced a partnership to bring internet to larg
e parts of 
sub
-
Saharan Africa using a satellite, which is launching next year.
 
And with Oculus, we're in a great position to begin delivering a new 
generation of shared immersive experiences, we plan to ship the Rift 
headset early next year. And Gear VR, o
ur mobile product with Samsung, is 
going to have its first consumer release this holiday season retailing for $99. 
And we also announced new partnerships with Minecraft, Netflix and Twitch 
and many other content partners.
 
Virtual reality has the potential 
to be the next computing platform that 
changes all of our lives. It's important also to recognize that this is going to 
grow slowly, like computers and mobile phones when they first arrived. So 
we're committed to Oculus and virtual reality for the long
-
ter
m.
 
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy this 
quarter. The results we've achieved show that our investments are creating 
a lot of value for our community and the world. I just want to thank the 
entire Facebook community, our employ
ees, our partners and our 
shareholders for helping us to continue moving forward. We've done a lot, 
but there's always more to do.
 
And now I'm going to hand it off to Sheryl.

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Thanks, Mark. And hi, 
everyone. We had an excellent third quarter. Results 
were strong across the board. Ad revenue grew 45% year
-
over
-
year or 57% 
on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 
73% year
-
over
-
year. Mobile now makes up 78% of our total 
advertising 
revenue.
 
Our business grew across all regions and marketer segments. Like last 
quarter, we saw especially strong growth in our North America and Asia
-
Pacific regions. Overall, we're really pleased with marketer adoption of our 
ad products aroun
d the world. Our results show that we continue to make 
progress on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing 
the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more 
relevant and effective.
 
First, capitalizing on the s
hift to mobile. People have already shifted to 
mobile and this shift is driving engagement on Facebook. The average 
American adult spends 25% of their media time on mobile, and Facebook 
and Instagram together continue to account for over one minute in five
 
minutes on mobile in the U.S. Businesses are lagging behind consumers in 
making this shift to mobile, and we believe we're well positioned to help 
them catch up. Facebook Pages are already the mobile solution for millions 
of businesses. Pages now offer be
tter messaging capabilities, call
-
to
-
action 
buttons and news sections that enable businesses to highlight important 
information.
 
We're also capitalizing on the shift to mobile by expanding ads on 
Instagram. This quarter on Instagram, we introduced new ad f
ormats and 
objectives, opened up our API and launched self
-
serve ad capabilities. 
Instagram ads are now available in all countries where we offer Facebook 
ads, and marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms with the 
same targeting. We're really p
leased with the marketer demand for 
Instagram ads.
 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad 
products. In September at Adweek, we announced that we have over 2.5 
million active advertisers on Facebook. With more than 45 million ac
tive SMB 
Pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more 
of these businesses into marketers.
 
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best 
performing mobile ad products, and video is making them even better. 
M
arketers have always loved using video to tell stories. As Mark discussed, 
video is a natural and growing part of our mobile News Feed experience. 
Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach, but better cross
-
device targeting and measurement than
 
we believe is available on any other 
platform. We're especially pleased with the breadth of marketers using video 
on Facebook, from brands to direct response to SMBs. Over 1.5 million small 
businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts and v
ideo ads 
on Facebook in the month of September alone.
 
Video ads complement TV ads. According to a recent study with Nielsen 
Research, marketers using Facebook ads with TV ads saw higher reach, ad 
recall, brand linkage and likeability. To share one example,
 
GMC used video 
and other ads on Facebook to extend the reach of their TV brand campaign 
highlighting their premium trucks and SUVs. The Facebook campaign drove 
a 13
-
point lift in ad recall and a 6
-
point lift in brand favorability.
 
We recently introduced t
arget rating point, TRP, buying so that marketers 
can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on 
TV. We're pleased with the feedback we're receiving on this from marketers 
and agencies.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more rel
evant and effective. We know 
relevant ads are more engaging for people and, therefore, drive better 
results for businesses. Products like carousel ads and dynamic product ads 
help improve effectiveness for marketers. Carousel ads show multiple 
images and n
ow videos and drive 30% to 50% lower cost per conversion 
than single image link ads. Dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to 
upload their product catalog, are driving ROI comparable to Search.
 
For example, Marriott uses DPA to re
-
target travelers bas
ed on their travel 
search habits and they are now scaling globally across their portfolio of 
brands. LatAm e
-
commerce company, MercadoLibre, uses DPA to re
-
market 
over 38 million products in over 13 countries. Both are seeing high ROI and 
continuing to inv
est.
 
On the measurement side, Conversion Lift is helping clients see the real 
business results from their campaigns. Boost Mobile, a Sprint brand, showed 
ads to people eligible for device upgrades. Using Conversion Lift, they were 
able to attribute a 4% li
ft in in
-
store sales to their Facebook campaign.
 
Finally, we're continuing to invest in ad tech across Atlas, LiveRail and the 
Audience Network. This quarter, we expanded the ad formats publishers in 
the Audience Network can add to their mobile apps. On Li
veRail, this quarter 
we began testing age and gender targeting. LiveRail can now deliver over 
90% accuracy on age and gender segments across desktop, mobile web and 
mobile apps versus a non
-
target rate of only 31% to 55% when not using 
LiveRail technology.
 
I want to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their 
continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams on great 
execution. Looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our priorities to 
continue to build a solid founda
tion for our long
-
term business.
 
Now here's Dave.

Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks, Sheryl. And good afternoon, everyone. Echoing Mark and Sheryl's 
comments, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We generated $4.5 
billion in revenue a
nd over $1.4 billion in free cash flow. Growth and 
engagement of our community again provided a great platform for our 
strong financial performance this quarter. In September, we reached a new 
milestone with over 1 billion people using Facebook on an avera
ge day, an 
increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 65% of 
the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
 
Mobile continued to drive our growth. In September, approximately 1.39 
billion people accessed Fa
cebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. 
Additionally, our next generation of services continued to grow, with 
Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 400 million, 700 million 
and 900 million monthly actives respectively.
 
Now turning to the
 
financials. All of our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non
-
GAAP measures exclude 
stock
-
based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
 
Total revenue was $4.5 billion, up 41%, or 51% on a constant
 
currency 
basis. Ad revenue was $4.3 billion, up 45%, or 57% on a constant currency 
basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable 
impact on our revenue in Q3. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant 
with Q3 2014 levels, 
our total revenue would have been approximately $340 
million higher.
 
Regionally, U.S. and Canada and Asia
-
Pacific were our strongest markets, 
producing ad revenue growth of 56% and 48% respectively. Europe and 
Rest of World grew more slowly at 33% and 29% 
respectively, impacted by 
our currency exposure in both of those regions.
 
As Sheryl mentioned, mobile continued to drive our revenue growth. Mobile 
ad revenue was $3.4 billion, up 73% from last year representing 78% of our 
advertising revenue. Revenue from
 
ads served on personal computers was 
down approximately 8%.
 
We have been very pleased with the sustained high growth of mobile 
advertising revenue. There are a number of important factors contributing to 
that growth both from the supply and demand side. T
he drivers of year
-
over
-
year mobile revenue growth fell into three main categories. First, as 
Sheryl covered, we have continued to have success driving strong advertiser 
demand. Second, we've grown both the number of people using Facebook 
and the time that
 
they spend with us. And third, the growth in advertiser 
demand and ad quality has enabled us to increase ad load over time. As we 
have grown mobile advertising, we have remained very pleased with overall 
engagement levels, user satisfaction with News Feed
 
and the overall quality 
of the ads themselves.
 
Turning now to our overall price/volume metrics. In Q3, the average price 
per ad increased 61% while total ad impressions declined 10% on a year
-
over
-
year basis. As I've indicated on prior calls, the changes 
in our reported 
price
-
volume metrics have been driven recently by the change in the 
number of right hand column ads and the shift to mobile. These factors will 
have a less significant impact on the reported price
-
volume metrics going 
forward now that a ful
l year has elapsed since the redesign of right
-
hand 
column ads, and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the 
majority of impressions.
 
In fact, the quarter
-
over
-
quarter trends already point to that. In Q3, total ad 
impression increased 7% sequen
tially and average price per ad increased 
5%. Total payments and other fees revenue was $202 million, down 18% 
compared to last year. The decline was expected and was driven by a 
reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal 
computers.
 
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $3 billion, up 
68%, and non
-
GAAP expenses were $2.1 billion, up 51%. Similar to last 
quarter, stock
-
based compensation and amortization expenses related to the 
WhatsApp acquisition contributed signif
icantly to the year
-
over
-
year growth 
in GAAP expenses. Non
-
GAAP expenses were driven by increases in head 
count related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended Q3 
with nearly 12,000 employees, up 44% compared to last year. We added 
over 1,0
00 employees to Facebook in the quarter and we are pleased with 
the continued strength in our recruiting efforts.
 
Our Q3 GAAP operating income was approximately $1.5 billion, representing 
a 32% operating margin. Our non
-
GAAP operating income was $2.4 billi
on, 
representing a 54% margin. Our Q3 GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates were 
37% and 32% respectively. Our Q3 GAAP net income was $896 million or 
$0.31 per share, and our non
-
GAAP net income was $1.6 billion or $0.57 per 
share. In Q3, capital expenditures were $
780 million as we continued to 
invest in servers, network infrastructure, and the build
-
out of data centers 
and other facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We 
generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with over 
$15.8 
billion in cash and investments.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We remain focused on growing the 
number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and 
improving the quality and relevance of our ads. Across these dimensions, we 
contin
ue to see healthy growth opportunities ahead for Facebook and 
Instagram. Given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past year, we 
will continue to face currency headwinds next quarter, particularly in Europe 
and Latin America. In addition, we expe
ct our total payments and other fees 
revenues to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4, similar to the trend that we 
have experienced over the last couple quarters.
 
Now, turning to the expense outlook. We expect the year
-
over
-
year growth 
rate for total full y
ear 2015 GAAP expenses to be approximately 55%, and 
for total full year non
-
GAAP expenses to be approximately 50%. We 
anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.5 billion to 
$2.7 billion. We continue to expect our 2015 stock
-
based 
compensation to 
be in the range of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, approximately half of which is 
related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect 
amortization expenses for the full year 2015 to be approximately $700 
million to $800 million.
 
And lastly, we anticipate our Q4 and full year 2015 GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax 
rates to be several percentage points above the respective Q3 rates. In 
summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with 
the growth and engagement of our comm
unity and the momentum in our 
business, which together support our ability to continue investing to build 
our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the 
world.
 
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.

Thanks for taking the questions. Mark, maybe one for you and one for 
Sheryl. For Mark, on virtual reali
ty and Oculus, how do you see the 
development of the entertainment and content ecosystem around virtual 
reality playing out in 2016 and beyond? And what's the role Facebook's 
going to have to play in maybe seeding some of the content and 
entertainment side
 
of VR.
 
And then for Sheryl, any color you can give us on Instagram? We've 
obviously seen a ramp
-
up now in advertising on the property. How the 
company's thinking about ad load monetization, some of the opportunities 
and how those will be balanced against 
engagement. Thank you.

I can start off talking about Oculus and virtual reality. So the first thing that 
I want to stress here is that these kind of new platforms take a long time to 
develop. So w
e've said often that we think that virtual reality and 
augmented reality could be the next big computing platform. But just to put 
that in perspective and compare it to the development of previous 
computing platforms like phones and computers, I think the 
first 
smartphones came out in 2003, and in the first year, I think BlackBerry and 
Palm Treo were the initial smartphones that came out. And I think they each 
sold in the hundreds of thousands of units. So just to kind of give a sense of 
the timeframe that 
we're thinking about this and how we expect this to 
develop, that's how we're thinking about that.
 
In terms of the actual content, first, we think gaming is going to be the most 
obvious market. There are around, I think, more than 200 million, almost 
250 m
illion people who have either an Xbox, a PlayStation or a Wii, and we 
think that that audience is going to the type of people who are going to be 
very excited about the type of experiences initially that you can have with 
virtual reality.
 
And the advantage
 
of that is also that some of those can be single player 
experiences. They don't require a big network effect or a lot of people having 
the technology or a large installed base. Once we start getting a bit further 
along with that, then the next thing that 
we think is going to be huge is 
video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like 
the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional 
and premium content both short form and longer form.
 
But we'll start to se
e some experimentation with that. There already is some 
very good content. But until there are millions of units out in the market, I 
don't expect that to be a big industry for folks to be investing a huge amount 
in 2016. Then when they're starting to get 
to be more units, just like every 
other major computing platform before that, what we expect is that a large 
portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior, 
and that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to, I think,
 
build the best experiences. And we're investing in trying to figure out what 
that's going to look like, and that's ultimately a lot of what we're extremely 
excited about for a number of years down the road.

On Instagram, we think that with Facebook and Instagram, we now have the 
two most important mobile platforms out there. And what we bring to this is 
a common ad infrastructure. So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out as 
we have this past quarte
r and gotten to a really good product offering, 
combined the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling 
and has a lot of engagement from people with the back
-
end infrastructure 
and marketer base that Facebook has.
 
So now, we have self
-
s
ervice ads rolled out. We've rolled out in all countries 
where we offer Facebook ads. We have new ad formats for Instagram. We're 
able to do more business objectives, all of which can use the same targeting 
as we have on Facebook and all of which are incre
asingly tapping into our 
measurement capabilities. On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling 
out ads into feed
-
based products and we monitor it very carefully and we're 
going to continue to monitor really carefully. We're also excited about how 
they 
work together.
 
Just to share one example, American Express working with Digitas, rolled 
out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel
-
related interest groups 
for people who are 18 years and older. They then retargeted those same 
people on Facebook. An
d what they created was a really visual journey using 
the format that is Instagram, the format that is Facebook and combining the 
two platforms that they're targeting. We think we're at the very beginning of 
what's possible when we combine these two.

Heather Anne Bellini

Great. Thank you. I had two quick questions as well. One, Sheryl, just to 
follow up on what you mentioned about Instagram, obvio
usly, it's a very 
visual experience. I'm just wondering, when you're talking to advertisers, 
are they viewing this as a separate channel? So I think there's been some 
questions as to the incremental nature of Instagram. And it would seem like 
it could be e
xtremely incremental, given these are the two top platforms in 
mobile. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the 
advertisers say about blending the experiences.
 
And also, a question for Mark. I was just wondering if you could share w
ith 
us how we might see your content strategy evolve over time and, in 
particular, just wondering what your view is on longer form content on the 
video side, sorry. Thank you.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Yeah. To the Instagram q
uestion, what we see in the short run is that some 
of the spend on Instagram is incremental to Facebook and some isn't. Some 
clients are comfortable with Instagram and bringing a new budget to bear. 
Some clients are shifting some of their Facebook budget. 
For us in the 
medium to long run, we believe that we're not competing between Facebook 
and Instagram. We're competing with other forms of media. And if you want 
the most eyeballs and we think the highest ROI, over time we think that will 
benefit Facebook a
nd Instagram.
 
And so, for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and 
get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook so that we can make 
the case that we can improve the ROI and then we believe if you look at the 
consumer metrics of
 
where people were spending their time, we will be able 
to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And to your question about long form content, the more natural startin
g 
point for us is shorter form content which can either be social content or 
premium short form content. But some of 

 
the vast majority of the content 
that's consumed on Facebook just talking about video right now is people 
browsing through feed. They dis
cover something interesting that they 
weren't necessarily looking for previously that's very powerful because that's 
a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet 
today in a great way, and then people watch it there or the
y bookmark it to 
watch later.
 
But if you're talking about watching inline and feed, that's not the place 
where you're necessarily going to see a TV show and then watch an hour
-
long clip right there. So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best o
r 
at least from my perspective, TV shows that we see folks like Jimmy Fallon 
breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed 
over social media and on the Internet in three
-
minute to five
-
minute or 
seven
-
minute segments which are mo
re of what people want when browsing 
through News Feed. So I do think over time we will get to more different 
types of content and we'll build products that serve that. The current market 
of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter form
 
clips is 
massive. We are nowhere near serving that as well as we want to.
 
So I actually think in a lot of ways though the more interesting question is 
not in the near
-
term what we're going to do to develop ways to consume 
long form content, but what 
traditional media and content producers who 
have traditionally produced short and long form content are going to do to 
chunk their stuff up better so that way it can be more easily consumed by 
this big community online.

ouglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Thank you for taking the question. One for Mark and then one for Dave. 
Mark, you recently spent time in China and India. And I was hoping to get 
some of your key ta
keaways both in terms of Internet.org and then also 
about Facebook's potential in China.
 
And then secondly, Dave, I was hoping to get some early thoughts on OpEx 
for 2016, at least perhaps qualitatively, if you could walk us through some of 
the puts and ta
kes for next year, Oculus in particular. Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. I can start off with the India and China question. So they are very 
different situations. So India is a unique country where there are 1.25 b
illion 
people, more than 1 billion of them are not on the Internet. So it is the 
country in the world that benefits the most from connectivity. And there's a 
lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out 
that show, that when y
ou connect to place like India, it makes a very big 
difference socially and for the economy there.
 
A lot of us here, everyone we know is on the internet and we think about the 
internet as entertainment and basic communication but if you don't have 
access t
o a good school, then getting basic Internet access could be your 
best educational information or if you don't have access to a good doctor, 
then getting access to the Internet could be the only way that you can learn 
about how to avoid certain diseases or
 
how to raise your kids and help them 
avoid certain diseases and find jobs and a lot of stuff.
 
So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get 
connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around one person 
gets lifte
d out of poverty and one new job gets created. So we're very 
focused on this. It's a huge priority for the Indian government and anything 
that we can do to help there, we think is very good for the world and we're 
invested in that, and we're happy to suppo
rt.
 
So in Internet.org in India now, there are already more than 1 million people 
who now have access to the Internet who didn't otherwise because of our 
efforts, so we're proud of that but obviously that's still very early on. We're 
only working with one 
operator currently in part of the country. So there's a 
lot of room to expand that and that's just a big opportunity for the Internet 
overall and for India over the next decade and we hope to play a role in 
that.
 
On China, that is a more complex situation.
 
Obviously, you can't have a 
mission of wanting to connect everyone in the world and leave out the 
biggest country. So over the long
-
term, that is a situation that we will need 
to try to figure out a way forward on.
 
For now, the thing that I would leave yo
u with is that people think that 
Facebook isn't in China at all and that's actually not true. Our consumer 
service isn't active there, but it actually is already one of the biggest 
advertising markets that we have. Because there are a lot of really big and
 
important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of 
China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools in a lot of cases 
to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer 
base. So we're happy to do what
ever we can to help develop the economies 
in both of those countries and they're both long
-
term efforts for us.

Doug, on your question on 2016, we're not going to obviously give specific 
guidance at this time, that
'll be coming with our Q4 call. But we're focused 
on continuing to invest heavily in the business across our near, mid and 
long
-
term opportunities and we see a bunch of great opportunities to invest 
there. So in the near term, we're focused on growing the 
community and 
executing on our existing business. In the medium
-
term, we're focused on 
those next generation of services, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. 
And in the long
-
term, we've got the investments we're making and things 
like artificial intelligenc
e, VR, and obviously the Internet.org efforts that 
Mark just spoke about.
 
Specifically with regards to Oculus and how that could impact the plan for 
next year, we're, as Mark said, very bullish about the long
-
term opportunity 
for VR and excited about the l
aunch for the Rift next year. But VR is still very 
much in the development stage. So it would be early to be talking about 
large shipment volumes.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Mark and one for 
Sheryl. Mark, can you talk a little about what factors and metrics you 
consider when you're thinking about a multi
-
app strategy versus rolling out 
more products and offer
ings on Facebook? There's a difference in Facebook 
Paper, Messenger, the video viewer on the platform. Just be curious how you 
think about multi
-
app versus adding more functionality to the mothership.
 
And then for Sheryl, it sounds like there's still a lot
 
of SMBs on the platform 
that are not yet paying advertisers. Can you talk about some of the biggest 
hurdles you need to overcome to get more SMBs paying and initiatives you 
have in place? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. So I can talk to the multi
-
app question first. So we view the social 
space as almost this matrix. You can think about it as a two
-
dimensional grid 
where one axis is the richness of the content that people want to share, then 
other axis is the size o
f the audience, or intimacy of how people want to 
share. So on the first axis, you get everything ranging from text to links, to 
photos, to videos, to immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and 
this progression.
 
And on the other axis, you get eve
rything ranging from one
-
to
-
one 
messaging to small group communication, to communicating with all your 
friends at once, to big interest groups, to completely public. And what we 
believe is that you can intersect at any point on that. And there will be 
some
thing interesting to build. So a small group product for sharing video, 
that's going to be a thing. A one
-
on
-
one product for sharing text or calling, 
that's clearly a thing. A public sharing and consumption product for video, 
that's a thing.
 
And what we've
 
tried to do is basically figure out the areas that we think are 
open and are not currently served by the set of products that the industry 
has built and figure out a way to offer those. So one of the big opportunities 
that I'm really excited about right n
ow is I think that there's a pretty big 
opening between very private messaging, the one
-
on
-
one messaging 
products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook where 
you share with all your friends at once or Instagram.
 
And in between there, what
 
we're seeing is this huge growth of private 
groups, right, and Groups remains one of the I think least talked about 
products on Facebook. But I just said earlier that we have more than 900 
million people are using that every month. It's a huge thing and i
t's a big 
area that we can develop going forward.
 
So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make 
sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the 
same set of friends and network and connections. Some of them ge
t clear 
value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make 
sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely 
important for a messaging app. But overall, there's a lot of stuff in the 
space. And the amount th
at people want to share and communicate is 
boundless and that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that we 
are with so many of these products.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
On SMBs, I think it's one of the most 
compelling opportunities we have for 
Facebook and that's because I think we solve a really big problem for SMBs, 
which is how are they going to reach customers. In the United States, which 
is usually the most advanced market, 35% of small businesses have n
o web 
presence at all. And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web 
presence because most people don't use the mobile web and mobile apps 
are expensive to build and hard to get people to use, especially if you're a 
small business.
 
That's why th
ere are 45 million SMB pages on Facebook. These are people 
who are using Facebook and this free product to create an online and 
increasingly a mobile presence. And then our job is to make sure that free 
product works for them and then over time bring them 
into our paid 
products. We have 2.5 million advertisers and over 80% of them started on 
Pages and then started with simplified ad products. And that's what we've 
done over time and we'll continue to do that.
 
And what you see is that it's as easy for them t
o use it as profile and we can 
give them opportunities to do things they otherwise couldn't do. So to what I 
said in my transcript before, 1.5 million SMBs posting videos in one month 
alone. 1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other 
pl
atform, but with us it's cheap, it's very easy to use and that gives us a way 
to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with 
them.

First, Mark, could you talk a little bit about how much activity you see 
around Events on Facebook and maybe your views on whether Facebook 
could benefit from political activity or advertising? And then, Sheryl, 
could 
you talk a little bit about where ad loads are today? Is there still room there? 
And also just what your feedback you're getting on advertiser ROIs, is there 
still more room there? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, sure. I'll
 
start with the question on ad load. It's Dave and then Sheryl 
can follow up on the political question. So, yeah, so, Justin, over time ad 
load has been one of the factors driving year
-
over
-
year growth. It's just 
worth noting that it is up significantly fr
om where we were two years ago. 
Looking forward, we continue to feel like there are good opportunities to 
grow the business. I talked about the three factors that contributed to 
growth this quarter: ad demand, users and engagement and ad load. And 
we see a
ll of those continuing to be factors for growth going forward.
 
And then, Sheryl, did you want to take the question on the political?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Yeah. And I'll take Events, too. Just as Mark said with Groups, Eve
nts are 
growing quickly on Facebook. We don't break out by product, but we're 
pleased with the growth.
 
On the elections and political activity and political advertising, we're excited 
about the elections because we think we give politicians and people a re
ally 
compelling way to interact. If you wanted to feel like you were interacting 
with someone running for office before, you had to go to a town hall 
meeting. And increasingly, that's happening on Facebook. So between 
January 1 and October 7 of this year, 
over 68 million people on Facebook in 
the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the campaign alone, and 
every candidate and every member of Congress is on Facebook now.
 
In terms of the revenue impact, no one vertical drives our business. We 
have a ve
ry large and diversified business. But we think we offer something 
pretty compelling, which is the reach of Facebook with very unique 
targeting. So on Facebook, you can target an ad by district, by interest. Ben 
Carson ran 240 different ads targeted at dif
ferent audiences, and so we're 
starting to see candidates use our platform to communicate, to advertise 
and to share.

Nomura Securities International

Thank you very much. Mark, on the subject of media content on Facebook, it 
seems like the big opportunity is for Facebook to be the portal with which to 
access the short form video content that you mentioned earlier, and maybe 
the idea is to keep th
e consumption of that content in line or inside the 
Facebook wall, the garden. So the follow
-
up question that I would have is 
how do you think you could best partner with the media providers and 
convince them the merits of bringing their valuable, in some 
cases 
expensive, content into the Facebook world, particularly at a time in media 
when they're really trying hard to guard their own existing ecosystems?
 
And then a question for Sheryl. I wonder if you could just touch on the 
relative growth of branded adv
ertising versus direct response ads. You 
mentioned total ratings point buying. Can you help us think about the mix of 
branded versus DR? And for you, do you think that TRP buying and video is 
going to shift your ad mix more towards branded over time? Thank
s.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I can talk about video and the business model around that. So you're 
definitely right that there's a certain class of content which is only going to 
come on to Facebook if there's a good way to
 
compensate the content 
owners for that. And we've recently rolled out the business model for this, 
which is for premium content, we'll give a revenue share on a portion of the 
views to the content owners. And we've got good feedback so far on that. 
We're 
working with a small set of partners to start, and we'll roll it out 
beyond that as that keeps on going.
 
But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why 
people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, 
r
ight? There are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, right, 
because they want to get a message out. That may not be business 
motivated. There are a lot of folks who are business motivated but who 
primarily post content in order to promote
 
something or gain distribution for 
something. And that you can gain value without some kind of rev share, and 
that's why the video ecosystem has grown so quickly even before we rolled 
out a revenue share.
 
And now the third class of content, which I think 
is going to be important 
and increasingly important over time is the one that you basically want to 
essentially trade the content for money, and that is one where you need the 
rev share to unlock that. But we're getting good feedback on that upfront. 
So we
're looking forward to seeing how that trends.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
On our marketer segments, we don't break out by segment, but all of our 
marketer segments are growing. We're seeing strong growth in brand, and 
we believ
e that's because we're delivering on the promise of personalized 
marketing at scale. So we've worked hard on things that will help brand 
purchasers feel comfortable on the platform and measure their ROI. So 
that's where TRP buying comes in, allowing people
 
who usually buy TV ads 
to plan, buy and measure Facebook ads the same way, enables apples
-
to
-
apples comparison that we believe is very strong for our ROI. We've also 
worked on brand awareness optimization, mobile polling to measure 
campaign effectiveness,
 
and we're working client by client.
 
Our other segments are growing as well. We're working hard in the direct 
response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads. 
And one thing that's worth understanding is that all of these differe
nt 
marketer segments often work together.
 
So to share one example, IKEA wanted to boost their online sales when their 
stores were closed. So in Norway, most retailers are closed Saturday to 
Sunday night. So they invested in carousel ads and only show them 
when 
their stores were closed and they turned a $35,000 investment in carousel 
ads into $2 million in sales which happened precisely when they want it to 
happen. That's a direct response ad buy because it's very specific carousel 
ads product but it's also 
a brand play for them as they strengthen their 
brand and get people to interact with them as they want them to.

Great. Thank 
you. Two questions. So with the explosive video consumption 
growth and growth in public content being consumed in the News Feed, 
could engagement perhaps materially increase from current levels over the 
next couple years? And then on WhatsApp, as it heads 
towards 1 billion 
MAUs, and/or greater, could you give us a sense of how you're thinking 
about monetization of that platform and perhaps timing of the monetization? 
Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner

On engagement, John, I think we're obv
iously focused across a number of 
different dimensions to drive engagement. Videos had a big contribution 
there. So that's certainly been helpful in terms of making News Feed even 
more engaging and we'll continue to be focusing on a number of initiatives, 
public content and just sharing with your friends. So there's lots that we are 
working on on engagement that continue to drive time spent.
 
On WhatsApp, I don't think there's a particular magical number with 1 billion 
users. The focus really for our messagi
ng products is to continue to drive 
user growth and continue to build great products that are fast, useful, 
engaging and fun. And on that front, they're both doing great. Messenger 
has over 700 million users and WhatsApp obviously has over 900 million 
user

I can answer the policy question and then I guess Sheryl will take the other 
one. The guiding principle for us on this is that we want to give the most 
voice to the most people. And the idea is that there are all these different 
barriers that any given 
person has to being able to share and express 
everything that they want, from technical barriers, it's really hard to 
communicate with someone if you're not on the internet and they're far 
away, to product barriers, it's hard to share videos if we don't ha
ve a good 
product for sharing videos, to legal barriers, it's hard to share content that 
your government says is illegal for you to share.
 
And at the end of the day, there's also policy and you're in a community and 
we have community standards for how we t
hink people should communicate 
in order to be safe. Because even if you have all of the internet connectivity 
and the products and the legal framework that you need, if you don't feel 
safe saying what you want to express, then you're probably not going to 
share it. And we see a lot of that online and that's a pretty big issue from 
everything from bullying to terrorism, there are lots of reasons why people 
might otherwise have the tools to share what they would want but feel 
silenced. And that isn't giving t
he most voice to the most people.
 
So we feel a responsibility to have policies for our community which limit 
hate speech and limit things which are going to create just an 
overwhelmingly uncomfortable environment for people that is going to 
silence other p
eople's speech in order to make sure that over the long
-
term 
we are enabling the most people to be able to express as much as possible 
as they can. And that's the philosophy that we have.

vertical for us and we're working hard to make our ads more effective. So 
what we're seeing from DPA ads and carousel ads, we're really happy with. 
We're seeing lower cost per conversion. When p
eople do multiple objectives 
and video, we're seeing lower cost per click than single image link ads.
 
And importantly, we're also creating better experiences for people because 
when an ad is more targeted, more relevant, when you see a product you're 
inter
ested in or a service you're interested in, that's a better experience. So 
we go into the holidays feeling that we have a really strong product offering, 
certainly the best product offering we've ever had to connect people to the 
products they're going to 
buy this holiday.

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you look at ad quality, I think 
when Facebook started, Sheryl, you were really 
adamant that you were 
focused on improving the ad quality and really making sure you were serving 
the highest quality ad to the right person. When you look at Instagram, I felt 
like you took incredible care to make sure that the advertising, like every ad,
 
was of the highest quality.
 
And as you've opened up the API, there's a tremendous amount of ads, 
some of them incredibly good quality, but some of them of lesser quality. 
How do you work to make sure that Instagram maintains what you started it 
with, whic
h is incredibly beautiful ads that fit the platform and so that you 
don't get criticized by users for pushing, not so much the amount of ads, but 
the type of ads?

You're right. The quality is really i
mportant to us because your experience on 
Facebook or Instagram is about the quality of what you see, both in terms of 
the organic posts you see from your friends or public people you're following 
and the ads as well. And what we do is we monitor it carefu
lly. We ramp 
slowly, we monitor engagement, sentiment, quality of ads. We get a lot of 
feedback directly from people who use Facebook. They can X out the ads. If 
they do, we ask them why they're Xing out the ads and we just continue to 
monitor the metrics.
 
We're pleased with what's happened with quality on our platform overall. 
And a lot of the product innovations and investments I've been talking about 
on this call feed into quality. So the carousel ads, they're not just that 
they're showing multiple produ
cts, it's that they're showing products that are 
more specifically directed at the person. And so a lot of the underlying things 
we do to build our ad systems don't just feed into revenue, they feed into 
quality. And that's important because over the long 
run our quality today is 
our revenue tomorrow.

The next question is from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open.

Thanks. I had two, if I could. We noticed a very impressive 
acceleration in 
user MAU growth and focus in the quarter. It seemed like it was pretty much 
in every region of the world. What, if anything, can you attribute that to? I 
know that you seem to be running more TV ads, at least where I live. But 
wonder if any
thing you could attribute that to.
 
And then secondly, again on video, as more and more people and businesses 
are uploading video, I assume that there's a lot of good video content on 
Facebook, but I don't see all of it. Question is really around video disc
overy. 
What strategies do you have going forward to improve video discovery from 
what is today more of a push
-
based model to something that may be akin to 
a pull
-
based model where I can enjoy all the great video content that's on 
Facebook? Thanks.

Hey, Mark, it's Dave. Just on the user growth point, we're obviously pleased 
with the growth we're seeing across the globe in terms of DAU growth. The 
three largest countries were India, the U.S. and Brazil. So we're seein
g good 
diversified growth. I mean, specifically we've made a lot of initiatives to help 
improve and invest in the Facebook experience in emerging markets and 
that has helped drive some of the acceleration in growth. And so we've 
made a number of product an
d performance investments there with 
Facebook like being a good example of that. The question then was on video 
and discovery and...
 
Mark A. May

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Yeah.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And
 
also just on the growth point, I just think the team that's working on 
that is executing extremely well. I mean, sometimes it's not that you came 
up with some brilliant strategy, it's just like really good work consistently 
over a long period of time. So 

 
and then I think they are. On video, yeah, 
right now the strength in our system is definitely through helping people 
discover content that they hadn't really asked for through News Feed. And a 
lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to s
ee all of the 
videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.
 
And there's a pretty clear roadmap of stuff that we're going to do over the 
next couple of years that I'm quite excited about to add some more 
dimensions to the v
ideo experience on Facebook. But we're just so early in 
this right now. It's pretty amazing how quickly it's growing but there's a lot 
more to do.

Great. I just had one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you mentioned that Marriott and 
MercadoLibre are both using DPA and seeing comparable ROI to paid search. 
That's a pretty incredible data point. So I guess the question is, what kind of 
lift
 
in ROI and overall budget do you see as e
-
commerce or travel marketers 
migrate from your first few products, like custom audiences and other to 
DPA? And are the yields that you're getting from DPA ads higher than other 
formats like video and app downloads
 
and those types of things? Thank you.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Our goal is to give marketers the highest return they can and over time to 
capture the amount of budget that's equivalent to the percentage of media 
time we capt
ure and we're not there. Consumers have shifted to mobile and 
consumers have moved to Facebook and Instagram more quickly than ad 
budgets. And that's the opportunity we have in front of us. What product 
you use really depends upon what you're trying to do.
 
If you're trying to tell 
a brand story, then you want to do a video ad. If you're trying to sell a direct 
product, then you want to use DPA ads. And all of these products and all of 
the underlying targeting like custom audiences are designed to help peopl
e 
meet different objectives and we're trying to be really clear on that.
 
If you're trying to move a brand objective, if you want to move favorability 
or brand sentiment, we can do that and that's often a video ad or one of our 
branded ads where you optimiz
e for brand awareness. If you're trying to sell 
a product, you might want to use carousel ads or dynamic product ads. And 
the targeting that is custom audiences underlies all of our product offerings. 
So our goal is to have lots of different things we can 
do for our marketers 
and measure them really deeply all the way through to business results.

And 

 
sorry, Ross, you just asked about yields. The way the auction system 
works is going to just be whatever is the ad t
hat is going to necessarily have 
the best return is going to win in the auction. So it doesn't necessarily mean 
you're paying a premium for a given product and so if we've got a good DPA 
ad that might win in the auction for a given user.

Certainly. The final question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital 
Markets. Your line is open.
 
Mark S. Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. Let me try going back to fut
ure use cases and, Mark, I think this was 
touched on a couple times. But can you talk about whether you're seeing 
greater attempts to do Search, the Search functionality on the site and how 
that could change over the next three years to five years, and als
o comment 
on news and to the extent to which you're seeing a rising utilization by 
regular users of Facebook as a way to get news and what you can do to 
make that even easier for people if that's something a behavior you want to 
facilitate? Thank you.
 
Mark
 
Elliot Zuckerberg

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. So on Search, we already have one very big use case which is people 
basically using our search engine to look out pages and people who are on 
Facebook and that by itself is already one of the bi
ggest search engines in 
the world. The next big use case that we've really been working on for a 
couple of years now and I think is going to 

 
is starting to roll out and is 
growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook. So that's trending. 
It's pe
ople finding post that their friends or others had posted in News Feed 
that they saw but then might want to go check out later.
 
And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience 
as well, because one half is pushed, right, going 
to News Feed and not 
asking for content but just coming across and discovering it. And then the 
other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking 
for some type of content and getting to a point where we can do that very 
well is ju
st going to add a whole new dimension to the service. So that's 
something I remain very excited about. In some ways, it's taken a little bit 
longer than I'd expected to get to a point where it's growing quickly. The 
people and page lookup part is doing ver
y well, the post part has taken a bit 
longer but I'm very excited about that going forward.
 
In terms of news, I mean the biggest issue with news today in Facebook is 
that it is the slowest part of the experience, right? When you go to load a 
video and it l
oads quickly, we made it auto
-
play to load even quicker. You 
tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately, but you tap on a link, 
and often it can take 10 seconds to load and if you're on a 2G connection 
somewhere in the developing world, that could
 
take 30 seconds to load.
 
So the big initiative that we have here which I'm really excited about is 
Instant Articles and the big thing that that does is just it lets publishers 
basically put the content on our servers ahead of time and that way when 
people tap on it, it loads instantaneously. And it can be a much more 
immersive experience and we've already found from the initial experiments 
that we've done that the engagement is positive and we're starting to roll 
that out more broadly. So I think tha
t that's going to be a really big deal for 
improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something 
that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it.
 
So, yeah, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and 
consumption of all of the different types of things that you asked about: 
news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some 
of the big areas that we're investing in and they're long
-
term investments 
and they're big investments and
 
we're going to keep on pushing on them, 
but I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and 
ultimately connect everyone in the world. So thank you, guys.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thanks, Deborah. And thanks, everyone, for joining today. This is a good 
quarter
 
for us. We've continued to make good progress in the growth of our 
community with 1.49 billion people now using Facebook each month and 
more than 1.3 billion people using Facebook on mobile. We've also continued 
to make gains in engagement. More than 968 
million people worldwide now 
use Facebook daily, and 65% of our monthly actives are daily actives.
 
Several products in the Facebook app are reaching global scale, too, now 
with more than 450 million people using Events each month and more than 
850 million 
people using Groups. And when it comes to time spent across 
Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, people are now spending more than 
46 minutes per day on average, and that doesn't include WhatsApp.
 
Our business performance has grown with our community. This q
uarter, our 
total revenue is more than $4 billion for the first time, and advertising 
revenue grew by 43% year
-
over
-
year. These results reflect the ongoing 
investments and improvements we've made and the quality, performance 
and usefulness of our services,
 
and continuing to make progress here 
remains our biggest priority.
 
Now, with that in mind, I'd like to talk about how we're working on this 
across our current product, our next generation of apps and our long
-
term 
innovation efforts. Over the next few yea
rs, our main focus is on helping our 
existing communities and businesses reach their full potential. An important 
part of our strategy is continuing to deliver great experiences across all our 
products. This means improving the speed and reliability of our
 
apps and 
building new infrastructure to support our global scale, like our new data 
center in Texas.
 
Over the last six months, we've improved the performance of our core app, 
reducing crashes on iOS by more than 30% and some Android phones by 
more than 40
%. On Messenger, people can now send messages up to 20% 
faster, and it's twice as fast when you start the app. These are just a few 
examples of how our engineering focus is delivering better experiences for 
everyone in our community.
 
Another part of delive
ring great experiences is helping people connect to the 
content they want. This quarter, we've continued to focus on improving 
people's experience in News Feed by making it easier to find more relevant 
and engaging content from friends and the entire commu
nity. Connecting 
people with more great video content is an important part. Video continues 
to be some of the richest and most engaging content for people and 
publishers, and since the start of the year, pages are also sharing more than 
40% more videos. Th
is quarter, we updated our News Feed ranking to help 
people see more of the videos they care about and also began testing new 
options for video monetization to help our partners build their businesses. 
We're excited about the potential for continued work h
ere.
 
The focus we've had on video also supports our efforts to connect more 
people around important public moments and events. From the 59 million 
people who generated more than 300 million interactions around the Copa 
America to the 26 million people who 
changed their profile photos for Pride 
or the more than 150 million people who were notified that their friends 
were safe after the Nepal earthquake. Facebook has clearly become the 
home for global conversations about things that people care about.
 
And whe
n it comes to serving businesses on our platform, this quarter, we 
continued to focus on delivering more useful tools and resources to help 
them achieve their goals. Helping marketers to tell more visually engaging 
stories through video and carousel ads is
 
an important focus, as well as 
supporting small businesses. There are now more than 40 million small and 
medium
-
size businesses, using pages on Facebook. So we have a big 
opportunity to create value for communities all over the world, and Sheryl is 
going 
to talk more about this in a moment.
 
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services, 
which we also expect to be important parts of our business over the next 
few years. With Instagram, the continued growth in the size and 
engagem
ent of the community shows how this is becoming one of the best 
places to get a real
-
time snapshot of the world. For moments from the U.S. 
presidential campaign trail to NASA's first photos from Pluto, people are 
using Instagram in a lot of interesting way
s. This quarter, we made some big 
improvements to the app, including upgrading our search and explore 
functionality and introducing trending content, which we expect will provide 
even more engaging experiences.
 
On Messenger, this quarter, we rolled out a n
umber of new features, 
including mobile video calling, a new way to share locations and the option 
to sign up for Messenger without using a Facebook account. We also 
continue to make good progress building out the Messenger platform. We 
expect these improv
ements to continue making Messenger a more useful 
and engaging experience for lots of people. More than 700 million people 
now use Messenger and we've reached more than $1 billion downloads on 
Android. These milestones are a good sign that we're on the rig
ht path here.
 
With WhatsApp, we're pleased with our continued growth, and the team is 
continuing to roll out new features to serve the whole community. We've 
continued to improve the web experience for WhatsApp as well as launching 
voice calling to more pe
ople and on more devices.
 
With Search, we are continuing to build a better experience for our whole 
community. We recently crossed 1.5 billion searches per day, and we've now 
indexed more than two trillion posts. This is a huge set of unique 
experiences an
d perspectives, and by allowing people to unlock this 
knowledge, we have a huge opportunity to create value for the world in the 
coming years.
 
Finally, let's talk about our other efforts that we expect to deliver impact 
over the longer term. With Internet.
org, we have a lot of momentum with 
our goal of connecting everyone in the world to the Internet. A year ago, we 
launched the Internet.org app for the first time in Zambia. And since then, 
we've made free basic Internet services available to more than 1 bi
llion 
people in 17 countries. Our results show that Internet.org is working. After 
launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt 
mobile data 50% faster than before. And more than half the new people 
coming online through Internet.
org choose to pay for data and access, more 
Internet services within their first 30 days.
 
We recently made changes to the Internet.org program for both developers 
and operators that will give more people access to even more free services. 
With the Internet
.org platform, now it's easy for any developer to create 
services that integrate with Internet.org. And just this week, we announced 
a portal for operators that makes it easy for them to quickly launch free 
basic services in new countries.
 
We're also makin
g progress on our efforts to connect people living in some 
of the most remote communities on earth. Our Connectivity Lab is working 
on new technologies for connecting communities, that include drones 
satellites and laser communication systems, and we'll be
 
sharing more of our 
progress here very soon.
 
And with Oculus, we've announced that the Rift will ship to consumers in the 
first quarter of 2016. The team recently introduced details about the full 
hardware and software experience that people can expect, i
ncluding our new 
touch controllers. Oculus is going to be the best VR experience in the world 
when it launches and I'm really excited for us to begin to delivering on the 
promise of virtual reality.
 
S that's how we've focused our efforts over the last quar
ter. We're preparing 
for the future, but we're also working to deliver better experiences and value 
to our community today. And as usual, I want to thank our whole 
community, including our employees, our shareholders and our partners. 
Thanks to you, our co
mmunity is getting stronger and stronger every day 
and we're making progress on our mission to make the world more open and 
connected.
 
So thank you. And now here's Sheryl.

Thanks, Mark. And hi, everyone. We had another strong quarter and a great 
first half of the year. Ad revenue grew 43% year
-
over
-
year, 55% on a 
constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue grew 74% year
-
over
-
year, 
making it over three
-
quarters of total ad rev
enue. Our growth was broad
-
based across all marketer segments and industry verticals. Similar to Q1, 
we're pleased with the adoption of our ad products across all regions and we 
saw strong revenue growth in North America and Asia
-
Pacific in particular. 
We'
re staying focused on our three main priorities: capitalizing on the shift 
to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers and making our ads 
more relevant and effective.
 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People are spending more time on 
thei
r mobile devices and on Facebook apps. We continue to get more than 
one out of every five minutes on smartphones in the U.S. and mobile usage 
is driving our growth globally as well. We believe we have the best 
performing mobile ad product in the market and
 
video's making it even 
better. With so many consumer videos being watched on Facebook, video 
ads are a natural part of the News Feed experience. For marketers, video 
has always been a compelling format. Now Facebook enables mass reach 
and cross device tar
geting and measurement abilities far superior to what 
other platforms offer. Mobile video was a major theme at the Cannes Lions 
Festival last month, where some of the biggest winners, like Under Armour's 
I WILL WHAT I WANT with Droga5, and Procter & Gamble
's Like a Girl with 
Leo Burnett used mobile video on Facebook as part of their campaign.
 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad 
products. In Q2, we announced that 40 million small and medium businesses 
have active Facebook page
s, and this number continues to grow. Earlier this 
month, I hosted SMB roundtables in Berlin and London. I got to hear 
firsthand how advertising on Facebook is helping SMBs sell their products, 
grow their businesses, hire new employees and even expand to o
ther cities 
and countries. One of the business owners I met was Kelly Wright (11:43), a 
single mom who started selling dresses from her home. She began by 
shooting videos of her dresses on her mobile phone and promoting them on 
Facebook for just a few poun
ds. Using Facebook as her only marketing 
channel, Kelly grew her business, Krista Lee Fashion, (11:59) to over £3 
million pounds annually and she now has 10 employees.
 
We're increasing our engagement with the global SMB community and have 
now held more tha
n 80 local Boost Your Business events around the world, 
meeting thousands of businesses and getting their feedback on how we can 
make our products work better for them. We're also building out our 
leadership teams around the world. In recent weeks we've ad
ded senior 
talent to our international teams, including a new head of Latin America and 
new regional leadership in several countries in EMEA. We also opened an 
office in Johannesburg, our first in Africa.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant 
and effective. Better, 
more engaging and relevant ads are good for people and marketers, and 
we're working hard to improve them. We continue to innovate at a rapid 
pace by introducing new ad formats and new tools for marketers. This 
quarter we expanded car
ousel ads, which show multiple images in one ad 
unit. We introduced dynamic product ads, which allow marketers to upload 
their product catalog and show the right product to the right person at the 
right time. We also introduced a new ad format called Lead 
Ads, a simpler 
way for people to connect with companies they're interested in hearing from.
 
We continue to focus on providing world
-
class products and tools for direct 
response advertisers. Booking.com, a Priceline Group company, is using 
Facebook link ads
 
featuring Book Now button to drive reservations. In Q2, 
Facebook ads drove a meaningful increase in room reservations for 
Booking.com, helping them meet their ROI goals for the campaign. They're 
now expanding their use of Facebook ads across multiple mark
ets.
 
We continue to make progress with ads on Instagram. In Q2, we launched 
Instagram ads in Brazil, Germany and Japan. We also introduced additional 
capabilities for marketers, including carousel ads on Instagram, which 
brands are using in creative ways. 
For example, to showcase a spring 
fashion collection, gradually reveal a full panorama or show different views 
of a location. Over the coming months, Instagram ads will be available to 
more advertisers with new formats, better targeting and the ability to 
buy 
online as well as through third
-
party planners. As we ramp Instagram ads, 
we remain focused on quality and relevance to ensure the best experience 
for people and the highest performance for marketers. And as always, our 
highest focus is on the consumer
 
experience with Instagram.
 
Measurement is a key priority as we work to expand our share of global 
marketing budgets. Since we introduced conversion lift, which measures the 
direct impact that Facebook ads have on sales, we've seen adoption for 
marketers a
cross verticals. When Acura launched the TLX, the largest launch 
in their history, they used Facebook video to show the TLX in scenarios that 
quickly captured people's attention, like imitating a roller coaster. They then 
used our retargeting technology to
 
show more detailed ads only to the 
people who watched the videos. Using conversion lift, they proved that 
Facebook ads directly drove vehicle sales.
 
To help marketers target and measure campaigns both on and off Facebook, 
we're continuing to build out our
 
ad tech platform with Atlas LiveRail on the 
Audience Network. Entertainment company Live Nation knew that people 
browsed for concert tickets on mobile devices, but they were never able to 
measure whether they converted into sales. Using Atlas, Live Nation
 
was 
able to link their mobile ads to 66% more ticket purchases for one of their 
largest artists. This shows the promise of Atlas to measure cross device 
conversion. We're pleased with the progress we're making on all three of our 
main priorities and we pl
an to stay focused.
 
Now here's Dave.
 
David M. Wehner

Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another strong 
quarter for Facebook. We generated $4 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in 
free cash flow. Strong community
 
growth and engagement underpinned our 
financial performance. In June, approximately 968 million people used 
Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. 
This daily number represents 65% of the 1.49 billion people who used 
Facebook
 
during the month of June. That MAU number grew by 173 million 
year
-
over
-
year, and by this measure the second quarter was our strongest 
in terms of community growth since 2013.
 
Mobile remains the key driver of our growth. In June, approximately 1.31 
billio
n people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year. 
We also saw strong growth in our next generation of services with 
Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp now exceeding 300 million, 700 million 
and 800 million MAU respectively.
 
Now turning to
 
the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non
-
GAAP measures exclude 
stock
-
based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. Total revenue 
was $4 billion, up 39%, or 50% on a consta
nt currency basis. Ad revenue 
was $3.8 billion, up 43%, or 55% on a constant currency basis. The 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar has continued to have an unfavorable 
impact on our revenue. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with 
Q2 2014 levels, 
our total revenue this quarter would have been 
approximately $330 million higher.
 
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 55% in the 
quarter, and APAC growth also remained strong at 48%. Europe and the rest 
of the world ad revenue gre
w more slowly at 30% and 22% respectively, as 
currency had a significant negative impact on each of those regions' year
-
over
-
year growth rates. Mobile is the engine of our revenue growth. Mobile 
ad revenue in Q2 was $2.9 billion, up 74% from last year, and
 
represents 
76% of our advertising revenue. Revenue from ads served on personal 
computers was down approximately 8%. In Q2, the average price per ad 
increased 220% while total ad impressions declined 55%. Similar to last 
quarter, these price volume trends 
were primarily driven by the redesign of 
our right hand column ads, which rolled out in the third quarter of last year. 
To a lesser degree, the shift of usage towards mobile, where we don't have 
right hand column ads, also contributed to the reported price
 
volume trends.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was $215 million, down 8% 
compared to last year. The decline was driven by a 19% year
-
over
-
year 
reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal 
computers, offset primarily by the addit
ion of other revenue related to 
acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
 
Turning now to expenses. Our Q2 total GAAP expenses were $2.8 billion, up 
82%, and non
-
GAAP expenses were $1.8 billion, up 57%. Similar to last 
quarter, stock
-
based compensatio
n and amortization expenses related to the 
WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year
-
over
-
year growth 
in GAAP expenses. Non
-
GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by 
increases in head count
-
related costs, cost of revenue and marketing 
ex
penses. We ended the quarter with 10,955 employees, up 52% compared 
to last year. With 873 additional employees, Q2 was one of our strongest 
quarters in terms of hiring, and the majority of the new employees were 
added in R&D.
 
Our Q2 GAAP operating income 
was $1.3 billion, representing a 31% 
operating margin. Non
-
GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion, representing 
a 55% margin. Our Q2 GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates were 44% and 36%, 
respectively. Q2 GAAP net income was $719 million or $0.25 per share, and 
non
-
GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $0.50 per share. In Q2, capital 
expenditures were $549 million and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash 
flow. We ended the quarter with $14.1 billion in cash and investments.
 
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start wi
th revenue. Since the first quarter 
of 2014, we have seen year
-
over
-
year advertising revenue growth rates 
decline each subsequent quarter. We expect this trend to continue in Q3 and 
Q4 as we continue to grow off a much larger base and face currency 
headwin
ds due to the strong dollar. In addition, we expect our total 
payments and other fees revenues to decline on a year
-
over
-
year basis for 
the remainder of the year. The decline in the second half of the year should 
be closer to the 19% year
-
over
-
year decline
 
we experienced in the 
Payments business alone as we will be lapping periods in which we added 
other fees revenue from acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
 
Turning to expense guidance. Based on our second
-
quarter results, we are 
narrowing the ex
pense guidance range for 2015. We now expect the year
-
over
-
year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses to be between 55% and 
60%, narrowed from the prior range of 55% to 65%. And we expect the 
year
-
over
-
year growth rate for total 2015 non
-
GAAP expenses t
o be 
between 50% and 55%, narrowed from the prior range of 50% to 60%.
 
We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures will be in the neighborhood of 
$2.5 billion to $3 billion, down slightly from the prior range of $2.7 billion to 
$3.2 billion. We continue to
 
expect stock
-
based compensation in 2015 to be 
in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is 
related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect 
amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million to 
$800 
million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q3 and full year 2015 GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates to be consistent with the rates in the second quarter.
 
We had a great first half of the year with solid revenue performance 
underpinned by healthy community growt
h across all of our services and 
regions. We have many exciting opportunities ahead, and we are investing in 
the talent and resources to capitalize on them as we seek to build long
-
term 
shareholder value.
 
With that, operator, let's open up the call for que
stions.

Thanks a lot. I have one for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, Facebook has had 
so much success in terms of the engagement, the growth of the 
engagement. I'm just wondering if there's a framework that you used to 
think about how 
much of that success is due to just the core value 
proposition of Facebook itself continuing to resonate with people at its most 
basic level as opposed to the product innovation that you've detailed in your 
prepared remarks or in your use cases? Which are 
more of a driver in your 
mind?
 
And then second one for Dave. CapEx being down as a percentage of 
revenue in 2Q and you lowered the guidance. It doesn't feel like you guys 
are in the midst of ramping investment in the infrastructure. I wonder, as 
you look a
t the assets, you have so much growth, you have a shift to 
bandwidth intensive content and applications. Do you feel like you guys have 
just been more efficient in terms of your CapEx spend, or at some point 
should we anticipate a reacceleration of CapEx? 
Thanks.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I can talk to the first part. So at some level, I do think that the core mission 
and promise of helping to connect people with their friends and family is 
very fundamental, right? And ever
yone has friends and family and wants to 
stay connected and uses a variety of tools and ways to do that in the world 
today, which are often very inefficient, and the Internet offers new 
opportunities to make that a lot better. When you look at the specific
 
products that 

 
and the work that we're doing, there's this process that 
we've followed that 

 
where basically we'll look at an area of our products 
that people are using. So for example, going back a few years, News Feed, 
right, was 

 
it's always been, s
ince we rolled it out, a very central part of the 
product.
 
But we're looking at the stuff with increasing rigor now where we organized 
the company into these product groups, and each product group leader will 
not just look at the product as one thing, but 
what are the key three or four 
or five use cases which often can really be their own product lines on their 
own, and we go through and we build those out to be world
-
class. And I 
think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the 
wo
rk that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News 
Feed and I mean that team has executed really well.
 
But when I look forward, I'm very excited about doing the same thing for 
messaging and groups and video. There's many different use 
cases. You 
don't want to just look at these as one thing. There are a bunch of different 
use cases, and we want to be the best at each of them. And if you have 
good people leading those teams, then I think you can deliver that over 
time. So I think yes is 
the answer to your question. The mission is 
fundamentally deeply important to people, but that has to be coupled with 
good thorough execution of each of the available opportunities.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, Anthony. It's Dave. So on 
CapEx, we are absolutely investing in the 
infrastructure and 2015 is an investment year, so we are ramping CapEx 
versus 2014. The guidance is $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and that's up from 
$1.8 billion last year. We've got a lot of infrastructure investmen
t that we're 
making across data centers, servers, network. We are clearly investing for 
the growth of both Facebook at its core and then also the additional services 
that we're bringing on.
 
So we're proud about the efficiencies that we've had. The infrastr
ucture 
team has done an outstanding job in driving good efficiencies through things 
like the Open Compute Project, which allows us to leverage an open
-
source 
strategy to lower our costs on server and other expensive hardware. It's 
been a great strategy for
 
us. But given the growth we have in the business, 
given the opportunity we have before us, we're very much in investment 
mode in terms of the infrastructure.

Thanks for taking the question. Mark, you talked about Oculus Rift shipping 
in 1Q 2016. Can you talk more about what you're most excited about in 
terms of the primary applications when it's into the mainstream? And then, 
Dav
e, can you also help us understand the cost structure more here as that 
product ramps? And then, Sheryl, if you could help us understand how 
broadly Instagram will open up to advertisers by year end? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Exe
cutive Officer
 
I can talk about Oculus. So the reason why Facebook is excited in this space 
is I can give you two reasons for this. One is there's this continued 
progression of people getting richer and richer ways to share what's on their 
minds. So if you
 
go back 10 years, most of how people communicated and 
shared was text. We are going through a period where now it's mostly visual 
and photos. We are entering into a period where that's going to increasingly 
be primarily video, and we're seeing huge growth
 
there. But that's not the 
end of the line. I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to 
share and consume thoughts and ideas and I think that immersive 3D 
content is the obvious next thing after video.
 
So if you look at what the initial use cas
es are going to be around that, I 
think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about. Video I think 
will be huge. So just taking that to be 3D and immersive. Gaming will be 
huge. And those are both areas that Facebook has been involved with. 
Once 
we start to get more of a critical mass, I think you can start to get social 
applications, which is what we as a company are more interested in over the 
long term and think have a huge amount of potential in addition to the video 
and gaming stuff, whi
ch I just think is going to be awesome in the next few 
years as well.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Hey, Doug. It's Dave. So just on the question of how Oculus would affect the 
cost structure, it's premature for us to be giving guidance on the 
cost 
structure in 2016. But I think one of the things to recognize here is that 
we're still early with Oculus. We haven't announced any specific plans as it 
relates to shipment volumes for the consumer for Rift. But we are still early 
in the development st
age, so it'd be early to be talking about large volume 
shipments. Obviously, we're investing on the research and development side 
on Oculus in 2015 and that's factored into our expense guidance for this 
year.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Director
 
On Instagram, we are opening up to more advertisers. I talked about some 
of our global rollouts in the past quarter. We're also opening up more 
capabilities, which means more formats, like direct response, more ways to 
buy, like self
-
serve. That s
aid, and it's important to understand this, while 
we think there's a lot of interest and great opportunity, we're going to be 
really thoughtful and strategic about how we ramp revenue. Instagram 
remains small relative to Facebook and it's going to really t
ake time to have 
significant impact on our growth.

Your next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is 
open.
 
Heather A. Bellini

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a little b
it 
more about as you start to speak with more advertisers on the Instagram 
opportunity, how are you and they thinking about the differences in how 
they'll engage with their customers across both platforms? And I guess what 
I'm getting at is do you see Inst
agram targeting a different type of 
advertiser, or do you expect people to leverage both platforms and almost 
think of them as kind of separate areas to budget for?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
I think one of the things that's in
teresting about Instagram is while the ads 
are really visually appealing and that brings to mind certain verticals like 
fashion or autos, things where the visual really matters, what we're seeing is 
that lots of different verticals can use the platform rea
lly well. So a recent 
example, HTC working with their agency Swift did Instagram videos to raise 
awareness of their mobile device warranty program. So they targeted 18
-
 
to 
34
-
year olds, they did five short videos with these funny moments of where 
you're ab
out to break your phone, and they got a 6 point lift in awareness of 
what is a warranty program. I think that's not something you would think of 
typically as Instagram.
 
In terms of Instagram and Facebook, we believe that marketers are looking 
to connect wi
th people in a really deep way, connect with the right people, 
and our targeting we think is really strong compared to any other platform, 
at the right time. And that really means mobile. And we see such 
engagement on both Facebook and Instagram along with
 
the different 
targeting and ad formats, we believe we'll be able to have and are already 
starting to have a relationship with marketers which grow across both 
platforms.
 
Our focus with our marketing partners is their business results. I talked 
about in my
 
remarks how we're looking for conversions. We're trying to help 
them measure. If you do a car ad for us, how many vehicles were driven off 
the lot? We see what products you use within Facebook or Instagram, or 
Facebook and Instagram, as less important as 
the best products for the right 
marketer at the right time to drive their business results. And we like having 
more abilities, more products, more apps to work with so that we can drive 
those business results.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my question. There are two. In early June you rolled out 
some new CPC measurement methods about how the changes in the clicks 
and the CPCs are measured. 
Just being curious about kind of early findings 
you see in ad engagement growth, average price per ad, and then the 
advertiser feedback or change in budgeting since you've rolled out these CPC 
measurement changes? And then the second one, the North America
n 
advertising results are really strong, I think you had accelerating growth. 
Sheryl, could you just call out any specific ad products that are driving this 
faster North American ad growth? Thanks.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
On
 
the first, we're always trying to improve our ad products so marketers 
can buy what they want and pay as they want to pay. We recently 
announced that we're updating the definition of CPC so that includes only 
websites and apps. But you can also buy on a c
ost per engagement basis, 
and that include likes, comments, and shares. It's too early to see any direct 
impact, but I think it's part of the innovation that you'll see from us as we 
continue to roll out different ways that marketers can use our tools, dif
ferent 
ways they can pay, different results they can target. When you look at our 
overall growth, our growth is very broad
-
based. We're broad
-
based against 
all of our segments of marketers, so brand and direct response, SMBs and 
developers.
 
Definitely a pa
rt of the story here is video. Our video demand is very deep. 
People love the format of video. It's long been used to reach people in a 
compelling way, and we can do targeting in a way that's really unique. So I'll 
share another example. Wendy's, working w
ith their agency, VML, launched 
their Jalapeno Fresco Spicy Chicken product and they were trying to reach 
millennials and spicy food lovers. So working with us, they did five video 
ads, and on our platform, they could not just do the video format but they 
could target millennials and people who like spicy food, which is very specific 
targeting. They got an eight
-
point lift in ad recall and a four

Yeah, I mean, on the options on video monetization, it's going to be, still our 
focus is going to be
 
on continuing to grow autoplay and continuing to 
leverage the video unit in News Feed. That's going to be the primary driver 
of video growth for us. So that's really the main focus. We've got other 
areas that we're experimenting with like suggested videos
, which are going 
to be very much like those ads in a feed of suggested videos, which are also 
an opportunity for us. But essentially, the focus is going to be on monetizing 
through feed ads for video.

seeing there and what products are really having an impact. Thank you
.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I think in terms of engagement the product is having, the biggest 
impact is News Feed continuing to do very well. So News Feed at the core is 
proving to be just a great experience for user
s. It's getting better. We 
continue to invest in that. As people spend more time with News Feed, we 
get better about understanding what they like and getting the content that 
they care about in front of them. So we're investing on that front. We're also 
do
ing more with public content. That's having an impact. So we're seeing 
across the board good improvements to News Feed. Video is another big 
contributor there as well.
 
So, I mean, that's what we're seeing in terms of driving engagement. 
Engagement across t
he different regions as we think about it from a DAU
-
to
-
MAU perspective was at record levels in the quarter, so we're pleased with 
that. And we continue to see time spent grow across the platform. So on all 
those measures, we really like what we're seeing 
and we like the 
investments that we're making to make that News Feed experience even 
better.

Ross Sandler

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great. I just had two 
questions, one for Mark and then one clarification for 
Dave. Mark, question on the messaging app. So the (37:37) from the first 
day keynote at the end of the day, Brian Acton and David Marcus were 
basically presenting different strategies in terms of their
 
long
-
term 
philosophy around monetization of those two platforms.
 
So if you look out three or five years, do you see the opportunity with 
Messenger and WhatsApp as being similar or can you just talk about the 
strategy there? And is the engagement for the m
essaging apps similar, 
higher, lower than the average for the core Facebook app in terms of daily 
visits? And then, Dave, you mentioned that you expect ad revenue to 
decelerate. I'm guessing that's a function of some of the FX headwinds. Can 
you talk about
 
that on a currency neutral basis relative to the 55% in the 
second quarter? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. I can take the second part first. So in terms of 

 
also you had asked 
about the growth rate in the back half of the year, s
o I'd kind of reiterate 
what I said in my comments. The business continues to perform very well, 
driven off the strength of our mobile News Feed apps business, and really 
consistent with the trend we've seen in the last several quarters, we would 
expect th
at year
-
over
-
year ads growth rate to decline modestly in Q3 and 
Q4, and it's really because we're delivering growth against a much larger 
scale News Feed business in the prior
-
year period and also, of course, 
headwinds are an impact as well, as you mention
ed.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
And I can talk to the messaging strategy question. So the playbook that 
we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how 
we thought about building a business in Faceboo
k and News Feed, where if 
you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of 
encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the 
experience, and what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and 
moneti
zation would perform better if there was an organic interaction 
between people using the product and businesses.
 
So instead of focusing on ads first, what we did was we built pages, and we 
made that free, that way as many businesses as possible could get i
nto the 
network. And we built insights to make it so that businesses knew how they 
were driving business when they used pages for free and could post them to 
News Feed. And then on top of that whole ecosystem, we then had the 
opportunity to build what has 
turned into a News Feed business that we're 
really proud of, right. That we think is driving a lot of value and good 
content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of 
businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall.
 
Mess
aging, I think, is going to be pretty similar, right? Where right now 
some people in WhatsApp use the service in order to message businesses, 
Messenger is, I think, more people
-
to
-
people today. We're working on a lot 
of different things that make it so tha
t people can get value from interacting 
with businesses. We launched some of them at F8. We have a number of 
other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. But the 
long term bet is that by enabling people to have good organic interaction
s 
with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of 
the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on 
that in a bigger way. So we'd ask for some patience on this to do this 
correctly, and the game plan will 
be more similar to what we did in Facebook 
with News Feed.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And, Ross, you also asked about, I think, the impact of Messenger on our 
user statistics and the daily users. The vast, vast majority, virtually all of 
Mes
senger users, are using News Feed as well. So Messenger
-
only usage is 
not having a material impact on our overall usage stats.

Thanks for taking 
my questions. I had one on search. I think you mentioned 
1.5 billion daily searches. Just kind of curious what portion of those are 
commercial, if you will, not so much lookups for friends and family but more 
commercial oriented, and kind of can you give u
s an update of where you 
are in the process of building out an even more robust search experience on 
Facebook and across the other family of apps?
 
And then on Instagram, just a question on kind of how we should be 
thinking about the ramp as well as the lon
g term opportunity. I guess the 
question would be in your tests, have you noticed any meaningful difference 
in Instagram users' willingness to see or interact with ads and their News 
Feed as compared with an average Facebook user, recognizing that probably
 
Instagram's audience is more geared toward some of the developing 
markets in the U.S. relative to Facebook? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. On the search experience, and Mark can add anything if he'd like, but 
on the search 
experience from a monetization perspective, the vast majority 
of the searches are for people or posts, and there can be 

 
there's the 
potential for there to be commercially relevant content in people's posts, 
people searches, which is the largest part of s
earching, is not something that 
we think is really up the monetizing category. But there's certainly great 
content that people are finding using post search, but it's really 

 
the focus 
is really to try and allow people to discover content that's been shar
ed on 
Facebook that's relevant to them, and that's going to be the focus in the 
near term. And as people consume more content on Facebook, there's 
opportunities to show them ads in Feed, so there's an opportunity there, but 
it's really around engaging with
 
content that you want to find on Facebook.

On Instagram, we haven't noticed any difference in willingness to engage

Great. Thanks. Two questions. David, the sales and marketing expenses this 
quarter were almost flattish sequentially. You don't normally see that i
n your 
business. Is there anything, any particular reason behind that why you didn't 
have that area grow? I assume it will continue to grow going forwards.
 
And then, Mark, you made a comment about. I think you were referring to 
Instagram becoming one of th
e best places to get a real
-
time snapshot of 
the world. And it kind of reminds me or makes me think about some other 
leading platforms on the Internet. And I wonder how does that happen with 
Instagram? Is that something that you're already seeing users use
 
Instagram to make that happen? Or is that something that you have to kind 
of tweak the user interface and change the product a little bit in order to try 
to have people think about it that way? How does it become that real
-
time 
snapshot of the world? Than
ks.
 
David M. Wehner

So on the sales and marketing expenses, Mark, I think you're going to see 
that be lumpy. That's just due to product marketing and that's just not going 
to necessarily be a steady quarter
-
to
-
quarter trend. So yo
u're going to see 
that be lumpy. But, yes, we are investing more in general in sales and 
marketing over time, so you'd expect to see that line grow in line with the 
expense guidance that we're giving. So it's definitely an area that we'll be 
investing in o
n an ongoing basis and I wouldn't read too much into the 
quarterly trend there.

I think a lot of it is that we're getting bette

a bigger opportunity when people have their phones with them all the time, 
but I think that there are plenty of other worlds that we could be living 
in 
where we wouldn't have necessarily executed on that opportunity. And the 
execution is hard, right? And just kind of having something that's appealing 
universally to people wanting to stay connected with their friends, that's an 
important piece of it. Bu
t I mean, the team has just done really good work in 
terms of ranking the content and making the experience faster and building 
out better ways to get feedback from our community on what kinds of 
content they want to see in News Feed and helping people hav
e the tools 
that they need to share the social content and news and video content that 
they want so that way it exists in the corpus of content that can be shown.

Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned 40 million small businesses 
have active Pages. I'm wondering if you could update us on how many 
individual small businesses, or businesses in total are buying ads right now?

see a discreet demand in supply
-
side businesses evolving?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Chief Operating Officer & Dire
ctor
 
So on the first, we announced that we have over 2 million advertisers who 
are buying ads on Facebook. And the process for that is often that small 
businesses become organic users, so those 40 million small business Pages 
that are using it once a month
 
and then we're able to move them onto being 
advertisers. And the best way we've done that is by simplified ad products. 
82% of people who start advertising with us start with our really simple ad 
products. You know, do you want to pay a few dollars or a f
ew pounds or a 
few euro to sponsor this post is a really easy on
-
ramp for a small business.
 
In terms of overall ad tech world, I think a lot is happening and there's a lot

people

marketing and the effectiveness and relevance of Facebook 
ads off of Facebook so we can give marketers and publishers the tools to

An importantly for our business, is connect the dots between online 
marketing and business outcomes. And you heard on this call me give a few 
examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of 
ads with real sales of real products. For us, this is an important investment

Good afternoon. D
rafting off that. Sheryl, I'm wondering if you could update 
us on Atlas. We understand Atlas in and of itself is not likely be a major 
revenue driver, but we do see it as a strategically important piece of your 
toolset. So wondering if you can comment on a
gency adoption. Is it going 
according to plan? Are you happy with it?
 
And then secondly, on SMB, just wondering, the 80 events that you've held 
around the world. In terms of learning come out of those, you talked a little 
bit about how folks get introduced
 
as users, and that makes sense. Is the 
toolset simple enough today for SMB's to grasp? Or are there significant 
additions that you need to make to the toolset to accelerate the growth of 
SMB advertisers? Thanks very much.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operat
ing Officer & Director
 
So on the first, Atlas is really important because it's solving a measurement 
problem which is that the current systems for serving and measuring ads are 
really flawed. They basically assume that you are one person on one of 
device, 
and we know that's not true. They are only about 65% accurate in 
demographic targeting, they don't work on mobile because they are cookie 
based, they don't work on multiple devices, they don't go off
-
line to on
-
line 
and they overemphasize the last click an
d reach.
 
And so our focus with Atlas is helping people really understand the results 
they get with ads. And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we 
are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales. 
We never could have do
ne that without Atlas measurements.
 
In terms of the migration process, this is an enterprise sale. We have to 
work client by client. Then they have to choose us, then they have to 
migrate their systems, and so it's going to take time. What really matters i
s 
that when we get that migration and we are seeing it, we are able to show 
them the value because it makes their buying much more effective because 
they understand real results in a new way.
 
In tune with SMBs I would say two things. I would say that, one,
 
our 
products aren't simple enough yet, because they can never be simple 
enough for SMBs, but two, our products are probably the simplest ones out 
there. And so I think we're leading and I think we have a lot more to do. If 
we look at even in the United St
ates, which is a very advanced market, I 
think it's something like 35% of SMBs don't have a web presence of any 
kind. But a great majority of those do have a Facebook page, and that's 
because setting up a web presence for an SMB is complicated and 
expensiv
e. You can't just start a webpage. But it is easier and free to start a 
Facebook page until you see broad adoption.
 
We also make a lot of things that they couldn't do in other platforms 
available on us. So over 1 million SMBs have posted a video on Faceboo
k, 
which is pretty amazing, because I doubt 1 million SMBs have ever run what 
is a video or TV ad. That's because you can shoot it on your mobile device, 
you can upload it, you can do that for free or you can pay us for the ad. And 
so I think our tools are
 
the simplest, but I think we still need to do better 
because what we hear from SMBs is simple, fast, inexpensive, showing them 
real return, and we're going to continue to focus on all of those things.

comparisons to traditional News Feed ads? Thanks.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
We're seeing investment, we're investing in the audience network and we 
think it's important because i
t takes 

 
it makes the ads more relevant. It's 
part of our overall ad tech push to bring the effectiveness and relevance of 
our ads off us. We're growing the number of advertisers and publishers, and 
we're continuing to see growth and we'll continue to inv
est.
 
When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but 
relatively small part of our revenue. The important thing to understand here 
is that they're not only used by developers, they're used by all four marketer 
segments. So for exampl
e, HBO used our video retargeting mobile app 
install ads on Facebook to drive downloads at HBO now, and Facebook is 
now the number one channel driving subscribers. And I think when people 
think about our mobile app install ads they often think this only ap
plies to 
developers and small companies, and really it's them as well but it's also 
companies like HBO which are using those ads to drive adoption and 
downloads.

Thanks Deborah, and thank you all for joining today. This was an important 
quarter for us. Our community and business continue to grow, and there are 
now more than 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Insta
gram, WhatsApp, or 
Messenger each month, and more than 2.1 billion people who use at least 
one of our services each day.
 
We continue to focus on our four priorities for the year, making progress on 
the major social issues, building qualitatively new experi
ences, building our 

going to focus on the first two priorities today, but first I want to talk about 
the recent news that we reached a settlement with the FTC over our privacy 
concerns.
 


and run this company. This will require investing a significant amount of our 
engineering resources in building 
tools to review our products in the ways 
we use data. It will also significantly increase our accountability by bringing 
the process for auditing our privacy controls more in line with how financial 
controls work at public companies with Sarbanes Oxley.
 
We

commitments. And just as we have an audit committee of our Board 
overseeing our financial controls, we will now also have a new privacy 
committee of our board that will oversee our privacy pr
ogram and work with 
an independent privacy auditor that will report to this new committee and to 

take on the role of Chief Privacy Officer for Product, reporting to me and 
managing our
 

developers who access data through our platform. Together, we expect 
these changes will set a new standard for our industry.
 
This is a major shift for us. We build services that billions of people
 
trust 
every day to communicate with the people they care about. Privacy has 




time to do this properly, and I expect it will take us longer to ship new 

that just as with the work we have been doing on s

going to continue to identify and fix issues as we develop our systems. But 
our goal is to build privacy protections that are as strong as the best 
services we provide, and this settlement gives us clear requirements moving 
forwa
rd.
 
Now, turning to our company priorities, our top priority is making progress 
on the major social issues facing the internet, including privacy, and also 
elections, harmful content, data portability, and more. In all these areas, 

lieve the internet would benefit from governments 

making so many decisions on social issues without a robust democratic 
process. Either the right regulations will get put int
o place, or we expect 
frustration with our industry will continue to grow.
 
This quarter I spent time in Europe talking with policymakers about how this 
could work. I met with President Macron to discuss a framework for harmful 
content. This is an area wher
e I believe there could be an effective public 
process led by democratically elected governments in Europe, and perhaps 
in the U.S., a process for industry standards and self
-
regulation.
 

t. We 

making on many categories of harmful content, including hate speech and 
graphic violence. Those are the areas where we still need to do better, like 
bullying and harassment. 
I believe more companies should release 
transparency reports that enumerate the prevalence of harmful content on 
their services. This would help companies and governments design better 

ese 
reports quarterly, so people can hold us accountable at the same cadence as 
these earnings calls.
 


appeal the 



this could work, which we published in a rep
ort last month. We expect to 
form this oversight board by the end of this year.
 
We also continue to invest heavily in protecting elections 

 
including more 
advanced efforts to stop coordinated inauthentic behavior, new ads 
transparency tools, and more fact
-
checking partnerships. Our adversaries 
are continually getting more sophisticated, but recent elections in the EU and 
India show that our efforts are working. After the recent EU elections, the 
former President of the EU Parliament said that we met the co
mmitments to 
fight election interference that I made in my testimony to the EU Parliament, 

continue building on these efforts as we approach the 2020 U.S. elections to 
make sure
 
that we stay ahead.
 

discuss our second priority 

 
delivering qualitatively new experiences for our

e first is our privacy

focused on delivering this over the next five years, building on the 
foundation we have with Messenger and Wh

private social platform could become the center of your social experience, 
for example, by bringing together all of your ephemeral stories from your 

s like the ability to co

watch videos together. This shows how something like video chat, which is 
growing quickly as a basic way that we all communicate can become more of 
a platform for more ways we want to interact privately in the future.
 
With WhatsApp
, which already has incredibly strong privacy and 

interact in this digital living room. WhatsApp Status is already the most 
popular ephemeral stories product in the world, and we co
ntinue to see good 
momentum there. With millions of small businesses using WhatsApp 

entrepreneurs around the world can use for free. This matters especially for 
the growing number of small 

that use private messaging platforms like WhatsApp as their main way of 
interacting with customers.
 

commerce and payments. These are huge a
nd important spaces, and we 
have efforts in several major areas to deliver qualitatively better experiences 
than what exists today from Instagram Shopping to Facebook Marketplace to 
payments across our apps to the new Libra project that we announced with 
2
7 other companies recently. These efforts are important both for our 
product experience and for our business. Once people have connected to 
their networks on social platforms, one of the biggest questions is how can 
we help them use those networks that the
y have created to create 
opportunity, and one of the best ways that we can do that is through 
commerce.
 
Instagram Shopping will improve the experience of browsing and shopping 
from your favorite brands and creators, while also giving emerging creators 
a po
werful new way to build a business and sustain their community. 
Facebook Marketplace gives people a way to buy and sell goods in a trusted 
network with real identities. Hundreds of millions of people are already using 

ng ways for people to interact with 
businesses through messaging like WhatsApp Business, because people 

over messaging if possible.
 

xcited about. When I look at 
the kinds of private interactions we can make easier, payments may be the 

WhatsApp in India, and are close to launching in other countries as well. In 
the f

money to friends and businesses on WhatsApp, shop on Instagram, or make 
transactions on Facebook. Being able to send money as easily as you can 
send a photo will open up new opportunities 
for businesses.
 

access financial tools. Last month we announced that we were working with 
27 other organizations to form the Libra Association. The association will 
create a new c
urrency called Libra, which will be powered by blockchain 
technology. The Libra Association will be independent of Facebook or any 
other member, but we plan to support this currency across our services. The 
goal is to empower billions of people around the 
world, who use services like 
WhatsApp but might be excluded from banking services, with access to a 
safe, stable, and well
-
regulated cryptocurrency.
 
There are a lot of possibilities here, and both Facebook and the association 
plan to work with regulators t
o help address their all of their concerns before 
Libra will be ready to launch. We worked with other prospective members of 
the association to release a white paper outlining the Libra concept in 
advance specifically so that we could address these importa
nt questions out 

right.
 

a qualitatively better experience than what exists today is in the future 
computing platforms of augmented and virtual reality. This quarter, we 
shipped Oculus Quest, our first all

required to be tethered to a $1000 PC, to now Quest, which costs $400 all 

more inn

The reason augmented and virtual reality will deliver a qualitatively better 
experience than traditional computing platforms is that they deliver the 
feeli
ng of presence 

 

another place. The feeling of presence is so important to social interactions 

than we expected to deliver this a
t scale, I continue to believe that this will 
be one of the most important contributions we make to the way we all use 
technology over the long term.
 


e made a lot of progress this quarter 
and a have a lot more ahead. Our business continues to perform well, and 
Sheryl is going to talk more about that in a minute.
 
But this was also an important quarter because now we have a clearer path 
forward 

 
not just
 
in terms of product and business, but in terms of 
guidance from regulators, which sets clear expectations and gives us a 
foundation to build on. As always, thanks for being on this journey with us, 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks Mark, and h
i everyone. It was a strong quarter for our business. Ad 
revenue grew 28% year
-
over
-
year and we saw strong growth across all 
regions and on both Facebook and Instagram. Mobile ad revenue was $15.6 
billion, contributing approximately 94% of total ad revenue


privacy while continuing to grow our community and our business. We know 
we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but this quarter once again 
shows that we can do
 
both.
 
We are committed to earning back trust through the actions we take. In the 

threats and develop smarter technology. The European Parliament elections 
in May were an importa
nt test for us. We created an operation center in 
Dublin to bring our experts together and make decisions quickly. We also 
worked closely with third parties across the EU, including 21 fact
-
checking 
organizations. As Mark shared, these investments are star
ting to pay off and 
we remain committed to doing everything we can to stop bad actors.
 
We are also focused on increasing transparency. At the end of June, we 
made our transparency tools available globally for ads about social issues, 
elections or politics.
 
These tools show who paid for an ad, how much they 

influence their vote will help us better defend against foreign interference 

ts to protect 

over the long
-
term.
 
At the same time, we are focused on growing our business by helping 
advertisers grow theirs. Consumers often adopt new technologies first and 
our competitive advantage is helping advertisers reach people, where they 
are. We helped businesses make the shift to mobile and now we are helping 

enough to make these new format
s available. We also need to make it easy 
for advertisers to create effective ads. We do this by launching new ad 
products and by improving our existing ones to deliver more value for people 
and advertisers.
 
One of our goals is to level the playing field f
or businesses of all sizes. We 
give small businesses free tools that previously only the largest companies 
could access. During National Small Business Week in May, we introduced 
Automated Ads to take the guesswork out of creating effective ads. 
Advertiser
s answer a few questions and get a customized marketing plan 
with up to six creative options, targeting suggestions and a recommended 
budget. We also launched new video editing tools to help SMBs quickly

result, nearly doubled their conversions to new memberships.
 

proving our existing ad products. We often get 
feedback from advertisers about how we can make small adjustments to our 
tools to better serve them. These basis point improvements allow us to 
create more value for businesses over time. For example, we first
 
rolled out 
our Dynamic Ads format four years ago and since then, we have adapted the 
format to the needs of different verticals and surfaces. Frontier Airlines used 
Dynamic Ads to connect with travelers, who recently looked at flights online, 

ook. This contributed to a nearly 3.5% increase in ad
-
related 
bookings and a 2.5 times increase in ad
-
related revenue. This quarter, we 
launched our latest variation 

 
Dynamic Ads in Instagram Stories 

 
which 


or app.
 

This quarter, we improved how quickly we refresh the ads people see. In the 
past, these ads were pre
-
selected at the beginning of a feed session. N
ow, 
the ads are refreshed while people are scrolling through their feed. This 
means people get more relevant ads, which improves engagement and 
delivers a better return on investment for advertisers. In addition to 

n new ways for people to discover 
products, engage with brands and shop on our platforms.
 
On discovery 

 
more than 50% of accounts on Instagram use Explore every 
month to discover photos and videos related to their interests. This quarter 
we started rollin
g out Ads in Explore on Instagram. This will give businesses 
a chance to reach new audiences in a place where they are already spending 
their time and learning about new products.

and influencers they love. Last month, we launched Branded Content 

ads. Brands like Old Navy, Sephora and Jack in the Box are reaching new 

nd this option so that advertisers 
can do the same in Stories.

I want to close by saying how gra
teful I am to our partners around the 
world. Every day, they give us valuable feedback on how to improve our 
products, so that we can help them grow their businesses.

up 8% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the 
Philippines. This represents approximately 66% of the 2.41 billion monthly 
active users in June. MAUs grew 180 million or 8% com
pared to last year.
 
In terms of our Family metrics, we continue to grow and estimate that on 
average, more than 2.1 billion people used at least one of our apps on a 
daily basis in June and more than 2.7 billion people were active on a 
monthly basis.
 
Turni
ng now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $16.9 billion, up 28% or 32% 
on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant 
with the second quarter of 2018, to
tal revenue would have been 
approximately $574 million higher.
 
Q2 total ad revenue was $16.6 billion, up 28% or 32% on a constant 
currency basis. In terms of regional ad revenue growth, North America and 
Asia
-
Pacific were strongest and both grew 30%, follo
wed by Europe at 25%. 
Rest of World grew more slowly at 21% and was impacted by currency 
headwinds.
 
In Q2, the average price per ad decreased 4% and the number of ad 
impressions served across our services increased 33%. Similar to last 
quarter, impression 
growth was primarily driven by ads on Instagram 
Stories, Instagram Feed, and Facebook News Feed. The year
-
over
-
year 
decline in average price per ad reflects an ongoing mix shift towards Stories 
ads and geographies that monetize at lower rates. Payments & O
ther Fees 
revenue was $262 million, up 36%. This year
-
over
-
year growth was 
primarily driven by sales of new products, notably Oculus Quest and Rift S.
 
Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $12.3 billion, up 66%. This 
includes an additional $2 billio
n expense accrued in connection with our $5 
billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. Absent this charge, 
our total expense growth rate would have been 27 percentage points lower. 
We ended Q2 with approximately 39,700 full
-
time employees, up 31
%.
 
Operating income was $4.6 billion representing a 27% operating margin. 
Absent the FTC accrual, operating margin would have been approximately 12 
percentage points higher. Our Q2 tax rate was 46% and was higher than 
expected due to the tax treatment of t
he FTC accrual and a court ruling in 
the IRS versus Altera case. In that case, the Ninth Circuit reversed a prior 
Tax Court decision addressing the tax treatment of certain share
-
based 
compensation expenses. We changed our treatment this quarter to reflect
 
the Ninth Circuit opinion which resulted in a one
-
time income tax charge of 
$1.1 billion.
 
Net income was $2.6 billion or $0.91 per share. Absent the impact of the 
FTC accrual and the Altera ruling, our EPS would have been approximately 
$1.08 higher. Capit
al expenditures were $3.8 billion, driven by investments 
in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure. We 
generated $4.8 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with 
approximately $48.6 billion in cash and investments. In
 
Q2, we bought back 
approximately $1.1 billion of our Class A common stock.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We executed well in Q2 with a number 
of optimizations and product wins, particularly with the Facebook app that 
fell in our favor and 
helped combat the overall trend of deceleration. 
However, we continue to expect that our constant currency revenue growth 
rates will decelerate sequentially going forward. We also expect more 
pronounced deceleration in the fourth quarter and into 2020, par
tially driven 
by ad targeting related headwinds and uncertainties.
 
Turning now to the expense outlook. We anticipate full
-
year 2019 expenses 
to grow 53% to 61% compared to 2018. The $5 billion in accruals we 
recorded in the first half of 2019 related to th
e FTC settlement represents 
approximately 16 percentage points of this anticipated expense growth. 
Absent the $2B accrual, we recorded in Q2; our 2019 expense outlook is 
essentially unchanged from last quarter.
 
I want to reiterate that our agreement with t
he FTC involves implementing a 
comprehensive expansion of our privacy program, including substantial 

requirements and reporting obligations, and a process to regularly certify 
our complian
ce with the privacy program. These efforts will require 
significant investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical 
infrastructure. In addition, these efforts will make some of our existing 
product development processes more difficult, time
-
c
onsuming, and costly.
 
We are lowering our 2019 capital expenditures outlook to $16 billion to $18 
billion, down from our prior estimate of $17 billion to $19 billion. Our capital 
expenditures are driven primarily by our continued investment in data 
centers
 
and servers. We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of 
2019 to be approximately 16%.
 

the further growth of our community and business while we continue to 
make significant
 
investments in privacy, safety and security.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian 
Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Th
anks for taking my question. I have two, the first one on the core 
Facebook app. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about the 
impact on engagement as well as monetization from the redesign. Dave, I 
think you mentioned some optimization 
and product win. So, what are you 
seeing on the core app, I guess, now a big weight on engagement and 
monetization. And then can you talk to us a little bit more about some of the 
ad targeting headwinds that you foresee in 4Q and in 2020? Thanks.
 
Dave Wehn
er
 



continuing to see solid performanc


think the first half has been solid from that perspective.
 
And then the second question was on the ad targeting related headwinds. 
So, we think
 
of those in really three components. The first is regulatory as 
you think about things like GDPR and other impacts and how those will be 
rolling out globally. The second is platform changes as it relates to operating 
systems and a more of a focus on priva
cy from the operating systems and 
the impact that that can have on measurements and also on targeting. And 
then the third is our own product changes as we put privacy more front and 

cre
ating headwinds that we think are going to impact us, as we get later in 
the year and into 2020.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe on a bigger, broader topic 
for every
one on video, how do you see video evolving as a consumption 
mechanism on all of your platforms and in terms of how users consume 

investing in video content. How should we think abou
t the investments going 
forward and how that might impact growth versus margins? And then third, 
the opportunities on the advertising side that video might present over the 
next three to five years? Thanks guys.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So, I think video has been p


of videos buffered on your phone. And now, you think about what people can 
do. They can consume video very easily on a phone
. They can share video, 


 


video is within a bunch of our products. So, we certainly have video in feed 
a
nd people can put video into stories and different places. And we also have 

 
I think to the second part of your question, which is how do we think about 
video content. Most of the content, p
eople put up on Facebook video or 
other is user
-

made some investments there in creating a more dedicated place to watch 
video. So, while a lot of the content is still provided by people in a 
way that 

that really starts the flywheel growing 

 


hits from Tom and Time t
o Tom and Time to Red Table Talk ,sorry for your 

shows. And the best of them actually carry over into the Facebook 
community, because the best of the people creating those shows and 
starri
ng in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the 
vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty 
social way.
 

obviously a firm asse
t marketers have long loved. I think one of the 

ads and put them on video 

 


est TV ad is 30 
seconds, it builds slowly to a story, the product reveal is usually at the very 
end, the best mobile first ad or ad
-
on Facebook kind of gets to the main 
point or gets to the product in the first three seconds, captures your 
attention much m
ore quickly. We sometimes talk about it as some stopping 
creative, where you actually want to stop and watch. I think the good news 
we have here is that mobile first video on Facebook right now is now over 
50% of video revenue.
 
So that shows real growth pe
ople understanding they need to do it 


video ads in Facebook and Instagram News Feed and Stories to launch 
a 
limited edition called the Big Mac range in the UK. They had a 16.5% lift in 

on Facebook versus TV. So, I think that shows that when video is done well, 
it can have a really big imp
act on companies large and small on our 
platform.

Your next questi
on comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hey, guys, can we just go back to the deceleration comment. So, we 
appreciate the color you just gave, Dave. But at the same time, you said 
that the impression growth in 2Q was driven by 
Instagram Stories, 
Instagram Feed and then Facebook Feed. And so if those are kind of the 

what specifically do you see is slowing down in 4Q in 2020? Is that core 
Facebook, any a
dditional color on like the surface that might slow down from 
some of these changes? Thanks a lot.
 
Dave Wehner
 


seei
ng good impression growth across all of those. We are seeing faster 
growth in impressions coming from Stories and then also coming from 
geographies that monetize at lower rates on things like Facebook News 



that growth was driven in the prior year.
 

into the remainder of 2019. When we get int

to how we had good product wins in Q2. We also had several product 
optimizations in Q4 that contributed a strong performance that quarter. So, 

think we
 
expect the revenue deceleration trend that Q2 is not mark a 
reversal of that, but we expect to kind of return to constant currency 
revenue growth deceleration as you get into the remainder of 2019.

Thanks for taking the question. One for Mark and one for Dave. First Mark, 

Libra? Because it changed your view of the timeframe at all in terms of 
rolling out
 
the currency. And then second, Dave just, you talked about the 
higher demands of privacy. Can you just talk about how that could impact 

about more moderate expense growth for next ye
ar? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So, on Libra and similar to our approach on some of the important 
social issues that we face around encryption and content regulation and 
things like that. We get that these are really important and sensitive spaces. 
So, o
ur approach has been to try to have a very open dialog about this, 
right. If Facebook from a few years ago would have probably just showed up 
and tried to release a product on our own. And now, the approach on all of 
these fronts is to outline the ideas in
 
the values that we think an eventual 
service should have.
 

different experts and constituents questions about this and then figure out 


planning to do with Libra. So, we worked with the 27 other members of the 
association to publish the white paper to put the idea out there expecting 
that this is a very important and heavily regulated area and there were 
going to be 


a safe and stable and well
-


t here.
 
Dave Wehner
 
And then Doug, you were asking about the impacts on expense growth. 

privacy efforts do require significant investments obviously and compliance 
processes, peop
le and then technical infrastructure and those are factored 


have an impact on our overall product develo


business, not purely just the expense side.

Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
Thanks. Two if I can.
 
First, can you just talk to us about early learnings from 
the test of Instagram checkout and what some of the key hurdles are to kind 
of scaling that more broadly? And then secondly, on OpEx, it looked like you 
saw a fairly meaningful step up from Q1 to Q
2 despite fairly limited head 

there that might explain why those are diverging a little bit in that quarter?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

 
on this call about 
early stage things, this is earlier than that. We are in a very small closed 
beta with 23 brands, which for Facebook is about small as something could 
be. On 

 
obviously, as I said, small, but there is working with the brands, 



make sure we really get this right. I think the way to think about checkout is 

e trying to do in terms of commerce 
and shopping on our services and apps across the board, which is, we 

great. We obviously have felt some good and robust ad tools that are 
helping us 
grow our business quarter
-
after
-
quarter. If we can help people 
close the loop a little more, so they are looking more directly products, that 
makes our ads more valuable. If we can help people check out and pay for 
the products and even buy the products, i
t makes the consumer experience 


across the board. All of them are in their early stages and we think about
 
this primarily from a consumer and closing the loop point of view more than 
a monetization in and of itself point of view.
 
Dave Wehner
 
And then Lloyd, you were asking about the step
-
up on the cost side in Q2 

 
the cost of revenue was up 

-


to flow through in the cost profile of the business. And then if you look at 
the 
G&A line, obviously that was impacted by the accrual for the FTC settlement 
as well as some other legal expenses including the SEC settlement. So, you 
had some G&A expenses that were higher in the quarter as a result of that.
 
Operator
 
Your next questio
n comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great, thank you so much. I wanted to follow up on two comments, one 

wondering if you could share what the feedback has
 
been so far from the 
brands that are in the closed beta and how this has helped maybe some 
stats if they have them like how it helped maybe conversion for the brands 
that are doing it versus maybe the traditional way they were selling on 
Instagram.
 
So, if
 
you have anything you could share there and then Dave, just back to 



-
single digi
t or low
-
single digit decel. Just wondering 
if there is any other color you could provide us here for the back half in 2020 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

 
early. We 
definitely hear that it decreases at friction in the shopping experience, but 

learnings. We are working with them on iterating the product experience for 
now.
 
Dave 
Wehner
 

that we would see constant currency revenue deceleration sequentially with 
that being more pronounced on a constant currency basis in Q4, again, due 
to the tougher comp for u
s in Q4 not giving specific quantitative guidance on 
that at this point.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 

going on in the regulatory environment and status with regulators. I guess 
good news on the FTC settlement, but the new investigation has been 
started. I guess wonder if you could
 
just give us high level to the extent you 
can. Is the company making progress with regulators both here and in 
Europe, and how you feel about that? And then, Dave, if you could talk 
about Europe since GDPR implementation. Has it really been a meaningful 
d
ifference in your ad revenue growth rates there versus other regions? 
Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So, I can talk about the regulatory picture overall. Over the last few 
years, we focused a lot on a number of major social issues everything from 
prevent
ing election interference to reducing harmful content to protecting 

think that there is work that we can do and that we certainly have a 
responsibility to really make sure that
 
we perform well on them. But at the 
end of the day, when our systems are mature, there are still going to be 
trade
-
offs between important values that we all have something, I mean, on 

te 
and things like that.
 

best that we can, but we think that having a more democratic process for 
setting with some of those norms are would be helpful. On privacy, there are 
really 
important questions about how you define what you want the system 

it portable for to enable competition and innovation and academic research 
and things like that.
 
So, we believe that
 
there needs to be a regulatory framework in place for 
each of the major issues that I just talked about. And my broader concern is 


ng to do our part to help 
advocate for a good regulatory framework in each area and they will come in 


 
there will be laws passed and 
others might be working with regulators and having some structural rules 
imposed
 
on us like with the FTC settlement; in other areas, it might be self
-


speech.
 
So this is important overa


I think, in a much stronger place in elections now. Our content systems are 

ach of those. But I 
think we are making progress. And as said this is a global problem, not just 
these are global problem, not just American one. So working with folks 
across Europe and the other continents as well is important too.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Hey Justin,
 

slowly than North America and APAC. That said, we had a strong quarter and 

Overall, we did see Europe had a reaccelerati
on of growth in Q2 versus Q1. 
And part of that is lapping the GDPR implementation. So, I think overall 

growing more a little more slowly than North America and APAC.

Your n
ext question comes from Mark May from Citi.
 
Mark May
 

rate of expense growth lately. And on the Q4 call, you said you expected in 
2020 the expense growth will be more in line with rev
enue growth. Just 
curious if that is something that you still feel comfortable with? And then 
secondly in terms of WhatsApp and WhatsApp status specifically, what are 
your plans as it relates to ads on WhatsApp status? Have you tested here or 
have any plan
s to test? Thank you.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Yes. Thanks, Mark. So in terms of, in terms of our overall expense outlook. 

down this year versus 2018. Even if you were to set aside the $5 billion FT
C 

investment priorities remain the same. In addition to the privacy investment 
priorities that we outlined today will continue to invest in key areas like core 
product infrastructure, i
nnovation, video and content and safety and security 

guidance on 2020.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

on the consumer exper
ience. But I will take a minute to talk about Stories 
ads in general, because I think eventually depending on our ability to use 


ght now. So we do have 
Stories ads available across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and I 
think one of the most important things we learned as we were doing it 
transition to mobile is if we made it easy for our advertisers to place the ads, 
make sure th
ey understood the measurement they were having and also 
make sure the ad format worked, businesses would move more quickly. 
Usually people move before businesses people move to mobile before 
businesses and we certainly saw the same with Stories. But I thin
k one of 

people move to Stories more quickly because of the lessons we learned.
 
So for example, automatic placements, what automatic placements do is 
they convert Feed ads into a St
ories format and deliver the ads wherever 

have gotten us to three million advertisers. So rather than across the three 
properties we have available Facebook, Instagram and Mes
senger. So rather 
than go to every advertiser both through our sales force and through our 
online tools where we sell and say we have a new format, you need to 
create the new format, you need to figure out the placement being able to 
just take what they ar
e already doing like Feed ads, converted into Stories 
and place at anywhere helps us move people into these formats.
 

benefit right now to being an early adopter, the pricing is 
very attractive. 
And so we think the mix shift to Stories is the big opportunity for us and 


the growth over
 
the long run, but we are as always very prudent and careful 
on the consumer experience.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.
 
Mark Mahaney
 

WhatsApp payments in beta i
n India, you launched that last year. Could you 
just talk about the 

 
if there are any particular factors that are causing a 
delay in that and maybe just takes a long time for a product like that to 
really gain traction, but is it consumer awareness of it 
is it regulatory push 
back is their technical hurdles and what does that tell you about the and 
maybe nothing, but what does that tell you about the ability to take that 
WhatsApp monetization or payments functionality embedded with WhatsApp 
and launched it
 

launch in other countries, but what are the lessons from India tell you about 
the pacing of that? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

had a 
license to roll it out as part of an initial test, the test went better than we 
even expected it would. I mean for a product that you would expect to need 
to be widely available to be useful, right, in order to 

 
for someone to know 
that they can sen
d money to someone else. Even a limited test the feedback 


also working beyond India, in a number of other
 
countries and hope to have 
this rolled out to a large percentage of the people who use WhatsApp within 

issues and should have more to talk about soon.

Your next question com
es from Michael Nathanson from Moffett Nathanson.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Thanks. I have two, one for Sheryl and Dave and one for Mark. So Sheryl 
and Dave, you noted the growth I guess in Europe this time in acceleration. 
And can you talk a bit about maybe the r
egional development of Stories and 
either the embracing the advertising community or the user community by 
region. And then, for Mark on the answer on currency arguably Crypto is 
going to take a long time to you to get approval or to build a product. Do 
yo
u see building a fiat currency wallet for Facebook and Instagram. I know 

-
crypto wallet 
develop if it takes a while for the other products to rollout meaning Crypto 
takes a while for approval. So doe
s non
-
crypto fiat currency become an 
opportunity for you?
 
Dave Wehner
 

would say Stories is today from an impression growth perspective really 
about Instagram Stories. So it map




 
well with Facebook and will map to the reasons where Facebook is stronger. 

and continue to drive impression growth and then we hope to continue to 
make progress on Facebook wher

base.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

payments with fiat currencies as well and making it so that when you pay in 

n Instagram Shopping or in 



 
certainly a big area for 
investment.
 
Overall these areas around commerce and payments, I think are one of the 
m
ost exciting areas of product development for the next several years. I 

map out and wire up their networks over the last several years, and now in 
each of these apps we have opportuni
ties to help people get more value 

social side, especially around creating communities and groups and some of 
it is going to be more on the economic and opportunity side and there
 

doing a whole lot of projects.
 
I know that Libra is the one that has gotten the most attention recently, but 

which is going to help people connect to brands and emerging cre
ators to 
Facebook marketplace, which is more consumer
-
to
-
consumer paying and 
buying and selling used goods to things like WhatsApp business, which is 
more about connecting with small businesses and then across the payment 
landscape, helping people do payme
nts and existing currencies and also 
trying some newer approaches that can hopefully bring down the cost of

on for the next several years.

Your next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.
 
Ben Schachter
 
Mark in 1Q, you mentioned specifically that GDPR had an impact on the 
business. I was just wondering if you can give an update on that? And 
then 
longer term on Facebook, you focused a few times now on buying and selling 
goods there. Just wondering if you can comment on how you think of 
services versus goods for example monetizing recommending a house 
painter versus selling a widget. And also c
an you talk about the timing of 
how marketplace might evolve? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

I can end.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Yes, Ben. So, just in terms of GDPR I kind of address that earlier, we 
do see 
that having an impact in Europe that we did see a reacceleration in growth in 

promising, but we continue to see Europe growing just a bit slower than the 
rest of the regions. Bu
t overall, not a whole lot of additional color to provide 
there.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. And in Marketplace, we definitely are going to focus on some of the 
areas that you talked about including jobs is already a pretty meaningful 
focus where a lot of people 
do find jobs and business is less jobs through 


business model around this is probably not going to be charg
ing for listings 

on Instagram with shopping and in Facebook Marketplace and in the general 
approach to payments is providing as affordably as possible to improve the 
user experien
ce and complete transactions which will of course make the 
tools more valuable for businesses overall and should make the ad prices go 

just handed me a piece of paper, which says that 
we have helped a million 
people find jobs. So there is the stat.

Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great, thanks. A couple from me. First off, any update on the higher profile 
for groups in the Facebook app 

engagements. And then Mark, the five
-
year timeline for the privacy focused 
vision. I guess, I wonder if we get a better sense for what the key 

-
year outlook perha
ps 
versus the shorter period? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, I could take both of those. So in the Facebook app overall after helping 
people connect with friends and family, helping people connected with 
communities is the next most important social probl
em that we believe we 

the product. That is going well since we started rolling that out after F8, I 

empha
size this point I think part of the 

 
our strong performance over the 
first half of this year, a meaningful part of our overperformance compared to 
what we had expected is because of strength and engagement in the 


 


one of the drivers of that. What was the second question?
 
Dave Wehner
 
The five

year.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

privacy vision. So for the next year to two a 
lot of the work that we need to do is just about getting the architecture 
right. Right so establishing, we have to rewrite the networks on Messenger

We want to make it so that the infrastructure that these services are built on

our playbook on this but this is a multiyear journey where first we deliver 
the consumer product experience, then we create organic business 
experiences and then only as the l
ast step, are we really able to ramp up

certainly see milestones every six months or 12 months. Bu

Your last question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.
 
Brent
 
Thill
 
Thanks, Dave. I think a lot of us are having a hard time reconcile that the 
tougher comp in Q4. It was your easiest comp and you just accelerated your 
constant currency growth in the quarter. So I guess, just, is there any 
change in terms of the vis

that lead you to that, any other color. I think there is a number of questions, 
just trying to understand why you have such strong conviction in that decel?
 
Dave Wehner
 
Hey, Brent. So in terms of the ou

revenue. We are constantly working from an auction perspective. So our 
forecasts are based on supply and demand and how we see the different 
product launches playing into that different optimizations that we make. 
So 


characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we 
expect constant currency decelera

to be lapping some particularly successful optimizations that we had in Q4

am.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone for joining us today.
 
This was a good quarter and a good s
tart to the year. We continue to grow 
the size and engagement of our community, now with 1.44 billion people 
using Facebook each month and 936 million people daily. We continue to see 
strong growth in daily engagement around the world, including in our mos
t 
engaged markets. On mobile, nearly 1.25 billion people now use Facebook 
every month, 240 million than a year ago, and we now see more than 1 
billion mobile searches every day.
 
Looking at our business, we continue to achieve impressive growth. Total 
reven
ue grew by 42% year
-
over
-
year, and advertising revenue grew by 
46%. Mobile now accounts for 73% of our ads revenue. These results show 
that we're making progress in our mission to connect the world and we're 
executing well against our priorities.
 
But this 
quarter also shows how Facebook is continuing to make progress for 
the years ahead. Facebook has evolved from a single blue app on your 
phone into a family of apps. Now, many of these apps are reaching a global 
scale. More than 1.4 billion people use the c
ore Facebook service, 800 
million also use WhatsApp, 700 million use our Groups product, 600 million 
use Messenger, and on Instagram, there are more than 300 million active 
members of the community. We're building this family of apps because we 
want people
 
to be able to share whatever moments they want with all the 
different sets of people they care about. Over time, we expect people to 
share richer content with an increasing frequency so we want to continue 
developing new and better tools to facilitate thi
s expression.
 
So with that in mind, let's talk about our efforts over the quarter. First, we're 
working to help people share and connect with all the things they care about 
today. An important part of our approach is helping our community to 
connect around
 
important public moments and personalities. Facebook is the 
largest community of sports fans in the world, with 650 million people 
connecting to sports pages. For this year's Super Bowl, more than 65 million 
people generated more than 265 million interact
ions on Facebook, the 
highest level of conversation we've seen for a Super Bowl to
-
date. For the 
Cricket World Cup, there were more than 700 million interactions by 53 
million people, which shows the strength of the global reach of our 
community.
 
We're als
o making good progress with video. We're very pleased with our 
growth here, and this quarter we reached a new milestone of more than 4 
billion daily videos views. We also launched an embedded video player that 
allows people to watch Facebook videos across 
the web, and more than 
80,000 videos have now been embedded on third
-
party websites. Spherical 
videos are going to be supported in News Feed later this year, allowing you 
to change your viewing angle for a more immersive experience. Supporting 
new types of
 
content like this is an important part of preparing for the future 
of how people want to share.
 
Now, another part of our strategy is helping people connect with businesses. 
This quarter, we announced that there are now 2 million advertisers on 
Facebook. T
his is an important milestone for our community, and we're 
encouraged that so many businesses are finding value on Facebook. We 
continue to focus on innovation in our ads business, and Sheryl is going to 
talk a bit more about that in a moment.
 
Now, here's 
how we're working to develop our family of apps so we can give 
people more options for sharing in different ways. In the future, we expect 
that people are going to want to share content with their closest friends at 
an even greater frequency than they do t
oday, so messaging is a big priority 
for us. Across the Facebook family of apps, our efforts have a lot of 
momentum. On average, more than 45 billion messages are sent every day. 
With voice calling, we're also starting to make some good progress. This 
quar
ter, we started rolling out Voice over IP calls on WhatsApp to let people 
call friends for free around the world. And meanwhile, Messenger already 
accounts for more than 10% of mobile VoIP calls globally.
 
With WhatsApp, we continue to be pleased with our g
rowth and the team 
remains very focused on building new features to serve their community and 
expand. For Messenger, this has been a particularly busy quarter. We 
launched the Messenger Platform, which allows people to use creative new 
apps to have richer 
conversations. We also began rolling out payments on 
Messenger to give people an easy, secure way to send money to their 
friends. And we announced a new way for people to communicate with 
businesses using Messenger. We're really excited by the potential to
 
build 
Messenger into a service that helps people to express themselves in rich new 
ways and to access useful services.
 
With Instagram, our growth remains impressive, and this quarter, we 
reached a new milestone of more than 200 million daily actives. Grow
th in 
Asia, Europe, and Latin America is particularly strong, with our community 
growing in some countries by more than 100% year
-
over
-
year, including 
Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia. Combined with an average 21 minutes a 
day that people spend on Instagr
am, this is a good sign of this community's 
continuing and growing strength.
 
Now, let's talk about how we're working with developers. Last month, we 
held F8, our annual event for the global developer community. Creating the 
future of sharing isn't somethin
g that we can do on our own, but by 
supporting developers, we can deliver more apps and experiences for our 
community. At F8, we presented new tools to help developers build, grow, 
and monetize their apps, including better sharing experiences from apps to 
Facebook and new analytics to help developers better understand how 
people are using their services. More than 30 million apps and sites have 
been built using Facebook developer tools, and last year we drove more than 
3.5 billion app installs. We think the
se improvements are going to create a 
lot of value for our community.
 
All right. Finally, let's talk about some of our most long
-
term innovation 
efforts. Internet.org, our effort to connect everyone in the world to the 
Internet, continues to gather momentu
m. We've now made free basic 
Internet services available to more than 800 million people in nine countries, 
including just in this quarter, launching in India, Colombia, Ghana, 
Guatemala, and the Philippines. More than seven million people who weren't 
conn
ected to the Internet before now use internet.org to get online. And this 
year, we expect to connect even more people.
 
With our efforts in search, AI and Oculus, we're also continuing to build a 
new generation of Internet services that are more useful, int
uitive, and 
immersive. And over the coming months, we'll have more to share about 
these.
 
So that's how we're thinking about innovation and the future of sharing. It's 
been a busy quarter. In the last few months, I've visited countries in Asia, 
Europe, and 
Latin America. In many communities, I've gotten the chance to 
see how the Internet is changing lives and creating opportunities for people. 
I've heard from people who can't wait to get access to the same tools that 
so many of us take for granted. We're mak
ing progress on our mission and 
working to accelerate towards the day when everyone in the world can be 
connected. Thanks to our entire community and all of our employees, 
partners, and shareholders for being a part of this journey and for helping to 
build
 
something great.
 
Now, here's Sheryl.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter and a great start 
to the year. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46% or 55% on a constant 
currency basis. Mo
bile ad revenue grew 82% and is now 73% of total ad 
revenue. Our performance was strong across all marketer segments and 
we're pleased with the broad
-
based growth across our industry verticals. 
From a regional perspective, we saw strong growth in North Ame
rica and 
Asia
-
Pacific, while Latin America and Europe were affected by foreign 
exchange headwinds and macroeconomic factors. That said, we're pleased 
with advertiser adoption of our ad products across all regions.
 
Innovation drives our ads business. It's h
ow we continually improve the 
quality of our ads, offer new tools to marketers, and build better experiences 
for the people who use Facebook. We believe that this ability to innovate will 
continue to drive our business. So today I want to focus on innovati
on 
across our three strategic priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile, 
growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our 
ads more relevant.
 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Mobile continues to be a great 
opportunity for us. People continue to be highly engaged with our mobile 
apps. In the United States, for example, Facebook and Instagram get more 
than one out of every five minutes spent on mobile. As consumers shift to 
mobile, businesses are following, an
d we're focusing on helping them take 
advantage of this opportunity to use mobile to build their businesses.
 
Two new products we introduced this quarter are good examples of this. The 
Mobile Ads Manager app gives marketers the ability to manage their ad 
ca
mpaigns from their mobile devices. It's early, but we're already seeing 
more marketers managing their activity on mobile. We also launched a page 
creation tool for feature phones, which has been a big driver of page 
adoption in high
-
growth emerging markets
 
where smartphones are less 
common.
 
Looking ahead, we believe video will play a significant role in bringing more 
marketers to mobile. More than 75% of global video views on Facebook 
occur on mobile, and we believe mobile video will become more important t
o 
marketers over time. Lionsgate's Age of Adaline premiere is a great 
example. To promote the film, Lionsgate targeted young women on 
Instagram with multiple video ads over the last few weeks. This week, since 
the film opens on Friday, they are retargeting
 
the audience from the 
Instagram campaign on Facebook. We expect more marketers to put mobile 
video at the heart of their campaigns in the future and we're well
-
positioned 
to drive this shift.
 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using ou
r ad 
products and we're making great progress. In Q2 of last year, we shared 
that we reached 30 million active business Pages on Facebook. This number 
continues to grow as more and more small businesses are using our Free 
Pages product, and we remain focus
ed on converting these Page owners into 
advertisers. One way we're doing this is by providing simple, easy to use 
products. Over 80% of our new advertisers start with entry level tools like a 
promoted post or a Page like. We are increasingly focused on mak
ing sure 
these tools work well on mobile. We're also educating marketers on how to 
use Facebook more effectively. We recently launched two online training 
resources: Blueprint for large clients and agencies, and Learn How videos for 
small businesses. These
 
efforts are paying off. In Q1, we announced that we 
now have over 2 million active advertisers.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant. More relevant ads lead to 
better returns for marketers and better experiences for people. We're 
pleased wit
h the increased adoption of our targeting tools like Custom 
Audiences and Conversion Tracking. In Q1, we introduced Dynamic Product 
Ads, which allow marketers to launch ads for different audiences. We also 
introduced carousel ads on Facebook and Instagram,
 
which allow marketers 
to advertise for specific products. Adoption of our targeting tools and these 
new ad formats help make our ads more relevant.
 
We're also focused on insights and measurement. We want to help 
marketers accurately measure the performanc
e of their campaigns and then 
apply that learning to improve their returns. In Q1, we released an ad 
relevance score, a way for marketers to better understand how people 
respond to their ads. This helps marketers test different types of creative 
and optimi
ze performance. We also launched Conversion Lift, a tool that 
scientifically measures how much additional business was driven from 
Facebook ads. This is important because it shows that ads on mobile can 
drive sales in retail stores and via other channels.
 
For example, Cellbes is a women's fashion retailer in Europe. Using 
Conversion Lift, they proved that ads on Facebook mobile drove sales on 
desktop and via phone calls to sales reps at their call centers.
 
On the ad tech side, we're pleased with the results
 
we're driving for 
advertisers and publishers. A good example of this is Cheetah Mobile. Using 
native ads from the Audience Network in its apps, the company is getting 
more than two
-
times the CPMs compared to other ad networks. We continue 
to invest in our
 
ad tech platform. At our F8 Developer Conference last 
month, we made new two important LiveRail announcements that will 
improve the relevance of ads people see across sites, apps, and devices. We 
extended LiveRail's video ad platform into in
-
app mobile di
splay, which will 
give publishers better ways to manage their ad inventory across devices. We 
also announced that LiveRail will give publishers access to Facebook's 
anonymized demographic information, enabling us to serve more relevant 
ads to people.
 
We've
 
had a great start to the year and we're really optimistic about what's 
to come. Our teams are executing well, staying focused on our big priorities 
and continuing to innovate.
 
Now, here's Dave.
 
David M. Wehner

Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and
 
good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for 
Facebook. We generated $3.5 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in free cash 
flow and continued making investments to position us for both near
-
term 
and long
-
term growth. We are pleased with the growth
 
and engagement of 
our community. In March, 936 million people used Facebook on an average 
day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number 
represents 65% of the 1.44 billion people who used Facebook during the 
month of March.
 
Mobile remain
s the key driver of our growth. In March, approximately 1.25 
billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 24% from last year. 
In addition to Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp continue to 
grow, exceeding 300 million, 600 million, and 80
0 million MAU, respectively.
 
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, as a reminder, our non
-
GAAP 
measures exclude stock
-
based compensation and the amortization of 
intangibles
.
 
Total revenue was $3.5 billion, up 42% or 49% on a constant currency 
basis. Ad revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46% or 55% on a constant currency 
basis. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the past year had an 
unfavorable impact on our revenue. H
ad foreign exchange rates remained 
constant with Q1 2014 levels, our total revenue this quarter would have 
been approximately $190 million higher.
 
Regionally, we saw strong North American ad revenue growth of 53% in the 
quarter, second only to APAC, which 
grew 57%. Europe and the rest of world 
revenue grew more slowly at 35% and 32%, respectively, with currency 
impacts leading to a significant reduction in these regions' year
-
over
-
year 
growth rates.
 
Mobile ad revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, up from approxim
ately $1.3 billion 
last year. Revenue from ads served on personal computers was down 
approximately 4% and we continue to see overall usage on PCs decline. In 
Q1, the average price per ad increased 285% while total ad impressions 
declined 62%. Similar to la
st quarter, these price volume trends were 
primarily driven by the redesign of our right
-
hand column ads, which rolled 
out in the third quarter of last year. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage 
towards mobile, where we don't have right
-
hand column ads, 
also 
contributed to the reported price volume trends.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was $226 million, down 5% 
compared to last year, a trend we expect to continue. The decline was 
driven by the year
-
over
-
year reduction in payments revenue related t
o 
games played on personal computers.
 
Turning now to expenses. Our Q1 total GAAP expenses were $2.6 billion, up 
83%, and non
-
GAAP expenses were $1.7 billion, up 57%. Similar to last 
quarter, stock
-
based compensation and amortization expenses related to the
 
WhatsApp acquisition contributed significantly to the year
-
over
-
year growth 
in GAAP expenses. Non
-
GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by 
increases in head count
-
related costs, cost of revenue, and marketing 
expenses. We ended Q1 with 10,082 employees
, up 48% compared to last 
year. We remain very pleased with our ability to attract and retain top
-
tier 
talent.
 
Q1 operating income was $933 million, representing a 26% operating 
margin. Non
-
GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion, representing a 52% 
margin.
 
Our Q1 GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates were 45% and 35%, 
respectively. Q1 GAAP net income was $512 million or $0.18 per share, and 
non
-
GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $0.42 per share. In Q1, capital 
expenditures were $502 million and we generated $1.2 bil
lion of free cash 
flow. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion in cash and investments.
 
Turning now to the outlook. Let's start with revenue. The strengthening of 
the U.S. dollar in the past year reduced our Q1 total revenue growth rate by 
7 percentage po
ints, or approximately $190 million. The dollar strengthened 
over the course of the quarter and, in the month of March, our year
-
over
-
year total revenue growth rate was approximately 10% lower than it would 
have been in constant currency terms. Based on th
is, we estimate that 
foreign exchange headwinds in Q2 will likely be greater than those we 
experienced in Q1. In addition, we expect our total payments and other fees 
revenue to decline on a year
-
over
-
year basis for the remainder of the year.
 
Turning to ex
pense guidance. We are tightening our expense guidance range 
modestly based on better visibility into our annual spending. We expect that 
the year
-
over
-
year growth rate for total 2015 GAAP expenses will be in the 
range of 55% to 65%, as compared to our pri
or guidance of 55% to 70%. 
We expect that the year
-
over
-
year growth rate for total 2015 non
-
GAAP 
expenses will be in the range of 50% to 60% as compared to our prior 
guidance of 50% to 65%.
 
Our expense outlook reflects the broad range of investments that w
e're 
making in both our services and infrastructure as we continue to enhance 
the core experiences on Facebook and Instagram, grow our messaging 
products, strengthen our advertising business globally and invest in long
-
term growth areas like Oculus and int
ernet.org. The remainder of our 
guidance remains unchanged. We anticipate our 2015 capital expenditures 
will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion. We expect stock
-
based compensation in 2015 to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.3 billion
, 
approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably 
WhatsApp.
 
We expect amortization expenses in 2015 to be approximately $700 million 
to $800 million. And lastly, we anticipate our Q2 and full
-
year 2015 GAAP

Thank you. We'll now open the lines for a question

answer session. Your 
first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan 
Stanley. Your 
line is open.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, I guess, can you 
talk a little about early advertiser and publisher feedback from the LiveRail 
in
-
app mobile product and what are
 
some areas where you see potential for 
improvements to drive faster adoption? And then on the OpEx side, I 
appreciate you're tightening the range. Can you help us at all on 
expectations for head count growth this year and what are the biggest areas 
you se
e investing in incremental employees this year?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
So, on LiveRail, we're pleased with the performance and the changes we've 
been able to make. Video is obviously super important so having the ability 
to
 
do 

 
work on video across the web has been really great. And then at F8 
we made two more announcements that I mentioned. What we're hearing 
from publishers is that this is a good opportunity and they're pleased with 
the extensions we're making because it 
can make their ad serving and 
buying more efficient across the platforms they use.
 
In terms of areas for improvement, I think there's a lot we can do. I think 
have you to look at our ad tech investments very holistically from Atlas to 
LiveRail to the Audie
nce Network. These are all different pieces of the ad 
tech but what they're all working on is taking the relevance and the ability to 
do people
-
based marketing and make that available to work on Facebook 
but also off Facebook. We believe that because we ca
n do marketing to 
people and then measure results across what people do in privacy
-
protective 
ways, we have an ability to improve the relevance of marketing which will 
make it better for consumers and increase returns for marketers.
 
David M. Wehner

Chief
 
Financial Officer
 
And Brian, it's Dave. Just on the OpEx question, I think the key is that we're 
investing in our near, mid
-
term, and long
-
term priorities, so in the near
-
term we're investing to grow the community, execute on the existing 
business, both o
n the product side and then the advertising and sales force 
side. And in the mid
-
term, we're building out those next
-
generation of 
services to be great businesses that reach their full potential, so that's 
Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger. And then in the lo
ng
-
term, we're 
investing in areas like the next
-
generation computing platform, internet.org, 
AI.
 
In general, I would say our head count growth has skewed towards the R&D 
side because a lot of these initiatives have long
-
term development needs. So 
we've bee
n investing there. But we are investing across the board. In terms 
of a specific head count guidance, I would just stick with our expense 
guidance. But I'd note that the 48% year
-
over
-
year does include some 
inorganic growth from the pickup of the three lar
ger acquisitions, Oculus, 
LiveRail, and WhatsApp. We haven't lapped those at this point.

Your next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is 
open.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. One fo
r Sheryl and one more Mark. Sheryl, I 
just wanted to ask you to talk a little bit more about big brands, give us a 
sense for what's working best in terms of products? And then also how 
penetrated do you think Facebook is now with some of the larger brands?
 
And, Mark, what are the signals that you'll be looking for to tell you when it's 
the right time to ramp
-
up the advertising on Instagram more? Thanks.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Our growth was really strong across all of our ma
rketer segments, but we 
had a particularly good quarter in brands, I think driven by two things. The 
first is that we really have a great platform to do creative storytelling on 
mobile and I think we have that in a way that no one else does. Our mobile 
ad 
product is so integrated into the user experience and provides real 
creative flexibility that people have a way to reach people on mobile and 
that's becoming increasingly important in telling the stories that drive their 
business.
 
The second thing is video
. Video is exploding on Facebook, as Mark talked 
about, and that gives us an opportunity to do a lot of work with marketers 
on video. This is the first time the technology and media vertical was one of 
our top four verticals. And that's largely because of 
the use of mobile. And 
so that's been really a great story for us.
 
In terms of penetration, we work with almost all the large marketers almost 
everywhere in the world. But even for the largest, the largest clients we 
have, we are a very small part of their
 
budget. I don't think we have any 
large clients, if you look at 25% in the U.S. of consumer media time is on 
mobile and then 20% of mobile time goes to Facebook and Instagram that 
would be 5% of U.S. consumer media time.
 
With our largest clients, even our
 
large ones, we're not close to 5% of their 
spend. And so I think we have a considerable opportunity to grow, and we 
also expect those underlying numbers time on mobile to continue to grow.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. 
Your second question about Instagram and the ads opportunity there, 
we think about this the same way that we do ads in Facebook today. The 
primary goal is to increase the quality. That's our strategy for growing the 
business. There's more inventory that we
 
can open up on Instagram over 
time because it's so early, but we're going to do that once we get to formats 
that are working well for businesses and that we feel really good about in 
the consumer experience.
 
And this has been a theme for our ad strategy a
nd product development for 
more than a year now, maybe two years, where folks have consistently 
asked us what we're going to do to increase the amount of ads that we're 
showing. And our response has been that we're going to focus on improving 
the quality a
nd relevance and that's both going to perform better for the 
people using our services and businesses who are buying ads. And that 
strategy, I think, is bearing out and we'll continue to apply it to all of the 
things that we do.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

One clarification, I think I said tech and media as a vertical, I meant 
entertainment and media that this is the first quarter that entertainment and 
media is one of our top verticals.

Your next question is from Heathe
r Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is 
open.
 
Heather Anne Bellini

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thank you. I just had two quick ones. I was wondering, Mark, I think 
you mentioned you're seeing 1 billion searches per day on mobile. I was 
wondering if you c
ould give us an update on your initiatives here. And also 
when you think about Facebook kind of as a microcosm of different 
applications, at some point is there a plan that we will be able to search 

 
use the search functionality to go across all the diffe
rent Facebook apps that 
we might have installed on our mobile devices?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So we're pretty early in this whole thing and there's so much unique content 
that people share in Facebook that I think 
that that is the clear, unique 
opportunity to go for first, right? I mean there's 

 
if you think about the 
overall web, there's a lot of public content that's out there that any web 
search engine can go index and provide. But a lot of what we can get at ar
e 
recommendations on products and travel and restaurants and things that 
your friends have shared, they haven't shared publicly, and knowing 
different correlations, or interesting things about what your friends are 
interested in, and that's the type of stu
ff, those are questions that we can 
answer that no one else can answer, and that's probably going to be what 
we continue to focus on doing first. And I think what you're seeing is that as 
we enable more use cases and as we just get a lot of the basics righ
t around 
performance and bringing the mobile features into parity and beyond what 
we've been able to do on desktop, the volume is growing quickly.
 
I think on a recent earnings call we just announced that we passed 1 billion 
searches total so now being more
 
than 1 billion on mobile shows some 
progress that I'm pretty proud of for the search team.

Your next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
 
Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one for 
Mark and one more Sheryl. 
Mark, you talked about the family of apps at Facebook. As more and more 
people are consuming professional content, different verticals like news, 
sports, and video format on Facebook, how do you think about the use case 
for the co
nsumption of that content inside the main Facebook app versus 
maybe an even separate app for more professional content long
-
term for 
Facebook?
 
And then for Sheryl, appreciate the color you gave us on the evolution of 
targeting on Facebook. Wanted to know e
ither qualitatively or quantitatively 
if you could talk a little bit about the way those ads are performing as you 
continue to evolve the product set around targeting on Facebook and off, in 
particular around Dynamic Product Ads and what that might mean fo
r 
closing the loop longer term. Thanks so much, guys.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah. So in terms of news and different kinds of content, I know this has 
traditionally been something that we've delivered a really good expe
rience 
for in terms of people being able to share the content that they want, being 
able to get access to the content that they want, different recommendations 
from friends, and we've a lot more coming there, so I'm excited about that. 
And we definitely do
 
see in this family of app strategy that there's so many 
new ways that people want to share content, and so many different types of 
sets of people that people want to share with, right, ranging from one 
person at a time and that would be messaging or small
 
group sharing or 
sharing with interest
-
based communities or sharing with all your friends at 
once or sharing with public.
 
There are just a lot of different experience that needs to get built. And a lot 
of what we're trying to do is enable a number of thos
e things through 
Facebook, while also building unique world
-
class services to enable people to 
share all the things they care about with all the different sets of people that 
they care about. So we're going to keep on doing more there. But we're 
happy with
 
where we are now. We have a number of services that are 
reaching pretty good scale and I think we'll keep on pushing that.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
To your question on targeting and closing the loop, these are two really 
imp
ortant pieces for what we want to do. Our goal when we work with 
marketers is to drive their business, and that means their products off the 
shelves, their services into the hands of people, and so in order to do that 
well, we need to work on targeting and
 
we need to work on measurement. 
So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better, it's better experience for 
consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it 
has a higher return for marketers.
 
And so we're very focused on getti
ng more people to use our targeting tools 
from Custom Audiences which lets people target ads differently to their 
current customers or people who they'd like to be their customers to look 
like audiences which enables us to identify the kind of characterist
ics of your 
current customers and then find other people on Facebook who share those 
characteristics so, again, the ad is well targeted. I think our targeting 
abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. XFINITY 
put out a voice gui
de for visual disabilities, and they did this, they did this by 
doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind imagining what Wizard of 
Oz characters looked like.
 
Now by doing that at the Oscars, that's obviously TV and it's a very broad ad 
and that's 
because they were both showing a product but also working on 
their brand. On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, 
Wizard of Oz fans and also people connected to accessibility causes. That's 
actually pretty specific targeting that lets t
hem hit exactly the right audience 
and amplify what they were doing on TV, and I think that's the kind of thing 
that only we can do at scale, and it shows how important targeting is.
 
When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the 
measur
ement piece because if we can connect, people seeing ads on 
Facebook to what they buy, in stores or in other ways, that's how you close 
the loop and that's why we put so much investment and hopefully so much 
innovation behind measurement. So conversion tra
cking is increasingly 
used, and we work with our marketers to use it even more, and we're also 
really excited about conversion list because that's the first product we've 
had which scientifically measures the additional business you get from 
Facebook ads. 
It compares test groups that see ads with control groups that 
don't. So whatever you're measuring in terms of conversions whether it's 
sales or website clicks or registrations, we can A, B test and see exactly 
what the impact Facebook has. I think we're st
ill at the beginning of this. I 
think there is so much more we can do to make ads more relevant on 
Facebook and so much more we can do to measure results, and I think our 
future growth will depend on executing on that very well.

Your next question
 
is from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is

Youssef H. Squali

Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
 
Thank you very much. A question for Dave and then maybe one for Mark or 
Sheryl. FX adjusted ARPU growth this past quarter, it was about 35%,
 
which 
is by our math about half of what it was last year and within mobile, it was 
about 45%, that's about a third of what it was last year. Other than tough 
comps, what else is driving that decline? Is it just Q1 seasonality getting 
more pronounced? Is t
here anything else 

 
we would have thought maybe 
video advertising would have had actually the opposite effect. And then 
what's your 

 
maybe Mark or Sheryl, what's your experience so far with 
Voice over IP? What is the strategy, I guess, over time? Is that
 
something 
that you can start charging for or either through maybe a subscription or is 
there another way of monetizing it? Thanks, guys.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Youssef, it's Dave. So on the FX adjusted ARPU growth, I would just really 
p
oint to the overall revenue growth rate, that's what's driving it. So you're 
coming up against a bigger business last year than we had in the past. So 
you're seeing declining rate on that basis. So I don't think there's anything 
specific to ARPU, it's just
 
a reflection of what we're seeing on the revenue 
front as we scale, and it's sort of as expected there.
 
So we're really pleased with the performance that we're seeing on the 
revenue front, certainly on the FX adjusted basis. We're seeing strong 
growth in 
the face of really a tough currency environment. So we're really 
pleased with that. We think we've got the best mobile ad product out there 
in the market and it's just getting better. So we're really pleased with what 
we're doing on the revenue front.
 
Mark
 
Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Yeah, and in terms of voice calling, no, we're not going to charge for it just 
like we're not going to charge for messaging. What we're focused on doing is 
providing more higher quality services for f
ree than what you could 
otherwise get in paying for them. And one thing that you may not know 
about voice calling is that by using the Internet for calling rather than the 
relatively low bit rate voice networks, you can actually get higher quality 
calls us
ing VoIP. So one of our theories in this is that it's one of the reasons 
why voice calling has been a little slower to catch on is because you need 
the large established network of people who you know will have access to be 
able to receive a voice call bef
ore it, before that behavior can really take on 
in a big global community.
 
But now between Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are two very 
broad communication networks, we're pretty confident that because of the 
higher quality of calling that you can g
et through the services that we're 
providing that this is going to continue growing very quickly. I mean, a lot of 
people still 

 
we're just very early in rolling out and promoting it. Even in 
Facebook Messenger, it's been out for a little while and we're 
already more 
than 10% of the global VoIP market. And I think that that's just going to 
continue growing and I'm really looking forward to getting the first stats on 
WhatsApp VoIP as well soon.

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Thanks. One question for Mark, one for Sheryl. Mark, there's just this 
explosion in these messaging platforms worldwide you obviously bought into 
one. The growth has been 
greater than we would have expected, and 
perhaps you too. Do you 

 
have you 

 
has your thinking changed on the 
opportunity or maybe the need but really the opportunity to integrate 
WhatsApp and Facebook over the next couple of years because of the 
growth o
f WhatsApp to
-
date? And then Sheryl, you mentioned some 
verticals that are doing well. I was just wondering if I could ask about 
automotive and insurance, just a couple of verticals that have always been 
skewed very heavily towards TV advertising and the q
uestion is whether 
they've really skewed up more now on Facebook given the auto play video 
ad format. Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I mean, on the messaging question, yeah, we're pretty happy with how it's 
all going
. I think if we're going to pay $19 billion for a company, we should 
have pretty high expectations for how it's going to do. So I do feel good 
about how we're doing, but it needs to do a lot more obviously and we're 
very excited about the roadmap of things
 
that we have ahead. In terms of 
integrating them, no, we're not going to do that. One of the things that had 
been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was 
just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication servic
es 
were growing at the same time, and it seemed a little bit counter
-
intuitive at 
first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it 
actually, now in retrospect looking back, seems like there is.
 
So you can look at countries where bot
h services, WhatsApp and Messenger, 
are growing very quickly like Brazil, for example. And what you'll see is that 
basically people use them a little bit differently. I mean, WhatsApp is more 
of a clear text messaging replacement. Facebook Messenger people
 
use to 
connect with people that they know on Facebook primarily. And then there 
are differences in the feature sets where WhatsApp is extremely utilitarian 
and focused on texting and now voice calling, whereas Messenger is very 
focused on expression and t
he whole set of things that fit into the tools 
around the Messenger platform that we rolled out at F8, communicating with 
businesses now, richer tools to communicate in different ways. So I think 
that these are just going to keep on growing is my expectati
on and hope, 
and we're excited to kind of pursue both different products to serve the 
different communities.

On the auto and insurance verticals, they're both still small which makes

on Facebook and Instagram, so we're optimistic about that.

Great. Thanks. Two questions. One for Mark and one for Dave. I guess, 
Mark, just going back to the video question again real quick. I'm wondering, 
given all the noise around over
-
the
-
top and long form content
 
and given 
your push in video, I'm just sort of curious as to whether or not you think 
Facebook can or should be a player in more studio content, professionally
-
driven content. And then Dave, I guess for you, just in terms of CapEx, you 
gave guidance for t
his year, but again, given sort of the ramp
-
up in video in 
search, how should we think about CapEx longer term relative to, either in 
absolute terms, or maybe relative to revenue growth? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner

I can go first. So 
on the CapEx growth for this year, Paul, yeah, we are 
ramping CapEx, obviously, to support the initiatives that we have. 2015 is a 
big investment year for us, both in CapEx and OpEx. It's a little bit early to 
be talking about how that's going to scale goi
ng forward. But, clearly, we've 
got a lot of areas that we're investing in, including video, including the 
various other services on top of Facebook. So, we're going to be investing to 
deliver the best quality services that we can for our users, so we'll c
ontinue 
to invest heavily on the datacenter and infrastructure side going forward.

Your n
ext question is from John Blackledge with Cowen & Co. Your line is

John R Blackledge

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thanks. Two questions. One more on video. So with the explosive 
ramp in video views over the last six months, could you discuss the video 
ad
vertising ramp this year? And then maybe talk about the video versus 
static ads within the News Feed. And then the other question would be, you 
reference Facebook hitting 2 million active advertisers in the first quarter, 
and with over 30 million company p
ages, how should we think about the 
advertiser TAM for Facebook next year and over time? Thank you.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
So, to the first question, video is a big opportunity for us. Mark talked about 
how we have 4 billio
n video views on Facebook everyday and we've always 
believed that the format of our ads should follow the format of what 
consumers are doing on Facebook. So many years ago when the homepage 
ticker was in vogue, we never did that. And so the fact that there
's so much 
consumer video, that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video 
as well. It's still early days and we're very focused on quality and it's worth 
noting that not all of the revenue from video is incremental, because the 
video ads take the
 
place of other ads that we would have served into News 
Feed. That said, we're really excited about the opportunity I talked about, 
increasing the entertainment and media vertical and brand marketers, 
particularly. But I think all marketers have the opport
unity to do video, and 
that's pretty exciting, including SMBs who would never be able to hire a film 
crew and buy a TV ad. We're seeing those put videos in. Over 1 million SMBs 
have posted videos and done really small ad buys around them. And that's 
pretty
 
cool because I don't think there are probably 1 million advertisers 
who have bought TV ads in that same period of time.
 
When you think about our marketer growth, I think we have an ability to 
grow both the number of advertisers who use our platform, but a
lso the 
percentage of their business that we get. So 30 million small business pages 
continuing to grow. We have an opportunity to turn those businesses into 
advertisers and marketers, and that's what we've done successfully and 
we're going to continue to 
focus on that. And we do that by building very 
simple ad products.
 
And then when you think about the percentage of spend we have, what I 
said before on this call, which is we only have a small percentage of even 
our large customers, that's true of our smal
l customers, too. Now, there are 
some who spend a large portion of their budget on Facebook, but that's 
actually very unusual. For most people, even when they start spending with 
us, we're a small portion of their budget. And when you look at the 
consumer 
time we get, we are not getting the equivalent amount of time or 
resources from our marketers really of any size, and therein lies our 
opportunity to grow.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thank you. Dave, maybe you could help us breakdown the 55% ad revenue 
growth a little bit. Between usage, kind of are you increasing ad loads at all? 
Maybe you talk about the formats or is Instagram helping at all, just a 
little 
granularity on that or maybe it's just a format shift, but just help us 
understand what the key drivers are and how much room you still have to 
go on each of these things. Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, Justin. So in term
s of the 55% revenue growth, obviously, it's mobile 
News Feed is what's driving it from a fundamental point of view. In terms of 
what the opportunity there is to drive it, it's really about increasing the 
relevance and quality of the ads. That's been a key
 
part of what we've been 
doing, and that will just continue to be the big driver in the near
-
 
and 
medium
-
term. And we're doing that on a number of different fronts. Part of 
it's about finding the right format, so it's getting the video units there for the 
people for whom video ads are going to make sense. It's getting the 
dynamic products ads in front of people for people who are going to find 
those ads interesting and engaging. And it's really just continuing to learn 
more and more about the people who are
 
using Facebook and what types of 
ads they interact with and the like. And so that's part of what we're trying to 
do across the board.
 
And then at the same time, we're bringing more and more advertisers into 
the system and that's giving us a better selection of the ads that we can 
serve to the people using Facebook, and that, again, improves the quality 
and the relevance. So the main thin
g that we're seeing drive this is just 
improving the quality and the relevance of the ads experience for the people 
using Facebook, and I think that's going to continue to be the story.
 
I think the specific ads will be part of how we do that, but it won't 
be the 
only way. It will also be the targeting that we have and the targeting 
capabilities that we're doing with things like Custom Audiences and getting 
better and better at that. So there's a lot of different fronts that we're 
working on. It's hard to te
ase out every individual component of it. But all in 
all, we're really pleased with the revenue growth that we're seeing. And also, 
that's coupled with good engagement growth, so we're doing a nice balance 
of having an experience that's working well for ou
r advertisers but it's also 
working really well for the people who are using Facebook.

like, hosting publisher content from New York Times and BuzzFeed and folks 
like that. So how are you balancing out organic reach between these 
algorithm changes and then whether or not professional content is hosted 
inside of Facebook versus coming fro
m a third
-
party website?
 
And then the second question is, Mark, how do you view the shift to 
wearables with smaller screens and shorter interactions? So it looks like you 
guys have gotten most of the apps on the Apple Watch. Just wondering what 
you're doin
g to kind of adapt to these new smaller screens. Thanks.

Sure. So I can speak to both of those. For the News Feed question, the 
North Star for us in News Feed is that we want to produce the best 
e
xperience for everyone who is using the app and loading News Feed to see 
what is going on in the world around them, right? So when it comes to 

 
there are lots of businesses on Facebook, there are professional content 
producers, our main interest here is t
he people in the community who are 
using News Feed, not those guys, right? So of course we want to build tools 
to enable them to share their content and all of that, but we're constantly 
refining the algorithms in order to make it so the experience is the 
best for 
you when you open up your phone and look at Facebook and, there are a 
bunch of things that are going on, we want to make sure that we're getting 
what you care about the most.
 
And we go to a lot of lengths to make sure that we're getting signals fr
om 
people in our community to make sure that we're doing this correctly, in 
addition to the different signals that we would get from seeing people use 
the products. We also do a lot of qualitative surveys to see what people, 
what makes 

 
what people write 
in that they want to see from us, what 
people tell us is the most important thing that they saw in Facebook today or 
saw anywhere in the world today and what they would've wanted to have 
seen on Facebook. And our goal is to just constantly refine this and 
make it 
better and we're going to keep on doing that because we think there's a lot 
of upside and there's a lot more that we can do.
 
Now, at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also 
needs to be good content in the system, right, so 
we need to make sure that 
people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about. 
But if you're a professional publisher, you need to have the ability to share a 
version of the content that you're producing that you're proud of, that can 
l
oad quickly, that can be as rich as the tools enable people to see, and we're 
working on a lot of different tools for that.
 
And you can imagine that as the tools for any of this content get better, 
people taking photos, newspapers, writing news articles, a
dvertisers, putting 
out ads for content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the 
more people are excited to see it and then that informs the ranking in what 
the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time 
as we
ll. So it's just a constant cycle on that. What was the other question?

that's going to be really interesting and we're going watch closely and build

Thank you. Two more quick questions on video. Roughly, what percentage of 
videos are currently monetized via ads and where do you see it headed over 
time? And as you look at the 
early video ads on the platform, how is pricing 
comparing to other ad formats? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
I can take this. I mean, in terms of 

 
in terms of what percentage of videos 
or ads, we're not breaking that out. I think what 
we said was that we're 
really pleased with the consumer adoption we're seeing. That's kind of the 
fundamental table stakes that need to be there and that's the most 
important thing, and we're really pleased with the 4 billion video views daily 
that we're g
etting. We know that marketers love videos so there's a great 
opportunity here. It's still early. It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl 
mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed. And let me just kind 
of speak to how that plays into pricing as
 
well. Video is just a format that's 
bid into the auction.
 
So video is effectively winning in the auction if it's higher priced. So if 
somebody's willing to pay more for a video, it's going to get served before 
another type of format ad. But there's not re
ally a price differential you're 
paying for a video, it's just what are you willing to pay into the system. So 
there's not differential pricing by product, it's just what are you willing to bid 
for the format that you want to show to the people that you wa
nt to show it 
to and that's how the system works.

Mark, does the OpEx guide assume an Oculus product for consumers this 
calendar year? And will the initial products focus on gaming or more on 
some of the experiences that you showed at F8 around 
non
-
gaming like that 
Saturday Night Live demo? And then separately, beyond searching within 
Facebook, should we expect to see Facebook leverage its 2 million advertiser 
relationships against third
-
party search queries? For example, when a user 
searches on,
 
say, Yahoo! or maybe some Apple device, Facebook might tap 
it to advertisers to provide relevant sponsored results. Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner

Chief Financial Officer
 
Ben, let me take the OpEx guidance question. So we have not announced 
any specific plans 
for shipment volumes in 2015 related to Oculus. I just 
know that Oculus is very much in the development stage so it's early to be 
talking about large shipment volumes, and our expense guidance reflects 
any volumes that we might do in 2015.

Good a
fternoon. Thanks. Dave, I just wanted to return to, I think, Justin's 
question about the drivers behind ad growth. You mentioned gains made in 
relevance and quality and format. Wondering if you could provide any 
quantitative color around ad engagement tren
ds, clicks, shares, likes or 
anything like that? And then secondly, one quickly for Sheryl. In your SMB 
discussions, wondering if you're ever asked to help facilitate transactions in 
that space? Or that's an area of small business that you're interested in
? 
Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah. So, Peter, just on the 

 
on ads engagement, that's an area that we've 
obviously been very focused on, and we're really pleased with the results 
that we're seeing there in terms of driving better 
engagement per ad, and 
that's really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts. How do 
we find those ads that are going to be more engaging, they're going to get 
more clicks, that they're going to get more views, that are going to get more 
in
stalls. We're working on focusing on all of those, on optimizing the 
relevance of the ads for all of those different potential actions that happen 
downstream and we're pleased with what we're doing there and the trends 
that we're seeing there. And, again, 
that's a big part of what we're trying to 
do to drive the overall ads growth story, as well as providing a good 
experience for users with the ads that they're seeing.

On SMBs, we have a very small tes
t in the U.S. We started last quarter for 
buy
-
on Facebook, and that enables people to buy products from merchants 
with a buy button on Pages, and it is a product that is used and aimed at 
SMBs. We're also very focused on helping SMBs have a presence, espec
ially 
a mobile presence. 35% of SMBs in the United States, which is probably 
ahead of most other countries, don't have a web presence at all, and an 
even smaller percentage of SMBs have a mobile web presence or any kind of 
mobile presence that works. And s
o Pages are a good and free and easy way 
to have a mobile presence, and that's something we're very focused on 
growing.

Thanks a lot. I had two. You've recently announced plans to enable longer 
form video content, as well as to allow those videos to be syndicated or 
distributed
 
on third
-
party publishers. What, if any, initiatives do you have to 
help with this content, contributors and the publishers to generate revenue 
from those videos? And then secondly, on public content, what, if anything, 
are you doing to try to secure more
 
unique public content, content that's 
potentially unique to Facebook from personalities and other sources? 
Thanks.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

On the video question, we're basically focused primarily on video on our own 
site an
d service, and video tends to be pretty short form content right now 
on Facebook because it's playing in News Feed.
 
We do see some pretty cool examples of people using it well. So for 
example, in the election, you saw Hillary Clinton announce her candidacy
 
very recently, obviously, and that video got 2.7 million views. Ted Cruz and 
others have done the same and they've gotten large numbers of video 
views. So we think it's a very attractive platform for people to reach people 
with video messages.

Mark Zuckerberg
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 2017 was a 
strong year for Facebook in many
 
ways. Our community continues to grow 
with more than 2.1 billion people now using Facebook every month and 1.4 
billion people using it daily. Our business grew 47% year
-
over
-
year to $40 
billion. I'm proud of the progress that our team has made, and the wa
ys that 
Facebook is helping people around the world. Giving people a voice who 
didn't have one before, strengthening relationships by helping family and 
friends stay connected wherever they are, and enabling more than 70 million 
small businesses to grow an
d create jobs.
 
But 2017 was also a hard year. The world feels anxious and divided and that 
played out on Facebook. We've seen abuse on our platform, including 
interference from nation states, the spread of news that is false, sensational 
and polarizing, an
d debate about the utility of social media. We have a 
responsibility to fully understand how our services are used and to do 
everything we can to amplify the good and prevent the harm. This is my 
personal challenge for 2018.
 
One of the most important thing
s we can do is make sure our services aren't 
just fun to use, but also good for people's well being and for society overall. 
So far this year, we've already announced a couple of important updates. 
The first is prioritizing meaningful social interactions o
ver passive 
consumption of content. Research shows that strengthening our 
relationships improves our well being. When we use social media to connect 
with people that correlate to the long
-
term measures of well being that 
you'd expect like happiness and hea
lth.
 
But passively watching videos or reading articles may not have those same 
effects. You can think about it this way. When you see a photo from a friend 
at News Feed, that's not just content that makes you smile or laugh, it's an 
opportunity to connect 
with that friend to reach out to them and to remind 
them that you care about each other. And that connection is deeply 
important to us as people. But when you see a video or a news articles, even 
if it's informative or entertaining, unless you start a conv
ersation around it, 
you're not building a relationship.
 
We've also gotten feedback from our community that these moments that 
lead us to connect to the unique experience that people want and expect 
from Facebook. But in the last couple of years, the ecosys
tem of public 
content like video, news, and post from businesses has grown massive to 
the point where it's starting to crowd out the personal connection that 
people value most.
 
News and video will always be an important part of Facebook. But when 
people ar
e spending so much time passively consuming public content that it 
starts taking away from the time people are connecting with each other, 
that's not good. So let me be clear, helping people connect is more 
important than maximizing the time they spend on 
Facebook.
 
As a result of this update, you will now see more content from friends, 
family, and groups that lead you to interact with people and less public 
content that leads to more overall time spent. Now as I made clear 
announcing these changes, I expect
 
the time people spend on Facebook and 
some measures of engagement will go down as a result. But I also expect 
the amount we actually interact with each other to go up over time. We are 
already starting to see this play out.
 
On our last earnings call, I sa
id that video done well can bring people 
together. But too often today, watching video is just a passive experience. 
To shift that balance, I saw that we were going to focus on videos that 
encourage meaningful social interaction, and in Q4, we updated our 
video 
recommendations to meet other quality changes to reflect these values.
 
We estimate that these updates decrease time spent on Facebook by roughly 
5% in the fourth quarter. To put that another way, we made changes that 
reduced time spent on Facebook by
 
an estimated 50 million hours every day 
to make sure that people's time is well spent. That's how serious we are 
about this.
 
Now we don't normally share time metrics because they're not the best way 
of understanding engagement. But this shows how committe
d we are to 
making sure that the time you spend on Facebook is valuable. Through this 
process, we've also got the sense of how some updates impact other metrics 
as well. For example, changes we made to improve quality in the fourth 
quarter contributed to a
 
decline in people using Facebook daily in some 
country.
 
By focusing on meaningful interactions, I expect the time we all spend on 
Facebook will be more valuable and I always believe that if we do the right 
and deliver deeper value, our community in our bu
siness will be stronger 
over the long
-
term. In this case, it intuitively makes sense. If people interact 
more that should lead to a stronger community, and we already know that 
time in News Feed interacting with people is more valuable than time 
passively 
consuming video or news.
 
When you care about something, you're willing to see ads to experience it. 
But if you just come across a viral video then you're more likely to skip over 
it if you see an ad. So I want to be clear, the most important driver of our 
business has never been time spent by itself. It's the quality of the 
conversations and connection. And that's why I believe this focus on 
meaningful social interactions is the right one.
 
The second update we announced is about making sure the information 
you 
see on Facebook comes from broadly trusted in high quality sources in order 
to counter misinformation and polarization. And the idea is this update will 
show more news from sources that are broadly trusted across the 
community and not only by those who
 
read them directly.
 
For example take the Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, even if you 
don't read them or if you don't agree with everything they write, most 
people have confidence that they're high quality journalists. On the flipside, 
there are
 
blogs that have intense following, but are not widely trusted 
beyond to their core audience. We will show those publications somewhat 
less.
 
Preventing false news hate speech and other abused is another important 
area of focus for us. In order to protect t
he security and integrity of our 
platform, we're investing in both people and technology. We now have 
around 14,000 people working across community ops, online ops, and our 
security efforts. That's almost double where we were a year
-
ago.
 
We've also built n
ew technology to detect suicidal posts that have helped 
first responders reach more than 100 people who needed help quickly and 
we've built AI systems to flag suspicious behavior around elections in real 

I systems, 99% of the 
ISIS and Al Qaeda related terror content we take down is now removed 
before anyone even flagged with us. And in some cases before anyone sees 
it.
 
We've also made progress demoting false news in News Feed, which 
typically reduces an ar

incentives that most spammers and trolls farmers have to generate these 
false articles in the first place.
 

Congress passing legisl
ation to make all advertising more transparent. We're 
not going to wait for them to act. We've already begun launching a way for 
anyone to view the ad, a pages running on Facebook, Instagram and 
Messenger, even if they aren't in the intended audience.
 
And 
we're testing this in Canada first with the goal of rolling it out in the 
U.S. this summer ahead of the mid
-
term election. As I said last quarter, I 
expect these investments on top of other investments we're making will 
significantly impact our profitabili
ty. But just like the changes we're making 
that will impact time spent these investments will help us build a stronger 
community over the long
-
term. Now building a stronger community also 
means delivering on our product roadmap for the next three, five and
 
ten 
years.
 
Over the next three years, we know video will continue to grow. So our job 
is to build a video experiences that help people connect with family, friends 
and group. That's why I'm excited about Watch as a place to connect with 
people who have similar intere
sts and why we launch a product like Watch 
party, where friends can watch a show together.
 
Another important shift that we're seeing across the industry is the growth 
of Stories. We expect Stories are on track to overtake posts and feeds as the 
most common
 
way that people share across all social apps. That's because 
Stories is a better format for sharing multiple quick video clips throughout 
your day. The growth of Stories will have an impact on how we build 
products and think about our business, including 
Whatsapp and Instagram 
which are the number one and number two most used Stories product in the 
world.
 
Beyond the video, we have a long roadmap working to help people connect 
in meaningful ways. Today, more people are using groups than ever. These 
include 
smaller groups of friends and family and also larger communities 
where people connect around shared interests. We are focused on helping 
more people find the right communities for them and giving group admins 
and leaders the new tools they need to run thes
e groups and help them 
grow.
 
The goal of the marketplace is to connect people through commerce. More 
than 700 million people each month now come to Facebook to buy and sell 
things. We've launched marketplace in 30 countries last year, including 11 
countrie
s in the last quarter alone. Over the next five years, we remained 
focused on building ecosystems around our services had lots of people 
already.
 
In Messenger and WhatsApp, we are working to give businesses more ways 
to communicate with their customers. We
 
launched a plugin for Messengers 
that people can chat live with companies on their websites, and now more 
than 2 billion messages are sent between businesses and customers every 
month.
 
WhatsApp recently crossed 1.5 billion monthly active with people now 
s
ending more than 60 billion messages every day. A growing number of 
these messages are between people and companies, which is why we 
launched WhatsApp business. A new app designed specifically for small and 
medium businesses to connect with people they wan
t to reach.
 
Over the next 10 years, we are working on the foundational technologies 
needed to bring the world closer together. Our goal with AI is to understand 
the meaning of all the content on Facebook to help us build better services. 
In addition to mak
ing it easier to get people the help they need and remove 
harmful content, this will also help us show more content that encourages 
connection and conversation.
 
And on the VR side, we are excited to get Oculus go into people's hands this 
year. Time Magazin
e named it one of the top inventions in 2017 and I can't 
wait for more people to use it. So 2017 was a good year in many ways, but 
it was also challenging and that's why our focus this year will be making sure 
that our services are not just fun, but also g
ood for us. And I'm confident 
that we will rise to the challenge.
 
Thanks to all of you for being part of this journey and I am looking forward 
to making more progress together.
 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks
 
Mark, and hi everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter and a great 
end to the year. Q4 ad revenue grew 48% year
-
over
-
year, mobile ad 
revenue was $11.4 billion, up 57% from last year, and contributed 
approximately 89% of total ad revenue in Q4. The full
-
yea
r 2017 mobile ad 
revenue grew 56% compared to 2016 and was broad
-
based across regions, 
marketer segments, and vertical.
 
We continue to make progress on our three priorities; helping businesses, 
leverage the power of mobile, developing new ad products, and 
making our 
ads more relevant and effective. Facebook and Instagram allow people and 
businesses connect and our especially meaningful platforms for small 
businesses. Globally 70 million businesses use Facebook. We surveyed small 
businesses in 18 countries a
nd 57% of them are employing more people due 
to growth in demand since joining Facebook.
 
Last week, I met Adam of Kings Barbers Club who started with two 
employees in Birmingham, England and now has 15 salons and 70 
employees. I also met Domingo from Pesca
ria, a restaurant in Southern Italy 
that uses Facebook and Instagram to connect with customers. 80% of their 
diners and 70% of their revenues comes from Facebook. They opened their 
second restaurant and now employ more than 60 people. Like Adam and 
Domingo
, small business owners are some of the most dedicated 
entrepreneurs and they are the heart of every economy and create the 
majority of new jobs throughout the world.
 
As Mark said, we are taking strong action to maximize the good we do in 
communities. As p
art of this we are investing heavily in small businesses and 
in helping people gain digital skills. In November, we launched our 
community
-
based program which provides digital training for people in need 
of work and helps local businesses and non
-
profits g
et the most out of the 
Internet.
 
During my trip last week, I announced that we are expanding the program 
to the EU. This year, we will visit more than 30 cities in the U.S. and Europe 
to work side by side with SMBs, start
-
ups and NGOs. Over 2 million peopl
e 
and businesses have already used our online and offline training, and by 
2020 will have trained 1 million people and businesses across Europe alone.
 
As people and businesses shift to mobile, Instagram continues to grow 
quickly. There are more than 2 mill
ion active advertisers on Instagram and 
we announced in November that more than 25 million businesses have 
profiles on Instagram up from 15 million in July. Instagram is a business as 
mobile visual shop and we're seeing more people seek out businesses ther
e. 
About two
-
thirds of the visits to Instagram business profiles are from people 
who don't follow them and this is helping bring in new customers.
 
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products, each year mobile 
advertising reaches new milestones
 
during the holiday shopping season. A 
year
-
ago, we saw a mobile conversion action taken on a mobile website 
after viewing an ad on Facebook surpassed desktop conversions for the first 
time. In 2017 mobile conversions continue to accelerate. Data from 17 
m
arkets shows mobile accounted for 69% of online conversions on Black 
Friday and 64% on Cyber Monday.
 
It also shows 80% of conversions on Singles' Day, a popular day for online 
shopping in China and increasingly other countries. Big shopping days like 
these
 
are the kind of global events that Facebook and Instagram are 
uniquely positioned to support. During these events and throughout the 
year, businesses are using our innovative ad products like dynamic ads to 
connect and reconnect with shoppers.
 
For example
, Holiday Inn Express recently used dynamic ads for travel with 
our collection formats to advertise to people who search for hotels on their 
website, but hadn't yet booked. They ran ads with a video that showed a 
personalized selection of hotels for the ci
ty and dates people have looked up. 
This resulted in three times higher return on ad spend then their previous 
campaigns.
 
In Q4 we also launched dynamic ads for auto, which allows dealers and 
manufacturers to show the right cars to the right audiences. As 
we expand 
and improve our ad products advertisers are increasingly developing mobile 
first ads rather than simply taking their TV creative and putting them online.
 
Mobile first video was 50% of our video ad revenue this quarter up from 
41% last quarter. We
're seeing the short form videos work well and 
Instagram Stories were people can watch a full
-
screen vertical video and 
swipe up to quickly learn about a product or brand. 60% of these ads are 
viewed with sound on.
 
Recently open table used Instagram Storie
s to advertise their reservation 
service to U.S. adults, who are frequent diners or are interested in dining. 
They combined food and restaurants footage of the book now button. Their 
ads reached 1.5 million people and achieved 33% lower costs per 
reservati

advertiser to try Stories ads as part of their other campaigns on our 
platform.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Targeting 
makes advertising better more relevant
 
to people and more effective for 
businesses. This is especially important for small businesses and they had 
limited budgets and need to make every dollar counts. Facebook give small 
businesses the same powerful tools that were previously only available to
 
large advertisers. So they can reach the right people at the right time.
 
For example, we're continuing to invest in value optimization, which helps 
advertisers show their ads to people who are likely to spend more with 
them. We've been gradually rolling t
his out to advertisers using web 
conversion dynamic ads and mobile app, install app. Their early results are 
promising over 2500 businesses have tried value optimization since June 
and many are putting more of their budgets toward it.
 
We take our responsib
ility to prevent abuse of our ad system very seriously. 
And we're investing heavily in both people in technology to protect the 
integrity of our platform. In addition to rolling out the ad transparency tool 
in Canada that Mark mentioned, we've disabled the
 
option that less 
advertisers exclude people and specific multicultural affinity segments until 
we can develop better safeguards against discrimination.
 
We're also focused on improving ad quality and delivering a better 
experience for people who interact w
ith marketers on our platform. This 
holiday, we took additional steps to penalize e
-
commerce advertisers, who 
created misleading or negative ads. In 2018, we will continue to focus on 
our same three priorities and do more to ensure the quality transparency
 
and authenticity of ads in our platform.
 
As part of our effort to be more transparent, last quarter we published our 
advertising principles, which have long guided our approach across all of our 
platforms. These principles are commitment to the people who
 
use our 
services. They are we build for people first. We don't sell your data. You can 
control the ads you see. Advertising should be transparent. Advertising 
should be safe and civil. It should not divide or discriminate. Advertising 
should empower busin
esses big and small and we're always improving our 
advertising.
 
As Mark said, 2017 was a challenging and important year for Facebook, a 
year where we committed to increasing our investment in the safety and 
security of our community, it was also a 
strong year for our business where 
our investments in helping our clients grow payoff. We will continue to make 
all of these investments in 2018 and in the coming years. I'm thankful to our 
partners around the world and to our employees who work so hard to
 
make 
us better every day. Thanks.
 
And now here's Dave.
 
David Wehner
 
Thanks Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter for 
Facebook and a great end to the year. Full
-
year 2017 total revenue grew 
47% over $40 billion and we generated over
 
$17 billion of free cash flow. 
Let's begin with our community metrics. Overall our global community is 
strong and growing. Daily active users on Facebook in Q4 reached 1.4 
billion, up 14% compared to last year, led by growth in markets like India, 
Indones
ia and Brazil. This number represents approximately 66% of our 
2.13 billion monthly active users in Q4.
 
MAUs were up $269 million or 14% compared to last year. As Mark 
mentioned certain product quality changes impacted our DAU growth. In the 
U.S. and Canad
a, these changes contributed to a DAU decline of 700,000 
compared to Q3. We don't see this is an ongoing trend, but we do anticipate 
that DAU in this region may fluctuate given the relatively high penetration 
level. We continue to see healthy growth across
 
the Facebook family of apps 
including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.
 
Turning now to the financials, all comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $13 billion, up 44% or 47% on 
a constant currency basis. For
eign exchange tailwinds contributed $329 
million of revenue in Q4. Q4 total ad revenue was $12.8 billion, up 48% or 
44% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $11.4 billion, up 
57%.
 
In Q4 the average price per ad increased 43% and the number o
f ad 
impressions served increased 4%, driven primarily by feed ads on Facebook 
and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenues was $139 million, up 7%. 
Total expenses in Q4 were $5.6 billion up 32%. Headcount remains a 
primary driver of total expenses. In 
Q4 we added approximately 1,900 
people and ended the year with over 25,000 employees, up 47% compared 
to last year. In 2017 we made significant investments in R&D and security. 
On the R&D side, we added more people in 2017 than we did in 2016 and 
2015 comb
ined.
 
On the security side, as Mark mentioned, we have accelerated our efforts 
and at the end of the year had around 14,000 employees and contractors 
working across community operations, online operations and integrity 
efforts. We also continue to invest a
ggressively in key areas such as content 
and our long
-
term innovation efforts.
 
Q4 stock
-
based compensation expenses were $814 million, which was down 
from the $831 million in Q4 of last year, due to a decline in deal related 
stock
-
based compensation expens
es. As a reminder, we acquired Oculus and 
WhatsApp in 2014 and we expect the deal related SBC expenses to be 
substantially recognized by the end of 2018. Q4 operating income was $7.4 
billion representing a 57% operating margin.
 
Our effective tax rate was 4
3%. In Q4, we recorded net approximately $2.3 
billion in one
-
time charges as a result of the 2017 Tax Cut & Jobs Act. That 
was largely driven by the mandatory transition tax based on the 
accumulated earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.
 
Net income was $4
.3 billion or $1.44 per share. Again the one
-
time charges 
related to the tax on accumulated earnings reduced EPS by approximately 
$0.77. Full
-
year 2017 capital expenditures were approximately $6.7 billion, 
driven by investments and servers, data center, of
fices facilities and network 
infrastructure.
 
In 2017, we generated over $17 billion of free cash flow and ended the year 
with nearly $42 billion in cash and investments. In 2017, we brought back 
approximately $2 billion of our Class A common stock and had 
approximately $4 billion remaining in our current authorization as of 
December 31. We remain committed to repurchases of our stock to help 
manage dilution.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We believe we have good opportunities 
to grow the business acros
s both Facebook and Instagram in 2018. We 
continue to improve the effectiveness of our ads which helps drive ROI for 
advertisers and demand for our ad products.
 
On the supply side, we expect we will be able to continue to grow ad 
impressions at a modest sp
ace. In 2018, we expect constant currency ad 
revenue growth rates to decelerate consistent with the trends that we have 
seen over the past year. I would also note that in the first half of 2018, we 
will likely benefit from favorable exchange rate tailwinds
 
due to the recent 
depreciation of the dollar.
 
Moving on to expenses. We continue to expect full
-
year 2018 total expenses 
will grow approximately 45% to 60% compared to full
-
year 2017.
 
Turning now to CapEx. We expect that our full
-
year 2018 capital 
expendi
tures will be in the range of $14 billion to $15 billion driven by 
increased investment in data centers, servers, office facilities and network 
infrastructure. We currently anticipate that our full
-
year 2018 tax rate will be 
in the mid
-
teens. In summary, 2
017 was another good year for Facebook. 
We continue to grow our global community and deliver great results for our 
advertisers.
 
Importantly, we accelerated our investments to make our products better 
and the community stronger as we push forward on our mis
sion of giving 
people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
 
With that, Mike let's open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
We will now open the lines for a question
-
and
-
answer session. [Operator 
Instr
uctions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, the quality 
changes that you mentioned that led to an impact on daily active users in 
North America.
 
I guess any further detail on what those quality changes 
were and what makes you feel comfortable this isn't likely to continue? I 
think you may need to make further changes and cleanup throughout the 
course of the year?
 
And then the second one, Mark, I t
hought your commentary on Stories 
engagement was really helpful. I'd be curious to hear about early learnings 
on monetization of the Stories format and any challenges you made to 
overcome to drive monetization through that consumption? Thanks.
 
David Wehner
 
On the quality changes on the impact on DAU in the U.S. and Canada, really 
no further I think elaboration on that. I would just say that we don't 
anticipate that that will be a continuing trend, but given the high penetration 
rates, we do think they'll be
 
some fluctuation there. There's a lot of different 
effects that come from the different quality changes and focus on meaningful 
social interactions, but that's our expectation at this point.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On story monetization, ads in Stories on Instagr
am is a small, but quickly 
growing part of our revenue. There are 300 million daily actives on 
Instagram alone, and the format is pretty exciting from a sales point of view 

engaging
. So the opportunity in the future for us to combine the power of 

going to be really powerful for both our business and the business of our 
clients. It's early days, but I'm pretty 
optimistic about this.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking the question. First, Mark you made it pretty clear that 
driving meaningful social interactions is the Company's top 
priority this year, 
but can you talk a little bit about how the changes you're making impact 
advertising and maybe you can talk about how you're thinking about any 
changes around ad load or just overall impression volume? And then how 
the ads work in an en
vironment of more friends and family content in an 
environment where you don't see as many business posts?
 
And then secondly, can you talk about GDPR as well. I don't think you 
mentioned it, but just curious, I mean you put the blog post out the other 
day,
 
but if you could talk about how you're preparing here, so that's a rollout 
over the next few months and whether you think that presents any risk to 
either engagement or monetization? Thanks.
 
David Wehner
 

n the business. The biggest 
focus 

 
the biggest impact of the focus on meaningful interactions as Mark 
mentioned will be in areas like passive video, where from a business 
perspective, we monetize less on a time spent basis. So if you think about it 
in ter
ms of things like post views in News Feed, which drives impression 
growth that we think this will have less of an impact, and so that's sort of 
built in to what I had said about the business commentary when I 
commented on 2018 revenue outlook. We still bel
ieve we have an 
opportunity to grow impressions at a modest space year
-
over
-
year across 
the platform.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
When I think about the MSI changes, obviously any change that's beneficial 
for our community is good for the long run health of our busine
ss, because 
as Mark said, we care not just about time spent on Facebook, but time well 
spent. But even in the shorter
-
term all time spent on Facebook is not equal, 
because when people spend time viewing more posts because they're 
interacting with family an
d friends and they're not involved in longer post.
 
We have actually more monetization opportunities. We're not doing this to 
be positive or negative for revenue. We're doing this because is the right 
thing for our community. But the impact that has on mone
tization is 
certainly not clearly negative. When you think about GDPR, the Facebook 
family of apps already applies the core principles in GDPR frame, which are 

fully comply by May.
 
We're going to continue to give people are personalized experience to be 
clear about how are using the data and give choices and we realize that this 
means that some users might opt out of our ads targeting tool. We also 
know that there may be a DAU impac
t for implications on European usage. 
But from the targeting, we're not forecasting a big impact here. There's 
some risk and more watching closely. Over the long run, we feel confident 
that we're very well placed to navigate the transition.
 
Operator
 
Your n
ext question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman 
Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you. I had two questions. One, I was just wondering what the 
advertiser response is then to the lower engagement and also just the kind 
of I guess cleaning
 

on this and also can you share with us any metrics on Watch and I know it's 
really early, but anything that interesting from an engagement perspective 
here and kind of how do you think this could 
evolve? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On the DAU impact any Advertiser response our business is strong. We have 
over 184 million people using Facebook everyday in the U.S., which is 
considerably more than the Super Bowl every day on mobile alone. We also 
have
 

 
we think the best stability to target and make advertising relevant for 
businesses and people who see ads. We're continuing to build the products 
that allow businesses to get a higher return for the dollars they spend and 
allow people to see more releva
nt information in ads on our platform.
 
So we're pleased with the growth and we believe that that delivering the 

a dedicated place for people to watch and comment, where heavily focu
sed 

findings.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS Securities 
LLC
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on the t
eam around 
engagement and the changes on product. First, how would be defining 
success? What will you be watching for in terms of either the time spent on 
the platform or the user growth on the platform or relative engagement to 
say that you've got the mix
 
right and that people are seeing the right of 
content and have a healthy experience with Facebook over the next couple 
of years? That will be number one.
 
And number two, Dave with respect to the OpEx and CapEx, given the 
incentive of the company to get a 
lot of things right on the security side and 
with repositioning products. Should we expect there to be a different 
cadence this year in terms of the investments the company might maybe 
more first half versus second half. Just one note there was any color t
here? 
Thank you so much.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I can take the first point about meaningful social interaction. So the product 
directive that I've given to all of our teams is to shift from focusing on 
showing the most meaningful content to people to instead to n
ow 
encouraging the most meaningful social interaction. So that will first take 
hold as the series of News Feed changes, but over time there are going to be 
new products that we build new interfaces that the team is designed with 
the goal of encouraging int
eractions between people.
 
So the thing that we're going to be measuring is basically the number of 
interactions that people have on the platform and off because of what 
they're seeing that they report to us is as meaningful. One interesting thing 
that I th
ink is worth being clear about in terms of how we develop News 
Feed. I think that there's this myth that we design News Feed in order to 
just optimize for time or for likes or comments or some signals like that.
 
The reality is the way we've done this for y
ears is we've had a panel, a 
survey of thousands of people who basically we asked what the most 
meaningful content is that they had seen on the platform or that they've 
seen off the platform and we design our systems in order to be able to get to 
that grou
nd truth of what people 

 
real people are telling us is that high 
quality experience.
 
So now we're going to shift that that methodology a little bit to instead of 
just being focused on the content, now to be more focused on trying to 
measure and have peopl
e tell us what is creating the most meaningful 
interaction in their lives. We're not just on Facebook. It could be a message 
that you have on Messenger or Whatsapp. But it could also be that you see 
something on Facebook and have a conversation about that 
in the world with 
someone who's meaningful to you and the next to me that we need to 
understand that.
 
But that's basically what where we're going to be moving all of these 
systems towards over the next period of time. And its not just can be one 
News 
Feed change that happens overnight. It will be a series of rollouts and 
then a number of product changes that go to the interface of the products 
and things that we launch within that as well.
 
David Wehner
 
And then Eric, you had a question about, how we mi
ght expect expense 
growth to progress through the year? There is no specific one item that's 
going to drive it. So we would expect expense growth to ramp throughout 
the year, largely due to the factors that we've talked about on prior calls in 
terms of wha
t's driving the overall acceleration. There's the continued 
investment on the security front. We talked about that in both Mark's 
comments and my comments and we're continuing to ramp that investment.
 
We are continuing to invest to support the video strate
gy on Watch. So we 
would expect that content investment to continue and ramp. And then finally 
we're continuing to invest in the long
-
term initiatives in areas like AR, VR, AI 
and connectivity. So across the board, we would expect expense growth 
ramp throu
ghout the year.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo 
Securities.
 
Peter Stabler
 
Thank you. Two if I may, one for Dave and one for Sheryl. First of all for 
Sheryl, wondering if you could update us on the search op
portunity given 
the rapid growth of product advertising on the platform. Is there an 
opportunity for Facebook to transition from more of a demand generation 
platform to demand fulfillment? And then for Dave, can you give us a sense 
of the timing of the cha
nges to the News Feed? Is this of fully completed 
rollout were there different cohorts that saw it first? Was there any regional 
phasing or anything like that? Thank you.
 
David Wehner
 
Yes, Peter. I'll take the second part first. We began to make changes ar
ound 
a number of different quality initiatives in the fourth quarter, so that affected 
metrics that we've talked about including both the time spent and the DAU. 
But we continue to make changes to improve and to optimize around driving 
meaningful social in
teractions as Mark talked about. That's going to be an 
ongoing journey throughout the year. So there's no 

 
I don't think we ever 
are going to declare that we are done making changes. So I'd expect we 
would continue to make changes and evolve.
 
Sheryl Sandb
erg
 
On the search opportunity, there's a growing number of searches on 
Facebook, but we're still a ways off from monetization. It's worth noting 
though that because of our ads targeting our ability to reach people multiple 
times. We do believe that some of
 
our ad success is taking people from 
demand generation through demand fulfillment.
 
So we have multiple clients who will show an ad, a video ad to everyone in 
the U.S. for example or to a big cohort of people and then they'll follow up 
with an ad that targ
et on either Instagram or Facebook to people who 
engage with that first that then they can follow up with the next team and 
we are seeing as businesses are increasingly measuring your ad spend in 
terms of their real ROI for sales that even within our own p
latforms. We can 
move people down that marketing funnel from demand generation to 
demand fulfillment.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
Great, thank you. Dave, maybe you can talk 
a little bit about the 
sustainability of the pricing growth that you're seeing with advertising. 
Obviously your outlook for next year suggest decelerates modestly, but it's 
certainly a very high level and talk a little bit about that. And then maybe 
Mark o
r Dave, just talk about how the Watch tab is evolving? Are you seeing 
a lot of usage there? And how do you think about content in the Watch tab 
versions the News Feed? Thank you.
 
David Wehner
 
Yes. Sure, Justin on pricing growth, I think there we feel like 
we're making 
good progress in our goal of driving better outcomes in ROI for our 
advertisers through things like better targeting, better ad units, driving 
better conversion, and we think we're making good progress there, and the 
willingness of advertisers
 
continue to grow budgets with us I think highlights 
our progress there. You remember they are optimizing at the end of the day 
for business results for a given dollar spent not the impression price that 
we're kind of nominally reporting here.
 
So you can t
hink of all of this work and Sheryl talked about the value 
optimization efforts as part of that as being an effort to improve the yield of 
the impressions that we have to drive downstream business results for 
advertising partners. And if we can drive those
 
affectively that will translate 
into higher effective prices for our business. And as I mentioned, I think we 
believe we still have a lot of work to do to continue to improve that. So we 
think there's opportunities here.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
And for Watch, it'
s early, there are some promising signs, but in terms of 
how we think about this overall compared to News Feed. I would say it's 
really important to internalize that the News Feed video ecosystem and the 
Watch video ecosystem are almost completely separate
 
things, right. So the 
Watch behaviors that we're building is one where people come intentionally 
to watch specific videos and to interact with the community around that.
 
That's in contrast to what we worry is too passive consumption of an 
experience in Ne
ws Feed today where people just happen to often see a 
video and maybe they'll watch it for a few minutes, but may not interactive 
around as much in News Feed. So we're still very optimistic long
-
term that 
Watch will be used for video that helps to bring pe
ople closer together and 
that will correlate with all the things that our community is telling us they 
want and that correlate with the measures of wellbeing that we think that 
social products can generate by helping people build relationships in terms 
of 
all the long
-
term measures of wellbeing that we care about like long
-
term 
happiness and health et cetera.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital 
Markets.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks. Two questions please. European advertis
ing revenue growth or your 
ad revenue growth in Europe accelerated, is that just currency or anything 
else you would call out there? And then you talked about progress in moving 
away from kind of demand or creation towards demand fulfillment or 
including d
emand fulfillment. And I was wondering if you could give any 
more examples of that?
 
And Sheryl, two years ago or so you mentioned Booking.com being on the 
platform. I still think those OTAs, based on our work, are still doing like 10x 
as much spend on Goog
le. So there's a real opportunity versus Facebook. 
Are there other examples or any other evidence you can show or talk about 
that that companies are really finding the ability to do demand fulfillment on 
Facebook and what's caused that to change? Thanks a 
lot.
 
David Wehner
 
Let me just quickly hit on the constant currency question I think you had at 
the beginning Mark. The acceleration we saw from Q3 to Q4 was currency 
for Europe, but Europe continues to grow at a very healthy pace on a 
constant 
currency basis, so we're very pleased with the results both in 
constant currency terms and nominal terms. And then Sheryl.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So to take the first question, the EU, the strength in Europe was driven by 
SMBs. We grew across the board with large
 
companies too, but SMBs were 
really important for this. There are 18 million small businesses on Facebook 
in Europe, and I had a chance to meet a lot of them on my trip. But to 
mention just one which shows the point, a couple named Linda and Marius 
starte

in Sweden on Facebook. She was selling clothes in her living room and 
selling them. Facebook is driving about half their sales. They then opened a 
factory in Romania and moved back to 
Romania, where they're now 
employing 100 people and they're shipping across Sweden, Romania, 
Germany, and Austria.
 
There's still a small business at 100 people, but they are a growing business 
and showing the power of how our work with SMBs is growing jobs
. You're 
asking also for an example of a demand generation going all the way down 
to demand fulfillment. Here's another one from Europe. Gymshark is a 
fitness clothing brand based in the UK. They ran Facebook video ads and 
Instagram Story ads for their Bla
ck Friday Campaign and then they target 
with a look a like people who had previously purchased and custom 
audiences that people who started, but then complete the purchase. And 
they saw 9.3 times return of investment over the two week holiday period.
 
What 
happens on our platform is often that people will start out during 
demand generation and then use the repeat opportunity to show people ads, 
moving down the funnel to demand fulfillment. If you use our targeting tools 
well, you can actually start out with 
demand fulfillment. So some of these 
examples I've shared on this call from holiday end to Gymshark are about 
people using the targeting tools to find the people who are interested in the 
products and then you can get closer and down the funnel to demand 
f
ulfillment.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Hey, guys, just two questions Mark, first on the topic of passive versus 
active consumption. Can you talk about what percent of the DAUs actively 
contri
bute today versus just moving back passive consumption? And how 
has that ratio maybe changed versus five years or 10 years ago based on 
some of the product changes that you had in News Feed?
 
And then Dave just follow
-
up on pricing, so with the bunch of noi
se given 
the growth rates of desktop versus mobile, can you just talk about what 
pricing growth looks like in mobile like for like geography basis? Is that 20%, 
30%, any color there would be helpful? Thank you.
 
David Wehner
 
Yes. Ross, I guess I'll take bot
h. Yes, we don't break out the type of metric 
that you're talking about on the passive versus active consumption. So we 
don't have anything specifically to share there. In terms of breaking out 
pricing on a mobile basis. I mean I think overall that the tre
nds reflect a 
generally what's happening on mobile, but there is still an overlay of a shift 
from desktop. But overall, we are seeing prices increase on mobile in region, 
so I think that's consistent with the reported trend.

Your next question com
es from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies LLC.
 
Brent Thill
 
Thank you. On Instagram I'm just curious if you give a little more color on 
the progress you're seeing, any metrics to help fill in what's happening 
there?
 
David Wehner
 
We continue to be 
pleased with the growth of Instagram both on a user 
basis and on a revenue basis. It continues to make an increasing 
contribution to the business. So we're very pleased with the Instagram 
result, nothing specifically to highlight from a metrics point of vi
ew.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On the business side, I think we have both pleased with the results. We see 
a very big opportunity in front of us. We have 6 million advertisers on 
Facebook, which means we have a lot of opportunity on Instagram, where 
we only have 2 mi
llion advertisers to grow their engagement with us and 
their spend.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with 
MoffettNathanson.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Thanks. I have one for Mark on news trustworthiness and then group on 
sports. 
So Mark, I realize you're taking great pains not to play the role of the 
news editor on your platform. You're asking users about trustworthiness, but 
I wonder does that pick up biases in our own stores of what we believe to be 
trustworthy and how do you ge
t past that?
 
And then would it make sense just simply you play the role of pipelining a 
new News Feed, maybe its own tab with news that we all believe 

 
we 
believe to be trustworthy. So at some point you take a more active role in 
identifying the news that
 
your platform believes to be real news and maybe 
create a new tab that ways. Is that ever something in your thinking?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
The value that we care about here is helping to build common ground. Right 
and helping to do our part to fight off news a
nd polarization. So what we're 
doing. With this specific change which is one of a number of News Feed 
changes that are geared at improving the quality and trustworthiness of 
news on Facebook.
 
What we basically ask people we don't want to assess by 
ourselves which 
sources are trustworthy. I think that's not a situation that our position that 
we're comfortable with ourselves. And I don't think personally that that's 
something that our community or our society wants us to do. So for all of 
the feedback
s that we get that we should take more of a view on that, I 
actually 

 
I don't believe that that is the right thing broadly.
 
What we try to do is get our community to tell us what matters to them, 
because we believe that we can get an accurate signal from 
the community 
then 

 
people are smart. They know what they want and what's good and 
they can tell us that, if we can ask them in a simple enough way and get 
aggregate data.
 
So what we're doing here is we basically are just asking people, if they're 
familia
r with news sources and whether they trust them. And the effect of 
that is that it basically normalizes for 

 
there are going to be people who 
read a given news source, who will probably trust it because they read it.
 
But the question is that the people wh
o don't read it, who are still familiar 
with it, do they think it's trustworthy, and that's the example that I gave 
before the Wall Street Journal or New York Times. A lot of people read those, 
a lot of people don't, but the people who don't still think th
at they're high 
quality journalism in general. And that's not true for a lot of the other stuff 
that's out there.
 
And we've found that that's the reliable signal of content that helps to build 
common ground that is unlikely to be polarizing, that is unlike
ly to be false 
news, and what we're doing is helping to show that a little bit more.
 
Again, we're not going to tell you that you can't share other stuff, right. You 
can share it on the platform. People can go to your profile. But in News 
Feed, we're going 
to just show that a little bit more to do what we view as 
our role is helping to build common ground, encounter some of these other 
forces in the world.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On this sports answer, sports is one of the ways that people ge
t together on 
Facebook and build community. We're excited to bring the UEFA Champions 
League Soccer and College Basketball to Facebook, and we're going to 
continue to experiment with developing many different forms of content for 
Facebook.

You nex
t question is from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen.
 
John Blackledge
 
Great, thanks. Two questions, on marketplace with the expansion to 30 
countries, just wondering how the business model evolves over time, does it 

-
party
 

business? And then just on ad units, on the mid
-
roll video ad units. Just 
wondering I know it's early, just any color on the ad demand and perhaps 
how you think about the impact to this ad unit for the next couple of years? 
Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On marketplace, we're just going to continue to iterate on the ad test. We're 
pretty encouraged by what we've seen even though it's pretty early days. 
What we're excited about is that our business is helping people connect with 
t
hings they want to buy. It's also important to note that commerce is a 
really important vertical in our ad business. So it's not just the commerce is 
being driven in ads in marketplace.
 
But in a much bigger way, commerce discovering product all the way, 
th
rough to sales is a big part of what's driving our ads business. On Ad 
Breaks for mid
-
roll video, early days pretty good result, more than 70% of 
Ad Break up to 15 seconds in length on Facebook and Audience Network are 
being viewed to completion. Most are 
being viewed with the sound on. But 
again it's very early for this.

Your next question is from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Evercore ISI.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Thanks for taking my questions. Sheryl, just hoping you could help us think 
about h
ow marketing budgets grow as retail moves online. So investors we 
speak to ask the question about the addressable market for Facebook. Is the 
addressable market running out of opportunity as the platform gets larger? 
So do you believe the overall ad market
 
or the TAM is possibly experiencing 
structural expansion, due to a shift in e
-
commerce overall?
 
And then Mark, I wanted to ask about AI. Can you just talk about the 
broader applications of the technologies that you are investing into improve 
the user expe
rience and safety on the platform. So I understand you're 
using AI to improve the quality of the experience and engagement, but 
should we be thinking about these investments as also enabling new 
features and products over time, whether it would be shipping
 
hardware or 
custom chips or potentially AI as a service externally? Thanks.
 
David Wehner
 
Anthony, on the on the marketing budgets, we continue to think we've got 
great opportunities to grow in the large global advertising market. When you 
get sort of down
 
to the micro level, you talked about e
-
commerce. E
-
commerce is and remains and was one of our strongest verticals in Q4, and 
we think we're doing an excellent job of building the right products for e
-
commerce retailers.
 
And Sheryl talked about value optim
ization and that sort of work that we're 
doing, and so I think we've got continued opportunities with e
-
commerce 
going forward. So I think we're very well positioned in the e
-
commerce 
space. On AI?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. I can talk about AI. So machine learn
ing is 

 
the improvement there are 
by far the largest technological trends that we're seeing in the industry and 
across the business. And we really see it in three ways, right. The first and 
most tactical or just the optimization to everything that you see
, right, from 
ranking in News Feeds, your ranking of ads or search, or improving our 
security systems, and that's driving a lot of the business and the quality 
improvement that we're seeing and that's really important.
 
The second category, I would call qua
litative changes and how we do 
business. So for example, for News Feed, historically all the content that's 
been a News Feed has been content that you're connected to, right. You 
become friends with someone or you follow a page and then their content 
can s
how up a News Feed, but long
-
term or not even long
-
term, right.
 
Over the next several years as we develop an understanding of all of the 

we're going to be able to just understand the meaning of all the content that 
hosted that you could potentially 
see and use that as candidates to 
potentially improve your experience and make it that you could see way 
more content that you might be able to today to 

 
and of course, we'll do 
that to help encourage more social interaction.
 
The way that this is improvin
g the work that we're doing around security and 
integrity is also very fundamental. Today, that whole model is that people 
can post what they want and then a person can flag it, and then our systems 
will look at it. But increasingly as we move into the fut
ure, we're going to be 
able to proactively take down some negative content. I gave the example of 
the terrorism
-
related content and some things around suicidal post where if 
someone posts something that they're thinking about suicide. Now today, we 
don't h
ave to wait for someone to report it a lot of the time.
 
In the last few months, there have already been more than 100 instances 
where we've been able to reach out and get in touch with first responders 
that they can give you people the help that they need,
 
and that's a big 
structural change in the way that we do business in terms of protecting the 
security and integrity of our community. The third major category is going to 
be completely new products and platforms. So there we talked about all the 
things th
at we're building around VR and AR and the ability to be present 
with anyone, anywhere.
 
And certainly AI is going to be a big part of that both on the vision side and 
the voice side. And there are going to need to be big advances there, but 
that's really e
xciting. But I think in each of those three categories, the 
optimization, the upgrading how we do business, and really changing how 
that works in our products today, and then the new products. I would say 
that improvements in machine learning are the most 
important technological 
trends in the industry now by far.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Operator, we have time for one last question.
 
Operator
 
Your last question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark May
 
Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask a follow
-
up question
 
regarding Mark's 
comments that user engagement had declined by I think 50 million minutes 
in 

 
daily hours in the quarter. I guess the question is how confident are you 
that that impact was due to News Feed changes that you made proactively 
versus some ot
her factor outside your control, and if you are still fairly early 
in the process of making these quality improvements to the News Feed, do 
you expect for engagement declines to continue going forward?
 
And just for Dave, I know you choose your words carefu
lly, just want to 
clarify, you mentioned this year you expect constant currency ad revenue 
growth to decelerate consistent with trends that we've seen in the last year. 
I think your constant currency growth rate in 2017 declined by about 12 
percentage poin
ts. Is that kind of what you're trying to lead us towards? 
Thanks.
 
David Wehner
 
I can take the second question first, Mark. I think what I am trying to say is 
that we do expect constant currency revenue growth to continue to 
decelerate consistent with stea
dy deceleration that we've seen over the past 
year, so we do expect that trend to continue. I'm not putting specific 
percentages around it.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
So in Q4, we made a number of quality changes that were largely around 
video. We are going to contin
ue to make quality changes now going forward 
around meaningful social interaction. And I do think that that is likely going 
to continue this trend of decreasing passive consumption, but if we do our 
jobs well, it should increase the number of meaningful in
teractions that 
people have. And we think that that's going to be positive, right. So we think 
it'll help make the community stronger over the long
-
term. I mean we think 
it'll be good for the business over the long
-
term, but this is what people are 
telling
 
us is what they want on the product.
 
It's the unique value that people expect from Facebook. You can go to a lot 
of places to consume content, but there aren't a lot of services where you 
can strengthen your relationships, that's what people want, so that
's the 
right thing for us to focus on, and it also lines up with all the well being 
research that we've done which 

 
and as you know, there have been a lot of 
debate over the last year about the utility of social media on the Internet, 
and we take this ver
y seriously, right. It's our responsibility, too, to make 
sure that we understand everything that's going on on our platform.
 
And one of the big takeaways from that is that time when people are 
engaging and building relationships, is good time and that cor
relates with all 
the aspect of long
-
term well being that you'd expect like happiness, and 
health, and feeling more connected and feeling less alone, and in all of the 
things that qualitatively matter in our lives. And we think that we can help 
drive that a
nd improve people's lives by doing that, so we're absolutely 
going to go do that.

Thanks Deborah, and thank you all for joining us today. This was a strong

, or

with
 
our privacy
-
focused vision for the future of social networking.
 
The basic idea here is that in our lives, we all have public spaces like the 
town square and private spaces like our living rooms. In our digital lives, we 
also need both public and private s
paces. For the last 15 years, Facebook 
and Instagram have become the digital equivalents of the town square 
where you can do almost anything you want with lots of people at once 

 
stay in touch with your friends, meet new people, find communities that 
shar

these whole rich platforms for lots of ways to interact in larger communities.
 
Today, people increasingly wa
nt the intimacy of connecting privately as well, 
so I think there also needs to be a digital equivalent of the living room, a 

privately. We already see that in messages, small groups,
 
and Stories are by 
far the fastest growing areas of online communication. And we also know 
that people want additional tools for private interactions like payments and 
commerce.
 
I expect the digital town squares like Facebook and Instagram will always be

rivacy. We all need to communicate privately, 
and this service could be even more important in our lives. So, I think we 
should focus our efforts on building this privacy

on the 
most fundamental and private use case, messaging, make it as secure as 
possible with end

end encryption, and then build more ways for people to 
interact on top of that. And this privacy

focused platform will be built around 
several principles: P
rivate interactions. You should have simple, intimate 
spaces where you have complete confidence that what you say and do is 
private. Encryption. Your private communications should be secure, and

around these ideas. There are a lot of open questions and real tradeoffs on 

consulting with experts and governments as we go.
 



y how this will play out 
yet. But on some of the questions like whether encrypting content will hurt 

use the content of messages between people to target ads today, so 
encrypting 

privacy without meaningfully affecting our business.
 
Similarly, reducing the permanence of data may have some impact, but 

recom
mendations anyway, so this is another step that should have a much 

business. Our stance on data localization is a risk. That is, if we get blocked 
in a major country, that will hurt o
ur community and our business. But our 

 
Some people have asked whether more use of private social platforms will 
replace the more public platforms. And our privacy road map applies to all
 
our products, but we believe there needs to continue to be both the digital 
town square and the digital living room. As private platforms have grown, in 

countries like India, wher
e WhatsApp is very popular, but the broader 
pattern across the world is that people want to use both private and public 
platforms . So, I believe building out this private social platform is a much 
greater opportunity than it is a risk.
 
In thinking about t
he opportunity and impact to our business, by far the 
most important factor will be whether people choose to use our products and 
whether we can build the leading private social platforms in most countries. 
Now remember, we are not currently the leading me
ssaging platform in 
either the United States, China, or Japan, which are the three largest 

succeeding in the other countries is going to be very important. People want 
a private social pl
atform that is as strong on privacy as possible, so 
delivering this is both in the interest of our community and our business.
 
As always, our first step is going to be to focus on building the services 


share more as our plans develop. The other piece I published in the last 
month was about the four areas of internet regulation I think would be most 
helpful around content, elections, privacy, and data portability.
 
And the reason I wro

years focused on addressing the important social issues around the internet, 


 
such important policy 
decisions by ourselves. If the rules for the internet were being written from 

making so many decisions around speech, elections, and data privacy 
without a more r
obust democratic process.
 
For harmful content, I think there should be a public process for determining 

could be through government or industry, but having common standards is 
criti
cal since people use so many different services to share content.
 
For elections, there have long been laws defining what is political 

threats like the ways that foreign nation states t
ry to interfere in elections 


 
For privacy, I believe it would be positive if more countries adopted 
regulation lik
e GDPR as a common framework. At this point, realistically, 
most countries will adopt privacy regulation, and the most likely alternative 
to a global framework like GDPR is the fragmentation of the internet and 
more countries following the approach of auth
oritarian regimes adopting 
strict data localization policies, where governments can more easily access 

 
For data portability, if you have data in one service, you should be able to 
move it to another. But we need a common understanding of nuanced 

birthday with you, is that now your da
ta that you should be able to bring to 
your calendar app, so it can remind you later? Or is that only my data? And 

data to another app, whose responsibility is it if that app misu
ses your data? 
The absence of clear rules here discourages companies like ours from 
building tools to make it easier to move data between apps.
 


lete privacy while also stopping 

but then expect a broad definition of data portability for research or 
competition. The values and equities at stake are too important and too 
co
nflicting for any company to balance them in a way that everyone will be 
comfortable with. So part of building trust will be deferring to a public 
process on how to make these tradeoffs.
 
I understand that any regulation may hurt our business. But I think i

necessary. Getting these issues right is more important than our interests. 
And I believe that regulation will help establish trust when people know that 
the right systems of governance and accountability are in place. So, over the

term, I believe
 
that that increase in the trustworthiness of the internet 
can have a much larger positive impact for our community and our business

metrics. Facebook daily active users reached 1.56 billion, up 8% compared 
to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This 
represents approximately
 
66% of the 2.38 billion monthly active users in 
March. MAUs grew 179 million or 8% compared to last year.
 
Turning to our Family metrics. We estimate that on average, over 2.1 billion 
people used at least one of our apps on a daily basis in March and aroun
d 
2.7 billion people were active on a monthly basis. We believe these numbers 
better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are 
using more than one of our services.
 
Turning now to the financials. All of the comparisons are on a yea
r
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted.
 
Q1 total revenue was $15.1 billion, up 26% or 30% on a constant currency 
basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the first quarter of 
2018, total revenue would have been approximately $503 million 
higher.
 
Q1 total ad revenue was $14.9 billion, up 26% or 31% on a constant 
currency basis.
 
In terms of regional ad revenue growth, U.S. and Canada was strongest at 
30%, followed by Asia
-
Pacific at 28% and Rest of World at 23%. Europe 
grew more slowly at 21
% and was impacted in part by currency headwinds.
 
In Q1, the average price per ad decreased 4% and the number of ad 
impressions served across our services increased 32%. Impression growth 
was primarily driven by ads on Instagram Stories, Instagram 
Feed, and 
Facebook News Feed. The year
-
over
-
year decline in average price per ad 
reflects an ongoing mix shift towards Stories ads and geographies that 
monetize at lower rates.
 
Payments and Other Fees revenue was $165 million, down 4% year
-
over
-
year and do
wn 40% from Q4 which benefitted from holiday sales of Oculus 
and Portal.
 
Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $11.8 billion, up 80%. This 
includes a $3 billion accrual taken in connection with the inquiry of the 
Federal Trade Commission into our pl
atform and user data practices. This 
matter remains unresolved, and we estimate that the associated range of 
loss is between $3 billion and $5 billion. Absent this accrual our total 
expense growth rate would have been 46 percentage points lower.
 
We ended Q
1 with approximately 37,700 full
-
time employees, up 36%.
 
Operating income was $3.3 billion representing a 22% operating margin. 
Absent the accrual, operating margin would have been 20 percentage points 
higher.
 
Our Q1 tax rate was 30% and was higher than th
e mid
-
teens guidance given 
the tax treatment of the accrual.
 
Net income was $2.4 billion, or $0.85 per share. The accrual we recorded 
reduced EPS by approximately $1.04.
 
Capital expenditures were $4 billion, driven by investments in data centers, 
servers, 
office facilities, and network infrastructure. We generated $5.3 
billion in free cash flow and ended Q1 with approximately $45.2 billion in 
cash and investments. In Q1, we bought back approximately $521 million of 
our Class A common stock.
 
Turning now to t
he revenue outlook. We continue to expect that our revenue 
growth rates will decelerate sequentially throughout 2019 on a constant 
currency basis. In addition, we anticipate ad targeting related headwinds will 
be more pronounced in the second half of 2019.
 
Turning now to the expense outlook. We are adjusting our expense outlook 
which now includes the accrual we recorded in Q1. We now anticipate full
-
year 2019 total expenses to grow 47% to 55% compared to 2018, up from 
our prior guidance of 40% to 50% growth
. The $3 billion accrual accounts 
for approximately 10 percentage points of the anticipated expense growth.
 
But excluding the accrual, this revised outlook implies a modest adjustment 
in our guidance on 2019 core expense growth rate.
 
Note that this does no
t change our longer
-
term outlook on the need to 
invest in core product, infrastructure, innovation, and safety and security, 
and the ultimate impact of those investments on our operating margin.
 
We are updating our 2019 capital expenditures outlook to be $
17 billion to 
$19 billion, down from our prior estimate of $18 billion to $20 billion. Our 
capital expenditures are driven primarily by our continued investment in 
data centers and servers.
 
We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of 2019 to be in
 
the mid
-
teens.
 
In summary, Q1 was another good quarter for Facebook. We are pleased 
with our ability to grow our community and business while at the same time 
investing heavily for the future.

Thanks for taking the question. Mark, can you maybe just tal

more about the time frame for building out a privacy

platform? Are we thinking about one year, three years, five years, and 

additional services and functio

And then one for Sheryl as well around Stories ads, you mentioned 3 million

plus advertisers, can you just talk about how the increased density there is 
translating into pricing relative to the feed? And your vi
ew over time, how 
Stories ads could monetize relative to feed ads? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. For the time frame for this, I think that this is going to be a central 
focus for the company for the next five years or longer. Parts of this, we 
already h
ave a strong foundation on, where WhatsApp and Messenger are 
strong around the world. But in a lot of the most important countries for this 
like that 

 
like I mentioned in the United States and Japan, we are not the 
leading private communication service to
day. So there, the most important 
thing that we need to do is get the basics right and make sure that we are 



 
a 
lot over the coming months and the plan 

 

next week in terms of the product roadmap and what we expect to see on 

period of time than we migh
t have previously in order to get safety right.
 
So when I first announced that we were going to be moving our private 
communication services to all be end

to

end encrypted, I was very clear that 

xperts and 
governments and law enforcements around the world to make sure that we 
have the right safety systems in place to make sure that we handle this 
really well, right? Because there are really important safety and content 
issues in messaging and if w

need to make sure we have different tools in place to handle that. And this is 

 

ed to deal with 
issues as they came up with, but now part of our new approach of trying to 
be more proactive about social issues is trying to build in from the ground 
up, getting this right upfront. So the playbook is going to be work on getting 
the basics
 
right, make sure that we have safety rights from the beginning. In 
countries where we already are the leading platform, there will be more 
ability to work on things like payments in the near term and build in 
additional ways that people want to interact p
rivately. But in terms of when I

anything, the mix shift on growth towards Stories is certainly in the near 
term a headwind on revenue growth.
 

strong impression growth that this 
supply growth keeps prices low and creates an opportunity for advertisers, 

believe we can increase demand for Stories as we attract more advertiser

monetization point with the 3 million advertisers, could you just talk us

on both News Feed and St

learned is that consumers usually move to new features, to new products, to 

rketers move 
there quickly. We definitely saw that with mobile, that one of the barriers 
was convincing marketers that they needed to be with mobile. But then 
there was a second barrier which was just making it easier for them to do it. 
If you take your lo

marketers that peopl
e are using Stories, and I think having seen the mobile

ow you can 

 
rather than us 
saying to you, go make a Stories ad you can just send us some pictures, 
some text, some very easy posts and we will create some Stories ads for 
you.
 
So our process is, we have one sales team selling all of these products; I 
thin
k that helps us a lot because they already have those relationships. And 

want to make this as automated as possible. So the long run view should be 
that you can give us maybe simple p
ictures, maybe simple videos, maybe an 

over time our systems will do a better job deciding where your ads should be

that Stories is having. And the supply growth really getting driven by Stories 

ors that factors 
into the lower growth outlook for the second half. But on the demand side, 
want to specifically call out several factors that are contributing to ad 
targeting headwinds. The first is just the evolution of the regulatory 
landscape, and here
 
I would point to regulations like GDPR. The number of 
people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites 
they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of

The second factor is just anticipated changes that mobile platforms will 
make that will make targeting and measurement more difficult.

platform increasingly focused on privacy, I was wondering how you think 
about the incremental
 
expenses, if any, to achieve this? And in particular, if 
I go back to your comments on your third quarter earnings call, you

and revenue were better matched. Does any of your recent 
areas of focus 
change your timeframe associated with that to occur? And then I had a

Heather, I can 

 
I can take that. I mean in terms of the focus on privacy, 
the one thing that I would 

 
I would sort of cite there, if anything the 
priority for messaging is clear, the focus on privacy a

that means that monetization for messaging is a lower, near

called that out last time exactly, because I care about making sure that we 
get that back more and more in line soon.
 
On Watch, generally this is starting to go quite well. The


 

one of the big questions around Watch that we had early on was what is 


If you rem
ember the reason why we got to this strategy, it was because 
people wanted to watch a lot of video, but we saw that passive consumption 
of video was displacing social interactions and News Feed.
 
And when you think about what Facebook stands for in the worl
d, and the 

helping people stay connected and have a meaningful interaction. So, it was 
really important to me, and I think to making 

 
to the long term of what our 
product stands for 
it to make sure that News Feed is always about 
meaningful interaction. While people wanted to consume a lot of video and 
we thought that there were new ways that people could interact around that, 
we wanted to create a separate place, where people could go
 
to do that.
 
And one of the big open questions was to what extent, what percent of 
people are going to want to go and do this? And now it was more than 100 

hypothesis, that this is some
thing that people are going to want to go do. 
That also not only with Watch, which is continuing to grow quickly, this also 
opens up opportunities around things 

 
around doing this around areas like 

 
And I do

very consultative approach to how we develop anything around news or any 
of the things that touch the big social issues and certainly, supporting 
journalism is up there as one of the reall

Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. Mark, for you, I 
guess as 
we read your statements and listened to you on the calls over the last sort 
of a year and a half, the end of 2017, I think investors are still trying to 
figure out the future business model and monetization path for Facebook as 
a company. Is it mo
re media consumption and advertising driven or do you 
think you are in the process of a pivot towards more e
-
commerce? And we 

on how you think about the puts and takes between an
 
ad driven model and 
an e
-
commerce driven model or somewhere in between those two as you 

Dave or not, but on the FTC, you threw out 3 billion to 5 billion, what sort of 
probab
ility should we assume to that being the likely outcome within that 
range and how should we think about some of the changes if any that might 
happen to the business model if you were to settle with the FTC? Thanks so 
much, guys.

I can take for 
the FTC one first, Eric. Look, the accruals and accounting entry

Great. A couple of questions. Thank you. First, Dave, does your revenue

caused the expense

getting at with the contemplated regulatory changes. But I did cite that one 
of the factors in the expected deceleration was the ongoing impact of the 
evolution of the regulatory landscape from things like GDPR and the nu

of people, who are opting out of using context from third

making our own product changes with things like tools for seeing and

Facebook in the U.S. and Canada were stable sequentially. So anything 
around that in terms of what does your revenue outlook kind of assume in 
terms of will 
there be continued stability there? Any color around what 
you're seeing in terms of its time spent or engagement on Facebook would 
be really helpful. Thank you.

So in shopping in general, we do see a lot of interest in our apps and 
shopping
. Instagram specifically where we launched checkout, 130 million 
Instagram accounts are tapping to reveal products or learn more about 
products in posts every month. So I think there is a real opportunity. We're 
excited about checkout but I really want to 
stress how early this is. This is a 
small closed beta with 23 brands and for us that's obviously a very small 
number.
 
And it's not primarily a monetization product as your question assumes. 
Really, the benefit here is enabling a better experience for peopl
e, that when 
they're interested in a product they can learn more and checkout right there. 
Obviously, if people learn about things through our ads and then close the 
loop all the way to purchase, it's very strong for proving ROI, it also helps as 
a measure
 
that return as well. We're excited about this kind of thing but this 
is as early as anything could be.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Yes, Anthony, on the DAU in the U.S. and Canada, yes, true, that was stable 
so in terms of the number of DAU quarter
-
over
-
quarter. And I thi
nk that 
broadly paints the right picture in terms of engagement as well. We're not 
providing a specific time spent update but I think it paints the picture well on 
the DAU front.
 
In terms of the strength that we're seeing in the U.S. and Canada on the 
reve
nue front, obviously, Instagram is playing a big, big role there and the 
growth of impressions from Stories is factoring into it. And at the same time 
we're seeing continued pricing growth on feed, and that's true for both 
Facebook and Instagram. And there
, we're relying on continuing to improve 
targeting. And so you've got 

 
the risk there is of course the headwinds that 
we talked about on the ad targeting front and how that will play into U.S. 
growth as well.

Your next question comes from Mark Ma
y from Citi.
 
Mark May
 
Thank you. To Sheryl's earlier point about the evolution of Stories, the 
perception is the core Facebook user adoption of Stories format has been 

 
hasn't been all that meaningful. How would you characterize the adoption on 
core 
Facebook? And if it is in fact relatively low, is that important for the 
company to address?
 
And then secondly with impression growth of, I think you said, Dave, 32%, 
that's obviously significantly higher than the 8% growth in MAUs. What 
would you largely 
attribute that to? Is that a reflection of improving 
engagement or the ability to kind of increase ad loads globally? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So on Facebook Stories, we have 0.5 billion people using it daily, and we 
think that's pretty impressive growth; w
e're seeing real engagement. In ads 
in Stories, we rolled out globally about 1.5 years after launching Instagram 
so it's still early but we're definitely seeing a lot of value for businesses on 
Instagram, and we believe same on Facebook.
 
To share one examp
le, a local e
-
commerce jewelry brand called Lokai 
started donating 10% of their net profits to charitable partners. And they 
started running video ads in Facebook Stories and News Feed. And just the 
addition of Facebook Stories drove 26% more additions to 
their checkout 
cart. So I think we are seeing that 

 
including on Facebook, including in ads 
even though it's earlier 

 
the additional opportunity is big.
 
Dave Wehner
 
So Mark, it's Dave. So in the impression growth I sort of cited the drivers in 
order of i
mpact, and I listed Instagram Stories first and then Instagram 
Feed. Stories it is the biggest individual driver of impression growth, and we 
talked about how that is coming through at lower prices. And there's some 
opportunity to increase 

 
we were seeing
 
increased engagement in Stories 
and there's some opportunity to increase load growing forward.
 
On Instagram Feed, which was the second factor, we have seen some 
increase in ad load on Instagram on a year
-
over
-
year basis, but we expect 
that there'll be les
s significant growth opportunities going forward on 
Instagram Feed ad load.
 
And then finally, you've got 

 
you have Facebook Feed which we're still 
seeing impression growth and that's coming around the globe. And we're 
tending to see growth in 

 
outside th
e U.S. and Canada. So that gives you 
some color on the sort of the type of impression growth that we're seeing.

Your next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. Mark, so you mentioned payments and commerce a bunch of t
imes in 
your March letter and also today. So I guess can you talk about how you see 
the strategy developing for payments and commerce on WhatsApp 
compared to maybe what you see broadly out there from other folks building 
these capabilities around messaging
? And then what timeline should we 
expect to start to see some of this come out? And lastly any insights on what 
the blockchain team at Facebook is working on and how does that potentially 
tie into the overall payment strategy? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure
. Across the 

 
commerce and payments are an area that I'm quite 
focused on and optimistic about across all of our different services. So in 
Instagram and Facebook, you have shopping, and you have Marketplace and 
you have all the tens of millions of small b
usinesses that use pages and a lot 
that use Instagram for sharing their inventory and being able to help people 
discover and pay.
 
Through messaging specifically, I'm more optimistic because of the private 
nature of this space, right? It feels 

 
when you're
 
using a messaging service, 
that everything there is very intimate and private so it feels like a more 
natural space to be interacting with a business in a private way for doing 
transactions.
 
So I think what we're going to end up seeing is building out Pay
ments, which 
is going to end up being something that we do country
-
by
-
country 

 
we 
have a test that is running in India for WhatsApp now, we're hoping to 
launch in several other countries at some point, but I don't want to put a 
timeframe on that here, but
 
it's something that we're actively working on.
 
And the goal would be to have something where you can do discovery 
through the broader town square
-
like platforms in Instagram and Facebook. 
And then you can complete the transactions and follow up with busin
esses 
individually and have an ongoing relationship through Messenger and 
WhatsApp.
 
And it's 

 
this is one of the things that I think will create a lot of value for 
people discovering and interacting with businesses. I don't know many 
people who like calli
ng businesses to deal with issues that they have. I think 
being able to handle that through messaging is going to be a great 
experience. For businesses I think that this is going to help complete the 
loop and help them to actually sell more things which ul
timately is what they 
care about when they're using the platform. So this is just a big opportunity, 
and one of the areas that I'm quite excited about.

Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
Thanks. Had a c
ouple of related to the commerce topic. Know it's early on 
Instagram, but in the blog post you all alluded to opening up the platform 
more broadly. So wondering kind of what the timeline might be? And how 
easy will it be for smaller businesses to integrate
 
here?
 
And then I guess second one related to that would be, as you start to test 
this with checkout on Instagram, do you see any change from participating 
brands in their strategy around ad spend on the platform as part of those 
tests and kind of how that
 
might evolve over time?
 
Dave Wehner
 
Yes. And Sheryl can add some color here but, Lloyd, it's Dave. I just want to 
make sure, I mean we've got a very small closed beta with 23 brands. It's 
very early days and it will take a while for this to have any 
impact. So I just 

 
I think it's something we'll be watching and nurturing but it's going to take 
a while before Instagram Shopping has any meaningful impact on the 
business.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
And we haven't announced anything in terms of opening up the prod
uct 
more broadly so that people can buy sign up automatically which is where 
small businesses would come in. We're going to get feedback and expand in 
time. But with all of these things we're doing very small slowly, we have a 
lot of teams working on a lot
 
of very important projects in ads, and this is 
one we're going to roll out very slowly and carefully.

Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Thanks. I have one for Mark and one for Dave. 
Mark, I appreciate your call 
about regulating the Internet. You've been outspoken on that. I just wonder 
if you have any views on the EU copyright directive which YouTube has been 
critical of or the Australia law about violent material? And if those laws 
b
ecome more global, do you think the company is prepared operationally to 
protect the platform from those types of challenges by regulators?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So we're working with policymakers to ensure that people can share and 
express themselves while stil
l protecting copyright. In terms of the 
experience in Europe, some of the provisions could impact the user 
experience in Europe but we're going to continue to work with policymakers 
to try to get the balance right.

Your next question comes from Co
lin Sebastian from Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Maybe a quick follow
-
up on the platform safety issue, maybe 
specifically with respect to broadcast. Wondering how close you are in terms 
of the ability to prevent harmful posts or videos from reaching users 
on a 
real
-
time basis? And how much of this can realistically be done today using 
AI versus more manual processes?
 
And then secondly, Mark, just considering the fast adoption of voice 
interactions in interfaces online, how should we think about Facebook's 
s
trategy and competitive positioning as an opportunity to strengthen the 
connections that exist between the apps or would voice interaction being a 
distinct feature perhaps within the apps? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So on safety, I think given the vo
lume of content that people share, if 
you want to have any hope of doing it in real time, the only hope is building 
AI systems that can either identify things and handle them proactively or at 
the very least, flag them for a lot of people who work for us w
ho can then 
look at them rather than waiting for people in our community to flag those 
after they've already seen them. The reactive model of waiting for people in 
the community to flag them guarantees that by the time that we get to look 
at an issue someo
ne has already seen that content, which is not the state 
that we want to be in.
 
So the state that we're trying to get to and hold ourselves accountable to is 
where we have these transparency reports 

 
right now every six months, 
but we want to get to quart
erly on those soon. And in those transparency 
reports, we break down every category of harmful content, everything from 
terrorism, to hate speech, to bullying, to nudity. And in each one, we talk 
about the prevalence of the content that people see because 
we think what 
matters is the number of impressions or people who are seeing the content, 
not just 

 
not if a lot of people are sharing something but no one sees it 

 
but what is actually getting seen. One piece of content that gets seen by a 
lot of people 
is a big deal.
 
And then in these reports, we also talk about and show what percent of the 
content we handle proactively and identify proactively. And our goal is to get 
that to be as high as possible. In areas like terrorism, for Al Qaeda and ISIS 
related 
content, now 99% of the content that we take down in the category 
our systems flag proactively before anyone sees it. That's what really good 
looks like.
 
I don't know that in every category we're going to be able to get to 99%; 
certainly not in the next si
x months or a year. But my hope would be that 
we can get to 90
-
plus percent on most of these categories within the next 
couple of years. And that's I think the best hope for doing this. That's going 
to be a bit continued investment and something that we re
ally care about 
getting right.
 
The other question was about voice. Most of what we build 

 
one of the 

about people interacting with each other than just people interacting with 
us,
 

voice calling and ways that people can communicate with voice. We have 

people interact. And having Portal out
 
in the market has been very valuable 
in terms of seeing how people want to use that and for 

 
so our teams can 
have a real target to shoot at and iterate on and continue improving week 

d
ifferent ways, voice and how people interact with each other and eventually 
building products that allow people to interface with our products through

Joh
n Blackledge
 
Great. Thanks. Could you provide some color on ad loads for Instagram 
Stories versus Instagram Feed at this point? And also any color on how 
conversion rates have trended on Stories ads and Instagram over the past 
year? And then other question
, just on CapEx, the guide was brought

brought down slightly. Just any callout out there and any view on longer

Dave Wehner
 

ries versus 


have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and 
the interstitials ar

posts, so comparing apples and oranges a bit. But we do have opportunities 
we think to increase effective ad load on Stories, where Instagram Feed and 
Facebook Feed are 

 
we think the opportunit
ies are much more limited to 
increase ad load going forward.
 



 

supply opportunity, and pricing is clear
ly lower on Stories than on Feed. Part 

in Stories, so that reduces the opportunities for conversion opportunities on 
Stories. And as we are more effective at getting direct respo
nse into Stories, 
that should improve, so some opportunity there.
 
On the CapEx guidance, this is really just about better visibility on how 

Those are large complex projects, so the tim
ing of that spend, we just get 
better visibility on as the year progresses, but no real change in outlook. 

 
The capital intensity of the business over the last several years had come 
up, and part of what i
s driving that are real changes in the business as it 
relates to our opportunity to deploy capital against things like ads targeting 





intensity increase over the 

 
over the past several years.

Mark Zuckerberg
 

global frameworks where possible, but the challenge of course, with that is 
that except in a limited number of cases, regulation typically isn


on different timeframes. I had a recent trip, where I was in Berlin and 
Dublin, talking to a bunch of folks, who are policymakers or academics out 
there.
 
And cert
ainly, I think people are thinking about all of these issues. And 
certainly, Europe has led on areas like privacy regulation with GDPR, and is 
probably further along in thinking about how to think through issues around 
content regulation and safety as well

people doing things in different countries around the world, but a lot of what 
we hope that we can 

 
that we can contribute to this discussion is as much 
as possible have shared frameworks for how the industry should 
operate 
around the world.

week Facebook celebrates its 12th birthday. And as I think about our 
progress and where we go from here,
 

moments that Facebook was involved in, in 2015. More than 950 million 
people received a notification that a friend or a loved one was safe in a 
crisis. Millions of people supported the people of Nepal after the earthqu
ake 
and the people of France after the Paris attacks. More than 8 million people 
used 35,000 groups and pages on Facebook to support refugees. And people 
from all over the world connected around moments from Star Wars to the 
U.S. presidential election, fro
m the Indian Super League to the Cricket World 
Cup.
 
Seeing our global community connecting in all these ways shows the 
opportunities ahead as we connect the world but also the challenges. Even 
as the world has tended towards greater openness over time, in 
many 
communities we also see greater fear over what a connected world and more 
technological progress means for them. Addressing these concerns is 

working to give as much voice as we can
 
and advance the benefits of 

going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring 

techn
ologies that give people more ways to express themselves.
 


here is to deliver better more engaging exper
iences for our community and 
to give people better tools for sharing different types of content with the 
different groups of people that they care about. Video is an important part of 
the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for 
allowing people to share and consume some of the most engaging content.

communities on Facebook. And these efforts are paying off with growth in 
engagement for different products reaching an impressive scale. Now, more 
than 500 million people use events each month and more than a 123 mil

events were created on Facebook in 2015. For the first time, more than 1

advertisers. More than 50 million small businesses now use pages on 
Facebook and people post more than 2.5 billion comments on these pages 
each month. This is a good example of how the strength and enga
gement of 
our community is making Facebook more valuable for businesses every day. 
And Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a minute.
 


the shift towards more visual 
content online. The community continues to grow. And back in September, 
we announced a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. Over the last 
year, as the community has grown, we have focused on building engaging 
new expe
riences for the community including by improving search and by 

experiences to give people more options for creating and sharing different 
types of content. In March, we launched the layout app 
allowing people to 
easily combine images and in October the team also launched Boomerang, 
and app for making looping videos which reached number one in the App 
Store in more than 70 countries.
 
We also introduced a new video channel on Instagram for people 
to watch 
moments from big events like New Year, so the college football 

continued to make progress with building these into valuable communication 
services for everyone in the world. More tha
n 800 million people now use 
Messenger monthly and in 2015 we grew that number by almost a quarter of 
1 billion while also increasing engagement. We continue to give people new 
ways to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for

powered 
by AI. In this quarter we also began testing a transportation platform, 
allowing people to request an Uber ride through Messenger. More services 
will be coming to the platform soon, including airlines.
 
WhatsApp ended the year with nearly 1 billion
 
monthly actives. As WhatsApp 

many communities come to depend on this as their main communication 
service. To serve these communities well, this month we announced that 
WhatsApp will n
ow be free to everyone and will no longer charge the 
subscription fees that many people were charged after their first year. We 
think this is an important step towards creating and even more ubiquitous 
product without affecting our plans for building Whats
App into important 

people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations 
that they want to hear from.

Thanks, Mark, and hi everyone. We had a terrific fourth quarter capping off a 
great 2015. Q4 ad revenue grew 57% or 66% on a constant currency basis. 
Mobile ad revenue reached $4.5 billion, up 81% year

over

year and is now 
80% of total ad r
evenue. Facebook and Instagram drive business results for 
our partners, helping their products off shelves online and off. As a result, 

to our platform.
 
We saw strong growth across a
ll verticals, marketer segments and regions. 

countries like China where businesses are advertising on Facebook and 
Instagram to reach people internationally. We continue to make progre
ss on 
our three priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number 
of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and 
effective.
 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Heading into 2016, it is clear that 
consumer
s have shifted to mobile and businesses know they need to catch 
up. Marketers now realize that if they want to reach their customers where 
they are, mobile is essential. Our conversations with clients have shifted 
from if they should market and mobile to h
ow. With over 1.44 billion people 
using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on 
Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the two most important 
mobile advertising platforms.
 
We provide creative canvas powered by technology, 
a unique combination of 
art and science that marketers can use to deliver great creative with the 
highest quality targeting at unparalleled scale. The 2015 holiday season was 
a defining moment for mobile marketing and demonstrated the power of our 
mobile p
latform.
 
According to comScore, total U.S. consumer spending on mobile in 
November and December was up 59% year
-
over
-
year. This holiday season, 
marketers turned to mobile more than ever before. To reach a large global 
audience for the launch of Halo 5, Mic
rosoft Xbox used optimized for 
Facebook and Instagram. Working with our agencies and power media team 
from Dentsu Aegs Network, Eisenberg Group and twofifteenmccann, they 
understood that people watch video differently in mobile newsfeed than on 
TV. So they
 
created videos to capture audience attention in the first three 
seconds even without sound. They drove over 380 million impressions and 
49 million video views in key markets and increased purchases by 10 points 
in the U.S.
 
Our second priority is growing a
 
number marketers using our ad products. 
Last quarter we announced that we had over 2.5 million active advertisers 
and since then our growth has remained strong. This represents small 
fraction of the over 50 million small businesses now actively using page
s. So 
we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook 

advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results advertisers are 
seeing from their investments. 98 of t
he top 100 advertisers on Facebook 
also advertised on Instagram in Q4.
 
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. 
We shipped a lot of new ad products this past year. These products help 
deliver personalized marketing at sca
le and drive business for our clients. 

retailer teased upcoming sales with a cinemagraph video to build awareness. 
They then retargeted people who saw the video with one day only deals.
 
On 
Black Friday, they used our carousel and DPA ads to promote products 
people had shown interest in. They saw 20 times return on ad spend from 
this campaign, helping them achieve their biggest Black Friday and their 
most successful sales day ever.
 
To sha
re just a few other product examples, in emerging markets we 
launched Slideshow a video like ad experience that works with lower 
connection speeds and feature phones. We introduced local awareness ads 
globally to help brick and mortar businesses reach peop
le near their stores 
and started testing Canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in 
a more immersive way. We continue to invest in ad tech and are especially 
pleased with the growth of our audience network.
 
Measurement also remains a critical 
area of focus. Our measurement tools 

driving business results and help make our ads more relevant. This year we 
saw more advertisers shift from proxy metrics like clicks to business 
results 
like digital and in store sales.
 

are paying off and we see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead. We know we 
still have a lot of hard work to do and heading into the New Year,
 
we will 
remain very focused on our top three priorities.
 
I want to take this opportunity to thank our clients around the world for their 
partnership. Your investment and feedback is critical to making our products 
better. I also really want to thank the g
lobal Facebook teams for your 
extraordinary dedication to our partner success. Your hard work and 
execution is critical to helping us fulfill our mission. Thanks everyone and 
now here is Dave.

Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Q4 was a
 
strong quarter and 
wrapped up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was 
$17.9 billion, up 44% year
-
over
-
year or 53% on a constant currency basis. 
In 2015, we generated over $6 billion in free cash flow including $2.1 billion 
in Q4 while c
ontinuing to fund important investments for the future growth 
of the business. The strong growth and engagement of our community with 
consistent theme throughout 2015, and that continued in the fourth quarter. 
In December, 1.04 billion people used Facebook
 
on an average day, an 
increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represented 65% 
of the 1.59 billion people who visited Facebook during the month of 
December. Mobile continued to drive the growth of our community. In 
December, 1.44 billion p
eople accessed Facebook on mobile devices, an 
increase of 21% compared to last year and 90% of the people who have 
used Facebook on both a monthly and daily basis accessed us via mobile 
devices.
 
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on 
a year
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non
-
GAAP measures exclude 
stock
-
based compensation and the amortization of intangibles. In Q4, total 
revenue was $5.8 billion, up 52% or 60% on a constant currency basis. Q4 
ad revenue was $5
.6 billion, up over $2 billion from last year, year
-
over
-
year growth was 57% or 66% on a constant currency basis. The 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on 
our revenue in the fourth quarter. Had exchange rates remained
 
constant 
with Q4 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $320 
million higher. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific continued to be our two 
strongest regions with ad revenue growth of 64% and 57% respectively. Our 
rest of world and Europe 
regions grew at 53% and 45% respectively, as they 
were more heavily impacted by currency headwinds.
 
Mobile ad revenue was $4.5 billion, up 81% from last year and represented 
80% of our advertising revenue. For perspective, three years ago the mobile 
percen
tage was just over 20%. Q4 tapped off a remarkably successful year 
for our mobile advertising business where we were able to combine strong 
growth in ad inventory supply with strong growth in advertiser demand. On 
the supply side, we grew the number of peo
ple using Facebook on mobile, 
time spent, and ad load. Our ongoing focus on ad quality and relevance 
enabled us to deliver a better overall mobile ads experience for our users 
while increasing the number of ads they see. In Q4, we also benefitted to a 
less
er extent from increases in ad inventory from Instagram and the 
Audience Network.
 
On the demand side, we believe our efforts on targeting and measurement 
solution enabled marketers to achieve better business results at better 
values. This helped us drive s
trong growth from a broad array of advertisers 
including direct response in brand advertisers, large companies and SMBs 
and both existing and new advertisers.
 
Turning now to the overall price volume metrics, in Q4 the average price per 
ad increased 21% whi
le total ad impressions increased 29% on a year

over
-

that total ad impressions increased on a year
-
over
-
year basis. This was 
driven by an increase in mobile ad impressions and was 
partially offset by a 
decline in ad impressions that were heard on personal computers, consistent 
with the ongoing declines in PC usage. The reported increase in price is 
being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile which contains 
higher price ne
wsfeed ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both 
newsfeed ads and lower price right
-
hand column ads. Total payments and 
other fees revenue was $204 million, down 21% compared to last year. The 
decline was driven by reduction in payments revenue relate
d to games 
played on personal computers.
 
Turning now to expenses, Q4 total GAAP expenses were $3.3 billion, up 
21%, and non
-
GAAP expenses were $2.3 billion, up 42%. Our year
-
over
-
year GAAP expense growth rate slowed this quarter as we lap the 
introduction 
of stock
-
based compensation charges associated with the 
WhatsApp transaction. Non
-
GAAP expenses were driven by increases in head 
count related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended the 
year with nearly 12,700 employees, up 38% compared to
 
last year.
 
Our GAAP operating income was approximately $2.6 billion, representing a 
44% operating margin. Our non
-
GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, 
representing a 60% operating margin. Our Q4 GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates 
were 39% and 36% respectively
. Our Q4 GAAP net income was 
approximately $1.6 billion or $0.54 per share, and our non
-
GAAP net income 
was $2.3 billion or $0.79 per share. In the full year 2015, capital 
expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data 
centers, n
etwork infrastructure, and office facilities to support the rapid 
growth of the business. We ended the year with over $18.4 billion in cash 
and investments.
 
Turning now to the outlook, first some color on revenue. We expect the 
factors that drove the stron
g growth of our advertising business in 2015 will 
continue into 2016. However, we expect to continue to face foreign 
exchange headwinds especially early in the year as we will be lapping 
periods where the dollar was relatively weaker than it is today. More
 
importantly 
--
 
sorry, more broadly, the overall macro
-
environment 
introduces the level of uncertainty around global growth and exchange rates 
that could impact our business in 2016. And we do expect to face tougher 
comparables as the year progresses, give
n the remarkably strong 
advertising performance in 2015.
 
Turning now to expense guidance, 2016 will be another significant 
investment year for Facebook. In 2015, we continued investing heavily in 
the core. At the same time, we doubled our investment levels
 
in our next 
generation services which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger and 
we tripled our investment levels in our long
-
term areas of focus which 
includes our connectivity efforts, Oculus and our AI investments. We will 
continue investing signif
icantly in all of these areas in 2016. We expect the 
year
-
over
-
year growth rate for full year 2016 total GAAP expenses to be 
approximately 30% to 40%, and for full year 2016 total non
-
GAAP expenses 
to be approximately 45% to 55%.
 
Note these ranges represen
t total operating expenses 
--
 
including cost of 
revenue. These ranges also include the cost of revenue impact of the 
expected shipments of Oculus Rift, so we expect that impact to be 
immaterial to our overall total expenses for the year. We anticipate our 
2016 
capital expenditures will be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. We 
recently announced that we will be 
--
 
begin building a new data center in 
Clonee, Ireland and that project is on top of the new data center being built 
in Fort Worth Texas. We
 
expect our 2016 stock
-
based compensation to be in 
the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is 
related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect 2016 
amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to 
$800 million.
 
And lastly, we anticipate that our Q1 and full year 2016 GAAP and non
-
GAAP 
tax rates to be in the low 30s on a percentage basis, down from our 2015 
range. We expect our tax rates will decline further over time and resemble 
those for our globa
l peers over the next several years. In addition in 2016, 
we expect for the first time to pay a significant amount of U.S. income tax 
on a cash basis.
 
To conclude, 2015 was an outstanding year for Facebook. Our performance 
reflects the strong growth and en
gagement of our community, the 

making on our mission to connect the world.
 
With that Chris, we would like to open up the call for questions.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Douglas 
Anmuth with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Thanks for taking my question. Two things I wanted
 
to ask. First Mark, just 
on Messenger and WhatsApp, can you just talk more about the takeaway on 


with WhatsApp goin
g forward? And then secondly Dave perhaps or Sheryl on 
the ad load, few years ago you talked about ad load at mid
-
single
-
digit 
levels and then more recently is up significantly since then. Do you still feel 
like there is still significant room to increase 
ad load here and how do you 
think about the theoretical ceiling there? Thanks.
 
Dave Wehner
 
I can start with the ad load question, Doug. So, ad load is definitely up 
significantly from where we were a couple of years ago. And as I mentioned, 

 
factors driving an increasing inventory. Really one thing to 
kind of think about here is that improving the quality and the relevance of 
the ads has enabled us to show more of them and without harming the 
experience, and our focus really remains on the ex

continue to monitor engagement and sentiment very carefully. I mentioned 
that we expect the factors that drove the performance in 2015 to continue to 

loads.
 
Ma
rk Zuckerberg
 
On Messenger, the platform efforts in 2015 focused on two things. One was 
expanding the different types of content that people could share in 
Messenger. And that diversity is going really well. And we see continued 
increase in video sharing a
nd photos and stickers, and a lot of stuff that you 
would just call fun but that people really enjoy as different ways to express 
themselves. But in terms of the business, the more important piece is how 
people can interact with businesses through Messenge
r. And we started 
some early small tests around f8 last year where with some ecommerce 
services made it so that people who were buying things could follow up with 
the business and get customer support and buy more things. And we went 
through this process o

with all these system well. And I think everyone is really happy with that so 

for how we look to make Messenger a busines

happy with the initial results. There is obviously a lot more there that we

The next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is ope
n.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just asking for more color on 

you seeing in terms of user engagement as you continue to move ad load up 
on the product? What a
dvertiser adoption of the product is? I know you gave 
us a little bit of color during the prepared comments. And also pricing on the 
environment inside the platform, as you continue to rollout deeper with the 
advertising products? Thank you so much.
 
Sheryl
 
Sandberg
 
When we introduce ads into feed and continue to increase the ad load, we 

we also look at the quality of ads. And our basic belief is that if we have high 
quality ads, tho
se create a good consumer experience and we can look at 
what consumers are doing, because we can understand how actively 


 
And 
as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers in Facebook are now 


platforms.
 

se platforms is that they combine the art 
and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about 
and targeting. So to share another example from a holiday, Shutterfly did a 
Facebook and Instagram, both the brand and direct response holi
day 
campaign on mobile. And what they did was just beautiful pictures but also 
targeting very specifically to women with specific interest, such as things like 
weddings and babies, and they saw a 6.4 times return on ad spend. We

The next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is 
open.
 
Heather Bellini
 
I just had two quick questions. One, Sh
eryl, I just wanted to follow up on 
what you said about Facebook and Instagram, and the overlap in the 
advertisers. And I was wondering if you could share with us how you feel 
those advertisers view it; do they view it as an incremental platform or there 
h
as been some question about whether or not some advertisers might take 
their spending and just move it over to Instagram. I am just wondering if 
you see incremental spending as a result of opening up both platforms. And 
then the second question would just 
be to Mark. Just I was wondering 
--
 
I 
know you mentioned Oculus and the preorders. I was just wondering if you 

launch of Oculus preorders. And also we obviously all know the big gaming
 
impact. But I am just wondering from your perspective, as you look out 
what industries do you think are 
--
 
where this could be the most disruptive 
outside of gaming? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

w much joy, but 

market. There are about 
--
 


are going to 
be most interested from the early VR experiences, especially at 

interested in this as the social company is that we think that this is going to 
be a new way that people interact. And
 
if you tried out the Toybox demo 

with another person and you can interact with the environment and use your 
hands, you can 
--
 

you can 

people in all these different ways that would be very difficult in the rest of 

investment for 
us. And it is ultimately I think going to change the way that 
we communicate and live and work in addition to how we play games. But I 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On the Instagram question, certainly in the short
-
run, some of the spend
 
is 

they have a social budget or Facebook budget and some of that moves to 

-

 
really well
-
positioned to take share from 
other platforms out there. We believe both Facebook and Instagram have 
this combination of an ability to do great creative with the best targeting in a 
most sophisticated measurement which shows businesses how we 
help them 
move products off shelves.
 
And we want and we tell our clients we want to be the best dollar, the best 
euro, the best pound and the best minute you spend. And we really 
encourage them to measure their ROI and compare us to other 
platforms. 
We think that comparison bodes very well for our growth. We also think that 
continued consumer shift to mobile devices bodes well for our growth as 

We have to continue 
to build the right products. We have to continue to 
measure all the way through from seeing an ad impression to sell. And so

The next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your l
ine is open.
 
Ben Schachter
 

you launching more such apps and could a standalone video app would be a 
part of that particularly for people who just want to watch a video? And then 
s
econdly on the virtual reality, another question. Can you just discuss the 
supply constraints in terms of how many units you can ship per month? And 
should we expect those shipments to accelerate into the holiday? And then 
also related to that, how are you
 
going to work with retailers to show 
consumers the power of Oculus in store and in person? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
So, on the apps question, the ones that have done the best are things that 
augment core Facebook functionality for large subsets of the comm
unity. So, 
for example, we have this Pages Manager App. There are 50 million 
businesses that have pages on Facebook. And while that is not a huge 

large number of people and busines
ses. And giving a focused experience for 
the person who wants to run their business through Facebook and be 

incredibly engaging experience that drives content into the system and 
is 
good overall. We have introduced a number of things like that for public 


than 800 million people using it. S

Operator
 
The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two, the first one is to go back to some of the core Facebook 
a
dvertising success. I wonder if you could talk about some of the Facebook 
video, ad, learning and kind of positive you have encountered and hurdles 
that you still encounter that could be holding back advertisers from moving 
further, video budgets out of th
e platform. And then the second one, we 
always see this gap between Asia and rest of world monetization versus 
North America and Europe. I was wondering if you just kind talk through 
some strategies and qualitative drivers you see over the next couple of y
ears 
that are going increase the overall Asia and rest of world monetization even 
further?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I think our approach to increasing monetization around the world is really 
the same. We need to build really compelling ad products with great format
s 


remarks, Slideshow, the Slideshow product is 
--
 
enables a video like 
experience which phone with lower connec
tion speeds and feature phone by 
series of photos. So, Coca
-
Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria. They took 
screenshots of a video ad they have produced for other markets, they 
uploaded them with text; and they reached 2 million people with a 10
-
point 
lift 
in ad awareness. So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is 
by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in 
India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to 
connect to those advertising metri
cs and business metrics around the world.
 

growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing. We have 
500 million people watching video a day. And the fact that so muc
h video is 
being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow 
because we want the formats to match. Marketers also really love video and 



are doing video but all of our market segments. Direct response, SMBs who 
have uploaded 1.5 million videos and have both organic and paid in the last 
month, and developers. The video ad spend is n
ot all incremental of course 

place of an ad with another format.
 
In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that 
video formats are different on Facebo

watching the whole 30
-
second video ad with sound, but there are some 

watching with sound. And one of the challenges we have in the market is 
convincing marketers and agencies and people that make the video to 

great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks that when 
people are willing to experiment, this is a p
retty unique canvas. You can do 
short form with sound off, you can be longer firm with sound on and 
everything in between. And our ability to persuade marketers to experiment 
is going to be a major driver of how much we can do here.

The next quest
ion is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Your line is open.
 
Justin Post
 

usage update and time spent, wondering if video or any other products are 
having a big
 
impact on usage and if you can give us any metrics there. And 
then maybe one for Sheryl, we have you have at 8% of all media time 

other forms of media based on time spent or maybe 
a little bit below. And 
then maybe one for Dave, 60% margins last quarter, obviously very strong. 
And just wondering what you think about the long

term, any comments on 
long

term margins?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

e case that consumers 
have shifted to mobile and businesses need to catch up. The exact [ph]

o. We really need to 
prove to clients particularly as they scale and we become a bigger part of 

advertising like TV and other have very established metrics that people have 
believed fo
r a very long time. We think our targeting can be better than any 
other platform. We also believe our ability to measure results can be deeper,

client.
 



bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do 
big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly, broadly targeted on 
Facebook. And 
we are able to increase the reach and increase brand 
favorability. So for the most part when people are doing big campaigns, 

 
Dave Wehner
 
Justin on time spent, there is no questio
n that video is helping us on time 

--
 

than the hours per day

or sorry time spent per day that Mark mentioned 
on video. So no updates on stats there other than that. In terms of our 
long
-


really investing in new areas today where we see a long
-
term opportunity 
for revenue growth. That
 
being said, we do think there is a lot of margin 
potential in this business, given the focus on advertising, but no target at 
this point.
 
Operator
 
The next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is 
open.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Thanks 

wondering what is your strategy for professional video content going 
forward. You talked a lot about video with bringing professional media 
content to Facebook, accelerate video engagement 
adoption. And then for 

revenue or financials. But wondering if the acceleration in the quarter, would 
you say 
--
 
was that driven more so by the step up in Instagram given the 
opening up o
f the API, the incremental Instagram ad load or was there a 
commensurate acceleration in the core of Facebook revenue? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
In terms of video content, newsfeed is as interesting as the quality of the 

hat users are generating a lot of really 
high quality content, often pretty short form that people are really happy to 

beginning with people really understanding the power of the sm
artphones 
and lot of people are walking around with particularly in developed market. 
We are working with publishers to try to make the content experience better 
inside of newsfeed. The best example of that is probably news with Instant 
Articles where we f
igured out that, it was the slowest upload experience you 
could have in newsfeed to link off to an outside article. So, we worked with 

seeing great engagement from that.
 

e had conversations with makers of Premium Content, I think 


worth noting that much of the engagement and cons
umption we have is 
short form, not long form.

performance of Instagram and it certainly made a contribution this quarter.

really driving the top

Facebook itself in the quarter.

The next question is from Carlos Karjner with Bernstein. Your line is open.
 
Carlos Karjner
 
I have two quick questions.
 

other things beyond liking content. I think you call it Reactions; I call it 
adding more words to the Facebook graph. Can you talk about the rollout of 
this capability and whether this is something that you
 
only see at 

other sites, much like the like button? And secondly, can you talk about 
thinking of the role of the different Facebook platforms in payments? I think 
that you will not do,

vis payments? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

handful of
 
countries to start just to make sure that we have the UI and 
interaction simple enough that people could express more of what they 
wanted without getting in their way, it is adding a little bit of complexity to 
something that is very simple, say just a on
e tap like button. But the 
philosophy behind it is that when you only have a like button, if you share a 
sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not 
have the tool to react to it. And therefore over time the community feels less 
c
omfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. And we want people 
to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them not just the 
things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it. And 

eally important to the mission of the company and 

that we care about.
 
And so far I think there are a few tweaks that we needed to make to 
reaction since initially testing it. But i


 
On payments, the basic strategy that we have is to make it especially in 
products like Messenger that where the business interaction maybe a bit 
more 
transactional, to take all the friction out of making the transactions 


payment. We look at the stuff that Ap
ple is doing with Apple Pay for example 
as a really neat innovation in the space that takes a lot of friction out of 
transactions as well. And our view is that the less friction, the better the 
user experience, the more people can easily interact with busi
nesses that 
they care about. And ultimately for our business that will drive up the 
amount that businesses are willing to pay to advertise to send people into 


bout that.

Michael Nathanson
 

Sheryl if you look at the fourth quarter, as you said as 
defining moment for 
marketers and with the friction of transactions again easier. Was there any 
type of shift in the marketers or verticals that move money to Facebook in 

of the c
ompetition of who is buying in fourth quarter?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Fourth quarter is a holiday quarter, so our top verticals were ecommerce, 
CPG and retail. Our growth is really broad

based, and I think it really shows 
how important the targeting can be. What 

year and plan to invest even more in over the next year is worked hard on 
vertical specific targeting. So for example for the telecom industry being able 
to target existing consumers with new consumers with people who ar

Two questions, Sheryl, could you just talk about political advertising and 
how you
 
think about the attractiveness of

Facebook as a platform for political campaign? And then Mark, the story is in 
2012 with beginning of that year you realized just how powerful the 
movement was towards mobile devices and yo
u turned to your engineers 
and said we need to generate $1 billion in revenue off of mobile devices. And 

when you think about these two messaging platforms that you have that got 
a large

conversation with your engineers about 
those two messaging platforms? 
Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

diversified, so no one vertical drives our business. Yes, the 2016 election is a 
big deal in terms of ad spend but so is the World 
Cup, so Super Bowl every 
year, so are events like the Olympics. We are excited about the targeting 


Instagram 
ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by 
interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those. And 

 


happening with the elections organically on Facebook. Facebook is really the 
new town hall. And connecting the people who are running for office, both at 
the national and the local level with people directly has been really 
important. Every member of Congress in the United States is now on 


get on Facebook themselves and interact taking
 
questions from their 
potential voters directly. And we think that kind of direct engagement where 
people can hold their elected officials accountable and elected officials can 
speak directly to constituents is a really important part of our mission and 
we

 
Mark Zuckerberg
 


had a 
conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then 

What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop 
and that people were shifting their usage
 
and that it was the more important 

not in our business first but in how we develop products. And I told all of our 
product team and when they come in reviews really just coming wit
h mobile. 
If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product, then I am going 
to kick you out; you have to come in and show me a mobile product. And 
that I think was just as a crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective and 
helping to motivate the org
anization to shift its energy towards focusing on 
mobile.
 
But if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period 
because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not 
as good as we wanted it to be and we had no ads on mobile.
 
And we actually 
prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ad there. So 
there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be 
as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always 
prioritized the exp

thing for the company.
 


who is one of the best pr
oduct leaders in the field to Messenger and why we 
bought WhatsApp, which the leading messaging product worldwide. And we 
have a formula for how we build these businesses. First, you build a great 
consumer experience that helps people share in a new way th

important. Then after that you can start to introduce organic ways that 
people can interact with businesses, so that in Facebook is pages, the 
businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the 
politicians, not necessary ads 
but organic interactions around not necessarily 
just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses. And 
then only once you have that ramped up to a good scale, can you really start 
dialing up advertising having that feel good and be a go
od part of your 
experience with good content because all those public figures and businesses 
are already participating in the platform at scale.
 

along in terms of having quite a matur
e pubic content. Ecosystem and ads 
are ramping well with good high quality ads because a lot of public figures 
and businesses are already investing in creating that kind of good content 

M
essenger and WhatsApp. In terms of making it so there are organic 
businesses and public figures, there is a bit more of that on WhatsApp 
already in terms of businesses using it and our Messenger, we are catching 

e we have those ecosystems 


that we do going forward.

it. We are the larges

million sports fans on our platform. And people are already using Facebook

Mark Zuckerberg
 
All right. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. This was a good quarter for 
our community and our business and a strong end to the year. There are 
now around 2.9 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or 
Messenger each month
 
and around 2.3 billion people using at least one of 
our services daily. There are now more than 140 million small businesses 
that use our services to grow, and the vast majority of which use our 
services for free.
 
Last year, I shared our four company prio
rities, and they're still our priorities 
in 2020: making progress on the major social issues, building qualitatively 
new product experiences, continuing to grow our business, and getting out 
there and communicating more transparently. Today, I'm going to f
ocus 
mostly on the new product experiences we're building, but before I get to 
that, this is going to be another critical year for making progress on social 
issues. We're very focused on election integrity, and this is an area where 
I'm proud of the progre
ss that we've made preventing foreign interference. 
We were behind in 2016, but after working to protect elections in countries 
across the world from the EU 
--
 
in the EU to India to Mexico to the U.S. 
midterms for the past few years, we think our systems a
re now more 
advanced than any other companies. And we're often alerting law 
enforcement and intelligence about threats that we identify. There's still 
going to be debate about what kinds of political speech should be allowed, 
especially as the 2020 electio
ns heat up. But by any objective measure, our 
efforts in election integrity have made a lot of progress.
 
This is also going to be a big year for our greater focus on privacy as well. 
As part of our FTC settlement, we committed to building privacy controls 
and 
auditing that will set a new standard for our industry, going beyond anything 
that's required by law today. We currently have more than 1,000 engineers 
working on privacy
-
related projects and helping to build out this program.
 
Related to this, just yes
terday, we announced that we're rolling out a Privacy 
Checkup tool to nearly 2 billion people, reminding them of the controls they 
have and making sure that they're set the way that they want them. We also 
introduced a new tool that notifies you anytime yo
ur account signs into a 
new service. So, it's going to take time, but over the next decade, I want us 
to build a reputation on privacy that's as strong as our reputation around 
building good, stable services.
 
When it comes to these important social issues,
 
I don't think the private 
companies should be making so many important decisions by themselves. I 
don't think that each service should have to individually decide what content 
or advertising is allowed during elections or what content is harmful overall. 
There should be a more democratic process for determining these rules and 
regulations. For these issues, it's not enough for us to just make principal 
decisions. The decisions also need to be seen as legitimate and reflecting 
what the community wants. And 
that's why I've called for clearer regulation 
for our industry. And until we get clearer rules or establish other 
mechanisms of governance, I expect that we and our whole industry will 
continue to face a very high level of scrutiny.
 
So during this, our job
 
is to keep doing what we think is right on the social 
issues and to stay focused on continuing to deliver product improvements 
and better experiences for our community. The product areas that I'm most 
focused on for the next chapter of our company are bui
lding out the private 
social platform and more intimate communities, enabling more commerce 
and payments and delivering the next computing platform. When I look at 
the Internet today, we all have this ability to connect with people, content, 
and opportunit
ies coming from all around the world in ways that were 
unimaginable just a generation ago. And I grew up in a town of 10,000 
people and making long distance calls anywhere outside the area was very 
expensive. Today, we all have access to billions of people
, and that's made it 
easier to find people that are into the same things that you are. But as our 
networks and communities have gotten so large, we increasingly crave a 
sense of intimacy and privacy. So, delivering this experience is our focus.
 
And across 
our services, the greatest growth in how people are 
communicating continues to come from private messaging, small groups, 
and disappearing stories where your data doesn't stick around forever. 
There's a lot more to do here. While the Facebook and Instagram
 
apps have 
developed with lots of different ways to interact with the people you care 
about, our private communication apps are still pretty much just about 
texting, so we spent the last year building infrastructure to turn our private 
messaging apps, What
sApp and Messenger into richer, private social 
platforms where you can hang out and be present with friends, find groups 
with your interest, engage with businesses more naturally. So, some of 
these are bigger projects like full end
-
to
-
end encryption, inter
operability 
across the apps, or rewriting our apps for performance. And they're going to 
take a long time to see through. But we should start seeing more new 
experiences later this year, and this will all be built on a very strong privacy 
foundation.
 
Comme
rce and payments is another area that will be important for the 
private social platform, but also across all of our apps, including Facebook 
and Instagram. Our goal here is to make sure that every individual, a small 
business entrepreneur out there has the
 
same opportunity and access to the 
same type of sophisticated tools that historically only the big companies 
have had access to, so that's what we stand for putting power in individual's 
hands.
 
One example that we've been working on is WhatsApp Payments w
here 
you're going to be able to send money as quickly and easily as sending a 
photo. We got approval to test this with 1 million people in India back in 
2018. And when so many of the people kept using it week after week, we 
knew it was going to be big when
 
we get to launch. I'm really excited about 
this, and I expect this to start rolling out in a number of countries and for us 
to make a lot of progress here in the next 6 months.
 
Beyond WhatsApp Payments, we're working on several other efforts to help 
facil
itate more commerce from Facebook Marketplace to Instagram 
Shopping, to our work on Facebook Pay or our work on Libra. This is such a 
big space, and it's important for empowering people. So we're taking a 
number of different approaches here, ranging from p
eople buying and selling 
to each other directly to businesses setting up storefronts, to people 
engaging with businesses directly through messaging and a number of 
things on payments ranging from existing 
--
 
using existing national systems 
like India's UPI
 
to creating new global systems. Having small businesses 
succeed is not only key to creating broad economic growth where everyone 
can support themselves, it's also important to maintaining healthy 
communities since small businesses are often where people c
ome together. 
We see on our services all the time how small businesses that use our tools 
are often at the heart of their local communities. So this is a top priority for 
us on both fronts, for the social mission and the business.
 
We've also been focusing 
on delivering the next computing platform with 
augmented and virtual reality. The defining characteristic of AR and VR is 
that they deliver the sense of presence, like you're right there with another 
person or in another place. And this is the Holy Grail o
f social experiences. 
And it's going to let us build things that we've only dreamed of for the last 
15 years, like letting people interact as if they're in person together no 
matter where they are or letting people live wherever they want and 
hologram into
 
work so they can access opportunities anywhere and don't 
have to move to a city or another country to find a job.
 
So while full augmented reality is still a number of years away, we hit a real 
milestone for virtual reality with Quest. Sales are stronger t
han we expected, 
and people are buying and engaging with more content than we'd expected 
to. On Christmas Day, people bought almost $5 million worth of content in 
the Oculus store. And that's an outlier day, but still, this is real volume by 
any measure. A
nd it shows the progress that this ecosystem is making.
 
The experience also just keeps on getting better. Last quarter, we shipped 
hand tracking, which almost no one thought was going to be possible with 
the Quest hardware. And we shipped Oculus Link, so n
ow you can run all of 
your Rift content from your PC on Quest.
 
On the AR side, while we're working on the long
-
term hardware and 
operating system, it's worth noting that our Spark AR platform is the most 
widely used AR platform in the world with hundreds o
f millions of people 
interacting with effects every month. Artists are using this to create new 
face filters and other tools that are going viral across Instagram and 
Facebook. We're well positioned here overall, and we're going to keep 
developing this pla
tform.
 
So those are some of the bigger product initiatives that I'm excited about. 
And aside from these, we're also focused on communicating more clearly 
what we stand for. One critique of our approach for much of the last decade 
was that because we wanted
 
to be liked, we didn't always communicate our 
views as clearly because we were worried about offending people. So this led 
to some positive but shallow sentiment towards us and towards the 
company. And my goal for this next decade isn't to be liked, but t
o be 
understood. Because in order to be trusted, people need to know what you 
stand for.
 
So we're going to focus more on communicating our principles, whether 
that's standing up for giving people a voice against those who would censor 
people who don't agre
e with them, standing up for letting people build their 
own communities against those who say that the new types of communities 
forming on social media are dividing us, standing up for encryption against 
those who say that privacy mostly helps bad people, 
standing up for 
--
 
giving small businesses more opportunity and sophisticated tools against 
those who say that targeted advertising is a problem, or standing up for 
serving every person in the world against those who say that you have to 
pay a premium in o
rder to really be served.
 
These positions aren't always going to be popular, but I think it's important 
for us to take these debates head
-
on. I know that there are a lot of people 
who agree with these principles, and there are a whole lot more who are 
open
 
to them and want to see these arguments get made. So expect more 
of that this year.
 
This is going to be another important year. It's going to be an intense year 
with the election. Some of our long
-
term technology bets are going to start 
coming to fruition
. We have strong business momentum, and we have to get 
out there and show what we stand for. As always, I'm grateful to all of you 
for your support and for being on this journey with us.
 
And now I'm going to hand it over to Sheryl to talk about our busines
s.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a good quarter across the board 
and a strong end to the year. Q4 ad revenue was $20.7 billion, increasing 
25% year
-
over
-
year. Full year ad revenue grew 27% compared to 2018.
 
We're focused on 
creating value over the long term for our community and 
for the 140 million businesses around the world who use our platform to 
connect with customers and grow. The majority use our free tools, but there 
are also more than 8 million businesses who advertis
e with us. This is 
because we help businesses create a mobile presence, increase sales, build 
the right relationships with customers and hire people. We will continue to 
focus on helping businesses use our free and paid tools to reach the people 
who matter
 
the most.
 
Throughout the holiday season, people used our apps to take advantage of 
the best deals and shop for the perfect gifts. We saw particular strength with 
e
-
commerce and online retailers who optimized for measurable objectives 
like website visits o
r sales. Pura Vida, a jewelry company based in San 
Diego, ran ads on Facebook and Instagram for a 50% off sale. In 9 days, 
they sold more than 300,000 bracelets, supporting more than 800 artisans 
around the world.
 
People often adopt new technologies before
 
businesses, and we try to make 
it as easy as possible for businesses to catch up. Stories is a great example. 
We recently announced 4 million advertisers are using Stories, up from 2 
million this time last year. Bombas, a sock and apparel company, used 
In
stagram Stories to show people wearing their stocks while ice
-
skating and 
gift wrapping. As a result, they saw a 60% increase in purchases from 
people under 35.
 
In addition to helping businesses shift to new formats, we're also making it 
easier for people 
to shop directly on our apps. We launched Checkout on 
Instagram with a small closed beta in Q1 2019. We've fully been building the 
experience, and now hundreds of businesses in the U.S. are experimenting 
with Checkout. We're taking the time to get this rig
ht and growing fully so 
people and advertisers can benefit over the long term.
 
We give small and growing businesses like Pura Vida and Bombas the same 
tools that previously only the biggest firms could access. Large companies 
can buy national TV spots and 
large billboards, but most small businesses 
can't. That's why small businesses benefit the most from targeted ads. We 
help them reach a more focused audience with the right message, and we do 
it while protecting people's privacy. This really matters becaus
e as Mark 
said, when businesses of all sizes succeed, they hire people and invest in 
their communities. Last week, we released a report with Copenhagen 
Economics. According to 7,000 companies surveyed across 15 EU countries, 
our apps helped businesses cont
ribute about EUR 200 billion to the European 
economy just last year. Economists say this translates to more than 3 million 
new jobs last year alone.
 
I announced these findings in London last week where I had the chance to 
meet with Naomi Roberts. Naomi sta
rted Flare Audio with her husband to 
improve the sound quality in everything from earplugs to loudspeakers. 
More than 75% of their sales come from Facebook and Instagram. This has 
enabled them to export to more than 180 countries and grow their business 
fr
om 2 employees to 22.
 
Stories like Naomi's are why we remain committed to helping small 
businesses reach customers and grow, but we know it's not enough. We also 
have to keep people safe and give them control over their experience on our 
apps, and we are. 
This month, we announced a number of improvements to 
our industry
-
leading ad transparency tools, including a new feature that 
gives people the option to see fewer political ads. We also updated our ads 
library to make it more transparent and easier to navi
gate. These updates 
help people understand who is trying to reach them, and we believe that this 
transparency is critical to empowering people and keeping them safe.
 
We also want everyone to be in control of their privacy on Facebook. As 
Mark said, we are 
rolling out our updated Privacy Checkout 
--
 
Checkup tool 
to nearly 2 billion people around the world. With a few taps, people can 
control who sees what they share and how to keep their accounts secure.
 
I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our par
tners around the 
world. Every day, they give us valuable feedback on how to improve our 
products so we can help them turn great ideas into revenue, jobs and 
economic empowerment.
 
I also want to thank our teams around the world for working to solve tough 
ch
allenges while still building great products that businesses use to grow, 
compete and hire. Thanks to your continued dedication, we are better 
prepared to serve the billions of people who count on us.
 
Now here's Dave.
 
David Wehner
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good 
afternoon, everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter and 
ended a good year for our business. Full year 2019 revenue grew 27% to 
$71 billion, and we generated over $18 billion in net income.
 
Let's begin with our community metrics. In terms of family metrics, we 
est
imate that approximately 2.3 billion people used at least one of our 
services on a daily basis in December and that approximately 2.9 billion 
people were active on a monthly basis. As a reminder, the family metrics are 
our best estimate of the deduplicated
 
audience across Facebook, Instagram, 
Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe these numbers better reflect the size 
of our community and the fact that many people use more than one of our 
services. Beginning this quarter, we are including family metrics and rel
ated 
information in our SEC filings and the slide presentation on our investor 
website.
 
Turning now to Facebook. We are pleased with the growth of the Facebook 
community in all regions this quarter. Daily active users reached 1.7 billion, 
up 9% compared to
 
last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the 
Philippines. DAUs represented approximately 66% of the 2.5 billion monthly 
active users in December. MAUs grew 178 million or 8% compared to last 
year. We plan to continue to disclose Facebook
-
only comm
unity metrics 
through late 2020.
 
Turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $21.1 billion, up 25% or 26% 
on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained consta
nt 
with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been approximately $295 
million higher.
 
Q4 total ad revenue was $20.7 billion, up 25% or 26% on a constant 
currency basis. On a regional basis, ad revenue growth rates were strongest 
in Asia Pacific and Res
t of World, which grew 33% and 28%, respectively. 
Europe and U.S. and Canada grew more slowly at 24% and 22%, 
respectively.
 
In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services 
increased 31%, and the average price per ad decreased 5%. Simil
ar to last 
quarter, impression growth was driven primarily by Facebook News Feed, 
Instagram Stories and Instagram Feed. Facebook News Feed impression 
growth benefited largely from community growth and engagement trends on 
the Facebook app. The year
-
over
-
ye
ar decline in average price per ad was 
primarily driven by the ongoing mix shift towards ads on Stories and in 
geographies which monetized at lower rates. Other revenue was $346 
million, up 26%. Year
-
over
-
year growth was driven by sales of Oculus 
Quest.
 
Tu
rning now to expenses. Total expenses were $12.2 billion in Q4, up 34%. 
Cost of revenue increased 25%, and the growth was driven primarily by 
depreciation related to our infrastructure spend. R&D grew 36% and was 
driven primarily by increased investments i
n core product as well as our 
innovation efforts particularly in AR/VR. Marketing and sales grew 23% and 
was driven primarily by consumer and growth marketing. Finally, G&A grew 
87% largely driven by higher legal fees and settlements. This includes 
charges
 
related to a $550 million settlement in principle we reached this 
month in connection with the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act 
litigation.
 
We had over 9,300 net new hires in 2019 primarily in technical functions. 
We ended the year with approxim
ately 45,000 full
-
time employees, up 26 
compared to 
--
 
26% compared to last year.
 
Operating income was $8.9 billion, representing a 42% operating margin. 
Our tax rate was 20%. Net income was $7.3 billion or $2.56 per share. Full 
year capital expenditures w
ere $15.7 billion, up 12%, driven by investments 
in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. In 2019, 
we opened data centers in Nebraska, New Mexico and Denmark. These new 
data centers are supported by 100% renewable energy. We a
re committed 
to doing our part to help tackle the challenge of climate change. That's why 
we're working to minimize our energy emissions and water impact. Across 
the entire company, we are on track to meet our 2020 goal of supporting 
our global operations 
with 100% renewable energy and lowering our 
operational carbon emissions by 75% from 2017 levels.
 
We ended the year with $54.9 billion of cash and investments. I would note 
that though we booked the expense in 2019, we have not paid the $5 billion 
FTC fine
 
announced earlier this year as the agreement is still pending court 
approval. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 
--
 
we repurchased 
$1.3 billion of our Class A common stock and had $4.9 billion remaining of 
our prior authorization as of December 
31. Today, we announced a $10 
billion increase in our stock repurchase program authorization.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect our year
-
over
-
year total 
reported revenue growth rate in Q1 to decelerate by a low to mid
-
single
-
digit percentage po
int as compared to our Q4 growth rate. Factors driving 
this deceleration include the maturity of our business as well as the 
increasing impact from global privacy regulation and other ad targeting
-
related headwinds. While we have experienced some modest im
pact from 
these headwinds to date, the majority of the impact lies in front of us.
 
Turning now to expenses. We anticipate our 2020 total expenses will be in 
the range of $54 billion to $59 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. Our 
2020 capital expendi
tures outlook is also unchanged at $17 billion to $19 
billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office facilities and 
our network infrastructure. Lastly, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to 
be in the high teens.
 
In summary, Q4 was a str
ong finish to 2019. We are pleased with the 
growth of our community and business as we continue to focus on our 
mission.
 
And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator 
Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian 
Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two. Just the first one on Instagram Checkout, Instagram Commerce. 
I'm curious to hear about sort of early learnings of what you've learned from 
t
he hundreds of adopters and sort of what you think are the 1 or 2 key 
points of friction you really have to get over to build that business into a 
larger contributor over the next couple of years. And then, Dave, I guess to 
go back to your comment about th
e majority of the impact that lies ahead 
when you're thinking about ad targeting and privacy regulation, is there any 
more detail you can give us as sort of types of data or types of sort of 
breakage that you see as potential risk to the targeting and the 
efficacy of 
the ads going forward?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So I'll take the first part of the question. So when you think about the 
shopping experience or the checkout experience on Instagram, these are 
still very early days, and we're working hard to improve the 
product and 
expand to more businesses. These require full integration. So our focus is 
making sure we get the right partners on board and consumers have a great 
experience all the way through.
 
We expanded shopping to all 
--
 
shopping ads to all advertisers 
globally Q4, 
and we began testing checkout and shopping ads. And what you're going to 
see from us is very small steps to get more people in and make this deeper 
across the experience people have. But you are right that we are moving 
very slowly and very, v
ery, very carefully because we want to make sure the 
entire experiences is right across the board before we go deeper and go 
broader.
 
David Wehner
 
Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, we are seeing headwinds in terms of targeting and 
measurement. But as I noted, the m
ajority of that impact lies in front of us. 
Just as a reminder, we utilize signals from user activity on third
-
party 
website and services in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our 
users. And in that regard, there are sort of three overlying fac
tors that I'd 
point to, and I spoke to these on prior calls as well.
 
First, the recent regulatory initiatives like GDPR and now CCPA have 
impacted, and we expect they'll continue to impact our ability to use such 
signals. Secondly, mobile operating systems
 
and browser providers such as 
Apple and Google have announced product changes and future plans that 
will limit our ability to use those signals. And then finally, we've made our 
own product changes that gives users the ability to limit our use of such 
dat
a signals to improve ads and other experiences. And there I'd point to 
something like the rollout of off
-
Facebook activity controls, and that's at 
100% today.
 
So, each of these factors limits our ability to target and measure the 
effectiveness of ads on ou
r platform, and that can negatively impact our 
advertising revenue growth. Both Mark and Sheryl talked about the 
importance of ad targeting for small businesses. And I think it's important to 
note that the regulatory and platform changes will have a dispro
portionate 
impact on the ability of small businesses to use ads to grow and thrive.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
Great. Dave, can we talk about the growth rate in the fourth quarter, 
particularly in the U.
S.? Was there anything that surprised you guys or any 
particular cohort of advertisers that slowed down? If we look at your growth 
rate from 3Q to 4Q in the U.S., I think it was the lowest since 2012 in the 
fourth quarter. So any color on what happened in 
the fourth quarter, or was 
this in line with your plan?
 
David Wehner
 
Yes, thanks. Thanks, Ross. No real surprises there. We are pleased with our 
Q4 results. We had a strong holiday season despite it being abbreviated. In 
terms of the North American numbers
, we're seeing slower growth in our 
more mature markets. That's consistent with the outlook that we had going 
into the quarter. It's true in North America and our more developed markets 
within Europe, but I wouldn't say there's any real surprises there.
 
Op
erator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman 
Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini
 
I just wanted to follow up on the Checkout on Instagram. And obviously you 
guys mentioned that you're rolling it out very slowly, which is 
understandable. 
I'm just wondering how much of this is due to the 
integration you need to have with the businesses' inventory system. And 
how are you going about the integration work that needs to be done to 
make the experience seamless, where you could kind of match inve
ntory 
levels with what people are actually buying? And I guess the follow
-
up would 
be is there a benefit that you envision businesses getting from using this 
format versus one of your more traditional shopping ads?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So, the integration you s
poke of are the right ones we want. You want to be 
deeply integrated at a product level. It has to go all the way through for this 
to work from discovery, all the way through a pretty seamless checkout 
flow. And that's what we're working on, and that reall
y takes time. You're 
also right that we are very focused on commerce ads on Facebook, that the 
great, great, great majority of activity is commerce ads on Facebook. We 
had a very strong holiday season. We continue to see growth across 
Facebook, across Inst
agram in people who are discovering products they're 
interested in, and we're continuing to make a lot of investments there.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
A couple of question
s, first on the privacy commentary. Dave, has anything 
changed since third quarter when we're looking at less deceleration this 
year? Has there been incremental changes since then? And then secondly, 
on the expense outlook, I noticed headcount growth was a
round 26%. As far 
as getting to your headcount guide 
--
 
I mean to your expense guide, do you 
expect that growth to accelerate? And are there other kind of expense 
initiatives you'd call out for 2020?
 
David Wehner
 
Yes. Thanks, Justin. So I don't think 
anything has changed since Q3 in terms 
of our outlook on the headwinds that we have around ad signals. I think 
that's very consistent with what we've been talking about over the last 
several quarters. So I think we'll 
--
 
we continue to face those headwinds
, 
and they will be more impactful as we move forward.
 
In terms of the expense guide in 2020, I would say that obviously we plan to 
--
 
a large factor of our expense growth is driven off of headcount. And we're 
continuing to invest across the board in terms 
of our core R&D and 
innovation efforts in terms of headcount growth there.
 
In addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx 
over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another 
driver of our expense growth as
 
well. And there's other nonheadcount
-
related expenses that we expect to grow, including marketing and content 
investments.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Mark, you have multiple payment initiat
ives across the family. You talked 
about WhatsApp Payments, Facebook Pay, potentially more over time 
around Libra and Calibra. Can you just talk about the importance of 
payments across the family? And how do you tie these together as you work 
towards inter
operability?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. So we're doing a lot around commerce and payments because there are 
lots of different segments for what people are trying to do. In terms of 
buying and selling things, a lot of people want to buy and sell used goods. 
We ha
ve Facebook Marketplace for that. A lot of small businesses want to 
set up storefronts. We're enabling that through Instagram and Facebook and 
then increasingly through messaging as well.
 
From the payments side, WhatsApp Payments will be a part of Facebook
 
Pay. I mean we announced this program last year that basically we'll make it 
so if you pay for something in any of our apps, you only need to enter your 
credit card once, and then you can use that to have a more frictionless 
checkout experience across the
 
other apps. So those two things tie in 
together.
 
But we are taking multiple approaches on payments where things like what 
we're doing with Payments in WhatsApp or Facebook Pay overall are built on 
top of traditional payment infrastructure, whereas the lon
ger
-
term work that 
we proposed around Libra that's now being handled by the independent 
Libra Foundation where we're working on a wallet that will work with Libra. 
That is more a proposal to make it so that some of the payment 
infrastructure around the wor
ld can be more efficient, especially for things 
like transferring money across borders. And if you think about it, a lot of the 
companies that do payments and such today are kind of national and/or in 
one country. And there aren't that many folks who have 
an incentive to 
make this work well across different places around the world. So that's some 
place where we thought that we could add.
 
But overall, where 
--
 
a big focus for us is making sure that individuals and 
small businesses have access to the same kin
d of tools that historically only 
larger companies have had access to. Bigger companies are going to find 
ways to sell their things and measure the effectiveness of their ads and all 
that. A lot of the work that we end up doing goes towards making it easie
r 
for small businesses to be able to 
--
 
without a big technology shop, be able 
to use the same tools, get access to payments, set up storefronts easily, 
being able to measure the effectiveness of ads. And that's a lot of what 
we're focused on, and you hear
d Wehner talk about this a bit. A lot of the 
concerns that we have with some of the potential changes to the ecosystem 
we think will disproportionately hurt small businesses' ability to compete 
with larger companies.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from 
the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe two, if I can. Mark, you had talked previously about trying to more 
tightly integrate the applications in the family under the Facebook umbrella. 
I wonder if we could get an update on the way you're t
hinking about 
branding the applications to the consumer as well as integrating them on the 
tech back end as you look out over the next couple of years.
 
And then following up on the comment on messaging, I wondered if we can 
get an update on the way the tea
m is thinking about the messaging 
component on a monetization front and thinking about some of the more 
interesting products you might use to monetize the messaging applications, 
both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp as you look out over the next 
couple of 
years.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So on integration, overall here's how I think about it. We're going to 
keep the brands, right, from all the apps. Of course, right, I mean these are 
large communities that people love and strongly associate with a specific 
app.
 
So that's clearly going to stay.
 
In terms of integration, all the apps are already very integrated today. We 
all run off of common infrastructure. We've tried to run the company in a 
way where we have 
--
 
we set up the infrastructure, and we set up the 
bus
iness models. That way, an engineer improving the efficiency of one 
system makes all of the apps better. And that's 
--
 
everything is already very 
tightly integrated kind of below the surface, in a way that people using these 
apps may not feel. But I think 
that the push for the next few years is we 
think that in running a company, I want to make it so it's not just the back 
end engineers when they improve something, it improves everything.
 
We want to make it so that features that get built across Instagram o
r 
Facebook or WhatsApp and when people engage on those, it can also make 
your experience better across the other apps in the family, too. So that's 
kind of the philosophy behind why we're doing a number of things.
 
Some of it is just we built up multiple te
chnical stacks in some places that 
didn't need to exist. The voice calling stack on WhatsApp and Messenger, 
there's not a real reason why those need to be different. But we didn't 
standardize that layer historically, and that means that now we have to put 
twice as much work into making that good. If we got that to be integrated, 
then the same engineering effort could just make it better across everything 
at a faster rate.
 
So there's going to be more work like that. I think some of it will start to be 
more v
isible across the apps. The apps will always continue to have their 
own identity and brand now because they 
--
 
people use them for somewhat 
different things, and that's really important.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali fro
m SunTrust.
 
Youssef Squali
 
Okay. Great. I actually just have one question. Could you guys provide us 
any update around Facebook Dating? That is not one product that, Mark, you 
talked about. Any stats that you can share with us? Any plans to push into 
other
 
geos? And would you bring it to Instagram as well?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So before we answer that, I'm going to go back and answer the messaging 
monetization, second half of the last question, if that's okay, and then we'll 
take this one.
 
On 
messaging, we are so really focused on this. And we think, in many 
ways, we're better positioned than anyone else in the industry to participate 
in the opportunity that should be there over the long run for businesses and 
consumers to connect on message. I
n terms of direct ads in messaging, 
we're taking that very slowly. We have a very slow rollout in Messenger. We 
don't have that rolled out in WhatsApp.
 
Where we are seeing a lot of growth and really exciting metrics right now 
are click
-
to
-
messaging ads. Th
ese are one of the fastest
-
growing ad formats 
in our family, especially with SMBs in markets like APAC, but really across 
the board. And what happens is that from Facebook or Instagram Feed or 
from Facebook, Instagram or Messenger Stories, you can click
-
to
-
message a 
business on Messenger or WhatsApp. It's a really good way to drive 
engagement. It also really takes people further down the funnel from seeing 
an ad to having a direct connection with businesses, which consumers like 
and businesses like. We also
 
think the ROI is very high here.
 
So I'll share an example. Manulife from Vietnam is an insurance company. 
They use click
-
to
-
messaging ads to generate qualify leads. And compared to 
Facebook lead ads, which were already performing well, those ads had 2.4x 
more qualified leads and a 4x increase in sales. And so we think the 
combination of the discovery ads that we can do, clicking through the 
Messenger right now already shows the potential of how important 
messaging can be for businesses.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes
. And I could talk a little bit about the Dating experience. It's going well. 
I don't think we have any specific stats to share on this, but it's going well. 
And we 
--
 
I think we're already one of the top dating services, and we 
expect to continue growing.
 
In terms of where we launched it, we launched a number of countries before 
bringing it to the U.S. And our product development approach is that we 
launch something, and then we get feedback. We try to test things before 
we launch them. But then there are 
some things that you can't learn until 
you have it out. And then we will kind of keep on iterating on it until 
--
 
in a 
number of countries, people who use it really like it and keep using it. And 
then we rolled it out to more countries. So we did that over
 
the last year. 
We'll continue doing that in more places, but the U.S. was certainly one of 
the biggest places that we were focused on launching it.
 
Overall, I mean the way that Dating fits into the strategy here is within the 
Facebook app, we think that N
ews Feed is really central and that it's one of 
the only things that we think everyone who uses the app is really going to 
use on a daily basis. But there are different social utilities that even if not 
everyone wants to use them, hundreds of millions of p
eople might find value 
in. So whether that's Marketplace for buying and selling things. Groups and 
communities, we think, is increasingly ubiquitous, but the tab there isn't 
going to be used by everyone. It's going to be used by hundreds of millions 
of peo
ple. Things like Watch or the News tab that we have started rolling out 
are not things that we expect everyone to use. But even if tens or hundreds 
of millions of people use them, then we're adding unique value that other 
folks might not be able to build, 
and we're making the app more valuable.
 
So I kind of expect in a year or 2, the world that we're going to be in is 
people use Facebook, they're going to use News Feed, and then they're 
probably each going to have 2 or 3 other of these social utilities that
 
they 
find valuable. And as we start building those, I think that that's some part of 
the story that you're seeing on why the Facebook app engagement has been 
strong recently is 
--
 
especially as we build more of these things that 
certainly is showing up in
 
how people use the app.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Two things, one, congrats on the carbon reduction goal, love that. 
Posted about it. Mark, you'd be happy to know that. But love to see mor
e 
companies do that. The real question I have to do 
--
 
have has to do with the 
security of the platform in this election year. And so can you just talk about 
the confidence you have? And I know there's a lot of things you can't 
control, but I am sure that 
there's going to be a lot of controversy around 
the elections, or I assume that's going to be the case. There may well be 
bad actor interference as there was 4 years ago. To the extent you think 
that Facebook and its platforms are ready to handle that bett
er prepared, is 
there anything you could do to talk more about that, quantify it whatever? 
Just how you were trying to hedge that risk, which I think is going to be a 
material risk this year.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. This is certainly something that we're extr
emely focused on. And I do 
think that there is going to be a lot that we need to be watching out for this 
year. Since 
--
 
in 2016, I think it's very fair to say that we were behind where 
we needed to be as with a lot of 
--
 
the rest of the industry and gover
nments 
as well and expecting the kind of information operations that we now have 
seen.
 
Now the good news is that since then, it's not like this is the first presidential 
election that we've had to play a part in defending the integrity of. There 
have been 
major elections across the world, and each time, we're able to 
see the tactics of the foreign adversaries evolve. Because we and others 
weren't really focused on that in 2016 as much, we've been able to improve 
at quite a fast rate. There are also good par
tnerships in place now across the 
industry, across law enforcement, the intelligence communities, not just in 
the U.S. but across other countries, too. So I think the systems are much 
more robust.
 
And you can look at the results in other elections around t
he world where, 
for example, in the EU elections last year where a lot of people were very 
worried that there would be this kind of foreign interference. I actually had 
gone to the EU Parliament and testified about what we were going to do. 
And then I thin
k the EU Parliament President after released a statement 
saying that we'd met our commitments and did the things that we said we 
were going to do, and it was a relatively clean election.
 
So it's 
--
 
we're going to continue seeing the adversaries get more ad
vanced. 
And I think certainly because this got a lot of attention, it's not just Russia at 
this point. We've seen similar types of attempts from Iran, China and some 
places, others as well. So there's more to kind of look out for there. But 
overall, I do f
eel confident about where we are.
 
One of the things that I think we need to look out for, that the intelligence 
community has warned us about is some of the goal of some of these 
nation
-
state actors is not necessarily to interfere directly, but to just sow
 
doubt about the legitimacy of an election. So even to the extent that we may 
not even see specific attacks, but if there's a big meme that there is 
widespread interference, that has the same effect in terms of kind of sowing 
doubt about things. So we're v
ery focused on this and making sure that 
people know what we're doing, so that they can have confidence. And this is 
just 
--
 
this is really a top priority for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
 
Colin Sebastia
n
 
Great. Two for me as well. Following up on the shopping commerce 
question, I wonder if the focus here includes expanding Marketplace across 
multiple services or if that seems like better as a distinct application. And 
then separately, curious on some of 
the newer visual apps such as Threads 
and Lasso, what are you seeing here in terms of usage or engagement? And 
are these features that ultimately fit within existing apps or also might be 
distinct from the current services?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I can talk about
 
Marketplace. Marketplace is growing nicely. It's now used by 
hundreds of millions of people every month. We also rolled out ads in 
Marketplace, which are available in 94 markets, which means advertisers 
can extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace. We're
 
seeing a lot of 
interest, especially with retail and auto advertisers. It's very early, but we're 
seeing good results. So we believe this is a good opportunity we're going to 
continue to invest. But for the foreseeable future, even within this, ads 
remain
s the great focus.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. And I think you mentioned Threads and Reels and a couple of the apps 
that we've launched within Instagram. It's still early. I think there are some 
promising signs. We're figuring out the extent to which those should
 
grow to 
be big, independent apps over time, or should be integrated into the core of 
the Instagram service or our other messaging apps. So we'll figure that over 
time, but those are certainly both important spaces to be in, visual 
messaging and kind of in
terest
-
based talent showing Stories

type 
functionality.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Rippey from Evercore ISI.
 
Kevin Rippey
 
Mark, this is really one for you. You described the new experiences that 
could be rolling out in the 
back half of the year. Could you just maybe 
provide a little more color on that and kind of what you're envisioning? It 
would be great to hear.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. I've been talking a lot about how we're trying to build out our private 
messaging apps 
into richer, private social platforms. And the idea there is 
that people want to interact in lots of different ways. And in Facebook and 
Instagram, you can interact with a lot of people you know or interested in 
connecting with them in a number of differen
t ways.
 
But our texting apps today are primarily still texting. So a lot of what we've 
been trying to do is make it so that we build out the infrastructure, so that 
way WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram direct can evolve rather than 
being just places wh
ere you message folks. They can be places where you 
can hang out and feel more present with people, where you can connect to 
different groups in different ways, interact with businesses and do payments 
and commerce.
 
And when we kicked off this big initiati
ve, a lot of the stuff was long
-
term 
infrastructure that we needed to get started building. So we've now been 
--
 
we're now a year or so into 
--
 
starting to build out a lot of that. So I guess 
what I'm saying is I just expect some of this to land in this ye
ar. Not all of it, 
some of the stuff is longer term. For example, the work that we're doing on 
full end
-
to
-
end encryption, that's just 
--
 
that's a long
-
term project. We want 
to make sure we get the safety implications of that right. Already fully rolled 
ou
t around WhatsApp. We're really committed to making sure that we nail 
the safety parts of that before fully rolling it out across Messenger and 
Instagram as well. So some parts of this will not land this year, but I expect 
a lot of this will start to land 
this year around this vision of building the 
private social platform.

Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
So this is the second quarter in a row where you guys have called out core 
Facebook a
s the key driver of impression growth. So wondering if you can 
just elaborate a bit on what's driving that strength in core blue engagement, 
whether this is something you guys expect to continue.
 
And I guess kind of as a follow
-
up related to that, there's 
been some press 
you plan a Super Bowl ad specific to the Facebook Groups product. So any 
updates on engagement around Groups or how the strength there is 
impacting the ad business? Any color you could share would be great.
 
David Wehner
 
Yes. Okay. So I'll t
ake that, Lloyd. Yes. I mean we have 
--
 
we are pleased 
with the engagement that we're seeing on the Facebook app broadly. And as 
you'd mentioned, this has been a pretty consistent story over the last 
several quarters. So I don't think it's particularly a n
ew story, but we're 
seeing that across the globe in all regions. And I'd say the character of the 
engagement growth is a little bit different by region. In the U.S. and Canada 
on Facebook, we're seeing strength in sort of nonvideo feed engagement. In 
other
 
regions, we're seeing good strength in video. And then I'd say across 
all of our apps, we're seeing strong adoption of Stories and, on WhatsApp 
Status products around the world, and that continues to provide another 
way for people to connect and share. Bu
t specific to core Facebook, I think 
those are some of the drivers that I'd call out.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
 
John Blackledge
 
Two questions. How should we think about the video strategy on core 
Faceboo
k? And any update on Watch users and engagement? And then on 
Instagram, there's been some discussion within the advertising community 
that Explore is an area for ad inventory expansion. Just any color on ad 
trends on the Explore tab.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. T
he video strategy is 
--
 
has been pretty consistent. We 
--
 
and it's 
consistent with the rest of what we're trying to do on creating these other 
tabs and social utilities as well. People watch a lot of video as part of News 
Feed. But what we also found was t
hat just straight consuming a lot of video 
on News Feed was displacing some of the social interactions and connecting 
with people that was the real core of what people came to our services for.
 
So basically, in order for 
--
 
to fully meet the needs that peo
ple have for 
video, we started creating a separate tab, Watch, and that's been growing 
quickly as well. You can think about the content acquisition that we do there 
as more along the lines of either marketing or bringing new people into the 
experience. It'
s 
--
 
we're not building out a subscription service or anything 
like that around this. So that's more just some good examples of content 
and anchor content to help create the community and get people into that 
experience.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I can share a littl
e bit about the Explore opportunity. So more than 50% of 
accounts on Instagram are using Explore every month. And as of Q3, ads 
were available to 100% of advertisers. We think it's a great opportunity to 
reach customers who are already in a discovery minds
et. And the way it 
works is after you click on a post in the Explore grid, you enter a Feed
-
like 
experience where the ads show up.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from 
MoffettNathanson.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
I have two, one
 
for Dave and one for Mark. So maybe for Dave, if you look 
at your slide deck, Page 4, what you see is just this amazing ARPU growth in 
the U.S. And just the size of the U.S. ARPU is so much larger than all these 
other markets, including Europe. I wonder w
hen you look at the opportunity 
to try to drive market 
--
 
drive pricing in other markets, what are those 
gating factors? What are you looking for to 
--
 
or what should we look for to 
move pricing to be closer to where, I guess, ARPU closer to where the U.S.
 
numbers are heading? And then for Mark, on payments, what are your initial 
markets that you're trying to target? And what impact do you all expect? 
And if you get payments right, what impact would that have on your other 
parts of the advertising business?
 
David Wehner
 
Sure, Michael. I'll take the first one. So this has been a pretty consistent 
question that's come up over the years. And I think the answer largely is the 
same as I've given on previous calls, which is the U.S. and Canada segment 
is 
really a pure
-
play developed market, which is U.S. and Canada is the 2 
countries in that segment. Europe is a broader mix of countries. So you've 
got Eastern Europe, and you've got Turkey in there. So you've got just lower 
ad market per capita countries th
at are included in that segment. It's a 
much closer number if you were to look just pure
-
play at Western Europe. 
And then there's obviously different engagement levels, maturity of 
Instagram in those markets that also plays into it. I guess not for the 
Fac
ebook
-
only stats, but I think you just get different dynamics based on 
the, really, characteristics of those countries.
 
So that's really what's driven the difference in ARPUs, and you're also 
getting faster growth in general in the lower
-
ARPU countries bot
h within 
Europe and within APAC. So that tends to also have a mitigating impact on 
ARPU because of the mix towards those lower
-
ARPU countries as the users 
grow there more quickly.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. And on payments, we're focused in different places wit
h different 
products. For things like Instagram and even a lot of what we're doing on 
Facebook, it's a lot more developed countries. For WhatsApp, it's the biggest 
countries on WhatsApp. So that's countries like India and Mexico and Brazil 
and Indonesia, w
hich will make up a large part of the community on 
WhatsApp.
 
The way that we expect that this will work out is basically for people, it's just 
--
 
this is an important feature to be able to move your money around, pay 
friends and individuals as well as smal
l businesses. From a small business 
perspective, being able to close the loop on ads and transactions, we think, 
is just going to make it so that it's more valuable to have a presence on our 
services, and buying ads is going to be more valuable. So click
-
t
o
-
messaging 
ads, which the ads run in Facebook and Instagram but then link you to 
WhatsApp or Messenger, is a product that's growing well. As you can 
complete more payments in WhatsApp and Messenger, you would expect it 
to be worth more for businesses to b
id more there, which is why we're so far 
focused on making it so that the payments can be free or really as cheap as 
possible. Because we think that from a business perspective, we will get 
some of the value just by having the services be more valuable for
 
businesses and the ad prices that they'll bid in the auction.

Your last question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo.
 
Brian Fitzgerald
 
Within the last few weeks, you brought several gaming streamers on board, 
the Disguised To
ast, Corinna Kopf, ZeRo, and in December, you acquired 
Play Giga. So we want to hear a little bit more about Facebook Gaming and 
the opportunities there and maybe the strategic overlap with Oculus.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. I mean there are a couple of differen
t things here. Over the long term, 
there surely will be in 
--
 
a connection between the work that we're doing in 
the Facebook app and Oculus, or there will be opportunities for that. But 
right now, we're developing them somewhat independently. I think withi
n 
the Facebook app, you can think about this as a connection 
--
 
as an 
extension of the social utility strategy where we've talked about Dating on 
the call. We've talked about Watch. We've talked about Groups, News tab. 
Certainly, the Facebook Gaming effort
 
for the people who are engaged in 
that. I mean there are a lot of communities that can get that 
--
 
people who 
really care about gaming. It has connections to the video and kind of live 
content services that we're building out. So this is going to be one o
f the 
increasing focuses for us or just the different ways that people want to 
interact and build communities. We're not just trying to build things that 
everyone is going to want to use. We think something like gaming, hundreds 
of millions of people are g
oing to want to use it, and that's great.

Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. We started the 
year off with a good quarter. Our community 
continues to grow, with more 
than 1.9 billion people now using Facebook every month and almost 1.3 
billion people using it every day. Our ads business is doing well too. Total 
revenue grew by 49% year over year to $8 billion, and advertising revenue 
was up
 
51% to $7.9 billion.
 
In my letter to our community back in February, I talked about how for the 
past decade Facebook has focused on connecting friends and family. Now 
with that foundation, our next focus will be building community. There's a lot 
to do her
e. Building a global community is bigger than any one organization, 
but we can help by developing social infrastructure for communities, for 
supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, 
and for including everyone.
 
Building a 
global community that works for everyone starts with building 
millions of smaller supportive communities. This is especially important, 
since membership in many physical communities is declining. We recently 
found that more than 100 million people on Faceb
ook are members of what 
we call very meaningful groups, like parenting or rare diseases, support 
groups that are an important part of their support structure. My hope is to 
help more than 1 billion people join meaningful groups to strengthen our 
social fab
ric over the next few years.
 
To help build a safe community, we launched Community Help, a tool that 
allows people to give and get things like food, shelter, or transportation in 
the wake of a natural disaster. We also launched a new fundraising tool that 
allows people to raise money for themselves, a friend, or a cause that isn't 
already on Facebook.
 
But it's clear we have more to do here. We're going to continue building new 
tools to keep people safe on our platform. Over the next year, we'll be 
adding 3,
000 people to our Community Operations team around the world 
on top of the 4,500 we already have today to review the millions of reports 
we get every week and to improve the process for doing that quickly.
 
To help build a more informed community, we make c
hanges to our News 
Feed ranking to reduce the financial motivation to spread hoaxes. We're 
working with independent fact
-
checkers to give people more information on 
whether an article has been disputed. We launched an educational tool at 
the top of News Fe
ed in 14 countries to help people spot false news. And 
we're beginning to test related articles that appear before you read an 
article, giving you easier access to more perspectives and information.
 
We're also helping to build a more civically engaged comm
unity. In March 
we launched Town Hall to help people find and connect with their 
government representatives on a local, state, and federal level in the U.S. In 
just the first month, we created more than 1 million new connections 
between people and their re
presentatives. We also rolled out a tool in France 
ahead of their election that allows candidates to share statements about 
where they stand on different policy issues. So these are some of the 
changes we've made to help people build stronger communities.
 
Next I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three 
time horizons, how we're making our core services more useful and 
engaging right now, how we're building ecosystems around products that a 
lot of people are already using over the nex
t five years, and how we're 
investing in the technologies that will give more people a voice and make 
sharing more immersive over the next 10 years.
 
This quarter we launched a set of new cameras. Photos and video are 
becoming more common than text, so the 
camera is becoming more central 
then the text box in all of our apps. In the Facebook app, you can now swipe 
right from News Feed to access our new camera with masks, frames, and 
filters. We've developed new computer vision tools that can apply the style 
o
f a painting to a photo or video, and we can do that in real time on your 
phone for the first time.
 
This is part of making the camera the first augmented reality platform. We 
want to give developers the power to build all kinds of AR tools in the 
camera so
 
more people can experience augmented reality on their phone. 
Creating the first open camera platform is a huge step forward, and we're 
excited to keep pushing augmented reality forward.
 
We also expanded the Stories format to give people more new ways to 
s
hare. Instagram Stories now has more than 200 million daily active people 
using it. And just a couple months after we launched it, WhatsApp Status 
has more than 175 million daily active people using it. More recently, we 
also rolled out Messenger Day and F
acebook Stories, and we're going to 
keep putting video at the center of all these services.
 
Over the next five years, we're going build ecosystems around our products 
that a lot of people are already using. I put live video in this category. Last 
month we 
announced that one in every five Facebook videos is a live 
broadcast. And over the past year, daily watch time for Facebook Live 
broadcasts has grown by more than four times.
 
This year we also gave people the ability to go live in 360. Messenger is in 
this
 
category too. And we just announced that 1.2 billion people use 
Messenger every month. At F8, we launched the second generation of our 
Messenger platform and introduced the Discover tab to make it easier to find 
the best experiences quickly.
 
Finally, over
 
the next 10 years, we're developing consumer use cases around 
technologies that are a big part of our future, but won't be a part of our 
business, a big part of the business for a while. On the connectivity side, in 
April we successfully simultaneously be
amed 16 gigabits of data in each 
direction between a location on the ground and a Cessna aircraft circling 
more than 7 kilometers away. Eventually, we're going to use this technology 
along with Aquila, our solar powered plane that we're building, to beam 
I
nternet to parts of the world that currently don't have access.
 
In virtual reality, we launched Facebook Spaces, the first social VR platform 
that lets you create your own avatar and hang out with your friends. And we 
also released the Facebook 360 app for
 
Gear VR that makes it easier to 
discover and experience in 360 photos and videos. And we continue to ship 
RIFT and Touch to people everywhere and deliver a strong content 
ecosystem across both RIFT and Gear VR.
 
As people share more video, as we explore mo
re things like augmented 
reality, and as we build more tools to keep our community safe, we're going 
to keep investing aggressively in the infrastructure that we need to grow and 
serve our community. That's why we announced that our next two data 
centers w
ill be built in Odense, Denmark and Papillion, Nebraska.
 
We've made some good progress. We have a lot more to do to help build 
community and connect the world. I want to thank everyone in our 
community, our teams, our partners, and all of you for being a p
art of this 
journey with us.
 
And now here's Sheryl.

Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a strong first quarter and a great 
start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 51% year over year. Mobile ad 
revenue was $6.7 
billion, up 58% year over year, and was approximately 
85% of total ad revenue. Growth again this quarter was broad
-
based across 
regions, marketer segments, and verticals.
 
Our goal is to build meaningful connections between businesses and people. 
We're doin
g this by focusing on three key priorities: helping businesses 
leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and 
making our ads more relevant and effective.
 
Our first priority is helping businesses leverage the power of mobile. More 
busi
nesses around the world are shifting to marketing on mobile. Over 70 
million businesses are now using Facebook Pages around the world on a 
monthly basis, and more and more of them are becoming advertisers. We 
also recently announced that over 5 million bus
inesses are actively 
advertising on Facebook, including more than 1 million in emerging markets. 
Most of these advertisers start by using our free Pages product because it's 
easy to use.
 
People are increasingly recognizing that the small screen is big. Our
 
Creative 
Hub is providing tools that make it easier to create ads optimized for mobile, 
what we talk about as thumb stopping creative. Marketers can see previews 
of their ads across Facebook and Instagram before rolling them out and get 
tips to help drive
 
business results.
 
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products that help 
businesses make the most out of their campaigns. We continue to improve 
Dynamic Ads, which enable advertisers to promote their full range of 
products across all devices. 
Advertisers can now target Dynamic Ads to 
broad audiences and are seeing great results.
 
Last week I visited home retailer Wayfair in Boston. They use Dynamic Ads 
to reach a large audience with personalized recommendations from their 
catalog of over 8 milli
on items. By finding higher revenue customers at a 
lower cost, the campaign beat Wayfair's return on ad spend goal by more 
than 20%.
 
We're also helping marketers use video to capture shoppers' attention. 
People are watching more video on Facebook than ever
 
before, and it's 
changing how they connect with businesses. In a recent study Facebook 
commissioned with Kantar, 30% of mobile shoppers said video is the best 
way to discover new products.
 
This quarter, we introduced a new ad format called Collection. Col
lection 
helps marketers tell stories on mobile by combining creative videos or 
photos of product images. Clicking on the products leads to an immersive 
shopping experience, driving purchase consideration and ultimately sales.
 
For example, adidas, which is 
how you pronounce them at their 
headquarters, and its agency, iProspect, created a video highlighting the 
innovative future of a Z.N.E. road trip party. Using our Collection ad format, 
adidas featured four more items from their product catalog below the vi
deo. 
They saw a 5.3 times return on ad spend and a 1.8 times decrease in cost 
per conversion. It's still early for this new format, but it's a great example of 
how we can deliver innovative mobile experiences that work for advertisers 
and work for people.
 
This quarter we also launched full
-
screen sound
-
on ads in Instagram Stories. 
Advertisers can now reach over 200 million daily actives on Stories to do 
everything from building brands to selling products.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant a
nd effective. 
Measurement is critical. We recently introduced new and expanded 
verification partnerships and committed to audits with the Media Rating 
Council. Whether marketers are trying to get people to buy something on 
their website or in their store, 
we now have systems in place to help them 
measure results and third
-
party partnerships to verify those results. These 
are important steps as we continue to build the advertiser trough.
 
Bud Light's NFL campaign is a great example. To promote the designs of 
their new team
-
specific cans, Bud Light took a national and regional 
approach. They ran video ads featuring the new cans to people ages 21 to 
49 in the U.S. Then they also ran more targeted ads in each region featuring 
the two cans of the teams playing eac
h other. Using Facebook polling and 
Oracle data cloud, they saw a 24
-
point lift in ad recall and a 4.4 times return 
on ad sales.
 
We know marketers want to compare results across platforms and 
placements. Historically, we've enabled larger marketers to do t
his. In Q1 
we started testing a set of advanced measurement tools that make it easier 
for marketers of all sizes to compare the effectiveness of Facebook, 
Instagram, and Audience Network alongside other publishers.
 
We're off to a strong start in 2017. We'r
e helping marketers leverage the 
power of mobile, developing innovative ad products, and delivering proven 
and measurable results. We're excited about the growing adoption of our 
platforms, and we're going to continue to invest in helping businesses and 
pe
ople connect.
 
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for 
Facebook. We continued to see healthy growth in engagement trends across 
our community as well as broad
-
ba
sed growth in our ads business. Let's 
start with our community metrics.
 
In March, 1.28 billion people visited Facebook on an average day, up 18% 
compared to last year. This daily number represented 66% of the 1.94 
billion people that visited Facebook durin
g the month of March, which was 
up 282 million or 17% compared to last year. Our community growth in Q1 
was driven by product improvement, internet.org, and ongoing third
-
party 
promotional data plans in markets like India. Note that we do not control the 
t
iming or terms of these promotions.
 
Before diving into the financials, I want to highlight that we are no longer 
reporting non
-
GAAP expenses, income, tax rate, or EPS. Given that stock is 
an important part of our compensation structure, we believe that inv
estors 
should focus on our financial performance with stock
-
based compensation 
included.
 
Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $8 billion, up 49%. Ad 
revenue was $7.
9 billion, up 51%. Exchange rates did not affect our overall 
growth rate this quarter, as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by 
tailwinds in others.
 
In terms of regional advertising growth, rest
-
of
-
world and Asia
-
Pacific were 
our strongest growers
 
in percentage terms at 66% and 60% respectively. 
Both regions benefited from particularly strong advertiser demand. Europe 
and North America both grew at 47%.
 
Mobile ad revenue was $6.7 billion, up 58%, and represented approximately 
85% of ad revenue. Des
ktop ad revenue grew 22% despite a decline in 
desktop usage and was aided by our recent effort to limit the impact of ad 
blocking technologies, which we began in Q3 of last year. Our mobile ads 
business continued to be driven by healthy supply and demand i
n apps 
(15:41). In Q1, the average price per ad increased 14% and the total 
number of ad impressions served increased 32%, primarily driven by mobile 
feed ads.
 
Payments and other fees revenue was $175 million, down 3%. Q1 total 
expenses were $4.7 billion, 
up 40%.
 
In 2017, we have continued to accelerate our hiring efforts. We added over 
1,700 employees in Q1, predominantly in technical and recruiting functions, 
and ended the quarter with approximately 18,800 employees, up 38% 
compared to last year. This mar
ked an acceleration from the 34% growth 
rate in Q4.
 
Q1 operating income was $3.3 billion, representing a 41% margin.
 
Our tax rate was 10%, which reflects the adoption of ASU 2016
-
9 in the 
fourth quarter. Excluding this adoption, our tax rate would have bee
n 
approximately 9 percentage points higher. Note that the new accounting 
guidance does not impact the cash taxes we pay but merely how the tax 
provision is presented under GAAP, whereby now excess tax benefits are 
flowing through the P&L and in this quarte
r positively impacted EPS.
 
Net income was $3.1 billion or $1.04 per share.
 
Q1 capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion, driven by 
investments in data centers, servers, office facilities, and network 
infrastructure. In Q1 we also broke ground on
 
our ninth data center in 
Nebraska.
 
We generated approximately $3.8 billion in free cash flow. In the first 
quarter, we repurchased $228 million of our Class A common stock and used 
$771 million in cash for taxes paid related to the net share 
settlement of 
equity awards. We ended the quarter with $32.3 billion in cash and 
investments.
 
Turning now to the outlook, with regards to revenue, we continue to expect 
that our ad revenue growth rates will come down meaningfully over the 
course of 2017. W
e expect that ad loads will play a less significant factor in 
driving revenue growth after mid
-
2017. We also expect desktop ad revenue 
growth rates to slow in the third quarter when we begin to lap our efforts to 
limit the impact of ad blockers. We continu
e to expect that our full
-
year 
2017 payments and other fees revenue will decline compared to full
-
year 
2016. As a reminder, payments and other fees revenue is primarily 
generated from payments related to games played on personal computers.
 
Turning to the e
xpense outlook, we continue to expect that full
-
year 2017 
GAAP expenses will grow 40% to 50% compared to full
-
year 2016. I would 
note that as we look into 2017 and beyond, there are going be a number of 
initiatives we believe are valuable to the community 
and to the company in 
the long term that are going be net negative on our operating margin. We 
are embarking on a significant ramp up in infrastructure supporting global 
growth, and we continue to expect that full
-
year 2017 capital expenditures 
will be in 
the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, which is up over 50% 
compared to last year.
 
Turning now to tax, as we noted in the last call, under the new accounting 
guidance, our tax rate will vary based on our stock price. At current stock 
prices, we expect th
at our Q2 and full
-
year 2017 tax rates will both be in the 
mid
-
teens, so up from the first quarter rate.
 
In summary, Q1 was a strong quarter and a great start to the year. Growth 
in the Facebook community remains strong. Engagement across our family 
of app
s is healthy and growing, and advertiser demand from our growing 
base of marketers is robust. Importantly, we continue to invest aggressively 
to build our business and drive value for our community over the long term.
 
With that, operator, let's open up the
 
call for questions.

Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
 
Eric J. Sheridan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question, maybe one thematic question on Instagram 
for Mark and Sheryl.
 
I wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of 
the development of the community on the user growth side, the engagement 
side, as well as on the monetization side with respect to breadth of 
advertisers and ad product evolution, what that means for I
nstagram's 
future and how it compares to maybe what you've learned growing the 
business on the Facebook side over the last couple years. Thanks so much.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Eric, why don't I take that and then Sheryl can augment with some 
addi
tional color? So when you think about Instagram, we're seeing great 
growth there with the community. So this past quarter, we announced 700 
million monthly actives, so that was a big announcement. And that's broad
-
based growth across the globe, so we're pl
eased with that.
 
In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically 
breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, because that's sold through 
the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution 
and good growth
 
there. And we're developing it across a wide variety of ad 
products, so VR is becoming a more significant part of the Instagram story, 
where it was originally more brand
-
focused. But we've expanded the product 
offerings on the Direct Response front, and w
e're continuing to bring more 
ad products to Instagram.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space 
because Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad 
platforms. And there's a
 
special property with Instagram, which is that the 
increasing visualization of ads and the creative canvas it offers with the 
science behind the Facebook targeting and measurement system is really a 
pretty unusual combination. We're also seeing very broad
 
adoption, 
including small customers. We are pretty excited to have 1 million 
advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform.
 
To share one example, an online store in Brazil called Loja Nama, they sell 
decorative items and accessorie
s. Their business owner, Joanna [Cariello], 
took photos of her products on her phone and then created ads with our 
Shop Now button. She targeted young audiences in Brazil who are interested 
in fashion, decoration, movies, and architecture. And during the p
eriod of 
her campaign, Instagram accounted for 79% of her sales. And I think what 
that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across 
our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a 
phone to create very s
ophisticated but visually compelling ads.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question, one for Mark and then perhaps one for 
Sheryl or Dave. Mar
k, first just on the video strategy, I was hoping you 
could talk a little bit about how that's evolving in terms of the type of 
content that you're licensing and featuring within the Facebook Video tab, 
and then if you have any more clarity just on how the
 
economics are going 
to work there around revenue share and gross margins.
 
And then on ad revenue, the U.S. and Canada was very strong at 47% 
growth, but at the same time it also did decel a little bit more than we've 
seen in recent quarters. I was just wo
ndering if there was anything else to 
call out there. Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yes. Doug, why don't I take the decel question on the U.S. and Canada? I 
don't think there was anything particularly surprising about the deceleration 
in the 
growth in the U.S. and Canada. We've been talking about expecting a 
deceleration in ad revenue growth, and we saw that play out in the U.S. and 
Canada modestly.
 
Obviously, we were particularly pleased that there was really strong demand 
that benefited regi
ons like APAC and rest
-
of
-
world, so really broad
-
based 
strength in APAC. And then rest
-
of
-
world, we saw a rebound in Latin 
America, especially Brazil, so we're seeing some particular strength there. 
So I think that I think was a big highlight.
 
On the conte
nt front, we're looking at investing in kick
-
starting an 
ecosystem for longer
-
form content on Facebook, and that involves us 
working with content providers to develop that content. In the long run, we 
expect to see a revenue share model on the platform. An
d obviously, we're 
going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers, 
so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News 
Feed from an expense profile perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan

Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Mark on 
Messenger 
monetization. Can you just talk about some of the biggest trends you're 
monitoring and what you're most excited about as you think about ways to 
monetize Messenger over the next two or three years?
 
And then on engagement, you continue to grow Ins
tagram and Messenger 
user bases really healthily. I guess I'd be curious to hear, do you still 
continue to see rising time spent per user across all three of those platforms, 
even as the DAU base gets bigger? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Can you start with the stats, Wehner?
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. Yes, I can start with the stats, Mark. On the engagement front, we're 
seeing time spent growth per DAU across the Facebook family of apps, and 
that includes Facebook itself. Inst
agram has been strong, especially with 
Feed Ranking and Stories. We're not breaking out specific time spent stats 
on a quarterly basis on those. And then on the Messenger monetization 
front...?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I can talk about the s
trategy. The first thing that we need to do on 
Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and 
build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different 
things, like customer support or for getting news conten
t, things that may 
not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of 
people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses.
 
In terms of making money on that, once we have that behavior, I think 
there are go
ing to be a number of ways that we can amplify that. We're 
already experimenting with a couple. One is ads that actually display a News 
Feed, not in Messenger or WhatsApp, but that link to the ability to 
communicate with a business directly in Messenger or
 
eventually WhatsApp. 
And that's great, it converts better for the businesses. They can have a 
better dialogue with the person and a persistent relationship. So that's one 
way that I think that this will be valuable. The other way is of course 
eventually s
howing paid content in Messenger, whether that's in the inbox or 
in relevant ways throughout the product.
 
But the top priority right now is just building out the base of organic 
interaction between people and businesses that they want to interact with. 
And
 
once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of 
opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the 
amount of that activity that people want to do organically.

Your next question comes from the line
 
of Justin Post from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 
Great, thank you, a couple things on advertising and modeling. When we 
think about Q1, can you help us at all think about how much the ad load 
growth is contri
buting and what drove the improvement in pricing in the 
quarter?
 
And then, Dave, when you look out to the third quarter and you lap the ad 
blocking on desktop, are there more ad blocking you can do to help maintain 
that growth, or are there other drivers t
here for desktop that we can think 
about? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure, Justin. I'm not breaking out specific drivers on the supply side. Supply 
growth was healthy, and we had contributions from users' time spent and ad 
load in the quar
ter.
 
In terms of what drove the improvement in the pricing, it's strong demand, 
so that's playing through in the face of a little bit slower supply growth. And 
so you're seeing 

 
of course, the auction drives pricing and there has been 
interplay between th
e supply growth and the pricing growth, and we're 
seeing the strong demand play through on the pricing side.
 
When we get to lapping our efforts on desktop, I do think you're going to 

 
you have a secular trend away from desktop. So that's going be an overa
ll 
factor in desktop, our ability to grow and maintain the desktop business, so I 
think that's an underlying factor. We're always going be in a back
-
and
-
forth 
with ad blockers on the desktop side. So I think that's going to constantly be 
a thing that plays
 
into the desktop revenue.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
 
Colin Alan Sebastian 
-
 
Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Great, thanks. First off I guess is a follow
-
up on the earlier video question 
from Doug. Could you 
add some perspective on engagement trends with 
video content and video ads such as average viewing time and whether this 
mix is what is impacting impression growth? And then more broadly, if you 
can offer some perspective on how much of the video ad spendi
ng on 
Facebook applications are incremental to television budgets, or if there's any 
evidence you're seeing of a share shift. Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure, Colin. I'll take that first one. So impression growth was 32% in Q1, as 
I 
noted, and that was a bit slower than in previous quarters.
 
Those of you who have been following us for a while know that periodically 
we make changes to the product that is going to impact some of the metrics. 
One of the things that I would call out in Q1
 
as a contributing factor on the 
impression growth side was our decision to rank longer
-
form video higher in 
News Feed. That means more time in video, and that does come at the 
expense of some impression growth in News Feed. So I think you do see 
some inte
rplay there on the impression growth side due to our focus on 
video. And then Sheryl was going to follow up on the video ad spending.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
On TV, we are definitely seeing people continue to advertise on TV and use 
us as a c
omplement. So over time, we believe that the dollar shifts with 
eyeballs and we want to earn it from our clients and be the best dollar and 
the best minute they spend and help them measure across channels.
 
I think increasingly, the question is not if you c
an do without TV, but it's if 
you can do without mobile. And we're working hard to help advertisers 
develop the video creative that really works for mobile because that really 
makes a really big difference. And we think the combination of the creative 
work
ing for mobile but also the measurement and targeting we can do is a 
very powerful offer.
 
To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their 
agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to 
promote the limited time 
offer Reuben sandwich. And they used Audience 
Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, 
and that's just pretty incredible targeting. Nowhere else I don't think you 
can actually target that way and people interested in fast food
 
and 
encourage them to visit Subways. They then used Nielsen Brand Effects and 
were able to measure a 16
-
point lift in ad recall and a 5
-
point lift in intent to 
visit Subway. So it's a really unique combination of the power of creative 
that was designed fo
r video for mobile with very specific targeting and very 
specific measurements.

John Blackledge 
-
 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Thanks, two questions. Mark, you mentioned adding 3,000 reviewe
rs to 
content at Facebook. Could artificial intelligence be used over time to help 
solve some of the monitoring? And then just more broadly, how is AI being 
employed in the processes at the company now versus a couple years ago?
 
And then second item would 
be, could newer ad units like mid
-
roll video help 
mitigate the decel from the lower ad load growth contribution in second half 
2017? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I'll talk to the content and AI questions, and then someone else can tal
k 
about the ad piece. The short answer is yes. AI tools over time will be able 
to do a better job of flagging things for the set of people who are in the 
Community Ops teams that we can prioritize what we look at. A lot of what 
we're trying to do here is n
ot just about getting content off Facebook. Last 
week there was this case where someone was using Facebook Live to 
broadcast 

 
or was thinking about suicide. And we saw that video and 
actually didn't take it down and helped get in touch with law enforcemen
t 
who used that live video to communicate with that person and help save 
their life. So a lot of what we're trying to do is not just about taking the 
content down, but also about helping people when they're in need on the 
platform, and we take that very, v
ery seriously.
 
Over time, the AI tools will get better. Right now there are certain things 
that AI can do in terms of understanding text and understanding what's in a 
photo and what's in a video. That will get better over time. That will take a 
period of y
ears, though, to really reach the quality level that we want. So for 
a while, our strategy has been to just continue building as good tools as we 
can because no matter how many people we have on the team, we're never 
going to be able to look at everything.
 
So that's going be a big challenge.
 
But given the importance of this and how quickly live video is growing, we 
wanted to make sure that we doubled down on this and made sure we 
provided as safe of an experience for the community as we can, which is 
why we
're almost doubling the size of the Community Ops team to focus on 
some of these issues around safety on live video. But over time for sure, 
more AI will do this, but this is over a period of years.

John, I think your quest
ion then was on Ad Breaks and then the mid
-
roll 
type of format. I think there we're testing the ability and are putting short 
Ad Breaks into longer
-
form live and on
-
demand videos. Tests are going well, 
but it's really early days to talk about that being a 
significant contributor, so 
we're working to continue to make those products better and continuing 
those tests, but it's early. On that front, we're focused on building out the 
best video experiences for our community and growing longer
-
form content 
as a p
riority. And Ad Breaks is going to allow us to have a monetization 
strategy with that longer
-
form content. But like I said, it's early.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman 
Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini

Great, thank you. I guess I had a question just related to Instagram and 
Facebook Stories. We've talked a lot about ad load growth over the last 
year, and Dave's been talking about the pending slowdown, which I think 
we're all expecting. But how do we
 
think about these new applications or 
new ways to engage with the apps at the top of your phone, where you're 
starting to see ad insertion show up as well? Is that thought of as different 
than the general ad load comments that, Dave, you're making? I'm so
rry to 
split hairs here, but I'm just trying to get a sense of how to think about 
when they're starting to show up in new places.
 
And then I guess I just had a follow
-
up for Sheryl. And one question in 
particular was if there's any measurement metrics that
 
advertisers are 
asking for now that if you could help them with, it would make them even 
more eager to shift their budgets over from TV and follow their eyeballs? 
Sorry, thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So, Heather, on Stories, again, it's a pr
etty similar answer, I think, to Ad 
Breaks in the sense that it's early in terms of using the ads formats in 
Stories. We've certainly rolled those out. They are not in the ad load 
calculation per se. So it is different, as you said, from the ad load 
commen
tary that I've given. But obviously, it's very early on those products. 
And then, Sheryl, you had the question about measurement metrics.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-

Yes, we know that measurement is so critical, and we really want to 
measure core
 
business results and focus on becoming the number one 
growth driver for our clients. We are continuing to constantly review our 
metrics. When we find bugs or errors, we're reporting them to our clients 
and addressing the issue and continuing with that ana
lysis as we work 
through all of our metrics.
 
We're also very focused on extending measurement partnerships and third
-
party verification. This last quarter we extended viewability measurement to 
the Audience Network, added another verification partner, Doub
leVerify, for 
video and display measurement, and introduced our MMM [Marketing Mix 
Modeling] portal so that we can help people measure across all of the 
different platforms and compare the effectiveness of their ad spend no 
matter what their end goal is.

Thank you very much. I have one for Mark and one for Sheryl. Mark, at F8 
and in your comments today, you talked about making th
e camera central to 
the app, making the camera the first augmented reality platform. I know it's 
early, but can you maybe share with us your thoughts about the potential 
commercial application of augmented reality as you see it today?
 
And then, Sheryl, the
re's been more lately about the use and effectiveness 
of influencer marketing on both Facebook and Instagram. How is Facebook 
thinking about sharing in the economics of when brands use celebrities or 
influencers to market their products using their Faceboo
k posts? Is it by 
bringing more transactions onto the platform, building on the shopping 
experience on Facebook? How is Facebook going to share in those 
economics? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

All right, I can start by talking about a
ugmented reality. The big step 
forward that we announced at F8 is that there are lots of different apps that 
have cameras in them or that independent developers just build an app that 
has a single camera effect. But what we're basically saying is that ther
e's so 
much innovation and so many different types of effects that people are 
creating that we don't want developers to have to build their own separate 
app and get to a huge scale in order to build some new kind of visual tool.
 
So we built 

 
we're making 
the cameras inside the whole family of apps into 
the first augmented reality platform, into an open platform, which is 
different from what any other app that has a camera has done before. It's 
going to open up a much greater diversity of use cases, not onl
y making it 
so that use cases like facemasks or style transfers that we already have, 
you're now going to have thousands of options instead of just 10 or 20 at a 
time. But there are also going to be all these new kinds of things that we're 
not even buildin
g today that developers will be able to experiment with.
 
One of the examples I showed at F8 was around using object recognition 
and computer vision to be able to point your camera at something and then 
tap on it and get a card of information and maybe even
 
a buy button. So 
there are lots of different ways that over time this kind of content is going to 
both augment existing real
-
world objects and eventually replace them, 
which I think is going to be an interesting opportunity. maybe not on 
augmented reality
 
on the phone but on glasses eventually.
 
When you have that, I think we're going get to a point where things like TVs, 
you no longer need a physical TV. You'll get a $1 app that you can watch it 
screen on. And it will just be an interesting exercise to see
 
how many of the 
things that we have that are physical things don't actually need to be 
physical in that world, and how much innovation that opens up for 
independent developers all around the world. A lot of people don't have a 
factory, so they can't build
 
a TV. But think about how many kids and 
different developers around the world, kids sitting in dorm rooms and all 
these different places are going be able to create things that today they 
couldn't.
 
So I hope this is going to create a pretty interesting ec
onomy. So a lot of 
that stuff is pretty far out, five, ten years. But we want to be pushing this 
forward. I think we're a little bit late to the trend initially around making 
cameras the center of how sharing works. But I do think at this point, we're 
pret
ty much ahead in terms of the technology that we're building, and 
making it an open platform I think is a big is a big step forward. A lot of 
people are using these products across our family of apps, and I would 
expect us to continue leading the way forwa
rd on this from this point on.

When you think about influencer marketing, we definitely see publishers 
interested in it, brands interested in it. And so we've worked on branded 
content, the ability to tag a 
sponsor and share posts and insights. And the 
financial arrangement remains between the sponsor and the publisher. It's 
early, but we're seeing some positive results with publishers of many 
different types bringing branded content to Facebook. In Q1, we op
ened this 
up to unverified pages so we could enable more people to take advantage of 
this kind of targeting.
 
We see this in the broader context of better targeting. When you think about 
what really drives great performance for both people who are using 
Fac
ebook but for marketers, it's well
-
targeted ads. And so influencer 
marketing is one way to get there, but we're focused on a very full range of 
ability to target well. We've been really pleased with the adoption of our 
targeting products from Custom Audien
ces to Lookalikes to Dynamic Ads, 
and we think all of these can improve the relevance of the ad by making ads 
more targeted, because when they're more targeted, they have higher 
returns for marketers and they're more enjoyable or relevant for people.

Great, thanks. First, I think it's a great move to go all
-
in GAAP in terms of 
reporting. Second, David, when you talked about the ads, your ad load 
commentary, I couldn't tell if there was a subtle shift there when you were 
saying that the ad load pressure would occur after the end of the year rather 
than in the second half of the year.
 
And then third, this is for Sheryl and Mark. The recent stories a
bout gender 
bias amongst engineers at Facebook, and I know you quickly responded to 
that and said if there were anything, there may be a rank bias, but in my 
mind it creates the opportunity potentially for Facebook to better tap into 
what is probably under
appreciated female engineering talent in the Valley 
and across technology. How do you think about that as an opportunity for 
the company? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner

I'll just real quickly address the ad load issue, Mark. Sorry if it wasn't
 
clear, 
really no change in outlook there. We continue to expect that we'll see 
deceleration in ad revenue growth. And that's going to be particularly 
pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a 
less significant factor drivi
ng growth starting in the second half.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

On the issue you raised with the Facebook female engineers, I'm really glad 
to have a chance to address this because this is an issue I take very 
seriously. On the specific report
 
on this study, the study was conducted by a 
former employee with very incomplete data. When that study was shared 
with people internally, and we have that culture where people do studies and 
share things, and we're really glad because that helps surface i
ssues, we 
immediately conducted our own research using the full data.
 
And what we found is that the main reason code was sent back at different 
rates was not correlated with gender. It was correlated with level, and the 
fact that we have more male senior e
ngineers was explaining it. If you 
compared male and female engineers at the same level, there was not this 
discrepancy.
 
Then that leads to the obvious question is are you promoting men and 
women at the same rate and the broader question of are you paying 
men 
and women fairly. And we do a comprehensive look at that every single 
promotion and pay and performance cycle we have, which is six months. 
And we know that we're promoting men and women at the same rate as 
men.
 
Now that said, our industry still has is
sues and we still have issues. We don't 
have enough senior female engineers. We don't have enough women going 
into computer science, and we take this very seriously, from the work we've 
done with LinkedIn to get CS&E Lean In circles all over college campus
es, to 
encourage more women and under
-
represented minorities to come into our 
field. We've had a really nice program in extra internships where we're 
taking people who are not yet majoring in computer science but we think 
have the ability, and teaching the
m for a summer and seeing them return, 
to the work we're doing with our female engineers to make sure that all 
forms of bias are surfaced and eliminated. And we can continue to use the 
full talents of the population. Nothing is more important to us.

Hey, guys. Just had two questions on video. We know it's early, but what 
kind of traction do you see with the video tab that's in beta? And do you 
think longer term the video consumption is going to be in that dedicated tab, 
or will it stay in the News Fee
d based on what you're seeing right now?
 
And then, Dave, just to follow up on your previous answers, so are the costs 
related to video ad rev share or licensing of video content, is that baked into 
your OpEx guidance for 2017, or is that something that wil
l step up after this 
year? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
I don't know if we have any public stats on the video tab, probably not. But 
in terms of the strategy, I can talk about that quickly. There were two basic 
use cases for checking 
in with Facebook and seeing what's going on in the 
world. What people do with News Feed a lot of the time is they have a few 
free minutes, or you want to sit down for maybe a longer session to see 
everything that's going on in the world. You don't have a s
pecific intention to 
watch a specific type of content. You just want to check in and see what's 
going on in the world.
 
There's this whole other use case around content, which is going to the app 
or sitting down at a TV because there's some content that you
 
want to watch 
and you want to go directly to it. And that's what we're trying to do with the 
video tab, to make it so that all the different folks, whether they're pages 
that you follow or creators that you like, who you want to subscribe to and 
get the u
pdates to what they're doing, that you have a place that you can go 
to with more intent to consume that content.
 
The reason why it needs to be a different tab or at least a different service 
from News Feed is because people come to it with a different inte
nt. I think 
you're going to start in the future getting people coming to Facebook for the 
News Feed use case of checking in and people coming with an intent to go to 
the video tab to watch a specific video. So that's what we're doing there. 
That's the stra
tegy, and I guess we'll update on stats when we have them.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
And, Ross, on the costs related to the video ad rev share, yes, our guidance 
on total cost is all
-
inclusive, so it includes all the R&D investments we're 
making. It
 
includes the content. It includes things like the Community 
Operations investments that we talked about today in the announcement. 
But I would say that the nature of the types of video content deals that 
we're doing will make them more likely to show up a
fter 2017. So there will 
be some content expense in 2017, but I think it will be something you will 
see step up after 2017.

Thank you. Mark,
 
in your prepared remarks, you talked about doing more to 
foster local communities and groups, and it would seem like one of the more 
interesting test cases here already is in Local Marketplaces. I was just 
wondering if you could talk to us a little bit ab
out the kind of adoption and 
engagement that you've seen with Local Marketplaces and maybe anything 
that you've learned that you can apply to some of the newer initiatives that 
you're looking at?
 
And then secondly, probably for Sheryl, for Ad Breaks to sca
le, it appears 
that content creators need to adapt their programming for this, and of 
course, users need to engage with the ads. So I guess the question is how 
are completion rates for Ad Breaks? I know it's early, but what are you 
seeing so far? And how w
ould you characterize the willingness of content 
creators to adapt?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
I can talk about Marketplace Groups first. So I think your basic point is right, 
that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab a
round 
that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of 
Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of 
millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things. And so these whole 
communities have formed, which wa
s somewhat surprising to us honestly, 
because we hadn't developed that product specifically for buying and selling. 
It was for group communication and that's what people were using it for. So 
we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going 
to invest in 
making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can 
grow that economy. So I don't know that we have any public stats on that 
yet, but that's an area that I'm certainly very excited about.
 
And then in terms of local communi
ties, one of the big trends in the world 
that we've seen is just that participation in all kinds of different physical 
communities, whether they're sports teams or some religious groups or 
different kinds of different things, have been declining a lot over
 
the past 
several decades. And that I think is a big social issue that is eroding the 
social fabric of the whole society, not just our country, but around the world. 
And that's one where I look at that and I wonder if Facebook can play a role 
in helping to
 
strengthen that.
 
We look at 

 
there are more than 1 billion people every month who use our 
Groups product. But if you think about your own use of the Groups product, 
you probably are a member of a bunch of different groups that you maybe 
check in on very 
infrequently. So that's very different from 

 
there's a 
handful of people, around 100 million or a bit more, who are a member of 
what we call a very meaningful group. So that could be a parenting group or 
you're diagnosed with a rare disease, and you can n
ow connect with people 
all around the world to share stories around that. These are groups that 
upon joining, they become one of the things that you spend the most time 
with on Facebook, one of the most important parts of your experience, and a 
really fund
amental part of your real
-
world support structure.
 
So we look that that and we ask the question of hey, if 100 million people 
are in those very meaningful groups today, can we get that to be 1 billion 
people over next several years? And if so, then that ca
n help reverse some 
of the decline in community membership and help strengthen the social 
fabric, not only in our country, but around the world. So that's a big part of 
what we're focused on across a number of different initiatives.

And I'll talk a little bit about the Ad Break, what we're seeing. It's really 
early both in terms of testing the ads and getting any feedback from users, 
so people who use Facebook, so we don't have that data to share. But we're 
pleased that
 
the test is active. We're pleased that it's going well and that we 
can do both live and uploaded videos. We think over time that marketers will 
follow where people are spending their time. And if the ads can be well
-
targeted, we think we'll be able to see
 
engagement, and we already see 
that. When ads are really well targeted and taking full advantage of the kind 
of targeting we offer, so you're showing people something they want to see, 
we see engagement that we think is really critical.
 
It's also worth no
ting that the metrics that really matter at the end are 
driving sales. And so any of the engagement with ad metrics, whether it's 
remembering an ad going back to 

 
people have been measuring that for a 
long time too, how long a video ad is viewed, are only
 
proxy metrics. What 
matters is the impact on sales. And so we think the better we can do at 
getting the measurement to what actually matters, which is the end 
behavior marketers are trying to drive, the more people will shift their focus 
to business metri
cs, the better it will be for the returns they get and 
ultimately our business.

Thanks. I have three philosophical quest
ions on video for you guys. Anyone 
can grab them. The first is, it was interesting to see the NFL games go from 
Twitter to Amazon. I wonder. Do the NFL games fit with your video strategy, 
and why or why not? That's one.
 
Two is, I know the model is revenue 
share, but a lot of the more traditional 
companies would like a license fee or the ability to sell their own inventory 
on your platform. Is that something you'd consider?
 
And last but not least, the question about monetization, why is mid

roll 
optimal to p
re
-
roll, and can you share anything about the testing of that 
concept?

I can talk about sports. So in terms of experimenting with different content, 
I think we'll try a number of different things here. In terms of 
working with 
folks to produce all kinds of content, sports is probably something that we'll 
want to try at some point. But again, like Dave said before, the goal is going 
to be creating some anchor content initially that helps people learn that 
going to th
e video tab that that's a great destination where they can explore 
and come to Facebook with the intent to watch the videos that they want.
 
And then the long
-
term goal is actually not to be paying for specific content 
like that, but doing a revenue share m
odel once the whole economy around 
video on Facebook is built up. But we're working on that, and I think we'll 
probably look at different pieces of content like this around the world, but at 
this point don't feel like any specific one of them is a must
-
hav
e for us.
 
David M. Wehner 
-

And I think Mark touched on the question of business model here, and our 
focus really is on revenue share. We'll be investing to kick
-
start the 
ecosystem with content, so derisking it for some of our content partn
ers to 
start off with, but the focus is really to build a rev
-
share model over time 
that's sustainable. That's the focus as opposed to other models.
 
In terms of why mid
-
roll is preferable to pre
-
roll, Facebook is well suited for 
shorter
-
form content where 
we're ranking things to be longer
-
form as well. 
So we're ranking longer
-
form video, but that's still relatively short video 
views. And for that reason, we think mid
-
roll is a better user experience.

Thanks very much, one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you talked a lot about the 
targeting advantage of Face
book, and you have a number of data signals 
and sources informing that. I'm wondering if you could talk about the 
relative importance of collecting signals on the platform versus off the 
platform, for instance, the behavior of Facebook users interacting wi
th third
-
party websites. Is this the depth of your off
-
platform collection? Is this a 
significant competitive advantage for you? Thank you very much.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
We think that targeting end measurement are significant competitive 
advantages for us. We're very focused on the privacy of what people do, 
wherever they do it, and using the information we have in a very responsible 
way. We believe that because people are sharing interests, because people 
are themselves their real identit
y on the Facebook platform, we have a 
significant advantage just in basic targeting itself. Just age and gender, 
we're 38% more accurate than broad
-
based targeting according to Nielsen in 
the U.S., and that's just age and gender. And then if you think abou
t some 
of the key studies I shared, targeting people who purchase a certain item, 
targeting people who are interested in a certain item, we think that's very 
substantial.
 
We also think that there's a real competitive advantage in focusing on 
business resul
ts, as we have. We're really working on shifting people to 
understanding what their real objectives are so that they can focus on 
driving businesses. At the end of the day, when you show an ad, you want 
to move a product off a lot, off a shelf, into a shop
ping cart, whether it's 
online or offline, and that's where our focus is and will continue to be.

Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
 
Our community continues to grow, now with nearly 2.1
 
billion people using 
Facebook every month and nearly 1.4 billion people using it daily. Instagram 
also hit a big milestone this quarter, now with 500 million daily actives. And 
we saw good results in the business, where total revenue grew 47% year 
over ye
ar, and we had our first ever quarter with more than $10 billion in 
revenue.
 
But none of that matters if our services are used in a way that doesn't bring 
people closer together, or if the foundation of our society is undermined by 
foreign interference. I'
ve expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried 
to use our tools to sow mistrust. We built these tools to help people connect 
and to bring us closer together, and they used them to try to undermine our 
values. What they did is wrong, and we are not goi
ng to stand for it.
 
Now for those who followed Facebook, you know that when we set our minds 
to something, we're going to do it. It may be harder than we realize up 
front. It may take longer and we won't be perfect, but we will get it done. 
We're bringing 
the same intensity to these security issues that we've 
brought to any adversary or challenge that we've faced.
 
The first step is doing everything we can to help the U.S. government get a 
complete picture of what happened. We've testified in Congress over t
he 
past couple of days about the activity we found in last year's election. We're 
working with Congress on legislation to make advertising more transparent. 
I think this would be very good if it's done well.
 
And even without legislation, we're already movi
ng forward on our own to 
bring advertising on Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency 
than ads on TV or other media. That's because in traditional media, there's 
no way to see all the messages an advertiser is showing to different 
audiences. We
're about to start rolling out a tool that lets you see all of the 
ads a page is running and also an archive of ads political advisers have run 
in the past.
 
We're also working with other tech companies to help identify and respond 
to new threats because, a
s we've now seen, if there's a national security 
threat involving the Internet, it will affect many of the major tech 
companies, and we've announced a number of steps to help keep this kind 
of interference off our platform. This is part of a much bigger fo
cus on 
protecting the security and integrity of our platform and the safety of our 
community. It goes beyond elections, and it means strengthening all of our 
systems to prevent abuse and harmful content.
 
We're doing a lot here, with investments both in peo
ple and technology. 
Some of this is focused on finding bad actors and bad behavior. Some of this 
is focused on removing false news, hate speech, bullying, and other 
problematic content that we don't want in our community. We already have 
about 10,000 peopl
e working on safety and security, and we're planning to 
double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our community 
standards and review ads. In many places, we're doubling or more our 
engineering efforts focused on security. And we're also buil
ding new AI to 
detect bad content and bad actors, just like we've done with terrorist 
propaganda.
 
I am dead serious about this. And the reason I'm talking about this on our 
earnings call is that I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on 
top 
of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our 
profitability going forward, and I wanted our investors to hear that directly 
from me. I believe this will make our society stronger, and in doing so will 
be good for all of us ove
r the long term. But I want to be clear about what 
our priority is. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing 
our profits.
 
So security and the integrity of our services will be a major focus. Beyond 
this, our focus is on building community
. I talked about this last quarter 
when we changed our mission to focus on building community to bring the 
world closer together, and that's more important now than ever. This gets 
into our roadmap for the next three, five, and ten years.
 
Over the next thr
ee years, the biggest trend in our products will be the 
growth of video. This goes both for sharing, where we've seen Stories in 
Instagram and Status in WhatsApp grow very quickly, each with more than 
300 million daily actives, and also for consuming video
 
content. We recently 
launched the Watch tab, where you can discover shows, follow creators, 
connect with people watching an episode, and join groups with people with 
similar interests to build community.
 
But as video grows, it's important to remember that
 
Facebook is about 
bringing people closer together and enabling meaningful social interaction. 
It's not primarily about consuming content passively. Research shows that 
interacting with friends and family on social media tends to be more 
meaningful and can
 
be good for our well
-
being, and that's time well spent. 
But when we just passively consume content, that may be less true.
 
When done well, video brings us closer together. We've found that 
communities formed around video like TV shows or sport create a gr
eater 
sense of belonging than many other kinds of communities. We found that 
live videos generate 10 times the number of interactions and comments as 
other videos. But too often right now, watching a video is just a passive 
consumption experience. Time spe
nt is not a goal by itself. We want the 
time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interaction. 
So we're going to focus our products on all the ways to build community 
around the videos that people share and watch. That's something Facebo
ok 
can uniquely do.
 
Moving along, over the next five years, I expect us to make some good 
progress on several newer initiatives. In messaging, today already more 
than 20 million businesses are communicating with customers through 
Messenger. Now we're start
ing to test business features that make it easier 
for people to make the same kinds of connections with businesses through 
WhatsApp. We rolled out Marketplace to Canada and 17 countries across 
Europe, giving people the ability to discover, buy, and sell th
ings in their 
local communities. Today, more than 550 million people are using 
Marketplace and buy
-
and
-
sell groups on Facebook to connect with other 
people for transactions.
 
We're also seeing good progress with Workplace, helping companies connect 
their ow
n teams internally through their own versions of Facebook. It's been 
less than a year since we launched Workplace, and today more than 30,000 
companies are using it. This quarter, we welcomed on Walmart, the largest 
employer in the U.S.
 
Over the next 10 ye
ars, we are working on the foundational technologies 
needed to bring the world closer together. I'm proud of the work we're doing 
with AI. We're now using machine learning in most of our integrity work to 
keep our community safe. When Hurricane Maria hit P
uerto Rico, we used AI 
to look at satellite imagery and identify where people might live and need 
connectivity and other resources. Progress in AI can unlock a lot of 
opportunities. This quarter we opened a new AI research lab in Montreal, 
and we're buildi
ng another lab in Paris as well.
 
This quarter we held Oculus Connect and we announced Oculus Go, our first
-
ever all
-
in
-
one headset that's great for feeling like you're present with 
someone when you can't physically be together in person. It's great for 
pla
ying games, watching movies, or hanging out with friends. And at $199, 
we think it's going to help us bring great virtual reality experiences to more 
people. It ships next year.
 
At Connect, I also showed off our new Santa Cruz prototype, which is the 
first
 
time any company has shown the full experience of positional tracking 
in a standalone headset and controllers. It's a major technical achievement, 
and I'm looking forward to getting this into developers' hands next year.
 
In order to support our community'
s growth, we need to keep investing in 
our infrastructure. This quarter we broke ground on our New Albany [Ohio] 
data center, and we announced that we'll build our 11th major data center in 
Henrico County, Virginia. As always, all our new data centers are 
powered by 
100% renewable energy. These long
-
term investments are important for our 
community's future.
 
We can do a lot to help people connect through phones and computers, but 
so much more will be possible in a world where everyone has Internet 
access, where AI improves all our services, and where we can basically 
teleport anywhere or be with anyone anytime we want.
 
With all the issues we've faced, it would be a lot to just invest in addressing 
those. But we know that we also have a responsibilit
y to deliver these 
fundamental technical and scientific advances to fulfill the promise of 
bringing people closer together. So we're going to keep making significant 
investments looking ahead towards the future too.
 
We've made some real progress this year.
 
Across the board, we have a lot of 
work to deliver on our mission of bringing the world closer together, but 
we're committed to rising to the challenge and doing what we need to for 
our community.
 
Thanks to all of you for being a part of this journey, and
 
I'm looking forward 
to the road ahead. And now here's Sheryl to discuss our business.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
 
We had a strong third quarter, with growth across all regions, Marketer 
segments, and verticals. Ad
 
revenue grew 49% year over year. Mobile ad 
revenue was $8.9 billion, a 57% year
-
over
-
year increase, making up 
approximately 88% of total ad revenue.
 
We're continuing to build our business by focusing on our same three 
priorities: helping businesses levera
ge the power of mobile; developing new 
ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
 
Today, we're announcing that Facebook has over 6 million active advertisers, 
and we recently announced that Instagram has over 2 million advertisers. 
The va
st majority of these are small and medium
-
sized businesses, which 
are a major source of innovation and create more than half of all new jobs 
globally. These businesses often have small ad budgets, so the ability to 
reach people more effectively is really v
aluable to them.
 
A great example value is LoveBook, a small business in Michigan which lets 
you make personalized books for the people you love. During a recent 
campaign, they used Facebook ads to reach people getting ready to 
celebrate their first anniver
sary. They've grown so much from marketing on 
Facebook that they've been able to hire 10 new employees this year alone. 
We're proud of the role we are playing in enabling businesses like LoveBook 
to reach people on mobile, to grow, and to create jobs.
 
One 
of our strongest areas this quarter was SMBs in Europe, with revenue 
growing more than 60% year over year. When I was Germany two months 
ago, I had a chance to meet Victor, one of the cofounders of Brooklyn Soap 
Company, which despite its name is based in 
Hamburg. Victor and his 
friends came up with the idea for their business while staying in a hostel in 
Brooklyn. Now they sell their grooming products in 38 countries using mobile 
video ads on Facebook and Instagram. As a result, their sales increased 
62% o
ver the last year. They're one of many small businesses using mobile 
to find new customers and grow across borders.
 
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products. Video is exploding, 
and mobile video advertising is a big opportunity. Until recen
tly, ads were 
only eligible for Ad Breaks if they also ran in News Feed. But in Q3, we gave 
advertisers the option to run ads in videos alone. We're seeing good early 
results, with more than 70% of Ad Breaks up to 15 seconds in length on 
Facebook and Audie
nce Network viewed to completion, most with the sound 
on.
 
As Mark said, Instagram Stories are growing well too. People and businesses 
are finding creative new ways to use full
-
screen vertical video in Stories. 
This quarter, we gave advertisers even more fl
exibility in the content, 
format, and reach of their ads in Stories.
 
We're also seeing how immersive video and images can help people discover 
new products on Facebook. We added a new creative template to Collection 
Ads, which helps retailers bring their c
atalogs online. West Elm, a home 
décor company, recently used this template to promote its furniture and 
home accessories. They targeted people who already got their physical 
catalog and saw a 5.5% lift in purchases in store.
 
Our third priority is making o
ur ads more relevant and effective. In Q3, we 
introduced new tools powered by machine learning and automation to help 
businesses reach people more likely to spend with them. We also simplified 
the tools for creating ads, making it easier for businesses of 
all sizes to 
advertise with us.
 
It's important for all businesses to reach the right audience, but it's 
especially important for small businesses that have limited budgets. 
Targeting allows them to show ads only to the people they want to reach. 
Neon Retro
 
Arcade in L.A. is a great example. They advertise to people 
within 10 miles of their location who are interested in video games and 
comic books. Last year, they moved their entire ad budget to Facebook and 
Instagram, and their revenue was up 25%.
 
Relevanc
e and effectiveness are also about giving businesses more control 
over where their ads run. In Q3, we clarified which publishers and creators 
can include ads next to their content. This is good for creators who want 
guidance on how to earn money from their
 
content on Facebook, and it's 
good for advertisers who want transparency and control to make the right 
decisions for their brands. We're also working to give advertisers more 
clarity on where their ads are shown so they can make more informed 
choices abou
t where to run them in the future.
 
I want to close by talking about what we're doing to protect our platform 
and help ensure that the ads and content people see on Facebook and 
Instagram are legitimate and authentic. When I was in Washington a few 
weeks ag
o, I made it clear that we are determined to do everything we can 
do to minimize abuse going forward.
 
As Mark said, we're investing heavily in new technology and people to review 
ads and posts. This will enable us to look more closely at the content of the
 
ads, targeting, and the advertiser who submits them, as well as tighten our 
ads policies, particularly for ads directed at social and political issues. We 
believe that ads are important to free expression and we will continue to 
accept ads on issues, but 
we will also do our part to elevate the quality of 
that discourse.
 
Transparency helps everyone keep advertisers accountable for their 
messages. We're working with Congress on new requirements for online 
political advertising, but we are not waiting for leg
islation. We're building a 
tool now that will allow anyone to see the ads of pages running, even if 
those ads are not targeted to them. We will test it soon in Canada and then 
in the U.S. in the coming months.
 
For ads related to U.S. federal elections, we'
ll start sharing even more 
information, including an archive of past ads, the total amount spent, and 
demographics about the people the ad reached. We're also going to require 
more thorough documentation from these advertisers and will label their ads 
so i
t's clear who paid for them. We believe these actions will set a new 
standard for transparency in online ads.
 
Because the interference on our platform went beyond ads, we're also 
increasing transparency around organic content from pages. We're looking at 
w
ays to provide more information about who's behind a political or issue
-
based Facebook page. We believe this will make it harder for deceptive 
pages to gain large followings and make it easier for us to identify malicious 
activity.
 
We are all committed to 
getting this right and to investing and strengthening 
our platform so we can better serve our community. We are also committed 
to continuing to help businesses all over the world attract customers, sell 
their products, and create jobs. As always, I'm grate
ful to all of our clients 
for their partnership and to our global Facebook teams for their hard work.
 
Thank you, and now here's Dave.

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone.
 
Q3 was another great quarter for Facebook. 
We saw continued growth in 
engagement in our community as well as strong performance in our ads 
business.
 
Let's begin with our community metrics. Daily active users in Q3 reached 
1.37 billion, up 16% compared to last year. This number represents 66% of 
our
 
2.07 billion monthly active users in Q3. MAUs were up 284 million year 
over year or 16%.
 
Our community growth was again driven by product improvements, 
promotional data plans, and internet.org. Note that in Q3 we began to lap 
the introduction of 
promotional data plans from mobile operators in markets 
like India.
 
Before going to the financials, let me touch briefly on our ongoing effort to 
improve our user aspects. This quarter we implemented a new methodology 
to help identify duplicate accounts. A
s a result, we increased our estimates 
for duplicate accounts to approximately 10% of worldwide MAUs from our 
previously disclosed estimate of 6%. Duplicate accounts are those that we 
believe are used by the same person and represent real activity and 
enga
gement on Facebook.
 
We have also increased our estimate for inauthentic accounts to 
approximately 2% to 3% of worldwide MAUs. Inauthentic accounts are 
largely those that are used for spam and other policy violating reasons. We 
continuously monitor and aggr
essively take down those accounts. These 
accounts tend to be less active and thus we believe impact DAU less than 
MAU.
 
Now turning to the financials, all comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q3 total revenue was $10.3 billion, 
up 47% or 45% 
on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed $128 
million of revenue in Q3. Q3 total ad revenue was $10.1 billion, up 49%. On 
a constant currency basis, our ad revenue growth rate was 47%, down 2 
percentage points comp
ared to the growth in Q2.
 
Ad revenue growth was strong globally, led by Europe and APAC with 56% 
and 54% growth respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $8.9 billion, up 57%. 
In Q3, the average price per ad increased 35%, and the number of ad 
impressions served
 
increased 10%, driven primarily by Feed ads on 
Facebook and Instagram.
 
I would note that compared to a year ago, price is a much more important 
driver of our ads revenue growth. Payments and other fees revenue was 
$186 million, down 5%.
 
Total expenses wer
e $5.2 billion, up 34%. Q3 was our biggest hiring quarter 
ever. We added over 2,500 people and ended the quarter with over 23,000 
employees, up 47% compared to last year.
 
Operating income was $5.1 billion, representing a 50% operating margin. 
Our tax rate 
in the third quarter was 10%. Excess tax benefits recognized 
from share
-
based compensation decreased our effective tax rate by 6 
percentage points, a level that was driven by appreciation in our stock price.
 
Net income was $4.7 billion or $1.59 per share. 
Year
-
to
-
date capital 
expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, driven by investments in 
servers, data centers, office facilities, and network infrastructure. In Q3, we 
generated over $4.3 billion in free cash flow, and ended the quarter with 
over $38 b
illion in cash and investments.
 
Year to date, we have bought back over $1 billion of our Class A common 
stock.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook, our ads business remains strong, but 
it's worth noting that in Q3, our year
-
over
-
year ads revenue growth rate
s 
decelerated for the fifth consecutive quarter on a constant currency basis, 
and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Going 
forward, we also expect the growth in advertising revenue will increasingly 
be driven by price. This is a s
hift from prior years, when growth was 
primarily driven by increases in supply.
 
Turning now to expenses, we anticipate that our full
-
year 2017 total 
expenses will grow approximately 35% to 40% versus our prior range of 
40% to 45%. We anticipate that full
-
y
ear 2017 capital expenditures will be 
approximately $7 billion. As mentioned previously, our tax rate will vary 
based on our stock price. At the current stock price, we would expect that 
the Q4 rate will be in the low teens.
 
I also wanted to provide some c
omments on 2018 expenses and capital 
expenditures. Please recognize that these are preliminary estimates, as we 
have not yet finalized our 2018 budget. That said, it is shaping up to a be a 
significant investment year, and I wanted to provide initial guida
nce to align 
investors with our most current thinking.
 
We expect full
-
year 2018 total expenses will grow approximately 45% to 
60% compared to full
-
year 2017. We continued to invest aggressively across 
the business, but there are three important factors dri
ving an acceleration in 
our expense growth rates from 2017 levels.
 
First, as Mark outlined in his earlier comments, we are making sizable 
security investments in people and technology to strengthen our systems 
and prevent abuse. Secondly, we are investing 
aggressively in video content 
to support the Watch tab. Finally, we continue to invest in our long
-
term 
initiatives around augmented and virtual reality, AI, and connectivity. Given 
our expectation of continued deceleration in revenue growth rates, we 
expe
ct these significant investments will be net negative on our operating 
margins.
 
In addition, we expect to make substantial investments in our infrastructure 
to support growth and improve our products. As such, we expect full
-
year 
2018 capital expenditures 
will roughly double from 2017 levels.
 
We would also anticipate that the full
-
year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid
-
teens.
 
In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook across the board. 
We are excited about the opportunities we see ahead and will 
continue to 
make significant investments to support our growth and our mission.
 
With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
We will now open the lines for a question
-
and
-
answer session. Your first 
question co
mes from the line of Eric Sheridan, UBS.
 
Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe revisiting Mark's comments at the 
beginning of the call, I would love to get a better sense or granularity about 
what sort of video content
 
you'd like to see on the platform that could drive 
a more active or interactive experience than passive.
 
And then the second question would be, what does that mean in terms of 
the business model? Would there be licensing content, funding content that 
you 
have to do to build the sort of business you're aiming for over the 
medium to long term? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
So the strategy here around helping people connect reflects more on what 
we do around the videos than some of the co
ntent itself. So hopefully, the 
experience on Facebook will not just be that you come and watch a video 
and you get informed, you feel entertained, and that's it. We think that the 
most valuable thing that people do are help build relationships with other 
people on the platform. So to the extent that video can serve as a 
touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then 
that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do.
 
So we're going to continue investing heavily in video conte
nt for Watch that 
is centered around people, that is centered around the things that people 
want to talk and connect around, that give people a sense of pride and bring 
people together. But we're going to invest as much in just making sure that 
we build ou
t the community features around that. And that I think is going 
to be the thing that differentiates this over time.

Your next question comes from Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my 
questions. I have two. Just, Mark, to go back on your 
focus on community and video, I was wondering if you could share with us 
or help us understand what you're seeing in engagement trends or maybe 
time spent per user on the core Facebook platform, as you'
ve had so many 
efforts focused on community and video.
 
And then secondly for Sheryl, you made such good progress growing the 
advertising business across SMB in a lot of verticals. I wonder. If you step 
back, could you talk to any areas or any verticals whe
re you really see the 
potential for material improvements or verticals you're having a hard time 
cracking into that you think can really be bigger drivers of ad revenue 
growth going forward?
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
So, Brian, just on engagement me
trics, we're continuing to see good growth 
in DAU, as you saw in the 16% growth that we posted this quarter. In 
addition, we do continue to see time spent growth per DAU on the Facebook 
family and on Facebook.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
For my p
art, when I think about our Marketer segment, we have SMBs; we 
have brand, direct response, and developers. We're seeing strong growth 
across. I think if you think about where the growth remains, it really is in 
increasing the relevance of the ads, because
 
the ads I think are getting 
better in terms of reaching the right people at the right time. But I think 
there's still a lot more we can do. And as people really use our Custom 
Audiences, our targeting tools, the quality of the ads improve and the 
returns 
improve. And the more we 

 
the better we get at measuring those 
returns, the better the ads get.
 
And so I'll share just one example but one I really love, which is the 
Alameda County Fair, which is a local fairground in Pleasanton, California. I 
happened t
o meet this woman, Angel [Moore], who's running their 
marketing this year. And they use Facebook to target people within 25 miles 
of their fairgrounds age 20 to 51 who have specific interests in concerts, 
music festivals, and theme parks. And what they saw
 
for season pass ticket 
sales for 2017 was a 50% increase compared to 2016, and they attribute 
that to Facebook. And that's really about finding the people that are 
interested.
 
And if you look at the percentage of our ads business where people are 
using ou
r most sophisticated approaches to finding the right audience, I 
think we still have a lot of opportunity for growth there, and that will 
improve both the quality of the ads people see but also the returns to 
marketers. And I think that will hit all of the
 
verticals and all of the 
segments.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Mark May, Citi.
 
Mark A. May

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thank you. I had two related questions on video. First on the OpEx 
guidance, one of the real consistencies of the busine
ss is OpEx growth. 
You've been growing that at $4 billion to $5 billion incremental spend per 
year, but the midpoint of your guidance is looking like a $14 billion increase 
next year. Is the differential there, the additional $6 billion to $7 billion, 
shou
ld we be thinking of that as the video content spend that you're setting 
aside possibly to spend next year? I'm just trying to understand where this 
significant increase would be coming from.
 
And then related, the 35% increase in ad prices 

 
would you say 
that that's 
predominantly being driven, the acceleration there, by the mix towards 
video, Ad Breaks, and other longer
-
form video ads? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure, Mark. So on the acceleration of the growth rate in expenses from 2017 
to 20
18, I would really look at the growth rate that we grew at in 2017, 
apply that to the total expense base, and look at that growth in 2018. And 
then I would say the additional expense that leads to the acceleration is 
driven by three factors, not just one f
actor.
 
And those three factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary: 
number one, the substantial investment that Mark highlighted that we're 
making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content 
investments we're making for W
atch tab; and then three, additional 
investments we're making in the long term initiatives like AR/VR, AI, and 
connectivity. And each of those are significant, so it's really the combination 
of those three factors that's driving the expense growth accelera
tion.
 
And then on the 35% increases in ad prices, this is really being driven off of 
a couple things. One is just the auction dynamic, which as supply growth has 
slowed, then there's more competition, and you're seeing prices increase as 
demand continues t
o grow.
 
But I think what is important here is we've been getting better and better at 
targeting as we optimize for real business results for advertisers, and we're 
better at converting the signals that we get from those advertisers into 
finding the right a
d spots for them. And I think that's really what's allowing 
us to improve yield and effectively driving higher effective CPMs for us while 
still delivering business outcomes to them at attractive ROIs.
 
So that's really what's driving it, not a shift to a d
ifferent format like video. 
It's really about us getting better at targeting and working with especially 
people where we get those downstream signals like direct response 
advertisers.

Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to hit on two topics. First just on 
the security comments, you talked about head count increasing from 10,000 
to 20,000. I was hoping you could just help us understan
d. Is that 10,000 
fully in the 23,000 head count that you have today, or is there a part of it 
that's not included in there, perhaps because it's not full time?
 
And then just secondly, just going back to the ad pricing changes, Dave, just 
to clarify on tha
t, it sounds like what you're saying is it's not that advertisers 
across the board are seeing that substantial of an increase in pricing, but 
that's more in output in your eCPM. Is that the right way to think about it? 
Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, I
nc.
 
Right, Doug. So on the first one, the 10,000 number, that encompasses both 
employees at Facebook and also employees at partners, so it's not all 
Facebook employees. So that's a fully loaded number. So that's also in the 
OpEx guidance as well. But 
yes, you can't compare the 10,000 to the 23,000 
directly.
 
On the ad pricing, what you're seeing is that most of the advertising that we 
get isn't necessarily bid on an impression basis. You're getting people 
bidding for other actions and optimizing against
 
other actions like a click to a 
website or a downstream e
-
commerce transaction, an app install. And our 
ability to optimize the inventory that we have against those downstream 
activities allows us to deliver those at still good prices while still seeing 
e
ffective CPMs go up.
 
You do have obviously people who are bidding on impressions if they're 
looking for a brand campaign or a reach campaign, but those aren't 
necessarily a part of the business that's driving up prices. It's more around 
just us doing a bet
ter job at being able to optimize campaigns for people 
who have downstream activities that we can do that for.

Great, thank you. I 
wanted to just ask a question about your content 
strategy, and I was wondering. How do you think about Facebook Watch in 
terms of Facebook

ype of content 
that you think will be best suited to optimize the Watch experience. Thank 
you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
I think it might be useful to talk a step back and first talk about why we're 
funding lighthouse content and Watch overal
l. So video is growing incredibly 
quickly on Facebook. And today, most of that is in News Feed. But most 
people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today in general 
are trying figure out 

 
they're trying to see what's going on with their 
friends
, see what's happening in the world. They're not coming necessarily 
to engage in a specific type of video or specific community around video. So 
the Watch tab is mainly 

 
it's a way to give people a tool to do that. When 
they want to specifically come and 
engage around video or communities 
around that, they can go to the Watch tab. So the intent there is different.
 
Now in order to build that up, we think it makes sense to first invest in a 
bunch of lighthouse content, some that we may produce or some that w
e 
may license, to get to your question. We're pretty agnostic on how that 
goes. We just want to start the flywheel going, so that way there's content 
and communities that are there that support this use case of people coming 
to Facebook specifically to eng
age in that.
 
Long term, our hope is that the business here will primarily be through 
revenue shares of videos that normal creators and businesses put into the 
system rather than ones that we proactively go out and license ourselves. So 
that's a look at whe
re we're trying to get on this. But first, we need to build 
this behavior where people want to come intentionally to engage with this 
content.

So on 
the first part, Ken, you're going to see that show up in a variety of 
different line items that we don't have it specifically broken out. We're 
making substantial product and engineering investments. So as part of the 
overall hiring on R&D head count, ther
e's going be a pretty significant 
allocation of that to some of the product
-
related security initiatives that 
we're doing. So that's going to show up in R&D.
 
You're going to have some of the ads work that we're doing, the ads quality 
work showing up in the
 
sales and marketing line, so you're going to see 
some there. And then you're going to also just have overall impact on G&A 
as well for things like policy

related expenses and the like. So I think you're 
going to see it impacting across the spectrum of our
 
lines, but overall one of

On GDPR, the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in

transparency and 
control, and we're building on this to ensure that we comply in May of next

users opt out of certain services, but we're going to continue to give people 
personal
ized experience and be clear about how we're using the data. We 
believe that we'll be able to obtain consent for uses of the data across 
Europe and that people still expect the content and their ads to be relevant. 
And so we expect a good result here and w
e're going to do it very carefully

Great, two things. First, as you've integrate

I'll talk about video engagement, and then Dave can jump in on some of the 
stats. So one of the important points here that I tried to communicate in my 
comments up front is that connecting with friends and family and having 
those meaningful interac
tions is more important than just consuming 
content. So video is growing incredibly quickly, and that goes across both 
social content and more passive public consumption of content. And they 
create different dynamics in the system, and I think that's an im
portant 
thing to understand.
 
When your friend posts something and you get to engage with it, it might 
inform you and entertain you. But you also, if you interact with it, you're 
building a relationship with that person or you feel closer to that person, an
d 
that is a really important part of what social networking is supposed to do. 
Whereas when you engage with public content, you might get informed or 
be entertained, but it's not necessarily increasing social capital in the same 
way or building relationshi
ps between people.
 
So we really differentiate what the core thing is that we're trying to do, 
which is help people connect with each other and build meaningful 
relationships. And that's why on a lot of these calls, I emphasize products 
like 
Instagram Stories or WhatsApp Status, which are very video
-
based 
products, but they're improving social interactions. And we're going to focus 
a lot more on helping people share videos of their moments in their lives. 
Because in a lot of ways, I think if y
ou take a video of yourself and your 
family out trick
-
or
-
treating, that's more engaging than a photo and a better 
representation of that than writing it out in text.
 
But overall, I would say not all time spent is created equal. That's why I 
tried to stress
 
up front that time spent is not a goal by itself here. What we 
really want to go for is time well spent. And what the research that we found 
shows is that when you're actually engaging with people and having 
meaningful connections, that's time well spent,
 
and that's the thing that we 
want to focus on.
 
So out of this big video thing that's growing very quickly, I think that is the 
real opportunity and product area that we should be focused on more. And 
to the extent that there is going be a lot of public co
ntent, which there will 
be, a big part of the focus is going to be around building community and 
interactions around that content.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Justin, then your question on ARPU in the U.S., we do think that there are 
opportunities to 
continue to grow the business in the U.S. on a lot of 
different fronts. So we can continue to grow engagement on core Facebook, 
as well as there are opportunities with Instagram and the other services that 
we have that are not monetizing significantly toda
y, so there are 
opportunities there.
 
But most importantly, I would go back to the fact that we're getting better 
on the ad product side of being able to optimize our inventory for the 
advertisers in a way that will we think drive good pricing in the system
 
for us 
and good outcomes for the advertisers. So we do think that that will lead to 
the potential for additional revenue growth in the U.S.

Gr
eat, I had two questions for Mark. One, so, Mark, as you look to make 
changes around safety and security and ring
-
fence the fake news issue, do 
you think that will have any adverse impact on engagement, or is it just too 
small to even be material?
 
And then
 
a follow
-
up on the video consumption comment happening mostly 
in the Feed, is the deceleration you guys are seeing around impression 
growth right now a function of promoting video in the Feed versus what 
other things that might be in there? And I guess as
ked a different way, 
should we see impression growth revert back to view (43:52) growth at 
some point? And is that likely next year, or is that further off into the future? 
Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So I can take the second one, which is 
the question about impression 
growth. So there are a couple factors there. Certainly, this quarter we saw 
that ad load had a much less significant impact on impression growth. So 
overall, that story has played out as we thought, and that's one of the 
reaso
ns you're seeing the impression growth come down. And then yes, I do 
think that there are less impressions when people are consuming video, so 
that also is a factor as more time is spent on videos. So I think you have 
both of those factors coming into play
.
 
In terms of how those play out going forward, hard to say. I would just point 
to our overall comments on just continued revenue growth deceleration. And 
I believe the first question was whether the security investments would have 
an adverse impact on eng
agement.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yes, and I can speak to that. Let me be clear on this, that people do not 
want false news or hate speech or bullying or any of the bad content that 
we're talking about. So to the extent that we can eradicate
 
that from the 
platform, that will create a better product, which will also create a stronger 
long
-
term community and better business as well.
 
So the reason why we haven't been able to get these things to the level that 
we want today is not because we some
how want them on the platform. It's 
that it's a really hard problem. And we're going to invest both in people and 
technology because we think that both are really important parts of the 
solution here, to go after all different parts of these problems.
 
And 
that was what I tried to stress earlier on. We're going from 10,000 
people working on safety and security to more than doubling that to 20,000. 
We're building 

 
we're doubling 

 
in some cases more 

 
our engineering 
teams focused on security. We're building
 
AI to go after more different areas 
of harmful content and finding fake accounts and other bad actors in the 
system. And I expect that all of these things will make our product better 
over the long term, but we will incur the expenses a lot sooner as we r
amp 
up these efforts.
 
And I also just think that going forward, we're going to be investing in these 
things at a much higher level because we realize that this is important, not 
only for our community and this company, but it's part of our responsibility 
t
o society overall.

Hi. Thanks for taking the question, a couple things. You talk about creators, 
I think, Mark, creating for the platform on their own w
ithout you having to 
invest. But I'm just trying to frame it in the sense of Hollywood. I look at 
what Apple is doing now and hiring a couple of Sony executives and doing a 
$5 million an episode buy of a Steven Spielberg show.
 
I'm guess what I'm trying to 
understand 

 
or I think a lot of investors are 
trying to understand is what type of content do you ultimately want? 
Because I don't think someone like Spielberg is going to work for an ad 
revenue share, no matter how good that advertising is. So how do you
 
balance what type of content business you ultimately want to build?
 
And then when you look at sports, which I also think about as being really 
relevant content that has a huge community around it, something like the 
NFL mobile rights I think come up next 
year. I'm wondering how important 
is that type of content? I know you were bidding on cricket rights overseas, 
but how important is sports in this mix?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Well, I think the answer to that is we don't know all the answer
s around 
what kinds of content are going to work and are not, so we will probably 
experiment with a number of different things.
 
I do think your point is right that not all kinds of content can be supported 
by ads, no matter how effective we make that. That
 
said, the current model 
that we have for at least getting some of the lighthouse content onto the 
platform is to pay up front. And what we would like to transition that more 
to over time and what an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue 
shares f
or ads shown in the videos. And as we do better and better on the 
monetization there, that will support people with higher production costs and 
doing more premium production and bringing their content to the platform.
 
And we've certainly found on the 
Internet and YouTube and in other places 
that there are whole industries around creators with different cost structures 
than traditional Hollywood folks who can produce very informative and 
engaging content that a lot of people like and enjoy and that buil
ds 
communities and that helps people connect together in a way that definitely 
can be supported by this ad model.
 
So I think the answer is we're going to try a bunch of things. That's a bunch 
of what the budget is. I'm very optimistic that a lot of this st
uff will be able 
to be supported long term, but you're certainly right that not all of it will be 
able to be supported by ad models alone.

I think 

 
look,
 
today we're talking about the additional investments we're 
making in terms of the lighthouse content on the Watch tab, so we are 
putting a substantial investment behind that. That clearly is going to have 
implications for margins along with the other big 
investments that we're 
making next year. And then even after we establish a flywheel here and get 
content being produced for ad revenue share, that's going have a different 
margin structure than core News Feed. So even going forward, there's going 
be reven
ue share back to the content creator, so it's going have a different 
margin structure than the core business.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

I think it's worth adding that the ad inventory itself is really valuable for 
marketers and our clients and 
also works very well with our other ad 
products, so I'll share a recent one. Visa with SocialCode and BBDO created 
10
-
second videos with text overlays showing people making digital 
payments. And they targeted millennials and early tech adopters. And they 
r
an ads 

 
one group for Facebook News Feed only, one group for Ad Breaks 
only, and one group for News Feed and Ad Breaks combined. And the best 
results combined the Ad Breaks and the News Feed. They had a seven times 
lower cost per video view compared to Ne
ws Feed alone.
 
And so one of the opportunities we have here is increasing inventory, and 
it's particularly good inventory for marketers because we're seeing nice 
adoption of video views and really nice impact from those sales. And it's also 
the case that o
ur ad products work together. The ability to show something 
in News Feed and then show a video in Watch and then show something on 
Instagram and measure results across the full funnel we think are very 
worthy investments for the long

Sorry about that, a comment and two questions. I think this incremental

that community maximization, including security, would lead to long
-

Two quick questions, the Watch tab, is there any evidence or any data points 
you can give us to what kind of traction you're seeing with that so far? I was 
surprised by how many people are on the Marketplace. Any relevant data 
like that for Watch ta
b?
 
And then secondly, of all the regions, Europe really stuck out to us as one 
that showed surprising acceleration. And I know you talked a little bit about 
that, Sheryl did, about the SMB pickup in traction there. Any other color for 
why Europe would have
 
accelerated so much in terms of its revenue growth? 
Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner

Sure, let me I guess hit both of those and then Sheryl can add any color 
she'd like. On the Watch tab, I think it's just early. So I think it's too early to 
be
 
talking about any stats there.
 
In terms of Europe, one thing to note is that we did pick up currency 
advantages there. So it was 56% on a reported basis but 51% on a constant 
currency basis, still a healthy growth rate. I think it's a strong economy 
there
. I think the team is executing well there, so I think you've got a 
variety of factors. As then as Sheryl commented in her prepared remarks, 
SMB has been particularly strong in Europe. And so I think that's one of the 
key drivers and one of the things we'r

up on safety and

course of time the trend in usage as younger people hit different milestones 
in life such as graduating from college or gettin

Face
book, Inc.
 
Sure, I'll speak to the safety and security investment, and then Dave can 
speak to the other question. So we need both technology and people for 
this. And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has 
different strengths than people d
o. So the AI tools that we've built can 
enable a system to look at millions of pieces of content and make rough 
assessments on them and figure out what to flag for people. But ultimately, 
if you want to get those high
-
quality judgments today on sensitive c
ontent 
and you want to do it quickly when the stakes are pretty high in terms of 
taking down content or leaving things up, and we take that extremely 
seriously, you want people to be looking at that.
 
So earlier in the year, when we were working on problems
 
like seeing issues 
when people were going live, there was this really serious issue around 
people with self
-
harm and in some cases suicide on Live, and we made an 
investment in AI tools and in dramatically increasing the staffing of the team 
that was work
ing on that and brought the amount of time to review those 
Live videos down through a combination of those things to 

 
I think it's 
under 10 minutes now. That might still be a conservative estimate, and 
we're continuing to work on that.
 
So now what we're t
rying to do is just increase the SLAs that we have across 
all of these different types of content and security threats that we might see. 
So that way, through a combination of the AI tooling that we build and 
having people to look at these things, we can g
et it right faster for more of 
the types of content.
 
And you're definitely right that a lot of the AI research that we do is 
applicable to multiple areas, but we still need to build those tools. So it takes 
a lot of engineering investment, and we will be p
rioritizing that, in some 
cases by adding people to teams and in other cases by trading off and doing 
more security work instead of other product work that we might have done, 
but this is really important and this is our priority.

Thank you very much, just one question. You guys unbundled the video buy. 
Can you speak to pricing relative to that 35% average increase in ad

today between pricing on the new video platform and the legacy video 
platform? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-

So I'm not totally clear on what you mean by the new video platform and 
the
 
legacy video platform, but I would just say that this is primarily driven 
by News Feed pricing, and then you have right
-
hand
-
column pricing as well, 
so you have impressions on Facebook News Feed, Instagram feed, as well as 
Facebook right
-
hand column. Ad B
reaks are really a relatively small 

 
a very 
small factor today. So the pricing is really about what is the pricing that 
you're seeing in the overall system primarily driven on the Feed
-
based 
products. So that's really what the driver is. And, again there,
 
I would point 
to the comments that I made about getting better at targeting and driving 
towards good outcomes for advertisers as being the reason that we've been 
able to support higher prices.

Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today.
 
This quarter we reached an important milest
one for our community. 2 billion 
people now use Facebook every month, and more than 1.3 billion people use 
it daily. We also saw good results on the business, with total revenue 
growing by 45% year over year to $9.3 billion, and advertising revenue up 
47% 
to $9.2 billion.
 
We're proud of the progress we're making, and it also comes with a 
responsibility to make sure that we have the most positive impact on the 
world that we can. That's why last month we updated Facebook's mission. 
For the past decade, we foc
used on making the world more open and 
connected. We have a lot more to do here to give people a voice and help 
everyone stay connected with their family and friends, but now I believe we 
have a responsibility to do even more. Our new mission is to bring t
he world 
closer together.
 
A big part of this mission is building communities. Communities give us the 
sense that we're part of something bigger than ourselves, that we're not 
alone, and that we have something better ahead to work towards. Last 
month, we ha
d our first
-
ever Facebook Community Summit to talk about our 
product roadmap, focused on building what we call meaningful communities. 
Meaningful communities on Facebook are groups that quickly become an 
important part of your social network experience and
 
your real world support 
structure. And right now, over 100 million people are members of these 
groups, from new parents to people suffering from rare diseases. These 
groups often span online and offline and bring people together physically as 
well as over
 
the Internet.
 
Our goal is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful communities. 
And part of this involves helping people discover the right groups, which is 
why we're building technology like AI to better understand people's interests 
and sugges
t groups that might be meaningful to them. And in the six 
months after we started working on this, we've already helped more than 
50% more people join meaningful communities than had before them, so we 
have a lot more to do here.
 
We also want to make it ea
sier for people to build and lead communities. 
Last month, we launched new tools for group admins, making it easier for 
them to get Insights into who their members are, filter member requests, 
and remove bad actors and their content quickly to keep a posit
ive and safe 
environment.
 
Next, I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three 
time horizons: making our existing services more useful now; building new 
ecosystems over the next five years around our products that a lot of people 
alrea
dy use; and creating foundational technologies to achieve our mission 
over the next ten years.
 
So we're pleased with the growth that we're seeing with Stories. Instagram 
Stories now has more than 250 million people using it daily, and WhatsApp 
Stories also
 
now has more than 250 million people using it daily. We're 
always working to improve and give people more ways to share. And this 
quarter we added the ability to reply to Stories with a photo or video and 
share a replay of live video on Instagram.
 
I am ex
cited about how AI will improve people's experiences across our 
products. We're finding AI is both delivering consistent improvements to 
many of our systems, like News Feed, search, ads, security, and spam 
filtering and more. But more than just improving t
hese existing experiences, 
I expect AI to change the way that we do business in some important ways. 
So for example, today to keep our community safe, we rely on people 
flagging content that might violate our community standards for us to 
review. In the fu
ture, AI will be able to help flag more of this content faster 
before people have even seen it.
 
Now we've started using AI to fight terrorism and keep propaganda and 
extremist accounts off Facebook. We've even started experimenting with 
using AI to underst
and texts that might be used to promote terrorism.
 
When it comes to News Feed, we currently mostly show you content from 
people and pages you're connected to. And we can write this better with 
algorithm improvements, but the really big improvement from AI 
will be 
when we can understand all the other content that's out there so we can 
help you discover much more of what matters to you beyond just what your 
friends are up to.
 
On the business side, we're seeing a large shift in the way that marketing 
works. In
 
the first wave of marketing, people would buy ads and media they 
thought their customers might watch like a TV show that had similar 
demographics, but they wouldn't know who saw their ads. The Internet gave 
people the power to target their messages to peo
ple who actually might be 
interested and to measure results much more precisely, and that was a big 
improvement. And now AI is taking this a step further. Now you can put a 
creative message out there, and AI can help you figure out who will be most 
interes
ted. A lot of the time you don't even need to target now because AI 
can do it more precisely and better than we can manually. This makes the 
ads that you see more relevant for you and more efficient for businesses. 
Those are just a few of the reasons why I
'm optimistic about how AI is going 
to improve our core services over the next few years.
 
Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around products 
that a lot of people are already using. We've talked about how video will 
continue to be a b
ig focus and area of investment for us. It's growing 
quickly, and we're introducing new features to make the video experience 
even better. For example, in May we made the option to go live with 
someone else available to all profiles and pages on iOS. And w
e also 
launched closed caption to make Live more accessible.
 
We're also working to build a business ecosystem around Messenger and 
WhatsApp. Messenger and WhatsApp both have large communities, and 
they're growing quickly, with 1 billion people now using Wh
atsApp daily. It is 
still early on the monetization side here, although we have started showing 
ads to a small number of people on Messenger. I want to see us move a 
little faster here, but I'm confident that we're going to get this right over the 
long ter
m.
 
Now finally, over the next 10 years, we're working on foundational 
technologies that are necessary to achieve our mission. In VR, we launched 
Live from Spaces, so you can go live with friends in different places. And we 
think that this has the potential
 
to be a powerful tool to bring people 
together and help build community in some new ways.
 
We're also working to help everyone in the world access the opportunities 
that come with the Internet. In May, we successfully flew Aquila, the solar 
powered plane t
hat we're building to beam Internet to parts of the world 
that currently don't have access, and that was the second successful flight. 
These initiatives and other projects require a lot of ongoing aggressive 
investment in the infrastructure to serve our co
mmunities. Last quarter, our 
Fort Worth data center went live and is now serving traffic using 100% 
renewable energy, and we're also expanding our data centers in Los Lunas, 
New Mexico and Altoona, Iowa.
 
This first half of 2017 has been an important period
 
for Facebook. We've 
achieved some major milestones, delivered good business results, and set 
clear goals around building strong communities and bringing people and the 
world closer together, but we have a long way to go. So thanks to our 
community, our te
ams, and our partners for all being a part of this mission. 
I'm looking forward to making more progress together.
 
And now here's Sheryl.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
 
We had a strong second quarter and a great 
first half of the year. Our 
business continues to deliver terrific results. Q2 ad revenue grew 47% year 
over year. Mobile ad revenue grew 53% year over year to $8 billion and is 
now 87% of total ad revenue. Our growth continues to be broad
-
based 
across reg
ions, marketer segments, and verticals.
 
Our goal is to build meaningful connections between people and businesses 
by focusing on our three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the 
power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ad
s 
more relevant and effective.
 
Our first priority is helping businesses leverage the power of mobile. People 
are rapidly increasing the time they spend on mobile, and businesses know 
they need to be where consumers are. Given the size and engagement of 
our
 
audiences, Facebook and Instagram are the best platforms to reach 
people and drive business results. We have over 70 million businesses on 
Facebook, and I'm excited to announce today that we now have more than 
15 million business profiles on Instagram.
 
Vi
deo is an important part of our mobile strategy. More video is being shared 
and watched on Facebook than ever before, and it's increasingly helping 
people and businesses connect. That's because video on Facebook is 
personal, so it's around connections, con
versations, and communities. This is 
why it creates opportunities for businesses to reach people in new and 
creative ways. People consume content faster on their phones, and 
marketers are increasingly recognizing that this behavior is different from 
other 
media. This means that developing short
-
form snackable content is a 
big opportunity on mobile. We're working hard to help marketers adopt 
mobile
-
first video ad strategies for Facebook and Instagram.
 
In a mobile environment, native mobile video ads typicall
y outperform more 
traditional ads. For example, when Tropicana launched its probiotic juice, the 
company tested 6
-
second video ads against 15 and 30
-
second ads. The 
shorter ads resulted in higher brand metrics across the board, including a 
16
-
point lift in
 
brand awareness compared to a 6
-
point lift for the longer 
ads.
 
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products. We're listening 
closely to feedback from marketers around the world to develop new ad 
formats and innovate on existing ones. Last quar
ter, I talked about how our 
Dynamic Ads help retailers and e
-
commerce companies promote their 
products across devices. Dynamic Ads show people the products that are 
most relevant to them based on actions they've taken, such as viewing 
items on a company's 
website.
 
This quarter, we continued to improve Dynamic Ads and extended them to 
new verticals and categories. Delta Airlines used our new flight format to 
reach people who had searched for a flight but not yet booked one. Delta 
was able to run personalized
 
ads based on the routes people viewed on their 
site and then bring people back to their booking page. This resulted in a 
12.7 times return on ad spend.
 
This quarter we also rolled out ads in Instagram Stories for all types of 
marketer objectives. As Mark 
described, Instagram Stories are growing 
incredibly well and are, therefore, a big opportunity for marketers. From 
driving brand awareness to increasing sales, businesses can now use full
-
screen Instagram Stories ads for any goal. For example, Ben & Jerry'
s 
created a brand awareness campaign using vertical video in Instagram 
Stories and saw a 14 point lift in ad recall and a 2 point lift in purchase 
intent for its new Pint Slices ice cream.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. T
his means 
better targeting and better measurement across Facebook, Instagram, and 
Audience Network. Marketers of all sizes are increasingly following our best 
practices, like optimizing their ads to drive real
-
world outcomes rather than 
focusing on proxy m
etrics such as page likes and video views. 53% of our 
revenue from SMBs is from campaigns that use these tools and strategies, 
up from 23% in the beginning of last year.
 
This quarter, we also added new ways for marketers to improve their 
targeting and spen
d more efficiently. For example, we introduced value 
optimization, which helps businesses show ads to people who are most likely 
to spend based on previous purchase behavior. We also introduced value
-
based Lookalike Audiences, which use machine learning to
 
help marketers 
reach people who are similar to their most valuable current customers.
 
For example, California
-
based accessory company, Nomad, built a custom 
audience of people in the U.S. who bought something on their site, and then 
created a multi
-
countr
y Lookalike Audience of people with similar 
characteristics. They targeted ads to their international audience across 
Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network, resulting in a 2.7 times return 
on ad spend.
 
We know that many marketers want to verify and com
pare results across 
platforms, and that's why we're focused on giving our clients more options 
for third
-
party measurement and verification. We now have 24 partners in 
our measurement system, including three partners measuring viewability, 
and we're in the
 
process of adding two more viewability partners, 
DoubleVerify and Meetrics.
 
As the first half of 2017 comes to a close, we feel good about the progress 
we're making. As marketers build more meaningful connections with people 
on mobile, we help them grow t
heir businesses, which in turn grows ours. I 
continue to be grateful to our clients and partners all around the world and 
to our global team to make all of this possible.
 
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and goo
d afternoon, everyone. Echoing Mark and Sheryl's 
comments, Q2 was another strong quarter for Facebook. We continue to see 
strong growth and engagement in our global community as well as 
momentum in our mobile ads business. Let's begin with our community 
me
trics.
 
In June, 1.32 billion people visited Facebook on an average day, up 17% 
compared to last year. This number represents 66% of the 2.01 billion 
people that visited Facebook during the month of June, which was up 294 
million or 17% compared to last yea
r.
 
Our community growth was again driven by product improvements on 
Android, our Internet.org effort, and ongoing third
-
party promotional data 
plans in markets like India. We will begin lapping the impact of these 
promotions in Q3 of this year.
 
We're also 
pleased to see strong adoption and community growth across 
video, Instagram Stories, Messenger, and WhatsApp. While these products 
do not monetize at the same level as News Feed, they are providing new 
ways to build global communities.
 
Turning now to the f
inancials, all of our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $9.3 billion, up 45%. 
Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with last year, total revenue 
would have been approximately $140 million greater
, or up 47%. Q2 total 
ad revenue was $9.2 billion, up 47% or 49% on a constant currency basis. 
Ad revenue growth was strong globally. Rest of World and Asia
-
Pacific grew 
at 56% and 54% respectively, while the U.S. and Canada and Europe grew 
at 45% and 43% 
respectively.
 
Mobile ad revenue was $8 billion, up 53%, and represented approximately 
87% of ad revenue. Desktop ad revenue grew 17% despite an ongoing 
decline in desktop usage. Note that our Q2 desktop ad revenue benefited 
from our efforts to limit the im
pact of ad blocking technologies.
 
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 24%, and the number of ad 
impressions increased 19%, primarily driven by mobile feed ads on 
Facebook and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenue was $157 
million, down 20%. Tota
l expenses were $4.9 billion, up 33%.
 
We ended Q2 with over 20,000 employees, up 43% compared to last year. 
Our hiring growth rate increased for the third consecutive quarter, as we 
continued to invest in the many opportunities ahead.
 
Q2 operating income w
as $4.4 billion, representing a 47% operating margin. 
Our tax rate was 13%. In the quarter, excess tax benefits recognized from 
share
-
based compensation decreased our effective tax rate by 6 percentage 
points.
 
Net income was $3.9 billion or $1.32 per share
. Q2 capital expenditures 
were $1.4 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, office 
facilities, and network infrastructure. We generated over $3.9 billion in free 
cash flow and ended the quarter with over $35 billion in cash and 
investments
.
 
Turning now to the outlook, growth engagement and advertising demand 
remain healthy, but there are certain factors that will impact revenue growth 
that are worth mentioning. As we have discussed before, we continue to 
expect that Facebook ad load will pl
ay a less significant factor driving 
advertising revenue growth going forward, and that desktop ad revenue 
growth rates will slow in the second half of 2017 when we begin to lap 
efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers.
 
In addition, we expect that our st
rategic focus on driving engagement with 
mobile video may slow advertising impression growth, given the relatively 
fewer ad impressions in video relative to News Feed. I would also note that 
we do not see our early efforts in Messenger monetization offsett
ing the 
factors that I just mentioned.
 
For these reasons, we continue to expect that our ad revenue growth rates 
will come down as the year progresses. We continue to expect full
-
year 2017 
payments and other fees revenue to decline compared to 
full
-
year 2016.
 
Turning now to the expense outlook, based on our updated view of the 
remainder of the year, we are tightening our initial expense guidance range. 
We expect that full year 2017 total GAAP expense growth will be 
approximately 40% to 45%, narr
owed from our previous range of 40% to 
50%. I would note that we expect to accelerate our head count growth rate 
in the second half of the year, as we remain solidly in investment mode. We 
also expect that our video content investments will contribute to o
perating 
expense growth in the second half of 2017.
 
In terms of capital expenditures, we expect that full year 2017 CapEx will be 
in the lower end of the prior range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. We are 
ramping our infrastructure investments to support gl
obal growth and 
anticipate more data center building activity in the second half of this year. 
For example, we recently broke ground on new buildings at our New Mexico 
and Iowa data centers.
 
Turning now to tax, as I have previously noted, our tax rate will
 
vary based 
on our stock price. At the current stock price, we would expect that our Q3 
and full
-
year 2017 tax rates will both be similar to our Q2 rate.
 
In summary, the first half of 2017 was a strong period for Facebook, both 
financially and in terms of 
growth and engagement of our community. We 
will continue to invest aggressively in the many opportunities we see ahead, 
as we make progress on our mission to give people the power to build 
community and bring the world closer together.
 
With that, Mike, let
's open up the call for questions.

Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. Mark, the offerin
gs on 
the core Facebook app have improved and changed a lot over the years from 
Groups, Live Video Search, et cetera. I'm curious to hear how you've noticed 
consumer behavior on the core product, the core Facebook app change as 
Instagram has grown. And how
 
do you think about that evolving over the 
next three to five years? Thanks.

So the main value proposition for the Facebook app is helping people share 
any type of content that they want with any audience that matter
s to them. 
So you can go from text to photo to video, from small groups to larger 
groups, from your friends to everyone in the world. And that's always been 
where the Facebook app has excelled. There have been different experiences 
that are more focused on
 
specific things. But with a strong technological 
foundation supporting all of these different use cases, the Facebook app has 
always supported people using all of them.
 
Now the biggest trend that we see in consumer behavior is definitely video. 
And there'
s a strong technological underpinning for that, which is that if you 
go back five years and you tried to watch a video on your phone, it would 
probably have to buffer for a minute or so before you'd actually get to watch 
it, which wasn't a good experience.
 
And if you wanted to upload a video, 
whether it was a longer video like what you'd post to News Feed or a 10
-
second story like what you'd post in any of the apps, even that might take 
30 seconds to upload, so it wasn't a good experience.
 
So now as the tec
hnology on the network level improves to support that, 
what we're seeing is the ability to serve what is a large amount of demand 
for what's a very engaging type of content. And that demand flows across 
social content like we're seeing in Stories and Feed 
to clearly a huge amount 
of public content. Pages are engaging in this, and some of the trends that 
Dave just talked about for just a lot of video behavior across the platform.

Good afternoon. Mark, in the prepared remarks you talked about Messenger 
and WhatsApp being on the early innings of monetization, and then you also 
talked about your desire to move faster on Messenge
r. Just curious what are 
the factors driving your willingness to move faster. And then how should we 
think about that both from a consumer and monetization experience? Thank 
you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

On Messenger, there are two basic thi
ngs that we're doing. One is we're 
starting to put some ads into the product just to see the basic parameters 
around how that performs, how people like the ads or don't, how they work 
for businesses, and just try to get an understanding of that. So we're 
s
tarting to run that across the world. But as Dave said, even though we're 
starting to roll that out in a lot of places, the volume starts off pretty small. 
The biggest strategic thing that we really need to do in messaging right now 
is make it so that peop
le organically interact with businesses and that that is 
a good interaction both for people and for the businesses.
 
So here's one way to think about this. If you're a business and you have a 
higher ROI for interacting with a person in your messaging thread
 
than you 
do on the mobile web or trying to get them to install an app, then that 
creates this positive feedback loop, where you're going to point your ads 
towards the Messenger thread. You're going to invest more of your 
engineering resources in building 
out the content and experience on the 
Messenger thread.
 
So we're currently working on making it so that that is the highest ROI 
thing. I think we're making progress there. It's not that we're going to crack 
every market at once, but in sum I think we're de
finitely getting there. 
We're getting some positive feedback from the market. But once we start to 
achieve that in more and more verticals, I think that's going to start 
unlocking a lot of behavior, and a lot of businesses are going to want to push 
more in
teractions to happen there, which I think will really be the foundation 
for building that into a big business.

Great, thank you. I was wondering. Sheryl talked a little bit about Instagram 
Stories. I was wondering if you could share with us the initial feedback from 
advertisers. Do they see it as 
similar to advertising in the IG feed, or are 
they using it to reach people in a different way, if you've noticed anything 
over the period that you've been doing it? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

So it's pretty early for ads in Stories. 
And I think the way people largely 
think about this is this is another way of using the Facebook ad system, 
including our targeting and measurement capabilities, to create ads that are 
great creative that can reach people. So the fully immersive format wit
h the 
targeting and optimization of Facebook ads is a pretty unmatched 
opportunity. We also have a huge opportunity within Instagram. And 
obviously, the use of ads in Instagram is much, much bigger than the use of 
ads in Stories.
 
The way we think about thi
s is we're trying to help marketers reach their 
customers, both their existing and their new customers, effectively. And we 
think it's a combination of all these offerings that really are the strength of 
our business and explains why we can continue to gro
w. So within one 
interface, we're working with one sales rep. If you're a large company or a 
small company, you can buy Facebook. You can buy Instagram. You can buy 
Audience Network. You can buy the different ad formats within Facebook and 
Instagram. And t
hat means that you have multiple targeting opportunities, 
multiple opportunities, and even opportunities to see who engages in an ad 
in one place and then reinvest to continue the conversation with those 
customers. So we think all of these things work toge
ther. And these new 
formats fit in really nicely with the ad system we built, which underlies all of 
the opportunity.

Thanks, g
ood afternoon, one for Sheryl, if I could. Sheryl, you guys have

like Dynamic Travel Ads. Could we anticipate more efforts going forward to

So we're really happy that our growth has been really strong across 
our 
verticals, and that continues to be the case. Our top verticals are pretty 
consistent in e
-
commerce, CPG, entertainment, media, retail, and gaming. 
For the most part, when we build products, we build them to work for all 
verticals, and you see us do th
at. So being able to upload your catalog of 
products can be used no matter what your product lists are. We do build 
vertical
-
specific ad products when they are necessary, so Dynamic Ads for 
travel, for example, as you mentioned, being an example.
 
I think t
he heaviest lifting of the work we do is really helping marketers in 
different verticals focus on the right metrics, which are the sales metrics, 
because for too long our industry has been focused on proxy metrics, how 
long someone viewed a video, even bra
nd lift, measurements we care about, 
but these are all proxy metrics. What really matters is you see an ad and 
you buy a product. You see an ad and you drive a car off a lot. You see an 
ad and you order a service.
 
And so there are very different processes 
with these different verticals in 
terms of helping them understand their own purchasing data so that we can 
connect our ads to their ultimate purchases. We believe that's one of the 
most important things that we've been very, very focused on, and we have a
 
long way to go. And part of the results you see from us in different verticals 
are actually explained by the ability of us to help those marketers measure 
sales at the end of the day. The more that we can tie ad viewing to sales, 
the stronger our case is 
with our clients, and so we need to do a lot of work 
around the measurement with different verticals.

So a lot of the themes around building community and bringing people closer 
together have
 
been underscored by a lot of the experiences that I've had 
traveling around. And I've tried to write about them. I don't write about each 
visit that I make on Facebook. But it's been really striking to me when you 
talk to folks in a lot of different commu
nities how important local institutions 
and their local communities are for supporting people there.
 
And there's been a clearly documented trend across the world of declining 
membership in a lot of different kinds of communities. And I think that that's 
an
 
important problem that is eating at the social fabric not only of our 
country but around the world that I hope that we can play a role in 
addressing. And that's not something that we can do directly, but I believe 
that we can empower people who want to bu
ild local communities and want 
to play a leadership role in their local community to have the tools that they 
need. And I think if we can do that, then you start bringing people together 
at a local level. And when people feel more comfortable in their live
s at a 
local level, then I also think that that helps bring people and bring the world 
closer together at a global level too.
 
So that all has been underscored by a lot of the visits and what I've seen as 
well as a lot of the research that we've done at Fac
ebook, and it's all 
reflected in the new mission.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Doug, it's Dave. I don't think there's anything that's really fundamentally 
changed. We are tightening the range to 40% to 45% expense growth due 
to better visibility. We re
main solidly in investment mode. And if anything, 
we're finding new opportunities to invest in.
 
From the perspective of hiring growth, I'd really point to the fact that we've 
been consistently accelerating hiring so far in 2017, and I pointed to the fact 
t
hat we expect to accelerate hiring in the back half of the year as well. And 
this quarter was the biggest recruiting quarter in terms of net hires ever for 
Facebook.
 
We're continuing to invest in a number of key areas, hiring engineers to 
drive the three, 
five, and 10
-
year priorities. We're going to be investing in 
content to help build a platform for content producers to find an audience 
and monetize. We are also continuing to invest in areas like community 
operations and other areas. So, we remain solidly
 
in investment mode from 
a total expense point of view.
 
On CapEx, we still expect to be within the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, 
and we're investing aggressively in our data center footprint to support the 
global growth that we see. So, I think acro
ss the board, we're investing 
heavily.
 
On head count, I would just point out that our payroll growth tends to lag 
head count growth, because head count is an end
-
of
-
period number, so the 
acceleration that we're seeing in 2017 will obviously play out in 201
8 as 
well.

Great, guys, a couple questions on the messaging apps. I think two years 
ago at F8, you talked about WhatsApp user base 
about really north of 1 
billion sending out 50 billion messages a day, and Messenger was about 1 
billion and 20 billion messages a day, so implying kind of like 2.5 times the 
engagement on WhatsApp compared to Messenger. Is that accurate? And 
where does th
at stand today? And then both of these messaging apps 
started in different geographies around the world. So, how does that impact 
your thinking around monetization ideas between Messenger and WhatsApp? 
Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah. I don't
 
think we're sharing detailed stats on engagement by 
messaging platform. They're obviously both critical platforms. Both have 
over 1.2 million monthly actives. And WhatsApp has demonstrated 
significant engagement with crossing 1 billion daily actives. So, 
I think that 
indicates the engagement that you have on that platform. There are 
different geographies where the messaging platforms are stronger. And 
depending on that, that shifts our priorities in different ways.
 
But overall, from a monetization perspect
ive, I think the strategy there is 
clear. We're focused on growing the user base, first and foremost. And then 
secondly, it's about building organic connections between businesses and 
consumers. And then third, it's about how do we build monetization aroun
d 
those relationships. And I think there, we're further along with Messenger 
than we are with WhatsApp. And so, I think you see us rolling out the global 
beta there with ads. So, I think we'll watch and learn from that. And as we 
learn things, we can apply
 
them in other areas.

Great. Thank you. Maybe a question for Mark. I know video is a priority for 
the company. To
 
start with, any change in user trends or engagement as 
you've added video to Facebook? And then secondly, just how do you think 
about semi
-
professional or professional video for Facebook? Is that a good 
business, given all the content
-
sharing costs and th
e production costs when 
you compare it to your existing social business? And do you see it as 
cannibalistic or additive as far as usage? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I can share a little bit about it, then Mark would want to jump in on any 
o
ther color. I mean, I would say, as I mentioned, Justin, in my commentary, 
as people spend more time with video, and more time is going to video, that 
is going to have a limiting factor to how much time they spend in News 
Feed. And so, that's going to have
 
an impact on impression rate growth. So 
there is, in that sense, a cannibalistic effect of sorts that happens there.
 
But what Mark alluded to was video is where people 

 
as networks improve 
and devices improve and our products improve, video is the most e
ngaging 
experience that we can offer. And so, we're seeing consumers adopting that 
and we're building products for them. In terms of the types of content, I 
think we're looking at a wide variety of content from 

 
of course, at the core 
is people sharing ex
periences in their lives. And that's at the base of what 
we offer in terms of bringing the world closer together. It's that community 
content. But then there's opportunities for semi
-
professional and 
professional content. And we're exploring things around 
the platform of 
making sure that we're a platform where professional content providers can 
come, find an audience, and then also monetize that audience.

Yeah. And in terms of ad load growth
, I pointed to the fact that we continue 
to expect that ad load will be a less significant factor in the remainder of

of other factors that I also pointed to, including the deskto
p lapping some of 
the efforts we made on desktop in terms of unblocking or working against 
the ad blocking technologies. And so, that has a factor on desktop growth. 
And then of course, I talked about video and our focus on driving and 
serving the consumer
 
demand for video, and that's also leading to 
potentially lower impression growth as well.

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On one of your blogs,
 
you put a post up 
basically detailing basically what people were doing during TV, and you 
showed a control group where Facebook usage was really constant. And then 
you did a group that was watching the TV show, and you saw huge spikes of 
Facebook usage du
ring the television 

 
during the ad breaks during the 
show.
 
Wondering like, as you go talk to marketers, obviously, TV ratings are down 
a lot. How does that type of study 

 
I realize it's just one TV show. But as 
you make the pitch of why are you not 
shifting dollars faster to Facebook, 
how does that type of research start to play into their thinking? And what's 
holding them back? Is it just the creative doing, or the embracing of 6
-
second ads? What's the block to getting more of that $70 billion of TV
 
ad 
dollars to shift over faster? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
That was just one study, and I don't want to overstate its importance in how 
we sell ads. We make the case to our clients that consumers are moving to 
mobile and that they need
 
to move to mobile. And not that mobile should 
replace all of their other advertising, but responsible marketers with great 
companies, large and small, still advertise on TV, and they advertise on 
mobile, and they advertise in other places. Our goal is to 
be the best dollar 
and the best minute anyone spends, and the case we make is that we want 
them to take advantage of the opportunity that is mobile and the 
opportunity for the targeting we offer and the measurement we offer.
 
I think what has taken us time 
and continues to take us time is we need to 
convince marketers to make mobile
-
first video and other ad formats. We 
talk a lot about how the first TV ads were people reading their radio ads in 
front of microphones. And we're still in the case that when peop
le go to put 
an ad on mobile, they often will take an ad that's really produced for TV and 
put it on mobile. And those work and they can work well, but they do not 
work as well as ads that are natively mobile, like the Tropicana example I 
shared in my earl
ier comments. Mobile ads when they're video are shorter. 
The brand comes in faster. They tell a story that doesn't evolve but really 
gets you to understand the brand and the offering really quickly. We talk 
about it as thumb
-
stopping creatives.
 
And so the 
work that we have cut out for us is to help marketers and 
working with their agencies evolve the format of the ads so that they're 
optimized for mobile, optimized for Facebook, optimized for Instagram. I 
think we're making progress, but we have a long way 
to go there.

Great, thanks. Mark, you talked about maybe trying to accelerate a little bit 
the messaging 
monetization end. I'm wondering if there's anything more 
behind that statement. Is it that you were frustrated with the level that you 
had seen to date, or that you saw some opportunity that you thought you 
could accelerate the push towards I guess monetiz
ing?
 
And maybe big picture, I want to ask. I know the monetization is very early 
stages. It's barely even begun. There's very few platforms around the world 
that have got 1 billion users that are unmonetized, so you would think that 
there's a lot of opport
unity there, but maybe not. And maybe people are 
making a mistake in trying to look at Asian assets and seeing what they've 
done there and thinking that you can do with your asset. So what's the 
upside? When you think about the real opportunity, what gets 
you excited 
about the ability to monetize those assets five years from now?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we 
want to invest in over the next year and doing our long
-
range pla
nning, and 
this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot 
more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the 
effort.
 
I do think, as you say, this is one of the rare times in business where you 
can 
look at messaging platforms that exist and see how they've successfully 
monetized in other parts of the world and have that be a floor. I think that 
over time, we should be able to do better, but that at least provides this 
existence proof that despite 

 
r
egardless of what our internal logic is of what 
we're doing, that someone has done it. So that gives us some degree of 
confidence there in addition to our own execution on other things.
 
But I feel there's a pretty clear playbook that we have here of first 
building 
up the consumer usage, then building up the organic person
-
to
-
business 
interaction, making sure it works for both people and businesses. And then 
once you have that, the quality of those interactions is really what 
contributes to the scale of how 
much you can grow.
 
We've seen this in News Feed too. One of the factors that's contributed to ad 
load over time is the quality of the ads. If ad quality was low, we wouldn't be 
able to put as many ads in because people wouldn't want them. But in a lot 
of m
arkets around the world, we see that ad quality is increasing at a very 
fast rate, and that makes it so that a lot of times people do ask for the 
content, which of course creates a very different dynamic.
 
So we need to get to that in messaging. And because
 
messaging really 
started from the place of people communicating one to one with each other 
and is now adding all these other uses, it's just a lot of investment and a lot 
of different functionality that needs to get added. But for all the reasons that 
I'v
e said here around our own experience doing this in other contexts with 
Facebook and Instagram, proof points in the market of how it's worked, I 
think over the long term I'm pretty confident that we will get there, and it's 
our job to just go do that.

Great, thank you, two questions on the Messenger ads. I recognize that it's

and Instagram.

implies 53% year

over
-
year OpEx growth in the back half of 
the year versus 
plus 36% in the first half. Just wondering if you can discuss other key drivers

Should we consider investment in video content the number two driver of 
OpEx growth in th
e back half of the year? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
On the Messenger ads, I think the way we think about it is, as Mark said, we 
have a lot of work to do to work on the format of that. This is not a feed
-
based product, and this is a m
essaging product. So it's a different consumer 
format, and we believe that the ad format should follow the consumer 
format, so it's really integrated as part of the experience. And that's where 
we have a lot of work to do.
 
We do think that the advertiser b
ase and the targeting and the 
measurement we offer once we figure out the format will be a very 
considerable advantage. We already have 5 million advertisers on Facebook, 
1 million advertisers on Instagram. And one of the reasons we were able to 
scale into
 
Instagram ads more quickly is because we were building off of the 
Facebook advertiser base. And similarly, the work we've done in Facebook 
and Instagram and Audience Network will help us expand to Messenger.
 
But we really want to emphasize, especially sin
ce there are so many 
questions on Messenger monetization on this call, that we're going to be 
slow and deliberate. We are always looking at the long run. We do not 
manage this company quarter to quarter. We protect the consumer product 
and the consumer eng
agement. Messaging is really strategically important 
for the company and the long
-
term engagement with our users, and the 
organic feel of the engagement with businesses and consumers is where we 
will be focused. So it's early days this year, and it's going
 
to continue to be 
early days for a while.
 
David M. Wehner

So on the OpEx guide, clearly the biggest driver there is going to be the 
accelerating head count growth. In addition, I mentioned video content as 
being a driver. And then 
also, we're just supporting the global growth of the 
platform. We continue to see growth in users. We continue to see growth in 
time spent per DAU across the Facebook family of apps and Facebook, and 
we're bringing more data centers online and the like tow
ards that growth. So 
those will start hitting cost of revenue with depreciation.
 
So there's going to be a variety of contributions to that growth. But like you 
mentioned, I would point to both head count, specifically in R&D. R&D head 
count grew 48% year o
ver year in Q2, and that's what's going to be a key 
driver along with the content layering in.

Thanks for taking my questions. Sheryl, in yo

hoping you could provide an update on the mid
-
roll Ad Breaks that you've 
now been testing for a few months and maybe what kind of progress that 
you're seeing
 
in terms of completion rates. Are you at a point where Ad 
Breaks can start to roll out more broadly?
 
And then, Dave, you mentioned that a greater focus on video could impact 
growth in ad impressions. But would you also assume that a greater focus 
on video
 
ads could also drive improved ad pricing and yield on your available 
inventory? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

On Ad Breaks, we're currently really just testing the ability to put a short Ad 
Break in uploaded videos. We do it if a video is 
longer than 90 seconds or 
live videos are longer than 4 minutes. We're just in the process right now of 
expanding to more publishers in the United States, so it's really early.
 
In terms of the metrics we're looking for, it's a great question. And 
obviously
, we care that people view the ads, but the most important thing is 
tying those ads impressions, even if they're short views, all the way through 
to that same purchase data that we keep talking about. And so as we work 
on rolling out more Ad Breaks, and we
 
are rolling out slowly, we're really 
focused on finding ways to help marketers measure the right things, and 
that's a very important focus for the company going forward.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Now, Mark, you were asking about video and its impac
t on pricing growth. I 
would probably step back and look at it from an overall system perspective. 
And so starting with the supply side, there's a variety of factors that will 
impact impression growth, and I mentioned slower ad growth and then 
increasing v
ideo watch time as being two of them. And given there's an 
auction that drives the pricing in how we run the business, there's always an 
interplay between supply growth and pricing growth. And so what we're 
really focused on is driving better ROI for our a
dvertisers.
 
And Sheryl alluded to it in her earlier commentary about if we get better at 
converting our impressions into things that are valuable for advertisers and 
we get more efficient in doing that, we'll be rewarded with better pricing and 
higher dema
nd at better pricing as a result of that hard work. That doesn't 
necessarily specifically pertain just to video. It really is across the board. So 
if we're effective at continuing to do that, then that should benefit pricing 
growth. And if we can grow dema
nd faster than we grow supply, then we're 
going to see that play through in price. And that's really the goal of a lot of 
the hard work that the ads team does to make our products better and more 
effective for advertisers.

Thank you. I have one for Dave and one for Sheryl. Dave, going back to 
your prepared comments, I think you mentioned there was 24% growth in

underlying that growth which products you're seeing the greatest inflation 
maybe quarter over quarter or year over year?
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I would really just point to the over
all dynamics of the system. And again, 
what we're seeing is with slower supply growth, that's going to play out to 
higher pricing. And again, are we effective? And we've been effective at 
delivering good return on investment for our advertisers and getting
 
better 
at converting what we have as inventory into what they care about as 
outcomes. And that from a systemic point of view is what's playing through 
there.
 
From a product perspective, as we get things like Dynamic Product Ads 
rolled out, those are incre
dibly valuable. As we connect more advertisers 
with those and bring more data into the system and we can get more of the 
impressions that are very highly targeted and very relevant, then we'll be 
rewarded with better pricing as we can expand that out into 
things like 
Lookalikes. We've talked a lot about it on this call. That basically takes some 
of that really good targeting and extends that into a much bigger audience, 
and then we can get more impressions at better value because we're really 
connecting tha
t with end results that the advertisers value. So it's really all 
that type of work that we do to get the system better and better, and so 
we're constantly working to get better penetration of these key ad products.
 
In terms of the supply side, obviously N
ews Feed is incredibly valuable 
because it's very present for the consumer. And we've improved the quality 
of the ads in News Feed, and that's another driver from the supply side.

Messenger monetization, so I'm almost reluctant to ask another, but just 
two things. Compared to what you saw in the early phases of testing New
s 
Feed ads, what can you say so far about users' responsiveness to ads in 
Messenger?
 
And then second, obviously, there's a lot of momentum in the development 
of bots on the platform. And do you see this enabling of great organic 
interactions, as Mark put i
t, as a way to ultimately make Messenger a great 
ad platform, or do you think that enabling these other business services can 
lead to other monetization opportunities down the road, independent of 
advertising?

It's rea
lly too early to understand the impact of the ads on consumers 
because there aren't enough of them and they haven't been rolled out for 
long enough. In terms of the bots, what we really think about is our 
businesses and people making useful connections on 
both sides on 
Messenger or any platform. If the connection is useful for marketers, 
businesses, and useful for people, then it will grow. And we're open to 
automated bots being useful. We're open to other forms of things being 
useful.
 
I think when you 
think about what bucket of spend that is in, which is a 
question we get, it really is both marketing spend and any other spend 
companies have where they're reaching their customers, of which if you 
think about marketing spend and customer service spend, ma
rketing spend 
is way bigger, because marketing spend grows as you can grow sales. And 
customer service spend is something that people generally try to minimize. 
So, the way we think about it is we want to grow the organic connections, 
whether they're autom
ated or whether they're personalized, and make sure 
that that is growing the business of our customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal

Thanks for taking th
e question. I was wondering if you could comment on 
how you think the European Commission's GDPR [General Data Protection 
Regulation] and related privacy initiatives will impact the business, either 
generally positively, negatively, and whether or not thos
e policies around 
privacy might yet become global standards. I'm curious how you think that 
impacts both the consumer product as well as the advertising business.
 
And maybe separately, I'm just curious if among those advertisers who have 
expressed particul
ar concern around third
-
party tool access, we certainly 
heard from some who have said very publicly that they're going to reduce 
their spending. Obviously, others clearly are increasing their spending. But 
curious how far you've gone towards allaying those
 
concerns and possibly 
regaining any lost spend.

When we think about any regulatory issue, GDPR or anything else, we 
respect local laws and regulations. And we have to work really closely with 
regulators to make sure t
hey understand our business practices, understand 
how we contribute to economic growth in their countries, and understand 
the steps we take and continue to take to protect privacy. Certainly, 
regulation is always an area of focus that we work hard to make 
sure that 
we are explaining our business clearly and making sure regulators know the 
steps we take to protect privacy as well as making sure that we're in 
compliance.
 
When you think about the metrics question you asked, how we think about 
what is 

 
so what
 
I think you're asking about is third
-
party verification. 
We're very interested in making sure that marketers can verify or measure 
outcomes through third
-
parties, and that's why we're working to actively 
expand those partnerships.

Thanks for taking the question. Another one on Messenger. So, you guys 
have talked of building 

 
the importance of building organic consumer
-
to
-
busine
ss interaction here. So wondering if you can share what sort of 
adoption you are seeing in those kind of interactions. And are there certain 
verticals or geos where it's really taking off?
 
And then a second, if I can. We've talked a lot, obviously, already
 
about ad 
impression growth and how it's set to slow in the second half. You're already 
seeing a big slowdown in impression growth in the first half. And yet, as 
you've noted, with supply growth slowing, pricing has gone up, as you've 
added a lot of ROA as
 
to your customers. So wondering why should this 
phenomenon not continue to carry ad revenue growth in the second half?

I'll take this. So, there have been a number of questions about Messenger. 
And in general, we're
 
seeing 

 
I'm happy with the rate of growth in the 
experiences that we're seeing on Messenger. But if there's one message 
here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to 
communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business,
 
it's a longer
-
term thing. I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the 
much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to 
be video, not Messenger.
 
Messenger, I think, is a really important thing and WhatsApp ov
er a three
-
 
to five
-
year period, and we're investing a lot in it. I think it's a huge 
opportunity. But as has been noted on the call, video is both at large scale 
and the economics are quite different from the current feed
-
based 
businesses that we have tod
ay, especially around how, with mid
-
roll ads and 
rev share around that, the margin structure will be different.
 
So, I mean, one of the big questions that we're focused on as we build this 
out, we're very committed to building it out because it's what peopl
e in the 
community want. But one of the big things that we're really very focused on 
is making sure that we get this right so that even though this business will 
likely be 

 
not likely, I think almost certainly will be a lower margin source of 
revenue than
 
the current thing that we do, there's this big question of how 
incremental is that behavior going to be.
 
And I'm just throwing this context out there because so many of the 
questions here today have been about Messenger, and I want to make sure 
on these c
alls that we do an accurate and a full job of conveying what we're 
actually thinking about as a business and what we think the outlook is going 
to be. And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic 
about, but there are real questions t
here that we need to manage well, is 
going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three 
years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and 
WhatsApp.

And, Lloyd, you asked abo
ut why the good work that we've done so far in 
basically providing value for advertisers is playing through into price. Look, 
that's not just happening. That's a bunch of hard work that goes into making 
our ads more targeted that makes the outcomes that ad
vertisers get more 
valuable. We're going to continue to work to do that, and we're going to 
continue to invest in making improvements in the ad products, and we think 
there are great opportunities to continue to make improvements to ROI.
 
But obviously, if 
you have rising prices, it's going to make that work against 
an upstream trend, so we need to continue to work hard to deliver more 
value for advertisers in the face of that. So we've got our work cut out for 
us, and we think we've got a great team working
 
on those challenges.

Thanks for taking the question. Mark, you stated that AR mixed reality could 
be the next computing platform. Obviously, this is way out in the future. But 
if that implies something so large, how do you think about allocating 
resources f
or that? How much are you willing to spend on it, and any new 
thoughts on how this all evolves? And then related to that, the next iPhone 
is coming out soon. Do you think that there will be capabilities there that will 
impact the AR evolution meaningfully?
 
Thanks.

This is certainly something that I'm really excited about long term. Not only 
does it have the possibility of being the next major computing platform, AR 
and VR together, but I think it has the 
possibility of being much more social 
and intuitive and natural than some of the devices that we have today, 
whether they're computers or phones. So that's why I'm really excited about 
that.
 
When you think about AR glasses, the technology and science to bu
ild an 
experience that would be both comfortable to wear and something that 
people would actually want to wear out in public, that doesn't exist yet. So 
there's a lot of foundational work that needs to get done there. That's 
partially why I'm excited about
 
doing the VR work because it doesn't have 
that constraint. You're not wearing VR out in public. But also recently, one of 
the things that we've seen is that there are a lot of AR experiences on 
mobile. So the work that we started talking about at F8 that 
we are 
releasing slowly over the course of the year is certainly one of the precursors 
for building out that ecosystem that I'm excited about.
 
But look, if I was just saying that video is going to be the primary driver or 
one of the big drivers over the ne
xt few years and Messenger maybe after 
that, I think AR is quite far down the road. But when you're running an 
operation and serving people at this scale, I think you have a responsibility 
to invest in all these things that are downstream that could help s
hape and 
improve people's lives, because I don't think that there are that many other 
folks in the world who will.
 
So I think that that's a thing that we take seriously, whether it's connectivity 
and making sure that people actually all around the world ge
t to enjoy and 
benefit from the opportunities that the Internet has or the improvements 
that come from AI, or eventually upgrading the computing platforms that we 
all get to use. This stuff doesn't just happen automatically. And someone in 
the world needs 
to focus on building it, and we want to play a role in that.

Mark Zuckerberg
 
Thanks Deborah and thanks everyone for joining us today. We got off to a 
good start this year with stron
g engagements and growth across the 
community, several major new product announcements and some good 
financial results. Sometimes it surprises me that our community can still 
grow so quickly beyond a billion active members. More than 100 million new 
monthl
y active members have joined in the last half of the year, and now 
there are more than 650 million people who use Facebook every day. It's 
more than 60% of our community every day. We continue to see high levels 
of engagement globally across our whole comm
unity. We take our 
stewardship of this very seriously. We want to make sure we give every 
person in the world the power to share and we are proud of these results.
 
Overall, there are three main parts of our strategy. Build the best mobile 
product, build a 
platform with new services that leverage the social graph, 
and build a strong monetization engine. I am going to use my time here with 
you today to give my assessment of how I think we are doing in each of 
these areas. Let's start with mobile. One of the p
roducts I am most excited 
about is Facebook Home. It's a family of apps that you can install in your 
Android phone to make the whole experience of your phone much more 
personal and about people and not apps.
 
We know that people spend an average of 20% or m
ore of their time in apps 
on Facebook. Staying up to date with the people they care about, are doing. 
We use to open the Facebook app maybe 10 to 15 times per day. But we 
probably check our phones over a hundred times a day. So with Home, you 
can see fresh
 
news and content from people and topics you care about every 
time you turn on your screen. It really brings your phone to life and provides 
with a completely new experience.
 
This product is still very early and this is just a first release in a long 
journ
ey. We are planning on iterating quickly and tuning things based on 

within app yet, and it's only available on a few phones. But over the next 
few months we hope to push this out muc
h more broadly and get this in the 
hands of a lot more people. We are excited about Home because we think 
it's a great product.
 
But Home is also an important milestone for our company. This is completely 
new kind of mobile experience based on people, not a
pps. And we think this 
is how phones and computers should work. I am looking forward to sharing 
more with you on the experiences that are brought on mobile that we are 
building over the rest of this year. Now beyond Home, I am really proud of 
how Instagram
 
is doing. Kevin and his team have made amazing progress 
since last April.
 
When we agreed to acquire them, the Instagram community had 22 million 
people actively using their service every month. And today over 100 million 
people are using Instagram each mo
nth. The Instagram community is 
growing even faster than the Facebook community did when it was this size. 
And the two communities complement each other to create some great 
experiences where you can capture any moment in your life and easily share 
across 
all the communities you care about.
 
Now I would like to talk about platform and building new services using a 
social graph. A couple of months ago we announced a new, richer and 

c
ontent that you might want to (inaudible). From new stories from the New 
York Times to pins from Pinterest, or activities from a game that you played. 
This new design opens up a nicer canvas for content for every developer and 
publisher out there. And we t
hink it's going to create a lot more 
opportunities for engagement.
 
Early feedback has been positive on the versions we have rolled out on 
iPhone, iPad and desktop web, and we are looking forward to rolling this out 
more widely since. For our development pl
atform, we have had a long 
roadmap to build the tools for iOS and Android to make building social app 
and advertising with Facebook as easy on mobile as it is on desktop web. We 
conceded this transition by bringing open bringing Open Graph to mobile this 
m
onth. And our efforts are paying off with now 81 of the top 100 growth in 
iOS apps and 70 of the top 100 Android apps integrating with Facebook and 
continuing to grow.
 

opportunity mobi
le apps can be for Facebook. Because of the rules Apple 

earlier on what kind of a role Facebook can play. But I think it's clear now 
that we can create a lot of value for developers 
by providing a platform for 
identity and distribution. We are starting to see real revenue through selling 
mobile apps themselves. We just announced the acquisition of Parse, a 
platform of service provider for mobile apps as part of our strategy to 
provide
 
greater support for developers. Both of these products make it 
easier for developers to create and grow their apps and this could be the 
start of something much bigger.
 
Now I want to talk a bit about monetization. I just mentioned mobile apps 
install ads,
 
which are growing quite well and it becomes one of our most 
important new ad product. This supports our hypothesis that Facebook 
should help you discover new apps and content that you may want to use. 
And even it is not every recommendation we make is one
 
that you take. I 
think this is still starting to provide some really good content for our 
community and I guess into the business opportunity here.
 
This type of ads makes sense to me on mobile. On desktop web, most ads 
encourage you to visit a new website
. On mobile, it makes sense that most 
ads encourage you to visit apps instead. And in order to visit apps you first 
need to install. So these ads are the obvious first step. On mobile, the set of 
companies that produce apps is much broader than what you mi
ght think of 
as traditional developer. Every major brand, company or service wants to 
build apps as a storefront or interface for their customers and each of these 
companies wants to reach their customers to encourage them to install their 
apps. This marke
t is already big and I expect it to continue to grow quickly.

stewards of this community. We aspire to have ads

to show ads that 
improve the content experience over time. If we continue making progress 
on this then
 
one day we can get there.
 


engagement across our whole community, several major product 
announcements and good financial re
sults. We think the products like Home 
and Graph Search are big opportunities to deliver some unique and 

anyone else. But these services are also big, long term investments. So I 
want 

think these are important areas for us to focus on.
 
Now finally, I want to take a moment to thank everyone who works at 
Facebook and everyone who makes this community great. All of you a
re 
contributing in building these new experiences and helping more than a 
billion people stay connected. So thank you all and thanks to everyone on 
this call for being with us today. I look forward to having more to share and 
report on next quarter.
 
And no

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Our first quarter total revenue 
was $1.458 billion and total advertising re
venue grew to $1.245 billion. This 
means that ad revenue was up 43% year over year, faster growth than 

products innovations are helping marketers to reach customers effectively. 
Our g
rowth is particularly strong from new small and medium sized 
marketers, direct response marketers and app developers.
 

in our three strategic ads priorities, mobile, measurements and
 
product 
innovation. First mobile. As Mark just said, having billions of people carry 
social devices in their pockets, checking them multiple times a day, often 
checking Facebook is a huge opportunity for us. A recent comScore report 
showed that in the U.S
, people spend more time on Facebook than on any 
other app on their smartphones. The opportunity for us to connect people to 
each other and to marketers has never been greater. We are uniquely 
positioned to offer marketers massive reach on a daily basis.
 
In Q1, mobile was approximately 30% of our ad revenue, up from about 

business all around the world, particularly in Asia. As an example, our 
mobile app install adds performed very well th
is quarter. We offer 
developers unique opportunities to drive downloads of their mobile apps as 
Mark talked about.
 
During the quarter, 3,800 developers used these ads to drive nearly 25 
million downloads. Of the top 100 grossing apps from both iOS and Andr
oid 
in the last week of Q1, about 40% of them used our mobile app install ads. 
In gaming, travel, e
-
commerce and financial service industry, the early 
indicators are that our cost per install are highly competitive. In one 
example, British Telecom provider
 
O2 used Facebook as its only digital 
marketing channel to promote its new music app, O2 Tracks. In just three 
days, they reached 9 million people and got to sixth place in iOS apps in 
music.
 
Second, I want to discuss our progress in measurements. One of t
he 
challenges we face is helping marketers understand the value of our ads. 

partnering closely with our clients to help them understand how their 
campaigns are performing and this mea
surement work also helps them gain 
a better understanding of their customers which then makes their future 

effectiveness studies on over 100 campaigns across CPG, auto, retail and 
tel
co. One of these studies was Bud Light. Bud Light ran Page Post ads to its 
5.8 million fans on Facebook and these ads appeared in all of our 
placements, including mobile newsfeeds. We worked with DataLogix and 
found that these ads reached 20% of U.S. house
holds and had 3.3% sales 
lift, yielding a six times return on ad spend. A result, we are very proud of 
and Bud Light is really excited about. We plan to continue to invest heavily 
in (inaudible) with our clients throughout the upcoming year. We are also 
re
ally excited about our acquisition of Atlas, which closed just last week and 
I was able to welcome the team to Facebook earlier today.
 
Atlas is a really important part of continuing to develop our measurement 
capabilities. For the past decade, digital mark
eters have primarily measured 
success by focusing only on clicks. But this over simplifies how people make 
purchase decisions, both offline and online because it ignores everything 
people do and see before they do that last press. Smart marketers are 
looki
ng for a better way to value all of the impressions that they buy and 
engage thus leading up to purchase.
 
Multiple industry
-
wide spendings have validated this multi
-
click attribution 
approach. For offline sales, both Nielsen and comScore have repeatedly 
sh
own that clicks are not a good predictor of sales lift. For online sales, 
Aggregate Knowledge found in an analysis of more than 500 online 
campaigns that when clients moved from allocating their advertising spend 
using last touch attribution to using multi
-
touch attribution, they saw a 33% 
increase in actions, conversions in sales. In a study of campaigns from Q4 
2012, they found that when measured holistically, costs per acquisition on 
Facebook is 68% less than other online channels. The DataLogix study 
va
lidates this finding as well, demonstrating that on average 99% of people 
who saw Facebook ads and then bought a product in a store never clicked on 
an ad at all.
 
We believe the Atlas platform will help us demonstrate even more clearly the 
connection betwe
en ad impressions and purchases. We could help marketers 
measure the effectiveness of their ad impressions better not just on 
Facebook, but across the entire internet. This means we can take the 
advancements we have made in measurements on Facebook, includ
ing our 
integrations with Nielsen and Datalogix, and expand them to a much larger 
audience and to many more purchases.
 
Third, I would like to highlight product innovation in ads. Over the last year 
we have invested heavily in product innovation and I am ex
cited about what 
we have accomplished at a relatively short period of time. As always, our top 
focus is on the results we generate for the marketers, and we are pleased to 
see the ROI we can provide as well as providing a good experience for our 
users. We 
continue to innovate new targeting capability that make it easier 
for businesses of all sizes to reach the right people, both on desktop and on 
mobile.
 
In Q1, we gained traction with our Custom Audiences product. This product 
allows marketers to reach thei
r target audiences based on their own 
customer databases or databases maintained by third party. For example, a 
marketer can target ads to customer who have not returned to their store in 
the past month but do have made purchases before. This product impro
ves 
their targeting and generates higher ROI for the marketers and a better ad 
experience for our users. We are really pleased with the adoption of this 
product.
 
In Q1, more than twice as many marketers used Custom Audiences than in 
Q4, including, 23 of th
e Ad Age 100 top global marketers and many other 
important clients. Companies from Hotels.com to Intuit, to Virgin America 
are seeing success with this product. In April, we launched another powerful 
targeted product, Partner Categories. This enables marke
ters to use third 
party data from Acxiom, Epsilon and other data providers to target their ads. 
For example, we can deliver ads to the 12 million people in the U.S. who are 
likely to purchase a car in the next six months, or to the 19 million people 
who ar
e active purchasers of hair care products, households that purchase 
hair care products at multiples with other households, or to the 23 million 
people in the U.S. who are heavy soda drinkers, we apologize, Mayor 
Bloomberg.
 
We have also seen more customers 
begin to use FBX. And we recently 
launched FBX in News Feed on desktop. We think this will continue to drive 
the advertiser's options, given that we generally see higher engagement for 
ads in News Feed. In the last six months of 2012, as one example, re
-
ta
rgeting platform AdRoll saw a 70% lower cost per click on Facebook and 
on traditional web targeting. FBX was so successful for them that by the 
beginning of Q1, AdRoll reallocated 63% of their total impressions to 
Facebook.
 
Overall, we feel really good abo
ut our first quarter results. We've made 
tremendous strides in mobile. We continue to improve our measurement 
capabilities, most notably with our acquisition of Atlas and we continue to 

 
early 
days of developing our adds business and huge opportunities ahead of us. 
And we thank all of you for your continued interest in our business.
 

 
David Ebersman
 

 
like to share with you the 
progress we made in Q1 against our key financial objectives to increase 
revenue, to invest aggressively to drive our future growth and to position 
the company to maximize long term returns for our investors. In March on 
average 
665 million people access Facebook each day, up 26% from last 
year and representing 60% of the 1.11 billion people who used Facebook 
during the month.
 
Consistent with last quarter, mobile continues to drive growth and visitation 
and engagement. 751 million
 
people accessed Facebook from mobile devices 
in March, up 54% from last year. These numbers do not include Instagram, 
which continues to grow rapidly as Mark mentioned.
 
Turning to revenue, in Q1 total revenue was up 38% and ad revenue was up 
43% compared 
to last year, driven by the strong performance of newsfeed 
ads. Exchange rates had no meaningful impact on our revenue growth rates. 
Ad impressions were up 39% and average price per ad was up 3% compared 
to last year. The product changes we made and discus
sed last quarter, 
primarily lowering the price floor in our option had a significant impact on 
the price and volume year over year comparisons. In the United States and 
Canada, where the price floor changes had a smaller effect, average price 
per ad increa
sed over 25% relative to Q1 of last year, driven by a higher 
engagement and performance of News feed ads.
 
Mobile ad revenue came in at approximately 30% of ad revenue this quarter 
versus zero last year and desktop ad revenue in Q1 was essentially flat with
 

not specify that their Facebook ads be shown on desktop only or on mobile 
only, or rather they put their ads into our system and allow us to show the 
ads on whatever device wher
e the ads will perform best. Because of this, the 
flat desktop revenue does not reflect a particular trend relative to desktop 
demand so much as it reflects the fact that more of our valuable ad 

e are 
spending increasing amounts of time and because the mobile ads perform 
well.
 
We believe our aggregate ad revenue number remains the most important 
reflection of our performance in terms of increasing overall advertising 
demand. And the most important
 
ways for us to continue to increase ad 
revenue are to grow users and engagements and to build advertising 
products and measurement tools that increase demand from advertisers of 
all types around the world.
 
Total payments and other fees revenues was $213 m
illion in Q1, an increase 
of 15% versus last year. payments revenues from games was up 12%, 
though we believe 6% represents the best apples to apples comparison in 
terms of the increase for payments from games if we adjust for items such 
as the Q4 change i

represented our largest three months quarter of games revenue to date 
despite a 37% drop in year over year payments volume from our largest 
developers as our other developers increased their payments volu
mes by 
almost 60% and we saw a record number of people playing games on 
Facebook.
 
Games revenue in Q1 benefited from the growth of games launched over the 
past year and also from our efforts to increase games distribution, usage 
and payments conversion. We
 
believe Facebook continues to offer a 
compelling platform for developers to build great games and businesses and 
we will continue to invest in this area. Overall, ARPU increased 12% to $1.35 
for the quarter, including a 21% increase in the United States a
nd Canada 
and double digit gains in the other major regions as well.
 
Shifting now to expenses, in Q1 our total GAAP expenses were $1.08 billion. 
Excluding stock compensation, total expenses increased 56% to $895 
million, driven primarily by headcount and i
nfrastructure spend to support 
our growth. We continue to expect that our total non
-
GAAP expenses, 
including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp, will likely grow in the 
neighborhood of 50% in 2013 consistent with what we said last quarter as 
we conti
nue to invest in products to grow engagements and monetization.
 
Our Q1 GAAP operating income was $373 million, representing a 26% 
operating margin. Excluding stock comp, our non
-
GAAP operating income 
was $563 million, representing a 39% non
-
GAAP operating 
margin. Our 
GAAP tax rate for Q1 was 38% and benefitted significantly from the 
realization of the onetime $94 million R&D tax credit in the quarter. Our Q1 
non
-
GAAP tax rate was 43% and we expect that our full year non
-
GAAP tax 
rate will be similar to Q1.
 
GAAP net income and EPS for the quarter were $219 million or $0.09 per 
share and non
-
GAAP net income and EPS were $312 million or $0.12 per 
share. We spent $327 million on CapEx in Q1 and we continue to expect 
2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.8 b
illion as we invest in servers 
and data centers to rapidly and reliably provide our products to people 
around the world.
 
In Q1, similar to Q4, upon the vesting of employee RSUs, we withheld 
shares and paid the associated income taxes for our employees, whi
ch 

repurchased approximately $400 million worth of shares in Q1. We ended 
Q1 with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. Overall, we believe that 2013 
is off to a good start. We are 
pleased with our financial performance as well 
as our progress and product development. We are continuing to invest 
aggressively in new products that we think will drive long
-
term engagement 
as well as product and tools to grow our revenues and increase re
turns for 
the advertisers and developers working with us.
 
And we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us to build out the 
network of people using Facebook and to bring our unique asset in terms of 
reach, engagement, and identity to our large and impo
rtant market 
opportunities. Now let's open the call for questions.

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Heather Bellini with 
Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs
 
Mark, I 
was wondering, you shared with us the continued success of mobile 
install ads, I was wondering if you could share with us the other 
monetization initiative that you have that you are most excited about for 
2013. And then my follow up for David would be, if
 
you can share with us 
qualitatively how CPM trended in the various regions on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I will take the first question. In terms of our ads priorities, they are what I 
mentioned, mobile, measurements and product innovation. W
e are 
particularly focused on improving the quality of our ads because we think 
that is the best way to have a great experience for users on Facebook as 
well as for marketers. I think if you look at the success of Custom 
Audiences, Partner Categories, FBX,
 
what you see in that are products all 
move us towards better targeting, more relevance, better experience for 
users and for our marketers. And we are going to continue to invest very 
heavily in making the ad experiences as high return as they can for 
ever
yone involved.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. I will just emphasize the same point. I mean the things I am most 
excited about are things that are driving quality. I mean the two big levers 
for the business are, a, obviously a lot of people spend a lot of time using 
Facebook to stay connected with all the people around them. And second, 
that is an opportunity to advertise. But I actually think over the long term, 

very high quality. Personali
ze, good content in there. And a lot of the things 
that we are doing are aligned with that. So App install, a lot of that stuff is 
just good content that people are interested and there is no great way to 
find app stores today to discover a lot of apps on 
mobile devices.
 
Similarly, I talked about the News Feed redesign that we are rolling out. And 
the content in there is much more visual. And we have always had the policy 
that the advertising content will display in exactly the same way that the 
consumer co
ntent display is. And making it so that people can share a much 
more visual content. Making that naturally advertisements can now have the 
same kind of compelling creative as well, which I think will increase the 
quality of that and overtime increase the e
ffectiveness as well.
 
David Ebersman
 
So Heather, in terms of your question about CPMs. Ads revenue grew well 
across all the geographic regions that we report on. I mentioned the U.S. 
and Canada growth in CPMs. We saw a similar number, a little bit lower bu
t 
similar in Asia. For Europe and rest of the world the numbers were much 
lower. A little a bit above zero in the case of Europe, a little bit below in the 
case of the rest of the world. The interesting question around this is, what 
those numbers might hav



pretty strongly and pretty confident that prices would have i
ncreased

Just two questions. Engagement first 
was up across most of the 


on the geographies. So it looked like the U.S. had a normal seasonal 
downtick s
equentially whereas international most of those regions held up 
sequentially. So can you talk about the difference between sell
-
through rate 
in the U.S. in newsfeed versus some of those international markets?
 
David Ebersman
 
In terms of growth and engagemen
t geographically, I think you can see 
from the numbers that growth was strong across all the areas of the world. 
We continue to add a lot of users in places like India and Brazil. And in 
engagement trends I think were similarly strong throughout and mobile
 
is 
clearly a big part of that equation and been very helpful to us in terms of 
getting more users, more daily users and more engagement from those 


eady said. Europe looks good in the first 
quarter after being a little bit softer towards the end of last year and we 
continue to grow well in Asia and the rest of the world. So I think just pretty 
consistent performance there.

omes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is

Jordan Monahan

Morgan Stanley
 


for
 

tomorrow is a multi
-
screen world with all sorts of personalized devices. And 

tomorrow? Would you agree that screen frag
mentation will continue to 
increase and does moving ads towards newsfeed and away from right hand 
side help you in that environment? And then the second question is just 
about engagement. Engagement continue to improve despite more ads 
which validates your
 
strategy. So every time you launch a new product 
people get concerned that engagement may actually tick down, but it seems 

that are likely to be complimentary to engagement?
 
Mark
 
Zuckerberg
 

is somewhat orthogonal from the main trend that we see which is just 
people sharing more in different ways. And people want to stay connected 
with their friend
s and family and all these different folks in their lives and 


whatever the products are. And I think that t

for people to be able to consume a social content on all of those. So I think 
the big question for us is just which platforms do we see growing the 

investment
s like that at a time. But we can do a couple. Certainly in tablets 

important. But I think that consuming social content and staying connected 
with people is such a fundamental human need
 

important on all of these.
 
And getting ads in newsfeed was a valuable step in making it so that 
everywhere where someone is consuming content from Facebook, the 
business model goes along with that naturally. And those were the earl
y 
challenges that we had with mobile with ad for the first six or seven years of 

mobile. But it was fairly easy with some amount of work just to make that 

 
now I think whatever the form factor is 

we think is good along with consumer content. For the sentiment stuff, I 

xpectations and 
we assumed that sentiment and satisfaction might drop some amount. We 


confident that we can d
o more with advertising over time and can ramp that 

to make it so that we are delivering these end
-
to
-
end solutions for our 
customers and only have a small number of simple thi
ngs, make it easier for 
advertisers to work with us. We want to deliver that and we are kind of 
underway on this long road map to execute that.

I have one for Sheryl and one for David. Sheryl, you talked about Atlas and 
the measurement capabilities there. And you phrased it in terms of click
-
based ads and I am wondering is there also an opportunity for Atlas to 
improve or standardize meas
urement for impression based ads. And I guess 
the spirit of the question more generally, can you just talk about or update 
us on the potential for impression based ads in terms of increasing as a 
percentage of the mix versus performance based ads on Facebo
ok. And 
then, David, question would be, a little bit of a decel in the rate of growth of 
ARPU in the U.S. I am wondering if there are other things you can call out in 
the first quarter, be it dollars from large events, TV events like the Super 
Bowl or othe
r things, other than seasonality. Or maybe you can quantify or 
comment on the seasonality factor in the U.S. and Canada for the 1Q?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So on Atlas you are exactly right. Our focus with Atlas is on impression 
based ads. And the idea is that, yo
u know historically a lot of ads online 
which were more based on search, the attribution was always that last click. 
And as people have looked more holistically at all the ad spending they are 
doing, what they find is that it's not just the last click that
 
matters but it's all 
the impressions leading up to that click. Importantly, we also drive sales 

are actually walking into a store. So in some sense there is no last click.
 
And so our focus with Atlas is to take that technology and enable us to 
improve our ability to connect ad impressions to purchase behavior both 
offline and online, and not just on clicks but across different ad purchases 

 
made that purchase.
 
David Ebersman
 
In terms of ARPU in the U.S. and Canada was up 21% versus last year, so 

to say about seasonality in 2013. We see it from Q4 to Q1 across the yea
rs 
that we have been in an advertising business. And I am sure there are 
unique things that impact each year but there is nothing that we are aware 
of that was particularly important in 2013 in that regard.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Jordan Roha
n with Stifel. Your line is open.
 
Jordan Rohan 
-
 
Stifel, Nicolaus & Company
 
I am curious about how you address markets where it's a little bit harder to 
sell advertising. Specifically, if I'm calculating correctly, 41% of monthly 
active users are in the U.
S., Canada and Europe, as you defined those 
geographies in your slides, and that's 74% of the ad revenues. How can the 
other geographies of the world step up to be an even more meaningful 
percentage of total revenue? Do you have to add a lot of heads, a lo
t of 
sales infrastructure and technology infrastructure that you don't currently 
have? And from that perspective, did you meet your objectives in terms of 
hiring and expenses, because I know how hard it is to support a business as 
global as Facebook. Thank
 
you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So, I'm very encouraged about our opportunity to sell ads all over the world. 
One thing I've learnt in my time selling ads on the internet, which is going 
over a decade now, is that markets that you don't expect to have ad 
markets dev
elop faster than you would think. So if you were to ask me 
seven years ago what Turkey's ad market would look like, I would not have 
predicted it as today. So I'm increasingly encouraged by small businesses 
around the world and large businesses, and their 
adoption of the technology. 
I think with small businesses we have an actually really deep competitive 
advantage, which is that people all around the world use Facebook. So when 
small businesses who are historically way too busy to spend a lot of time 
using
 
technologies, start to use the Facebook platform, they are using 
something they already use as users.
 
So once you have a timeline or a profile, setting up a page is not a very big 
ask because you understand it and you are doing it anyway. And that's why 
w
e think with almost no direct effort we have 16 million small businesses 
actively using Facebook pages. I think one of the things we have done well 
over the past number of quarters is build out simplified ad products like 
Promoted Posts, where it's easy fo
r those people who are using pages and it 
happens all over the world typically on the advertisers and we are 
increasingly optimistic that we can do more and more of that.
 
David Ebersman
 
In terms of hiring, I think everything has gone quite well and as we h
ave 
discussed 2013 is the year where we're investing for future growth, and I 
think in the first quarter both in terms of hiring and building out our 
infrastructure we are on track with where we want to be,

ali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your

Two questions, maybe one for Sheryl and one for Mark. On ad pricing can 
you maybe just talk about CPMs for ads in the newsfeed versus ads on the 
right hand rail? Can you give
 
us maybe just an idea so the magnitude of the 
difference between the two was that a big driver for that 21% increase? 

video advertising to Facebook and both in newsfeed and to de
sktop initially 
and then eventually on mobile assuming that there's enough bandwidth for 
that? Thanks.
 
David Ebersman
 
This is David; I'll take the first one which is about CPM. So the ads that we 
show in newsfeed are displayed more prominently and they are
 
more in the 
flow of the user's attention. So as you would imagine, we get more 
engagement with those ads and they end up commanding a much higher 
average price per ad as you would expect.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I'll take the second part. So video is a really exc
iting area because we have 
leveraged our scale and engagement and our ability to provide relevant ads. 
We have a video product out today. Advertisers can embed a video in their 
page post, and we're seeing really strong results. I think both because of 
that
 
and because of marketers' inherent liking video as a format, we 
continue to explore new things as well, but we don't have anything to 
announce today.

I guess two questions, first on ad formats. Sheryl, do you think you've really 
optimized the ad formats, especially on PC or is there a lot of room you can 
do to get better performance from that? And then secondl
y, maybe you 
could just give us a business update on Instagram, maybe you could 
compare where they are to where Facebook was when you turned on ads or 
any thoughts on how you could monetize that platform maybe far down the 
road?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On the firs
t 
--
 
I think there's a lot of room to improve our ads. I don't know 
whether that'll take the format of different formats. I think more of it will be 
in terms of quality because I think we feel pretty good about our formats. 
But one of the main pushes we ha
d is to make each ad a better experience 
for users, content in those ads, which is as good as the content they'll see 
from a friend or anything else on the site, as well as make those higher 
return for marketers and those two go hand in hand. I think the p
lace you 
will see the most from us is more around targeting, around ability to take 

certainly our focus now. But as our site evolves and our product evolves, we 
never rule out changin
g the format as well.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, on Instagram they're really doing well and growing really quickly. and I 
think that is the right for them and they have this opportunity to capture and 
basically build off this huge community. And I think that tha
t should be a 
100% of the focus right now. I am really optimistic about the business

advertise with Facebook putting content in Instagram, getting huge 
engagement rates. So people are co

You've seen some 
acceleration of revenue over the last three quarters and 
can you just give us some guidelines in terms of should we continue to see 
that accelerate? And if not, at some point in the back half of this year or 
early next year based on some of the investments
 
in new products, could we 
see another inflection point in growth? Thank you.
 
David Ebersman
 
I think we're still in the really early days of what we're doing and that's 
particularly true in mobile. A year ago, we didn't have any mobile ad 
revenue and now i
t's 30% of our ad revenue. So this is great. We're really 
pleased with the progress and we still believe that mobile has the 
opportunity to be huge for us if we can execute well. We've got a really large 
mobile user base. They are very engaged and spend a 
lot of time with us. 
We have an ad format that works on mobile and we have identity so that we 
can put the right ads in front of the right people. So, I think the future for us 
is I think much more interesting than trying to project it from any particular 
quarter at this point, just because we've got a lot less to do. And, obviously, 
we will continue to try and develop tools to enable us to monetize our 
advertising better and potentially in different ways as well. But the big 
opportunity that's right in fro
nt of us is trying to make the mobile advertising 
products higher quality and more relevant over time.

A couple of issues for Mark. I was wond
ering, first, if you could talk about 
the platform strategy and maybe give some specific examples of third 
parties that have really been successful. And in general, what are the 
lessons that you've learned around the platform strategy, how it's evolved? 
An
d then secondly, just around the evolution of Graph Search, any lessons 
from the launch, positive or negative?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. I mean one thing that I think has actually gone well with the platform 
recently is the gaming ecosystem. I mean David was t
alking about this 
earlier, but with the exception of our largest partner, Zynga, whose growth 
hasn't been as awesome as everyone would hope, the rest of the community 
is actually growing quite well and is quite healthy. So, we're pretty happy 
with that and
 
it's a pretty diverse group. I mentioned in my comments at the 
beginning, I mean we have as many as 81 of the top 100 top grossing iOS 
apps and 70 of the top grossing Android apps that are connected in with 
Facebook. So we're getting good coverage, right.
 
And that's all has been the 
vision, it's making it so that any apps and experience that you have can be 
social. So that's working well.
 
Also we really want to be a source that developers can come to for 
distribution and make it such that they can come to 
Facebook and spread 
their apps. People have always had good tools to do it organically, but 
recently the App Install ad product has been another tool in developers' 
arsenal in order to do that and that's showing some real traction. So, I'm 
pretty excited a
bout that as well. Graph Search was your other question. 
And the strategy around it and kind of where we are in rolling out is, we 
developed it over a period of time at the company and we knew that in order 
to get it to be really good we had to get some re
al world data. So we rolled 
it out to just a small percent of people in order to be able to tune the 
ranking and all that. We're getting into a state where we are really happy 
with it before we roll it out to everyone. But we're really optimistic that that
 
will happen over the coming months.
 
So, I'm pretty excited about that. The people who use it, we've gotten very 
positive feedback from it and I think it's going to be a very big opportunity. 
But the launch wasn't this point where we expected a ton of peop
le to start 
using it. We've gated who can use it quite aggressively in order to just make 
sure that we get the data that we need and the real rollout will hopefully 
start pretty soon.

I was wondering if you could talk about engagement per cohort. There is an 
urban myth that those under 25 are disengaging from Facebook. It's hard 
for us to see that in obviously the day that you report, but you w
ould know 
that. Is the mobile engagement, is that offsetting that? Could you talk about 
that engagement amongst younger cohorts? And then secondly, you talked 
about advertising on mobile devices performing well. Could you actually 
make the statement as to 
whether it performs as well as desktop ads do for 
advertisers on Facebook, similar to, sometimes great or sometimes less? 
Could you compare those two? Thank you.
 
David Ebersman
 
Sure. I guess I'd start by saying we remain really pleased with the high level 
of engagement on Facebook by people of all ages around the world. You 
asked about people under 25, we continue to have really high penetration 
rates among that age group, both in the U.S. and globally. And the younger 
users remain among the most active and
 
engaged users that we have on 
Facebook. And then in addition, younger users are extremely active users of 
Instagram as well. So that's great and makes our position even stronger.
 
I think, from our standpoint, the urban legend you referenced, sort of flows
 
more often than not from surveys people have done of younger users that 
indicate that they're using other social services. And we take this feedback 
seriously but our sense is that much of the concern stems from the 
assumption that this is a zero sum game
 
and that's not how we see it. We 
think the overall amount of time spent on services that enable you to 
connect and share is growing and will continue to grow, because these kinds 
of services are really engaging and good. And it's great for us to be the 
le
ader in a market that's expanding rapidly with the foundation we have with 
both Facebook and Instagram and I guess the challenge for us is to just 
continue building great products that appeal to users of all ages. Your 
second question about the engagement 
levels are the performance of mobile 
ads, I think it's fair to say that newsfeed ads on both mobile and desktop 
both perform extremely well and we're pleased with both formats.

Our main focus with Atlas is our own measurement, that being able to

Sheryl, you talked about having strong traction with SMBs and also in direct 
response and app developers and then also about Atlas and attribution. But 
can you help us understand th
e biggest hurdles that you have right now with 
big marketers? And then secondly, David, if you could help us understand 

ads?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
There are lots of types of big marketers
. There are big marketers out there 
who are direct marketers. There are also big marketers who are brand 


across 

about brand advertisers is that they got very used to TV and they got very 
used to search and we are a third thing. And we will win that business client 
by client, CMO by CMO.
 

and I think we have a great team in the field again. With some of the big 
brand advertisers, we have been working with them for years and years. A 
lot of the data and measurement you hear us talking about
 


have a lot of belief at the top and in many of them we are in the process of 
going through their companies and getting that same commitment to buy.
 

 

really wants the company to come along. And now we are in the process of 
working brand by brand, region by region to get that same buy
-
in lower in 
the organization, which actually takes more time not surp
risingly. With other 
brand marketers, they are just in a testing phase and they really haven't 
done enough with us so that we can even do the studies to prove the value. 
And so the good news with us is we're engaged with all 100, Ad Age 100. So 
everyone is
 
buying with us on an annual basis and we're working client by 
client to bring them along that spectrum. The good news is I think we're 
increasingly proving that we can return on ad spend in different parts of the 
purchase funnel.
 
So to share one recent ex
ample, MGM Resorts have used a different suite of 
Facebook products to address different customers at different parts of the 
purchase funnel. They used offers to acquire new customers and they saw a 
three times return on ad spend. Then they used FBX to ret
arget people who 
were in their booking process and dropped out and that gave them a 15 
times return on ad spend. And then for past guests who had completed a 

to return and they got a 
five times return. And I think it's experiences like 
that where we show the breadth of what we can do that really move us 
forward with the brand spenders.
 
David Ebersman
 
You asked about mobile app install ads. So we launched that product I think 
at the beg
inning of the fourth quarter more broadly. So it's early in its 
development, but really doing quite well. And we're pleased with both the 
quality of experiences we're providing and with the revenue growth that 
we've seen. It really fits in nicely with the 
idea of putting content into 
newsfeeds that we think will be of interest to users and provide value for 
developers. I guess the only other thing I've noticed that it's an incremental 
audience for us for the most part from an advertising standpoint which is
 
also nice. Some of those developers were advertising with us before a lot of 
the mobile app Install Ad purchasers or new advertisers to Facebook.

First of all, I just want to go back into the segments of the advertisers 
between the brands, developers, small businesses and performance. Is there 
any way you can characterize what maybe the growth trends have been, 
even recognizing some 
of them below the lines or ultimately growth trends 
between the different ad products. I find it useful to get a sense of where 
the relative growth is, that will be useful. And then a second question, I just 
want to get updated thoughts on datacenters and 
the role of datacenters for 
Facebook. The degree to which you think that it is strategic in investing and 
building these out or if it's really just about operational efficiency?
 
David Ebersman
 
So in terms of the segments, it's really hard to breakup the re
venue because 
the same advertiser crosses multiple segments with multiple objectives, 
sometimes with the same ads. So one of the ways we use the segment is to 
help focus our product development on understanding the different 
objectives that marketers might
 
have, but then translating that into 
individual groups of revenue is difficult. So I think that, as Sheryl mentioned, 
we're particularly pleased with small businesses. That's something that we 
can measure on Facebook and see the number of advertisers incr
easing.
 
In terms of datacenters, I think it is both strategic and operational. There's 
no question that owning our own datacenters removes sort of another party 
from the mix relative to when we used to lease datacenter space. It also 
enables us to build th
e datacenters to look exactly as we want them to look 
so that the performance is optimized for precisely what Facebook needs to 
do with the servers that we put in there, and there's definitely some 
efficiency that comes from that. But I would also say that
 
it is, given what 
we are trying to do in the world we are trying to reach, I do think it's 
strategic for Facebook to not be dependent on third parties to provide that 
critical part of our supply chain.

Yes, couple of questions. On the unpublished Page posts, can you give us an 
update. I think that got released towards the end of the first quarter, maybe 
what type of traction you're seein
g there. And also going back to kind of 
U.S. versus Europe, can you just maybe detail 
--
 
Europe definitely 
outperformed U.S. on a sequential basis, was that due to some of the later 
adoption of some of the sponsor stories in the News Feed or is that 
someth
ing else?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On Page post, Page post ads first appeared May of last year and then we 
just put them into News Feed in March of 2013. In terms of unpublished, 
what that just means is the ability to target Page post only to the right 
people. So, 
for example, without posting it to everyone on your page. For 
example, if you are a retailer and there was a snow storm in one state, you 
could target snow shovels or other relevant stuff you want to sell for snow 
storms only to people in that state. So, i
t's just a really useful way of 
segmenting your audience, again part of our overall push to relevant 
targeting and quality. We're really excited about Page post ads. Over 7.5 
million posts have been promoted by pages. Over 30% of the people using 
the produ
ct are new advertisers basically. And I think that speaks to one of 
the earlier questions on small
-
to
-
medium business and their adoption. If you 
say to an SMB, do you want to become an advertiser, that's a heavy lift. If 
you say to them, you have a page, y
ou've posted something, do you want to 
pay a few dollars to promote this post to reach more people, that is a much 
easier on ramp to advertising spend with us and we think it's working really 
well.
 
David Ebersman
 
In terms of U.S. and Europe, I really don't
 
have a lot more to add. The 
Europe number as I said was strong in Q1. I'm certain it's true that for some 
of the products that we roll out the U.S. represents the first adapters and 
then they spread their way to other clients around the world. But I don't
 
have any specific evidence to support that that was key to the trends in Q1.

Two questions if I may. If we look at the broad base of all ad impressions 
across Facebook whether it's desktop or mobile, can you give us a sense of 
what percentage of those are generated or conditioned by social stat
istics or 
socially relevant data that comes out of the Facebook experience versus ads 
conditioned by external data like from Acxiom or it's from retargeting traffic 
from other websites. And then second, within the category of apps and 
others, can you give 
us a sense of is there any materiality around the other 

Facebook type services like gifts? Thank you.

n mobile 
ad load, is that right?
 
Daniel Ernst

No. It was whether it's mobile or desktop, what part of the 
--
?
 
David Ebersman
 
All right. I got lost in the second question which I should have written down 
to the first one. So right n
ow you asked about Acxiom and things like that. 

overtime we can bring tools to bear that can really increase our ability to do 
more targeting and more effective targeting than we do
 
today. In terms of 
the second part, I think you're asking about the whole payments and 
another fees revenue lines. So I said the whole line grew by 15%. Games 
represented 12% growth. So the increment in between the 12% and the 
15% came primarily from user
 
promoted posts, which is a product we 
launched last year to a lesser degree also from our gifts product.

Thanks, Deborah and thanks everyone for joining us today. We made some 
really good progress this quar
ter with the growth of 

 
in the growth and 
engagement of our community, the release of new products like Instagram 
video and advertising growth, especially on mobile.
 

more daily active
s on mobile than on desktop. Nearly half a billion people 

on mobile than on desktop as well. This progress is the result of investments 
we started making more than a year
-
ago and in som
e cases years ago.
 
I appreciate the patience and trust of our team, our community, and our 

-
term 
investments and achieved great results as well.
 
One of the questions I frequently get ask
ed are what are the big changes we 

connected a 1 billion people, what is the next big ambition? There are three 
main goals I would like us to achieve. Connect everyone, understand the 
wo
rld and help build the knowledge economy.
 
Connecting everyone is about growing our community to reach the next 5 
billion people. Our mission is to give all people the power to share and make 
your world more open and connected. And that means everyone. Not 
just 
product in developed countries. Most people in the world, they only had the 
smartphones or data access, but we know that we want to be connected.
 
We are focused on making this possible, while also strengthening 
engagement within our existing community
. Understanding the world is that 
helping people share not just day
-
to
-
day updates like text messages and 
photos, but also building up long
-
term knowledge about the world. But what 
people are interested in, which restaurants are good, which hotels your 
fri

 
We should be able to build intelligent services that help you use your 
network that could answer lots of questions for you to note if service can. I 
want to read our community to create a graph of all that understanding to 
power this intelligence.
 
Building the knowledge economy is about helping people create companies 

just building a strong monetization engine for our Company. We are creating 
tools to 
enable new growth jobs and businesses, [indiscernible] (2 2:24) 
Platform to support a larger economic shift in the world based on knowledge 
and information.

d customers, to help great brand tell their stories 


Facebook community has grown steadily this quarter, ad
ding 45 million new 
monthly actives and the number of monthly active is steady or increasing 
across demographics and countries.
 

ratio of daily actives to monthly actives were decreased 
as later technology 
adapters used our service. The opposite is actually been true, but now 61% 
of monthly actives or daily actives and that ratio has just continued to 
increase.
 
In our most penetrated markets like the U.S., more than 70% of our 
monthly act
ives use our services daily. And now more than 700 million 
people worldwide use Facebook daily as of today. As more social services get 
created, one question is how that affects the sharing and time that people 
spend on Facebook? You can naively assume tha
t more new services means 

on average are spending more time on Facebook than ever before.
 

time spent per
 
person increases on Facebook, maybe our market share can 

third
-
party metrics like comScore and Nielsen, Facebook share of time spent 
in the U.S. is either steady or increasing. Now we
 

or increasing everywhere else as well.
 
This makes sense to me because Facebook helps to maintain your real 
identity in relationship, which are universal need. We believe that if we 
execute well, we have a good shot at growing 
the amount of time that 
people spend using Facebook, while also maintaining or increasing our 
overall share of time spend.
 
One specific demographic I want to address is U.S. teens. There has been a 
lot of speculation reporting that fewer teens are using Fa
cebook. But based 

some young people lied of their age. But based on the best data we have, 

for a
 
while and the number of teens using Facebook on both a daily and 
monthly basis has been steady over the past year and half.
 

worth mentioning that these stats are for Facebook only. Inst
agram is 
growing quickly as well. If you combine the two services together, we 
believe our engagement and share of time spend are likely growing quickly 
throughout the world.
 
Next, let's talk about building more useful services on the path to 
understanding
 
the world. The newest product I'm most excited about from 
our last quarter is Instagram video. Adding video fits really naturally with 
the Instagram mission of capturing and sharing the world's moments. It's off 
to a great start. People are already upload
ing hours of video to Instagram 
every minute. I'm really proud of the team and I think they did a great job 
with this product.
 
When I first talked to Kevin about this, he had a really smart insight. 
Instagram has always been about helping people capture mo
ments in a way 
they're proud of. Filters were necessary for photos because when Instagram 
started, most phone cameras weren't good enough to take high quality 
photos. But lack of filters isn't what's holding back videos from being great. 
It's that they're 
shaky and feel unprofessional.
 
Kevin realized that if we can deliver a product that helps people produce 
stable videos that would really change the landscape and I think it already 
is. Now some products that video fit into the flow of what people are 
doing 
and they take off quickly. Others like Graph Search and Home are 
completely new kinds of products and they're just going to take longer to 
develop.
 
I've used the right strategy to have a balance of long
-
term foundational new 
products in ones that fit
 
in immediate demand. We're committed to building 
all of these into market
-
leading products.
 
Finally, let's talk about building the knowledge economy and what that 
means for our core business. This quarter has been a strong period for us. A 
lot of new busi
nesses have signed up to advertise with us and we now have 
more than 1 million active advertisers. Our News Feed Ad products are 
working well for them.
 
One of the things I watch most closely is the quality of our ads and peoples' 
sentiment around them. Rig
ht now ads on average make up about 5% or 1 
in 20 stories in News Feed. We haven't measured a meaningful drop in 
satisfaction when we ask people about their experience with Facebook. 
We're comparing that to the result we get when we ask the same question t
o 
people using a version of Facebook with no feed ads at all.
 
With that said, in recent studies people have told us that they noticed the 
ads more, so we're going to invest more in improving the quality. Our top 
priority is to expand the number of marketer
s and overall demand in our 
system rather than just increasing the number of ads that we show. We 
believe that this will help us improve the quality of the ads that we show by 
creating a more competitive auction and this will create the best experience 
for
 
people who use our products, the best returns for more marketers and 
the best results for us.
 
So that's my update for this quarter. We had a lot of progress in the last 
three months on growing our community engagement, releasing a successful 
major product
 
and generating strong financial results. This quarter also 
marks the end of our first year as a public company and I think we created a 
good foundation for the future.
 
I want to take a moment to thank everyone who works at Facebook and 
everyone who's a pa
rt of this great community. You are all helping to 
connect the world and push it forward. I'm grateful to have the chance to 
work with all of you on this. So thank you and thanks to everyone on this 
call for joining us today. I look forward to having more 
to share next 
quarter.
 
And now, Sheryl.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thank Mark. Our advertising business gained significant momentum this 
quarter growing 61% year
-
over
-
year to 1.6 billion. Our mobile ad revenue 
grew significantly as well and is now approximately 41% o
f total ad revenue, 
up from about 30% in Q1. This growth was robust across all regions and 
each of our four marketing segments increased spending about this quarter. 
We believe this is because our ad products are delivering impressive ROI for 
each of these
 
types of marketers.
 
Direct response marketers, including ecommerce companies, increased their 
spent significantly. Year
-
over
-
year ad revenue from ecommerce companies 
doubled in the second quarter. Direct response marketers are taking 
advantage of our high
 
click
-
through rates and competitive CTCs to grow 
their businesses. These marketers are typically very measurement focused 
and they quickly increased their budgets as we deliver compelling ROI.
 
Revenue from mobile app install ads also continues to accelera
te. The app 
market is relatively new but it is already large and growing very rapidly. We 
believe that Facebook is one of the most effective ways for developers to 
acquire new customers at competitive rates. We're increasing our share and 
helping to grow t
his market.
 
Local businesses also grew spend significantly. We surpassed 1 million active 
advertisers this quarter, more than double the number we had only a year 
ago. We believe that this rapid growth is being driven by our unique ability 
to target ads an
d the simpler ad products we rolled out in the past year.
 
We're all really excited that we can help local businesses grow around the 
world. One of my favorite local examples is right in our backyard, Artisan 
State, a San Francisco business that prints phot
o books. The owner told us 
that running News Feed ads gave him so many customers so quickly that 
they had to pause their campaigns to let their manufacturing catch up.
 
Nearly 18 million local businesses now have Facebook pages, but we are 
excited to hit 1 
million active advertisers, we know that this is just a small 
fraction of the local businesses on Facebook. So this remains a large growth 
opportunity for us.
 
And finally, brand marketers also continue to grow spend. We have a 
massive and engaged audience 
around the world that brands can use to 
build awareness and drive scales. Every night 88 million to 100 million 
people are actively using Facebook during primetime TV hours in United 
States alone.
 
One recent example is from Reckitt Benckiser, a global CGP 
company. Their 
campaign for Lysol targeted moms and drove a two times return on ad spent 
for their brand. Their campaign for Air Wick was even better driving a 5x 
return on ad spent. As they have seen these results, they have more than 
doubled their ad spe
nt with us over the last year.
 
News Feed ads are performing very well. In an analysis by Datalogix of 55 
ad campaigns on Facebook over the past six months, marketers saw a 
median return on ad sales of three times of campaigns that did not include 
adding ne
w feeds, which is very solid performance. Campaigns that included 
News Feed ads, the median return on ad sales was nearly double at 5.9x.
 
During the second quarter we increased the number and type of ads in News 
Feed. At the same time, our click
-
though rat
es and cost
-
per
-
click metrics for 
News Feed ads remains strong during the quarter providing a good indicator 
of healthy and growing advertiser demand and continued user interest in 
these ads.
 
Custom Audiences is another key product that continues to gain m
omentum. 
This product enables our clients to enhance their ad targeting by marrying 
their data with ours in a privacy protective way. In Q2 the number of 
marketers using custom audiences more than doubled relative to Q1.
 
We also continue to innovate around
 
our mobile app products. In April we 
launched ad targeting for future trends. This helps marketers, everyone from 
multinationals to local businesses, reach people in emerging markets who 
they could not easily reach before. While these ad markets are not e
specially 
large today, they'll become increasingly important in the years to come.
 
In summary, we believe we're making strong progress executing our 
strategy. As I have mentioned in previous quarters, we are investing in 
mobile measurements and product inn
ovations. The results we are reporting 
today demonstrate the early returns on these investments. Looking ahead, 
we're enthusiastic about the launch and prospects for our business.
 
The time people are spending on mobile devices is increasing dramatically 
th
at mobile represents just 2% of ad spent globally and 3% in the U.S. We 
have a massive and growing mobile user base. We have an impressive share 
of mobile time spent and we have one if not the most effective mobile app 
products. Together this positions us 
well to lead the mobile app market.
 
We believe that over time, marketers will increasingly rely on Facebook not 
just to reach people wherever they are but to fundamentally transform the 
way they build their businesses. As Facebook delivers personalized 
exp
eriences to over 1.1 billion people, we also have a unique opportunity to 
deliver a more personalized advertising experience.
 
As I meet with marketers all around the world, I find more and more that 
they are understanding the benefits of this opportunity. 
As a result, 
Facebook is placed to play an essential role in the evolution of marketing. 
We know we still have a lot of hard work to do, but we're excited about this 
quarter and the opportunity in front of us.
 
Now David.
 
David Ebersman
 
Thanks Sheryl and go
od afternoon, everyone. Today, I'd like to update you 
on our progress in Q2 against our key financial objectives. Increasing 
revenue, investing to drive our future growth and positioning the company 
to maximize long
-
term returns for our shareholders. It wa
s a great quarter 
across the board as we continue to benefit from and effectively navigate the 
transition to mobile.
 
Let's start with our network. Usage and engagement on Facebook remain 
extremely strong as evidenced by the following. On an average day in June, 
699 million people used Facebook, up 27% from last year. This represents 
61% of the 1.15 billion people who acc
essed Facebook at any point during 
the month of June.
 
Additionally, time spent per person on Facebook continues to increase. An 
aggregate across everyone in our network, time spent on Facebook 
exceeded 20 billion minutes each day in June.
 
Separately, Insta
gram continues to grow rapidly with impressive 
engagement and we announced last month we had over 130 million actives 


o the 
financials.
 
In Q2, total revenue was $1.81 billion up 53% or 54% when adjusted for 
constant exchange rates. Ad revenue was $1.6 billion up 61% in the quarter 
or 63% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. This was our strongest 
quarter in terms of
 
advertising revenue growth since the third quarter of 
2011. The performance was strong throughout the world with ad revenue in 
each of our geographic regions growing by greater than 15%.
 
Growth in advertising revenue was driven by an increase in the numbe
r of 
marketers, overall advertising demand and the strong performance of 
newsfeed ads. Newsfeed ads were, they have been remarkably effective at 
delivering high levels of engagement a significant increase in click through 
rates and overall number of clicks
 
and marketers have increased budgets 
meaningfully in response. Overall ad impressions were up 43% and the 
average price per ad was up 13% compared to last year.
 
Ad impressions are up due to more people using our service worldwide 
combined with the impact 
of reducing the price floor late in 2012 which 
resulted in more ads being shown particularly in developing markets. In the 
U.S. and Canada where the price floor changes had a smaller impact, ad 
volume increased 6% and average price per ad increased over 40
% year
-
over
-
year driven by the growth higher performing newsfeed ads.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was $214 million in Q2, an increase 
of 11% versus last year. Payments revenue from games specifically was up 
7% so we believe 11% represents the bes
t apples
-
to
-
apples comparison if 
we adjust for items such as the change in revenue recognition timing we 
made late last year. We were pleased to see Kings continued rapid growth 
on our games platform in Q2.
 
Kings strategy of launching games like Candy Crus
h Saga on Facebook and 
subsequently launching on mobile has proved to be an effective approach 
that enables people to seamlessly play games across desktop and mobile 
and we expect other game developers to pursue a similar strategy. We 
believe Facebook cont
inues to offer a compelling platform for developers to 
build great games and businesses.
 
Overall ARPU increased 25% compared to last year to $1.60 per user for the 
quarter including a 35% increase in the United States and Canada as well as 
30 plus percent 
gains in all our other regions.
 
Turning now to expenses, in Q2 our GAAP total expenses were $1.25 billion, 
excluding stock compensation non
-
GAAP total expenses increased 52% to 
$1.02 billion primarily driven by headcount and infrastructure. We ended the 
qu
arter just shy of 5,300 employees up 33% from last year and we continue 
to be pleased with our success in attracting talent.
 
Our Q2, GAAP operating income was $562 million representing 31% 
operating margin. Excluding stock comp our non
-
GAAP operating incom
e 
was $794 million up 44% non
-
GAAP operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate for 
Q2 was 39% and our non
-
GAAP tax rate was 37%. GAAP net income was 
$333 million or $0.13 per share and non
-
GAAP net income was $488 million 
or $0.19 per share.
 
We spent $268 million 
on CapEx in Q2, as we continue to invest in our 
datacenters and facilities. While the relatively lower spend on CapEx in Q2 is 
partially the result of timing of purchases. It also reflects the returns from a 
significant effort by employees throughout the c
ompany to make our 
software and hardware more efficient. CapEx will remain one of our primary 
areas of spend since we need a powerful infrastructure to provide content 
rich and personalized information to all the people who use our service 
around the world
.
 
The projects like Open Compute and many others are providing great 

disciplined and efficient manner. Of note, free cash flow in Q2 was over $1 
billion. This is much higher than we 
expect in coming quarters as Q2 free 
cash flow benefited from $419 million tax refund and light quarterly spend 
on CapEx. But still $1 billion in free cash flow is a nice milestone for us 
against an important financial metric.
 
In Q2 similar to prior quarte
rs, upon the vesting of employee RSUs, we 
withheld shares and paid the associated income taxes for our employees, 
with provides an outcome similar to Facebook having repurchased 
approximately $153 million worth of shares in the quarter. We ended Q2 
with $1
0.3 billion in cash and investments.
 
Now I want to conclude by sharing some thoughts about the second half of 
2013. We expect newsfeed ads to remain the main driver of revenue growth 
in the second half of the year and we believe we have a great opportunity
 
to 
continue to drive long
-
term growth by improving the quality and relevance 
of these ads. However remember that newsfeed ads really began to 
contribute to our revenue in the third and fourth quarters last year which will 
make for more difficult year
-
over
-
year comparisons in Q3 and Q4 relative to 
Q2.
 
Looking at expenses, consistent with what we said previously we plan to 
invest in our business and continue to expect that our total non
-
GAAP 
expenses including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp will li
kely grow 
in the neighborhood of 50% for the full
-
year 2013 compared to 2012. We 
also continue to expect that this full
-
year over full
-
year expense growth rate 
will be faster than our year
-
over
-
year revenue growth rate for the full
-
year 
2013 compared to 20
12.
 
In terms of our tax rate, we expect that our Q3 and full
-
year non
-
GAAP tax 
rate with be a few percentage points higher than our Q2 rate and finally we 
expect 2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.6 billion. This is down 
from our prior estimate of 
$1.8 billion due to a combination of efficiency 
gains and changes in timing of purchases while Q2 was a very strong quarter 
for us.

of work around targeting. The most important work we've done over the 
past year and I think you're seeing its results and it is around Custom 
Audiences, which enables people to use their da
ta in a privacy protective 
way with us. It enables them to show different ads to people who are 
current customers versus new customers who are interested in different 
things. And I think we're really pleased with the adoption. The number of 
marketers using
 
Custom Audiences more than doubled in Q2 and we're now 
up to 50 of the AdAge 100 who have already started using the products. We 
also think there is room to improve. We can do more and we will continue to 
do more to improve the targeting, the relevance of

Great, thanks. Two questions please. Could you talk about thoughts on 
monetization of Instagram and maybe just pote
ntially how you think about 
the ability to monetize that versus your core Facebook asset? And then 
secondly, Sheryl, could you talk about on the vertical basis where you think 
the biggest wide space opportunities are for advertising revenue for 
Facebook an
d the particular industries that you look at that they are 
materially underrepresented on Facebook where you could have the greatest 
growth going forward? Thanks a lot.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. I'll answer the Instagram question. Kevin has always been clear t
hat 
we're building Instagram to be at business and that we expect that over 
time we're going to generate a lot of profit from it and probably through 
advertising. Now that all said, right now it's just growing still quickly. I mean 
the number that we just 
said was 130 million monthly actives. Video product 
is growing really quickly. There are so many directions to expand this in that 
we think that the right focus for now is to continue just focusing on 
increasing the footprint of Instagram. And when the rig
ht time comes then 
we'll think about doing advertising as well, but I think that's going to be a 
really big opportunity.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
In terms of growth opportunities, I think in terms of vertical categories, we 
have big growth opportunities across the 
board. There are certainly verticals 
that were stronger than others which were very strong, for example in CPG. 
But even though we've grown spend significantly, we're still a tiny portion of 
the spent that CPG advertises. And even in the verticals where I 
think we've 
done very well, starting to penetrate, there's a lot of room for growth. I 
think as you think about different industries using the power of online 
marketing, we see different levels of adoption but I'm a believer that over 
time this is where pe
ople are spending their time and any marketer who's 
trying to reach people is going to spend their resources there as well.

Thanks so much. I think it's fairly easy too when talking to advertisers to 
access that there has been this latent demand for advertising on Facebook. 
But when you look across the globe, it's a little bit harder to address the 
advertising co
mmunity. Can you talk about the growth of the ad sales force 
and the ad ops and all the people required to really bring that outside of the 
major U.S. and Western European markets? And specifically is there a 
chance that you believe that Asia
-
Pacific and r
est of world markets can see a 
meaningful continued and sustainable shift higher in ARPU than where we 
are today? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Yes, I'm a big believer that revenue opportunities exist all over the world 
and our gross was very strong across re
gions, including outside of the U.S. 
for this time. We're up to over 40 offices and we have sales teams on the 
ground in over 40 offices and we're seeing really good adoption and really 
good growth across. You mentioned Asia, I was actually in Japan and Ko
rea 
meeting with advertisers just a few weeks ago and we are seeing companies 
that really weren't doing much with us a year ago increasingly adopt us as 
part of a core part of their spend. So I remain very optimistic about our 
growth across Asia and the re
st of the world.

Thank you very much. Two questions please. Can you talk about the mix of 
growth in direct selling versus pro
grammatic selling for you guys and where 
do you see that going forward? And in terms of just on the cost side, I guess 
looking at the investment and by the way David, thanks for the color about 
operating expenses and guidance for the second half, but as yo
u look at 
longer term, how far can you see that 50% increase in operating expenses 
still being sustained as you, I guess just looking at 2014? I know you're not 
guiding to 2014 right now, but just as we look at the model going forward 
how far do you think 
you can sustain growth in operating expenses faster 
than growth in revenues? Thank you.
 
David Ebersman
 
Yeah, thanks for your question. Your first question about direct selling 
versus programmatic, the mechanism that most people buy from Facebook 
is 
through the option that we offer, but that doesn't mean that we're not 

 
we don't have a sales force that's out calling on clients. Sheryl can expand 
on that if you want.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Yeah, we sell both directly to our sales team so it's in
-
person and o
nline. 
And what I think you mean by programmatic which is through third party 
such as DSPs and other 

 
one thing worth noting is that FBX which is part of 
that programmatic selling is actually a very small part of our business and I 
think sometimes people 
don't understand that. So that piece is quite small. 
We are expanding both our direct selling efforts both to sales teams and 
online as well as the third parties we work with, and we think having a 
healthy and growing ecosystem on both sides is really good
 
for the 
development of our business.
 
David Ebersman
 
You asked about investments looking forward to next year, I think 
philosophically is the easiest way to answer that which is we still think we're 
early in the journey of building the service that we want
 
Facebook to be and 
there's lots of work ahead of us to do and lots of things to do. And our plan 
will continue to be to invest aggressively in the areas that we think are 
important to improve our strategic positioning and to drive our ability to 
grow reve
nues and profits over the long run. We also know that to be the 
great company that we want to be, we have to be disciplined in everything 
that we do and focus our spend on the areas that are really most important. 
So, the challenge for us just by any compa
ny is finding that right balance. I 
really can't comment on 2014 yet honestly just because we haven't 

 
I don't 
know what 2014 is going to look like. We tend to plan in six

month blocks 
and I think have our act together pretty well for what we're going to 
try to 
do in the second half of this year, but haven't been on the conversation

be coming in when video 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
We may have lost the question, but I'll take the first half while we wait for 
the second piece to come back. On the first piece, our system works that 
you can buy by CPM or CPC and we let advertiser
s choose. I think both parts 
of our business are healthy and growing. I think when people talk about 
impression
-
based purchasing or buying, what they're really trying to get at 
is brands. And brand is a very important, one of our four segments and one 
that
's growing. When you think about what brand spenders are doing, 
they're trying to get discovery. And I think we've made a lot of progress 
there. We now work with every one of the global AdAge 100 over the past 
year. Now that said, people are in different p
arts of that spectrum. We have 
brand advertisers who are looking for discovery who have advertised with us 
for a long time, proven the value and are really expanding and these others 
that are newer, that are experimenting that aren't as convinced yet and i
t's 
our job to get there and convince them. I think what people are increasingly 
seeing is we have a big brand opportunity. We have a massive engaged 
audience, 88 million to 100 million people in the U.S. during primetime 
hours who are on Facebook. We offe
r discovery and we have a unique 
opportunity to take people all the way through the funnel. In one example, a 
recent one that I really like is T
-
Mobile did an ad campaign with us to attract 
people to sell new phones. They used our offer ads to do it. 9% of
 
the 
people who claimed the offer converted to T
-
Mobile within 10 days and they 
had over 20 times return on their ad spend which is just incredibly strong in 
the industry and I think that shows the power of what we can do with 
impressions, taking people al
l the way through the funnel.
 
David Ebersman
 
Anthony, I'll try and answer your question about CapEx as best I could. You 
got cut off as you probably know, so I only got about 

 
well, I don't know 
how much of it I got but I got enough to give it a shot. And
 
really the best 
way I can think to answer it is to describe for you the variables that 
influence what CapEx requirements are for the company. So clearly the 
number of users is near the top of the list, and also the time at which the 
users use the service.
 
So adding users who are off peak 
--
 
the Facebook 
peak provides less of a burden for our infrastructure than people who are 
using at the same time as our peak hours, because we can leverage what we 
built to peak. A second thing is definitely the level of e
ngagement with those 
users and that seem to be where you were going with your question about 
video. That is and will continue to be, we hope something that drives up 
requirements for our infrastructure because it means people are really 
engaging and findin
g new ways to use the service. What has helped us I 
think is the two variables that come next. One is just the cost of the 

things and competition in the market have helped us to reall
y be able to 
bring down the cost for each unit of equipment we use. And then the next 
variable which I mentioned in my remarks which I think is a really important 
one is just the efficiency of what we build. So over time I think Facebook has 
impressively s
ucceeded at making the hardware we use more efficient and 
the software that we run on it more efficient in terms of how much compute 
power that is needs. The last variable of course probably the hardest to 
predict is product development, is just what we bu
ild and how that 
influences what the computer requirements are. So clearly the variable you 
emphasized which was engaging with higher content things is one of the 
things that will influence the CapEx over time, but it's a pretty complicated 
equation, but I
 

with how 2013 is coming together in that regard.

more feed eligible demand was a big part of the story. And I think one of the 
really good pieces of news for us is how well the price held up as we did

ads we showed in feed. So for many of 
our ads as you know marketers are bidding for clicks in an auction and the

Great, thanks guys. David, just the continuation of what 
you were just 
talking about, so on the mobile newsfeed ads is the 5% number 
--
 
your 5% 

then is the growth a function of, you just said price is going up sequentially 
obviously yo
ur mobile DAUs are going up or MAUs are going to up 

So, of those three variables, users, click through rate and price, which is 
driving the sequential increase the most in mobile
? Thanks.
 
David Ebersman
 
So in terms of the 5% number again, what we know is where we are now, 

level. So, the number was zero a year ago, it increased steadily over the 
past year and the 5% number is a aver
age number globally, it does differ by 
geography and it also differs by person. It will be higher for people for whom 
we have a lot of more ads that are targeted towards them and are relevant 

ideally for 

performance of the ads and continually tweaking the product, learning from 
our experience to try and do that as well as we can. Going forward, I think 
as we have

I think 

is to improve the quality of the ads so that we can show ads that are 
engaging in relevant for the users involved. Your question about what drove 
the increase? I think everything contributed. I think 



pleased with how click through had held up, and I mentioned what was 
happening in terms of
 
cost per click increasing sequentially. So it's a nice

On Video ads, we have a current video ad pro
duct, because marketers can 
embed a video in a page post and we see a lot of marketers using that 
product and seeing good results as a demand to do more in video on

Congratulations on a really outstanding quarter. Mark I want to ask about 
the pla
tform strategy and its broadly, how was the strategic vision to allow 
third
-
parties to provide services to the network evolved over the past year, 
and what needs to happen that more of a contribution from non
-
advertising 
based businesses?. And David just q
uickly from modeling, the mobile ad 
revenue, can you talk about how that progressed through the quarter, did it 
exit June much stronger than it was earlier in the quarter? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yeah, I mean, I can get the platform question. The strategy 
for that has 

 
we shifted a bit to focus on building more business tools for developers than 

mobile app installs and originally we were 

 
we had a little bit of skepticism 
about h
ow happy developers would be with a system where they would pay 



able way that they have to grow 


 
we think about 
advertisers in terms of these used cases that folks had on this local 
businesses. They are great brands. They are developers, who are building 
app, there
 

platform to be one of those big verticals to be a big part of the business. 
There is also a games part of the platform, which is kind of the first piece of 
platform that we launched and that is j
ust continuing to grow at a slower, 
but steady rate.

Your second question was about progress through the quarter, nothing

Morgan Stanley
 
Thanks. I had a bigger picture question for Mark. I was hoping you could 
give sort of a scorecard when you're in relative to your founder letter. I 
know it's b
een only 14 months and that's a short period of time, but it will 
be interesting to hear your views on the company's performance against the 
longer term aspirations and core values that you've put in the letter? 
Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yeah, I think we're 
early. And one of the interesting things over the past six 
months or so is reaching 1 billion people was this big rallying cry for the 
company for a long period of time. And I think as we've passed that, we've 
seen the ambition that the company has grow. A
nd reaching 1 billion users 
was a great first thing to focus on because no one had ever built a service 
that had 1 billion active people who were signed in and had real identity 
before. But in a way it's actually kind of just an abstract, there's nothing 
m
agical about 1 billion. The real goal is to connect everyone in the world and 
help people map out everything that there is. Well, I think what we're seeing 
is as some of the products succeed is just the ambition increased to be able 
to do more of these and
 
taking on more longer term things. At the same 
time, I think what you have is we weren't happy with the quality of our 
mobile experiences, rewinding 18 months. So we had just a lot of 
foundational work to do and I think coming into this year, we kind of c
ould 
tell internally that we were turning a corner on that. We were in good shape 
and could start to play a bit more offense. But as I think the numbers from 
this quarter suggest, I think we're really starting to see the upside of some 
of the investments t
hat we've been making over the last period.

Thanks for taking my question. I have two. One of the things that stood out 
in your prepared r
emarks is I think you mentioned 40% year
-
on
-
year 
increase in average price per ad in North America in Q2. I was hoping you 
could remind us how that compared to say Q1 and given that I think you 
contributed that to higher performing ads, if maybe you could 
call out 
specifically what one or two either ad units or ad targeting enhancements 
were the kind of key contributors to that growth? And then secondly, David, 
I think you called out the more challenging comps as you enter into the 
second half of the year. 
Are you suggesting that it's kind of unreasonable for 
us to look at the sequential growth that you saw in the second half of 2012 
and assume that that sort of rate of growth is repeatable this year?
 
David Ebersman
 
Okay. In terms of pricing I think 

 
we wer
e pleased with the pricing growth 
in the first quarter too. The net across the world was a 3% average in the 
first quarter but that was much higher in the U.S. and Canada, because 
again for the same reason it wasn't impacted by the price floor change. So i
t 
was about 25% in the U.S. and Canada and was even stronger in the second 
quarter. And similarly in other territories, I think pricing is just going really 
well and would be stronger than the result show if not for the impact of the 
price floor. We probab
ly have numbers that are similar to the U.S. and 
Canada, if not stronger in our other regions as well. In terms of the comps, I 
don't think there is anything particularly complicated so what I was saying, 
it's just if you're looking at the percentage growt
h rates for Q2, you're 
comparing to a quarter last year that really didn't have much mobile 
revenue or News Feed revenue in it at all and that really started to ramp up 
in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So it's there in one side of the 
compariso
n going forward.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
In terms of where the growth is coming from in terms of ad units, in terms 
of our market segments direct response marketers are a very big contributor 
to the growth. That's why I started with them in the remarks and in 
the 
Q&A. Ecommerce doubled year
-
over
-
year and they're doing that by using a 
bunch of our different ad products; everything from post to offers to other 
things, but it's really about looking for those contributions. We've also seen 
a lot of growth, as I sai
d, in mobile app install ads; small market but 
growing rapidly and it's a market where we offer a product that there is 
almost nowhere else to get the kind of returns and opportunity we offer.
 
David Ebersman
 
I'm just going to add one more thing just in cas
e I, in anyway, created any 
confusion and I have no evidence that I did yet. But the price per ad that I 
was talking about in this question reflects not the same thing as the cost
-
per
-
clicks that I answered in a question earlier because price per ad will a
lso 
incorporate the click
-
through rate as well as the cost
-
per
-
click for click
-
based ad and also includes ads that are purchased on an impression basis. 
So most of the pricing metrics we provide are per ad inclusive of click
-
through rates and impression
-
ba
sed ads. The CPC metric I gave earlier was 
just, I think, a specific and useful metric in understanding how much strong 
demand contributed in the second quarter.

Hi. So just maybe if we could drill into the comment around ecommerce 
spending doubling and it seems as though FBX and third party effort, its 
growing fast but its small and the same with the app install effort. But can 
you tal
k a little bit about what drove that doubling in Europe year
-
on
-
year? 
Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I think direct response marketers have had more opportunities to use our 
system, use our product and we've also made a very major investment in 
helping them measu
re returns and helping them connect what's happening 
both online and as well as throughout the system. So direct response 
marketers tend to be buyers when they have an ROI metric. They're looking 
for that ROI metric and their budgets are flexible around th
ose ROIs. So as 
they've invested with us and hit their ROI metrics, their budgets go up and 
they make those adjustments very quickly. That's why when they start using 
the products and see the value they create, they are able to grow very 
quickly even withi
n a quarter or within a week or within a month because 
they adjusted their budgets.

Thanks. A couple of quick questions. First on hi
ring, there's been a lot of 
discussion in the press about tech companies' need for more highly skilled 
workers and I'm curious if you're feeling pressure to find that kind of highly 
skilled talent and what areas you find hardest to fill and maybe some 
succ
essfully that you're finding good engineering talent? And then secondly 
on the advertiser mix, have you guys discussed your mix of brand 
advertisers by category like auto, retail, telecom, that kind of category mix? 
And are there any that have grown partic
ularly well the past year?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yeah, I can take this. Hiring great people especially engineers is one of the 
biggest challenges that any technology company has. We're doing really well 
against the hiring goals that we have. But I mean there was
 
a systemic issue 
where our country doesn't produce the volume of engineers that the 
companies would want to hire. And I think that that's a lot of what you hear 
these companies talking about. We're doing really well competitively right 
now. We have a real
ly strong program on colleges where we can continue to 
attract a lot of best people who are graduating. We do really well at hiring 
senior engineers from across the valley as well. But it's just something that 
we invest a huge amount of time and it's reall
y important.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
In terms of where we're growing by category; I've mentioned CPG, gaming, 
retail, these are vertical categories where we're strong. But again we're 
growing. We're growing; we're watching people really experiment. One of 
the thin
gs that's been really fun to see even though it's not a pay product is 
GE is Instagram work. GE is doing super interesting photos on Instagram 
which show us that other industries are also going to adapt to the social 
environment and to some of the new ways
 
to reach customers globally.

Hi, there. Great numbers, you guys. Congratulations. Two questions. One 
on, could you guys clarify 
the custom advertising bucket? I know you said it 
was up 100% year
-
over
-
year or quarter
-
over
-
quarter and a lot of the brands 
are talking about this as a key growth area. So I'm really interested in how 
big it's starting for you guys? And then my second que
stion is we're also 
talking to a lot of companies that target your metrics using UTI integrations 
and would that create an arbitrage I'm wondering if over time you foresee 
that being a stable ecosystem or are you guys going to try to ease those 
guys out ov
er time and grab some of that upside that these arbitragers that 
are using our platform are garnering today? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On the first, Custom Audiences is small but growing and important. We 
doubled what I said as we doubled the number of marke
ters using the 
product Q2 over Q1, and that also has included getting us to 50 of the 
AdAge 100. As I've talked about as a large brand advertisers the AdAge from 
100 have a long sales cycle and it takes a lot of work that happened to 
adapt products and so 
seeing adoption this quickly of something, we think 
shows how powerful that targeting is. In terms of some of the more 

multiple sales channels. We like having a direct sales channel,
 
which we 
have in our 40 

 
over 40 offices. We like having online and robust sales, 

have the ability to sell into those markets. We also like having an eager 
system of what we call
 
PMDs, third
-
party sellers who can work with our 


like to see all of our sales channels continue to gro
w and thrive.

Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the numbers. Mark, longer term 
question 
focused on your initial comments, how have some of the recent products 
that are consumer facing that you guys have launched like Graph Search 
and Facebook Home sort of taught you what the consumer acceptance is for 
certain things, learnings about 
how the platform can be developed and 
evolved over time, would love to get your takeaways on that?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yeah. Well, I mean I think that there are bunch of different kinds of products 
that you can ship. I mean everyday we ship a lot of tweaks to 
the products, 
or small changes to existing products. Then there are going be to products 
like Instagram video, which is really doing well and it fits very naturally into 
the current flow of how people use Instagram to capture moments that 

 
So that makes sense. I think the team did a really good job 
there. The thing is like Home and Graph Search are really new used cases. I 

from anything that exist out there and I thin

planting that its going to create completely new pillar of the ecosystem 
rather than drafting off behavior that people already have in the system 
today. So, I definitely think that we just have to look at this over the long
-


 


And we expect these to become marketing 

 
market leading products and 

-
one
 
else really has, the strategic position or 

There is going to be longer term back. So I think if you wan to look at the 

y fit into the 

going to ramp up over time.

Mark Zuckerberg
 
Thanks, Deborah and thanks everyone for joining today. This has been a 
busy quarter at Facebook where
 
we planted the seeds to achieve our long
-
term goals with internet.org, our AI group and our efforts to build the 
knowledge economy. We continue to see strong overall engagement and are 
making good progress in our strategy, especially in mobile. This contr
ibutes 
to the result we have reported today. Strong revenue growth, strong growth 
in daily active and good growth in engagement, as our ratio of daily actives 
to monthly actives continues to grow.
 
We have also reached new milestones as a mobile company. No
w 49% of 
our revenue comes from mobile and 48% of the people use Facebook in any 
given day are only accessing it from mobile. That's almost half of the people 
only using Facebook from their phones, and it's a pretty incredible sign of 
how Facebook is evolv
ed over the last year.
 
On our last earnings call, I talked about our three big goals for the next 
phase of our company, connecting everyone, understanding the world and 
helping to build the knowledge economy.
 
Connecting everyone means giving everyone in th
e world the power to use 
the internet and stay connected to the peoples and things that matters 
them. Understanding the world means helping people not just share day
-
to
-
day updates, but also building up long
-
term knowledge about the world and 
being able to
 
answer questions for you that no other service can.
 
Building the knowledge economy is about helping people create growth in 
jobs and supporting a larger economic shift in the world based on 
information and ideas. This framework can tell off things about o
ur progress 
as a company over the next few years, so it's useful way to look at our 
progress over this quarter as well. We'll start with connecting the world.
 
This quarter, we took an important step. In August, we launched 
internet.org, a global effort Sam
sung, Ericsson, QUALCOMM and other 
industry leaders to make affordable internet access available to everyone in 
the world.
 
Today, only about a third of the world's population is online and internet's is 
growing more slowly than you probably expect less tha
n 9% a year. We 
want to change that. Our mission has always been to connect the world and 
to us that means everyone. When the next 5 billion people have a chance to 
use these basic services and participate in the global economy, that's going 
to create huge
 
benefits for everyone in the world.
 
By working together on technology and new business models, we think we 
can help accelerate the process of connecting everyone. We believe we are 
in a unique place to help encourage broader growth of the Internet, becaus
e 
so much of what people do on the Internet is Facebook.
 
According to comScore, around 20% of the time that people spend in apps in 
the U.S. alone is in Facebook services when you a lot of people in developing 
countries what service they care about using m
ost, the answer is often 
Facebook.
 
We are already trying to make access to Facebook cheaper. All the same 
tools of innovation that we are developing to do this can be applied to other 
basic Internet services as well, but messaging, search, whether and 
Wiki
pedia to make those services cheaper or free to deliver.
 
We also recently acquired Onavo, business team that builds world
-
class data 
compression technology in mobile analytics and they will play an important 
role in helping us build more efficient technolo
gies and services that use less 
data. Of course no single company can do this alone and we are working 
closely with our partners to develop our future plans. It's still very early for 
internet.org and we will have more to say in the months ahead, but I am 
very excited about this effort and I am grateful to our partners for being a 
part of it.
 
Next, let's talk about understanding the world. What I mean by this is that 
everyday people post billions of pieces of content and connections into the 
graph. In doing
 
this, they are helping to build the clearest models of 
everything there is to know in the world.
 
A big part of why this works is that people can share things with any 
audience they want. They don't have to share publicly with everyone at the 
time. they ca
n share with just their friends, so this means that the model 
the world that people are building our systems include things that people 
only want to share with just a few people. This has the potential to be really 
powerful, but right now we have to do ver
y little to utilize the knowledge 
that people have shared to benefit everyone in our community.
 
The service we invest in the most news feeds, which gives you a great sense 
of what's going on with your community today. The news feed has proved 
itself incred
ibly useful for people and the most used app on peoples scoring 
by far, but this is just the start of what's possible.
 
When we get to the point, where everyone can easily ask any question to 
Facebook and get it answered by our community. That's going to be
 
very 
powerful.
 
In the last quarter, there had been several important evolutions in our 
strategy of understanding the world. The first is around Graph Search. At the 
beginning of this year, we announced the first beta version of the service on 
desktop and 
that indexed more than 1 trillion connections between people in 
this segment.
 
In the last quarter, we started testing what we call host search allows you to 
search all the unstructured text and posts that people have ever made on 
Facebook. About 1.2 trilli
on more posts. The folks on the team who have 
worked on web search engines in the past tell me that the Graph Search 
corpus is bigger than any other web search index out there. It's still early for 
Graph Search, because it's still in beta, only in English 
and we haven't 
launched our mobile version yet, but it's something I am really excited 
about.
 
Another evolution in our progress to understand the world is around our 
efforts to building mobile apps. Our goal has always been to help people 
share anything th
ey want with anyone they want. Historically, we have done 
this by building a lot of features into the core Facebook app, but we also 
have a few separate apps that are widely used like Instagram and 
messenger, our standalone messaging app. These are each la
rge services 
that help people share in different ways Instagram enables more than 150 
monthly actives to share beautiful photos also more publicly than people 
would want to share on Facebook.
 
Messenger is part of how people spend billions of private one
-
to
-
one and 
group messages every day and with the latest release of the app yesterday, 
we are continuing to add features and make this a better experience. In the 
future, we expect to develop more services help people share different 
content with different gr
oups of people and we will continue to build up 
messenger as better distinct messaging experience.
 
There is one more evolution in our strategy to understand the world that I 
want to mention. In September, we formed the Facebook AI Group to do 
world
-
class artificial intelligence research using all the knowledge that people 
have shared on Facebook. The goal here is to use new approaches in AI to 
help make sense of all the content that people share so we can generate 
new insights about the world t
o answer people's questions.
 
We started assembling a team of some of the best people in the field to work 
on these problems. We also announced the acquisition of Mobile 
Technologies, a speech recognition and machine translation company that 
will help expan
d our work in the field beyond just photo recognition to voice. 
Over time, I think it is going to be possible to build services that are much 
more natural to interact with and can help solving many more problems than 
any existing technologies today. I am e
xcited that we are working on this 
problem and I am looking forward to doing a lot more here.
 
Finally, let's talk about the progress we have made towards building the 
knowledge economy. The key to building the knowledge economy is building 
tools for everyo
ne to use information to do their jobs better. So in addition 
to connecting everyone and understanding the world, we are also focused on 
building new services for businesses as a way to accelerate the growth of 
this new economy.
 
The way businesses will exp
erience this effort is that we will keep building 
better services for them to reach their customers with higher quality ads, 
more efficient leads with better targeting, better analytics and using richer 
formats. The way people will experience this effort i
s that the ads they see 
will become more and more relevant to their lives.
 
Last quarter, I started talking about how our approach going forward would 
be to grow our business through improving the quality of our ads rather than 
by just increasing the quanti
ty. This quarter we have continue to do this. 
And the results show our approach is working.
 
We have been able to deliver better content and grow business for our 
customers and ourselves. We are planning that a lot more people are finding 
their ads useful a
nd engaging with them and the average daily actives is 
engaging with more than ad per week.
 
Most people probably wouldn't expect to engage with ads that often, so I 
think it's a great time that people are finding ads useful and they are adding 
value to the
 
experience on Facebook. I think there is still a lot of room to 
improve the quality of our ads and grow our business over time. So this is 
something that we are going to keep on investing in going forward.
 
So that's my update on how we are thinking about 
the next big changes we 
want to make in the world. Connecting everyone, understanding the world 
and building the knowledge economy. We have made a lot of progress this 
quarter and I want to take a moment to thank everyone who works with our 
company and eve
ryone who is a part of our community for all the efforts 
that make Facebook great.
 
Looking ahead, you can expect us to keep preparing for the future, even as 
we keep on building momentum today. As I said in our original S
-
1 filing, we 
don't build services 
to make money, we make money to build better 
services. This approach has served people who use Facebook, marketers and 
our entire Facebook community well. It's a different way of looking at the 
world but its how we are going to keep succeeding as a company

Thank you for being with us today and now I am going to hand it over to 
Sheryl.

Thanks, Mark. We continue to see strong growth in our ads business, 
especially mobile. Q3 total ad revenue grew 66% year
-
over
-
year to $1.8 
billion and mobile 
ad revenue grew to 49% of our total ad revenue. This is a 
remarkable milestone in a short time since we initiated mobile newsfeed ads 
just last year. Similar to last quarter, our performance is very broad based 
with strong growth across all geographies and
 
types of marketers. At the 
same time, our overall user engagement metrics remained strong. We think 
this validates the careful approach we are taking to the building our ads 
business.
 
I would like to highlight some of the key drivers of our performance th
is 
quarter. These are, to a large degree, the results of investments we have 
made over the past few years and they will continue to be our priorities 
going forward. The first driver is the continued growth of mobile 
engagement around the world. In 2013, fo
r the very first time, people will 
spend more time with digital media than watching TV. Emarketer estimates 
more than 5.25 hours a day on digital services including mobile compared 
with 4.5 hours watching TV in the U.S.
 
Facebook is well
-
positioned to benef
it from this shift. In the United States, 
Facebook including Instagram, just one in eight minutes people spend on the 
desktop, but one in five minutes on mobile. According to comScore, 
Facebook and Instagram have more mobile time spent than many of the 
nex
t largest services including YouTube, Pandora, Yahoo, Twitter, Pinterest, 
Tumblr, AOL, Snapchat and LinkedIn combined. Along with this engagement, 
we believe that we have the best mobile ad product with ads that are 
integrated unit into newsfeed for people
 
who spend the most of their time on 
Facebook.
 
As people shift where they spend their time, marketers are starting to 
follow. Our results today show that we are benefiting from this shift to 
mobile and we believe this shift will continue and will continue 
to benefit us. 
Today, mobile represents 12% of consumer media time, but it's still only 3% 
of ad budget. The second driver of our performance is an increasing number 
of marketers spending their ad dollars on Facebook.
 
From brand to direct response, to loca
l businesses to developers, more 
marketers are advertising on Facebook, because they recognize that our ads 
work to drive sales. This growth is taking place globally. In the third quarter, 
the number of Facebook advertisers in EMEA, nearly equaled the numb
er in 
North America, reflecting global growth in our online advertising.
 
The third driver of our growth is product development. We are working in a 
number of areas to make the ad people see on Facebook better. More 
targeted ads are better and we are improv
ing our ad targeting to increase 
relevance. We are investing in features like custom audience and partner 
categories to improve targeted. These are great tools that are still in their 
early days and we will continue to invest.
 
We also want to make it easie
r for marketers of all sizes to buy ads and 
measure their impact. In late September, we rolled out ad format changes, 
make ad a bit more consistent across Facebook and we reduced the number 
of ad units marketers have to choose from to reduce complexity. Th
en 
earlier this month, we rolled out a full redesign of our ad buying tools to 
simplify the ads creation process. Advertisers now select from one of eight 
business objectives such as website conversion are [often].
 
We think these product investments make i
t easier for marketers to achieve 
their goals. We are also expanding our products for developers. We already 
have launched mobile app install ads and these are going very well and we 
now launched mobile app install ads for engagement. These ads help 
develo
pers and businesses reach people that have already installed their 
apps and direct them back to increased engagement. We believe these apps 
are a nice complement to our install ads and represent a unique opportunity.
 
We also continued to invest in helping 
brands stay with our campaigns and 
increase same
-
store sales. We recently launched Outcome Measurement for 
the telecommunications industry. An initial test showed that more than 90% 
of people who made a purchase after viewing a Facebook ad have never 
click
ed on that ad. This shows that impressions matter and focusing only on 
clicks does not tell the whole story.
 
Similarly, a recent study by (Inaudible), one of our leading preferred market 
developer partners proves this point. The (Inaudible) study found tha
t 
marketers who use the multi
-
touch attributions to measure campaign ROI 
credited 12% to 13% more value from Facebook than marketers to use off
-
click attributions, but we still have work to do. Brand marketers aren't 
moving as quickly as we would like and 
we believe measurement is key to 
influencing the app advertisers.
 
Another important trend influencing our growth is our preferred marketing 
developer of PMD program. Over the past few years, we have invested in 
building an ecosystem that supports all types
 
of marketers and PMD has 
helped those marketers advertise effectively with us. Today, this program is 
a community of hundreds of technology and service companies spread 
across more than 45 countries.
 
In summary, we think our strong performance this quarte
r further validates 
that our ads strategy is working. Marketers are responding favorably as we 
heard during ad week in New York. Our messages around reach, targeting 
and measurements are resonating and will continue to reinforce them. Our 
ads are getting b
etter and we still have a long way to go.
 
Moving forward, our focus remains the same, continuing to capitalize on a 
shift to mobile, increasing the number of marketers who advertise with us 
and continuing to invest in our ad products. We believe that we ar
e in the 
early stages of a major transitioning and advertising and we are uniquely 
positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. Now, David.

Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon everyone. Q3 was a strong quarter for 
us in terms of our financia
l results. Our business grew rapidly around the 
world and we are pleased with our performance across our key financial 
metrics highlighted by the fact that Q3 was our first $2 billion quarter in 
terms of revenue. Let's start with the size and engagement of
 
the Facebook 
community, which continues to grow. 728 million people used Facebook on 
an average day in September, up 25% from last year, continues to be driven 
by mobile.
 
In Q3 for the first time, daily access on web declined year
-
over
-
year, albeit 
very m
odestly. Daily users represented 61% of the 1.19 billion people who 
accessed Facebook during the month of September and our overall 
engagement data remains strong. Also as we announced in September, 
Instagram now is over 150 million monthly actives.
 
I want
 
to say a few words about used engagement on Facebook. As we have 
said previously, this is a hard issue for us to measure, because self
-
reported 
age data is unreliable for younger users. So we have developed other 
analytical methods to help us estimate usa
ge by age.
 
Our best synopsis on youth engagement in the U.S. reveals that usage of 
Facebook among U.S. teens overall was stable from Q2 to Q3. So we did see 
a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens.
 
We won't typically call out such 
granular data, especially when it's of 
questionable statistical significance given the lack of precision of our age 
estimates for younger users. But we wanted to share this with you now since 
we get a lot of questions about teens.
 
We are pleased that we re
main close to fully penetrated among teens in the 
U.S., our monthly user numbers remain steady and overall engagement on 
Facebook remains strong. We will continue to focus our development efforts 
to build products that drive engagement for people of all ag
es.
 
Turning to the financials. Total revenue in Q3 was $2 billion, up 60% and ad 
revenue was $1.8 billion, up 66%. Exchange rates had no meaningful 
impact. Revenue growth was strong around the world with each of the four 
geographic regions we report on gro
wing by more than 50% versus last 
year.
 
The primary drivers of ad revenue growth were an increase in the number of 
and the strong performance of newsfeed ads and an increase in the number 
of marketers using Facebook and increased demand in our system. In Q
3, 
overall ad impressions were up 16% and the average price per ad was up 
42% compared to last year.
 
The growth in ad impressions was primarily due to market where using our 
service combined with the impact of a price floor reduction late in the third 
quar
ter last year. The growth in price per ad was primarily due to the 
increase in news feed ads. In the U.S. and Canada, where last year's price 
floor change had a smaller impact, ad impressions decreased 8% and 
average price per ad increased over 60% compare
d to last year.
 
The decrease in ad impressions despite an increase in the number of users in 
the U.S. and Canada was due to the continued migration of usage to mobile 
devices where we show fewer ads per person compared to web. The greater 
than 60% increase
 
in average price per ad in the U.S. and Canada was 
primarily due to the increase in the number of news feed ads shown on both 
mobile and web.
 
Due to their high engagement levels, news feed ads have a significantly 
higher price per ad than right hand colum
n ads. Therefore the mix shift of 
our ads towards the higher percentage being in news feed versus right hand 
column is driving up our average price per ad.
 
Mobile ad revenue in Q3 was approximately 49% of our ad revenue, up from 
41% in Q2. The sequential q
uarterly growth of mobile ad revenue was due 
to three factors. An increase in the average price per mobile ad, an increase 
in the number of mobile users and an increase in ads shown per mobile user.
 
Looking now at web. Ad revenue from web usage decreased b
oth 
sequentially and year
-
over
-
year. Web ad revenue includes both news feed 
ads on web and right hand column ads on web. Revenue from news feed ads 
on web increased significantly in Q3, sequentially and year
-
over
-
year, driven 
largely by an increase in the 
number of news feed ads per web user. The 
increase was not enough to offset the revenue decline from right hand 
column ads.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was up 24% year
-
over
-
year to $218 
million and roughly flat sequentially. Payments revenue from
 
games was up 
18% from last year. So we believe 12% represents the best apples
-
to
-
apples comparisons adjusting for accounting items such as the change in 
revenue recognition timing from late last year. Overall ARPU of $1.72 per 
user was up 33% compared to 
last year. We saw 43% increase in the U.S. 
and Canada and greater than 40% gains in each of the other three regions 
we report on.
 
Turning now to expenses. In Q3, our total GAAP expenses were $1.28 
billion. On a non
-
GAAP basis, excluding stock compensation,
 
total expenses 
increased 40% to $1.03 billion, driven by higher headcount and 
infrastructure spend. We ended Q3 with just under 5,800 employees, up 
34% from last year and we continue to be pleased with our success in 
attracting talent.
 
Our Q3 GAAP operati
ng income was $736 million, representing a 37% 
operating margin up from 30% last year. And on a non
-
GAAP basis, 
operating income was $987 million, a 49% margin, up from 42% last year.
 
Our GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates for Q3 were 41% and 36% respectively. 
GA
AP net income was $425 million or $0.17 per share. Non
-
GAAP net 
income was $621 million or $0.25 per share, up around 100% from last 
year. In Q3, we spent $284 million on CapEx and free cash flow was $666 
million.
 
Looking at our balance sheet, we ended Q3 
with $9.3 billion in cash and 
investments. During the third quarter, we repaid our $1.5 billion term loan 
and replaced it with a new $6.5 billion line of credit, which is currently 
undrawn.
 
We will continue to manage our balance sheet to meet our liquidity
 
needs, 
protect the business against risk and provide us with flexibility to invest in 
new opportunities to grow the business.
 
Now let's look forward. We continue to believe that improving the quality 
and relevance of news feed ads provides us with a big l
ong
-
term 
opportunity, however as we think about the future, we do not expect to 
significantly increase ads as a percentage of news feed stories beyond where 
we were at the end of Q3. This is important because increasing ads in news 
feed has been a meaningf
ul driver of our revenue growth in 2013, so this 
should be factored into your expectations for next year.
 
Turning to payments revenue. Remember that in the fourth quarter of 2012, 
we recognized revenue from four months of payments transactions, so for 
that
 
reasons we expect payments revenue will be down this coming Q4 
compared to last year.
 
Looking at expenses, we now expect that our 2013 total non
-
GAAP 
expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock compensation will 
likely grow around 45%. In term
s of our tax rate, we expect that our Q4 and 
full year non
-
GAAP tax rates will be a few percentage points higher than our 
Q3 rates.
 
Finally, we expect our 2013 CapEx to be in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion. 
This is down from our prior estimate of $1.6 bi
llion due to a combination of 
efficiency gains and changes in the timing of our planned purchases.
 
To sum up, in Q3 we make great process against our key financial 
objectives, growing revenue, investing for growth and positioning the 
company to maximize lo
ng
-
term returns for our shareholders and we remain 
excited about the opportunities ahead.
 
Now, we are ready to open the call for questions.

Thank you for taking the question. I just had two one for Mark, and then one 
for Sheryl or David.
 
Mark, the first one and a
s Facebook, value proposition is connecting the 
world, how should we expect Facebook in the future to more specifically 
leverage [geo] location, data of advertisers, to mobile ads even more useful 
for your users? Over what timeframe should we expect that t
o kind of play 
out in your mind?
 
Then the second question for Sheryl or David would just be, you talked 
about brand advertisers taking a little bit more time, I think, than you would 
have liked spent than you might have liked. Just wondering if you 
could help 
us there with that higher mix between DR and brand advertisers as kind of 
played out over the course of the year, if you could just give us some rough 
ideas. Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
The way we think, I'll take this actually. The way we think 
about using 
location data is that every time we use data, we use it in accordance with 
the privacy controls we offer people and we are working hard at making our 
ads better targeted. Over time, I think you will see the industry continue to 
evolve to get be
tter at targeting more ads. We certainly see it as a 
significant upside for us to get better at targeting more ads, not just from 
geo
-
location data but from all kinds of different data we get based on what 
users do with our service.
 
On brand advertisers, w
e don't breakout the different marketer segments. 
Our results this quarter are based on growth in all marketer segments, 
including brand and we continue to make progress. We have every one of 
the AdAge Global 100 have advertised with us over the past year.
 
My 
comment was based on the fact that marketing spend is just not keeping 
pace with the transition to time on line in mobile in that segment of the 
market. Since that segment of the market is so big, helping that transition 
happen present significant upsi
de for us.
 
Our focus there is measurement. We have to show brand marketers that our 
ads drives in
-
store
-
sales and we work on that, we work on that client
-
by
-
client to share a few examples from this quarter Cadbury in the U.K. works 
with us to sell their cr
eam egg product kind of find the table for Halloween to 
talk about candy to 16 to 24 year old. They used Facebook media for user 
generated post along with TV, they reached 15 million people, 21% of those 
people they only reached on Facebook not TV and the 
combined impact of 
TV and Facebook where sales were up 9%.
 
Another example because it shows how we can move awareness is the Alfa 
Romeo 4c launched in Portugal, (inaudible) where a person could do a test 
drive with a Formula One driver and they got the hig
hest buzz they have 
ever had in Google Trends for a product launch.
 
So as we think it's a big opportunity ahead of us and you have to work on 
these clients, account
-
by
-
account, client
-
by
-
client. But we think as the shift 
to mobile and digital happens, it's
 
a big opportunity and we are focused on 
helping that shift happen.

Hi, thanks. Sheryl mentioned some of the tools that have been added
 
to 
make it easier for advertisers to access and use the ad platform. One 
example was the objective
-
based ad buying. I was just wondering how much 
you would attribute reduction in friction, like the examples that were 
referenced on the call, leading to dir
ect and immediate increases in flow of 
ad dollars versus being more gradual in nature?
 
Then secondly, for Mark. Mark, the concept of the knowledge economy. I 
was just wondering, how you envision what the consumer will be doing on 
the site five years from n
ow? If today is more about and sharing and sharing 
is more developed than search and production integrations, how do you 
think about that relationship between those three activities on the site over 
a five
-
ish year time horizon? Thanks
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On t
he first. Our growth overall is based on the strong performance of news 
feed ads, an increase in the number of news feed ads per user and also 
more marketers. The simplification of products has actually been very 
important in attracting new marketers. If y
ou look at the new advertisers we 
acquired in Q3, 62% of them started with either promoted posts or 
promoted page likes which are the most simple of our advertising formats.
 
So we are continuing to rollout very simple ways to become an advertiser is 
drivin
g our growth and we will continue to. The larger question you asked 
was based on our focus of business objectives and that's actually really a big 
deal for us. We are now getting to the point where our ad product supports 
really helping marketers achieve t
heir core business objectives.
 
So before, people use to buy via the product, what product do you want to 
buy. And now they are buying from, I would say, identifying, I want to get 
mobile app installed. I want to get mobile engagement. I want to get 
website
 
conversions.
 
I think the fact that we are pivoting to focus on those end business results 
and making everything else including social a part of meeting those business 
results is a really important part of our strategy. It's driving our growth and 
I think 
it's going to continue to.
 
Operator
 
The next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Sorry, operator, can we just go back to the second half of that question.
 
David Ebersman
 
Yes. I just want to answer the part of question about the pr
oduct experience 
over time. I know there are two pieces of this that we are thinking about 
related to the knowledge economy. The first is just helping our customers 
use information better to grow their businesses and create jobs. Right.
 
So we are thinking 
about small businesses and making it so they can have 
better insights into who their customers are and better ability to reach them. 
Now developers have been able to use better analytics for being able to find 
new customers as well. And those are a lot of 
the inspiration and the 
strategy behind the ad products that we are delivering.
 
On the side of the product experiences that we are creating for people who 
use Facebook, right now I do think that the Facebook experience is very 
push based, in that you go to
 
Facebook and we are suggesting content to 
you through something like news feed. Overtime, I think, if we do a good 
job, we should be able to create more value through all of the knowledge 
that has been shared over time that we are not really surfacing on 
a day
-
to
-
day basis right now in terms of helping people answer a lot of different 
questions that they have around the world.
 
That's kind of the direction that we are starting to go in with Graph Search 
and a few other areas as well. But it's pretty early. 
So I think around a five 
year time frame like you are saying, hopefully we will make very significant 
progress towards going in that direction.

Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one for Sheryl and then 
David. It seems like a year and half ago around the time of the IPO, the 
company was very focused on top of the funnel brand related 
advertising. 
But over the last year or so, it's been much more around direct response but 
certainly get the sense that on the top of the funnel brand is starting to 
move in a more meaningful way. What is the company doing and what are 
some of the main proj
ects that you are working on that you think will really 
start to move to dial on the top of the funnel segment of the market. What 
role does video maybe play into that?
 
Then for David regarding the ad load comment had ad load not increased in 
North America
, give us a sense of what the ad revenue growth would have 
been if you normalize for that? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Top of the funnel ads remain really important to us. Again, our growth this 
quarter was a very broad based, including top of the funnel ads. 
The reason 
they are important is that Facebook is such a unique and powerful discovery 
place. When you are on Facebook, you are open to discover, you are open to 
getting messages and that's what we are seeing with news feed messages 
from friends and with u
s as well.
 
The key for us is measurement, the way we are really going to make 
progress is better measurement. It's easier to understand and measure a 
click that goes to return online sales. It's harder to measure how you 
-
 
household that see ads and don't 
see ads change their purchase behavior in 
stores
 
The thing I think we have done a lot over the last year and we are 
continuing to do that to put those measurements in place, so I talked on in 
my opening remarks about measurement of telecom. We have also do
ne a 
ton of work around CPG, so that we can look at households that saw an ad, 
households that didn't see in an ad and what their difference is.
 
Just to share one more example, (Inaudible) did a promotion with us for the 
(Inaudible) in the U.S. They were t
argeting 35 to 43 seen ads in months, 
because we were able to do this type of measurement that we could have a 
year ago, we were able to show that they get side extra turn on their ad 
spend. We measured household spending who saw their ads versus 
household
 
who didn't saw their ads and there was a 9% difference.
 
They were also able to tell that a lot of those 9% was driven by new buyers 
of their products, which is what they want, so I do think we have a big 
opportunity, I do think the brands are going to con
tinue to need to be 
convinced account
-
by
-
account, but this moves products off shelf and that's 
what we are doing.
 
David Ebersman
 
Mark, thanks for your question. This is David. Truly not possible to tease out 
individual contributions because the way the auc
tion works, everything is 
dependent, so if we have fewer ads that's going to play out with different 
pricing and other sorts of things, so I can give you sort of our gut feel for it, 
but I can't quantify precisely.
 
If you look at overall ad revenue growth 
for example on that third quarter 
compared to the second quarter, there is probably three factors that are 
contributed materially that are important to understand. One is just growth 
in users. Second is growth in demand, which plays out into pricing. Then 
the 
third is an increase in the number of ads that we showed in news feed per 
users.
 
I would probably order the ad load, probably third of the straight relative to 
the sequential growth. I think it plays out a little bit differently on mobile 
versus web. O
n mobile, we really increased the number of ads as a 
percentage of the overall mobile experience quite modestly in the third 
quarter versus the second quarter.
 
On web, the increase in the number of ads or the percentage of ads in the 
web news feed experien
ce went up more significantly than mobile did in the 
third quarter versus the second.

Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask
 
you about two 
things. First on video, can you talk about what you have learned from the 
recent launch of video on Instagram and how that may have shaped your 
thinking on rolling out video ads on Facebook?
 
Then secondly, just following
-
up on the ad volume,
 
just to clarify when you 
are saying the ad volume won't necessarily increase any more beyond where 
it was at the end of Q3. Is that on average or in the more penetrated 
markets? Then can you comment relative to the 5% of stories in the news 
feed that you 
mentioned last quarter? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
The experience with video on Instagram has been very positive so far, right? 
I think that we proved that having a quick start auto play can be a good 
experience inline in the feed and that people really feel 
they are in and 
control they are experience. They can just grow if they don't like content. If 
it's good content then that can be really good, so we are heartened by that.
 
This is that important launch for Facebook overall, because the addition of 
video co
ntent to the stream could be one of the most positive things that we 
have done in a long time for making it more engaging, but if we do it 
quarterly then it could also be a negative thing and we are trying to take our 
time to make sure that we do this in a
 
very positive way and I am pretty 
confident that we will. But that's why you are seeing us take the process 
that we have on this.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Now I will add on videos ads. We do have a video ad product today, because 
any one can embed a video in page 
post. And we are actually seeing very 
good results, particularly around entertainment and media. This is driving 
some of our ad spend. And the area remains pretty exciting because this is a 
very compelling way for marketers to tell their story.
 
David Ebers
man
 
So I thought you asked what we mean when we say ad volume won't 
increase. So the first thing I would say is, I would frame that in the context 
as a percentage of the user experience. Obviously, if we can drive more 
engagement that provides more opportu
nity for us to show more ads. In 
general, I think your question referenced whether this was geographic.
 
The ad load in news feed is reasonably consistent across the world. It's a 
little bit less in the least developed markets because we have less 
advertiser 
there. But it's not different grossly different. So I think that comment holds 
generally across most of the markets where we make our advertising 
dollars.
 
In terms of relative to the 5%. So what we said last quarter was that, of the 
total volume
 
of stories in news feed, about 5% of those were ads. As I said 
on the last question, the mobile piece of that didn't change very 
substantially in the third quarter versus the second. The web percentage did 
go up. So if you mix those two together, the Q3 n
umber would be modestly 
higher than the 5% number from Q2.

Great, thanks. Two question. First, David, could you just give us some color 
or why the reduction in the OpEx growth for this year? Were there certain 
investment projects you decided to cut? 
And what were those and why?
 
Then secondly. Mark, this kind of five year vision of moving towards, going 
from push base to pull based, that opens up a lot of opportunities. I mean 
that's been kind of the sauce maybe behind Google and it's an interesting 
pa
rt of Twitter, et cetera. But could you talk about the challenges in order to 
get there, and maybe both in terms of user experience the advertiser 
opportunity, how difficult and substantial the technology challenges are to 
get there? It's a very different 
direction and there is lot of opportunity but

Hi, Mark. In terms of OpEx growth, so we are continuing to invest 
aggressively in the business with particular emphasis on technical hiring and 
bui
lding out our infrastructure. At the same time, we are trying to do this in 
a disciplined fashion making sure that all the investments we make and the 
dollars we spend are spent wisely in terms of furthering our mission and 
creating returns for the company
.
 
I am really quite pleased with how things are going in that regard in 2013. 
From an R&D standpoint, we are really on track for anything ahead of what 
we expected to be in terms of hiring and spend. And that's surely the most 
important area for us in term
s of investing to drive future growth.
 
In other areas of the business, such as cost of revenue, G&A, marketing and 
sales, I think we are ramping up spend less than we anticipated for a couple 
of reasons. One is better success than we expected in some of th
e efficiency 
projects that are helping to keep the company small, even as revenue ramps 
up. A second reason is, some slower than expected ramp up in both hiring in 
new projects. And then the third contributing factor is just we have in the 
budget some expe
ctations for the unplanned stuff that comes along that can 
drive spend, like an asset acquisition or something like that and we really 
haven't spent this much money as we have expected in the unplanned 
areas.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, and to your question about
 
on how do we make the knowledge that's 
been shared in Facebook more useful. The first thing we needed to do is just 
index it all and build the infrastructure to start being able to use it in 
different ways. I mean the first data for Graph Search, we had i
ndexed to 
more than a trillion connections, friendship connections, group membership, 
like connections and then for post search, we indexed more than a trillion of 
the post that people that people have put into the system.
 
The basic insight that we think w
e are operating on here, is that right now a 
lot of the behavior and engagement on Facebook is very day
-
to
-
day where 
you are sharing something and Facebook is the best place for you to share 
photos or events that's going on in your life and if you go to ne
ws feed and 
see what's going on with the people around you.
 
What has happened is that, over the past almost 10 years of this behavior, 
this amazing base of knowledge has been build up, but there is trillions of 
pieces of content and information that now we
 
are just trying to find 
different ways to expose and basically make that more useful to people 
instead of just the stuff that's been shared in the last day or so.
 
Graph Search is one way that you can see that coming to light in terms of 
people being able 
to do directed queries for different types of content. There 
are other kind of services that we think we can build as well that just a few 
people more utility from the corpus of knowledge that's been built out and 
that's going to be a big focus for us over
 
the next few years.

Mark, after a successful revenue year, you kind of start next year with a

bitions in your prepared 
remarks about access and improving search. Just maybe you remind us how 
you think about driving profit growth as you look at the company relative to 
kind of your long

term objectives for the company. Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Well
. I mean, we care a lot about that. In terms of the shareholder value 
that we are generating as well. I think in the recent results and what I said 
at the end of my remarks there was that, we are going to keep on planting 
seeds for our future growth while 
continuing to build momentum now and I 
know that's a philosophy that we have taken in term of building the 
company. We generally wanted to be profitable as such, but I don't think we 
are going to commit or have any specific guidance on this right now.

Thank you. Mark, can you talk a little bit more about how the knowledge in 
the Facebook graph compares with the knowledge in the 
overall web today 
qualitatively and quantitatively? Is there a plan to connect the worldwide 
web graph to the Facebook graph when you think the answer that you are 
going to give people into future?
 
Secondly, the graph regulation in the European Commission 
in Brazil at least 
may require internet companies such as Facebook to store all their data 
locally. What do you think will be the impact on Facebook's CapEx and 
expenses if these regulations are indeed implemented? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. 
Sure. On your question about the graph of Facebook, the graph that 
people share on Facebook versus the web overall, I think they are pretty 
different. In terms of quantity, they are getting to a pretty comparable size, 
so engineers on the graph search team
s have told me folks who have 
worked on other web search engines before tell me that the scale of things 
like post search are as big or bigger than any web search index that's out 
there but they are they are just different used cases with different kinds o
f 
knowledge and people are going to use them for different things, so our 
approach with Graph Search is not to build something which is web search.
 
I mean, we think that companies have done that and they are doing a good 
job at that, but there is different
 
kinds of knowledge. Things that you want 
more opinion on from people that you trust that I think is kind of a late 
inside Facebook that we need to do a better job of servicing that, so that's 
going to be the focus on that.
 
I mean, over time, there are a l
ot of possibilities for things that we can do 
and I am not really ready to talk about a lot of them today, but you can kind 
of look at what we have launched in the couple of the Graph Search 
launches that we have done so far and we are pretty early in that
 
journey.
 
David Ebersman
 
Carlos, the second part of your question about draft legislation or discussion 
about companies needing to store data locally in various companies, it's an 
interesting question and definitely something we are tracking, but the 
answe
r is really going to depend on the details of what that looks like. It's 
very hard assess what kind of implication it would have for company like 
Facebook without understanding what we would need to do, so, we will 
continue to pay less attention to it, but
 
really hard to give anything in the 
way of the specific answer at this point.

Thanks. Can you give us some color 
on how many advertisers you guys 
ended the quarter? How that grew? And if there is a way to think about how 
many advertisers have claimed pages so we can get a sense of how deep the 
penetration is. Because it looks like you guys are more successful than ot
her 
companies and growing at a faster rate, particularly on the local penetration 
side? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So last quarter we reported that we had a million active advertisers and that 
number continues to grow and continues to grow healthily. We belie
ve, 
globally, we have 20 million small businesses, local businesses of some kind 
who have pages. So obviously just a fraction of those are advertisers.
 
And I think its one of the most exciting opportunities in front of Facebook. 
It's really hard to get sma
ll businesses to use technological products and 20 
million small businesses are using us and we haven't gone out and done 
aggressive sales efforts to make that happen.
 
Going from having a page that you are using for organic distribution to paid 
distributio
n, it's something we are very,
-
very focused on. It's why we rolled 
out these simple products. And I think our track record at doing that is good

David, sorry to beat a dead horse, but back to the ads per user comment. 
Can you give us some color on, I guess since you guys started the mobile 
news feed ads a year and change ago, how much CPC and click throu
gh rate 
improvement you have been able to drive? And should we think about it, 
going forward if mobile users are growing at 18% in the U.K., 20% in the 
U.S. and I think 60% for ROW, should we think about revenue growth as a 
slight premium to that but somew
hat co
-
related to that? Thanks.
 
David Ebersman
 
Sure, Ross. So I think if you look back over the last year, some of the 
metrics that I think have been most positive for us have been, as we have 
ramped from a very low volume, very few ads shown in news feeds
 
to larger 
numbers, what one could reasonably have expected given the way the 
auction dynamics work, is that the pricing would really come down as we 
were delivering more clicks and as we were I think deeper into the pool of 
the advertising demand.
 
And the
 
way pricing has really held up and click rates have held up and CPCs 
have held up, as we have progressed through this over the last year, I think 
has really validated our confidence that news feed ads were going to be 
really important product that could r
eally drive the performance of the 
business. So we remain really encouraged and pleased by that.
 
Going forward. Clearly, we will try to continue to grow the user base, as you 
described, and that's been an important part of our revenue growth since 
the comp
any started. And the other opportunity is for us is continue to 
improve the quality, the relevance and the performance of the ads and to 
drive up pricing by bringing more demand into our system. We are certainly 
doing a good job of that right now and we ha
ve got to continue to execute.

Eric Sheridan

UBS
 
Sure. Thanks, guys. Two quick questions. One, following up on the last one 
with respect to ROI around advertising products g
oing forward. I guess, 
maybe more for Sheryl, but how do you guys think about the dialogue 
between advertisers and yourself about ROI and how much of that fits with 
measurement and attribution tools that you guys would need to develop 
internally versus wha
t they need to think about in terms of the ROI on your 
properties versus other online and offline properties.
 
And second question on mobile app install ads. Question about the 
diversification of the advertiser base and how that sort of developed since 
the 
product has been launched? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So the first question, it's really both. In order to measure all the way from 
seeing a Facebook ad through to a purchase, particularly when that's offline. 
That takes work and tools on our side 
including the data systems and it also 
takes thinking about measurement on their side.
 
The industry overall is moving. We have been really pleased to see more 
embracing of multi
-
click over last step attribution. You can see that 
happening with a number of 
big players in the industry. The PMDs are really 
important here. The PMDs are good at helping people and helping marketers 
measure.
 
But really the developers' measurement system take our measurement, take 
industry measurements. Particularly for brand adver
tisers, they also take 
some rethinking of the ways they have measured ads and ads' performance 
before and we work very closely with our clients on that.
 
On mobile app install and mobile engagement ads, we are very focused on 
growing across the board. We wa
nt growth in all of our marketer segments 
and we want to grow that broadly across the world.
 
Developers are really interesting place for us, because we think not only do 
we have we think the best mobile ad product in general, because people 
spend a lot of 
their time in news feed. They spend more time in news feed 
than they spend on any other part of our service. That gives us an 
opportunity to sell ads broadly, but it also gives a great opportunity for 
developers, because the developers want people to do ha
ppen on their 
mobile phones and on their desktop.
 
Mobile app install ads have been very successful for us and they are 
interesting, because the mobile app install market didn't even exist a few 
years ago. I think the move to rollout engagement ads further 
deepens our 
relationship with developers and shows that we can help different users and 
then we can get those users to continuously use their products, so we are 
pretty excited about this part of market, because we think it can grow 
quickly and we think ou
r ad products and offerings are so unique.

Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. You introduced 
hashtags in June 
and I am just wondering if you could comment on usage 
trends. How strategically important hashtags are to index in the knowledge 
graph going forward and where their hashtags could become a meaningful 
part of an ad targeting opportunity in the future if usa
ge catches on in a 
significant way. Thank you
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
The launch of hashtags was more just following behavior that we see from 
people, right? All we really did was take hashtag that people are putting into 
the product and make them linked, so if yo
u could find other posts that have 
the same tag.
 
The effort that I think you are latching on to is basically we are putting some 
more effort now into both, public content on Facebook and more private 
content, right? As there are a bunch of different sets o
f people that a person 
will want to share with, one is all of their friends, but a lot of the sharing and 
the communication done is one
-
on
-
one in messaging or with small groups or 
with the communities.
 
Then there is a large set of content that's public, wh
ich is often very high 
quality content as well and we have efforts in all of those areas to make a 
set people can share all of those different kinds of contents on Facebook. 
That's going to be something that we are going to continue to do.

was wondering if you could speak to the to the traction and kind of anything 
user 
adoption of the early topical and interest trending that you have rolled 
out.
 
Last quarter you talked about strengthened e
-
commerce driving some of the 
advertising which kind of verticals would you speak to this quarter and as we 
are heading into the holid
ay season, you still see e
-
commerce as being a big 
driver again? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. You are asking about the effectiveness of some of the public content 
efforts that we have done. I think it's starting to do very well and we are 
very pleased with
 
it. Some of the questions that we have gotten has asked if 
this is an area that we have started focusing on recently, which actually it 
isn't something we have been working on for a while, but I think the 
question as a sign that the results are starting t
o be quite good and folks are 
starting to note it. The traffic that we are driving and the higher quality 
content that's public that people came for us on Facebook, so we are going 
to keep focusing on this.
 
It's not just about public content, it's about gi
ving people the power to share 
with every different audience that they want, weather it's most private one
-
on
-
one communication and tread up to the most public content that you 
want to get out for everyone in the world to be able to consume, down the 
road 
we are going to keep watching all of that.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
To your second question, direct response including e
-
commerce continues to 
perform well. We have high click
-
through competitive CPC, so we are 
attractive from marketers. When you think about vertic
als, I think we have 
very tremendous opportunity in basically all of them.
 
Things that are performing particularly well right now financial services, 
media and entertainment, e
-
commerce, professional services. But if you look 
to a vertical like auto, that 
we haven't historically been strong in, I think we 
are starting to make real inroads, client
-
by
-
client, like the Alfa Romeo case 
study I showed, because we had such a great opportunity to engage the 
people they want to reach.
 
Our targeting is also getting 
better. So with custom audiences and partner 
categories, we are able to identify, here the people you want to show your 
ads to who, we believe are in the market to buy a car, for example. And so 
the combination of the measurement work we are doing and the 
ability to 
target, I think means we have a strong play in every vertical.

Hi. I really wanted to ask you about the Instagram blog post that 
you put up 
the other week, where you stated specifically that, I think the quote from 
the blog was, you want ads to be creative and engaging, and that seems 
pretty different than most of the advertising that I have seen on Facebook, 
whether on mobile or on
 
the desktop. I wanted to ask you how do you think, 
or is it possible that if this strategy of advertising works well on Instagram, 
could we actually see a new form of advertising appear on Facebook 
sometime in 2014 or 2015.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So what we anno
unced last week is a small test with 10 advertisers to start 
showing ad in the Instagram feed. And we are excited about it because there 
is a lot of interest and a lot of excited brands. When you think about ads 
being exciting and engaging, I think we thin
k about two things. We think 
about ads that fit the format of the product that they are part of.
 
So the Instagram ads right now are the pictures and videos which are 
exactly what people post on Instagram. If you look at the progress we have 
made with our n
ews feed ads, those ads, those in the size, the shape. You 
know they got larger when they moved over from the right hand side, right 
hand column but they are also meant to be as exciting, as engaging as the 
content.
 
So our goal is, we want our ads to be as
 
good as the user shared content. 
Some of them are, a lot of them aren't. We have a lot of room to grow in 
improving that quality. But in terms of the excitement you will see or the 
interest, that is our goal. And we are just going to match the format of t
he 
products we are working with as we rollout ads.

Hi. Thanks for ta
king the question. I have taken notice of the number of 
businesses advertising. I was wondering if you could just quantify the 
number of new small businesses perhaps or number of advertisers going 
beyond that one million in the quarter? The reason I ask is
, I am trying to 
understand to what degree that maybe the shift is spending mix towards 
smaller business may have contributed to margin expansion. And maybe can 
talk about the margin profile that different segments of marketers bring to 
your business?
 
Sher
yl Sandberg
 
So we don't break out our business by marketer segment and we don't give 
margins by marketer segment. But to help answer you question, we have 
seeing strong growth across all of our marketer segment. All of them are 
growing brands, growing dire
ct response and E
-
commerce are growing, F&B 
and local businesses are growing, developers are growing.
 
We definitely think there is a big opportunity for those to grow same
-
store 
sales of our large clients, particularly with the shift that's happening from 
TV 
to digital and mobile. We think that there is a really exciting opportunity. We 
also think SMBs are a big opportunity for us and certainly in an advertiser 
base of over a million advertisers, the great majority of that is obviously the 
small to medium s
ized businesses.
 
We worked hard on our sales efforts, so that we have the right sales and 
support effort to meet our clients. We care about our margins. We certainly 
have simplified products such as we have rolled out over the last year, make 
it easier and
 
cheaper for SMBs to use our products. Easier for them and 
cheaper for us. And we will continue to focus on the automated tools that 
help.
 
I think the most important thing we have done on this goes back to an 
earlier question about focusing on marketer obj
ective. Before we were 
asking marketers to come in and choose what ad products they were buying. 
With our shift to focusing on marketer objectives, it's easier for everyone 
from largest to the smallest. You know, a small business owner can come in 
and say,
 
I want my app install or I want web conversions or I want web 
clicks and then we are doing the harder work of figuring out what products 
are there, figuring out which of those ads should have digital content, so 
that we can meet those objectives
 
I think t
hat move of moving more towards using their language and focusing 
on their business needs is a simpler product for them. It will help gain us 
more marketers and it helps us work with them in a more efficient way.

Mark Zuckerberg
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This was a great 
quarter and a great way to end the year. We saw strong growth in 

leased with the growth of 
our ad business, especially on mobile.
 
Overall, 2013 was an important year for us. If 2012 was the year we turned 
our core product into a mobile product, then 2013 was the year when we 
turned our business into a mobile business. I
 
expect 2014 will be the year 
when we begin to deliver new and engaging types of mobile experiences.
 
As of the end of the year, more than 1.23 billion people now use Facebook 
each month. Last quarter was our first quarter where more than 50% of our 
ad reve
nue came from mobile. Looking back at the year, we launched an 
important products and initiatives: internet.org, graph search, Instagram 
video, and Messenger 3.0. We also made a lot of improvements to the 
performance and reliability of all our mobile apps.
 
One important trend from the last year is the continued growth in size and 
engagement of our community. In 2013, we added 172 million monthly 
actives and 139 million daily actives. That means that our daily engagement 
continues to increase. In the latest 
quarter, more than 60% of our monthly 
actives visited Facebook daily.
 


December, we saw more than 6 billion likes. T

likes a year ago.
 
These trends show that our strategy of improving the quality of our core 

to focus on our longer term goals of connecting everyone,
 
understanding the 
world, and building the knowledge economy.
 
Connecting everyone is about bringing the internet to everyone and giving 
them the tools to stay connected with the people and things that matter to 
them. Today, more than 750 million people use
 
Facebook every day. While 


 
Only one

and for even many of those, the return o
n experience remains pretty weak. 
Helping more people get connected is important the developing the global 
knowledge economy. Once people are connected, they can access tools like 
basic financial services, health information, and education tools to help th
em 
take care of their families and join the worldwide economy.
 

industry leaders to make affordable internet access available to everyone in 


by deepening the relationships with mobile operators around the world and 
working to develop new models for internet access.
 

invested a lot in over the years,
 

excited to build on going forward. Connecting everyone ultimately means 
giving people the power to share different kinds of content with different 
groups of people.
 

rate mobile apps beyond 
the main Facebook app. Messenger and Instagram are examples of this. We 
launched a new version of Messenger to make the app even faster for mobile 
to mobile communications. Messenger was among the topmost downloaded 
apps on iOS and 

engagement since launching.
 
The number of people using Messenger grew more than 70% in the past 

sent. We have a lot more coming
 
to messenger in the first half of this year, 

 
Instagram also had a busy quarter, bringing Instagram to Windows Phone, 
launching our first ads, and launching Instagram Direct, the new way to 
send private phot
o and video messages.
 

team has taken an especially careful approach, working closely with a small 
number of brands that are already important members of the Instagram 
community to c
reate a great early experience.
 

using Facebook Groups every month. Groups is one of our core products, 
and it provides a private space for sharing with small groups like your 
family
, close friends, or a sports team, or for larger communities, like 
schools or even companies.
 
One theme that should be clear from our work on products like Messenger, 
Groups, and Instagram is that our vision for Facebook is to create a set of 
products that
 
help you share any kind of content you want within the 
audience you want.
 


growth we see is coming from gi
ving people the tools to share with different 
sized groups of people.
 
Now, moving on to our business, last quarter I talked about our efforts to 
grow our business through improving the quality of our ads rather than just 
increasing the quantity. Our goal i
s to reach a point where the ads are as 
relevant and timely as the content your friends share with you.
 

around our ads and seeing how people engage with them. We do some of 
the broades
t surveys in the world. We survey more than 35,000 people 

product development.
 
Our approach is working. In the second half of 2013, we saw an 
improvement in sentiment about ads on 
mobile, even as volume grew during 
that period. We also saw sentiment on desktop remain stable. Interestingly, 
even as the volume of newsfeed ads has grown, clickthrough rates have also 
remained stable.
 

st our strategy of 
improving quality is working. Our plan is to continue focusing on improving 
quality, since we think this is the best way for us to improve the experience 
for people on Facebook, returns for advertisers, and our own revenue, as 
well as ac
hieving our long term goal of providing ads that are as relevant as 
organic content.

past 10 years have simply been steps on the path to achieving our lo
ng term

of the same themes, but now with greater scale, ambition, and resources.
 
Finally, I just want to thank 
everyone who works at Facebook for a great 



.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. I am really excited to report earnings this 
quarter, and proud of the teams at Facebook who delivered these results.
 
We ended 2013 with a terrific quarter, continuing the strong momentum we 
saw throughout t
he year. Our total revenue grew 63% year over year, led 
by 76% growth in advertising revenue. Approximately 53% of our ad 
revenue came from mobile.
 
This is not only the first time we crossed the 50% threshold in mobile, but 

ar mobile quarter. In fact, our Q4 mobile ad 
revenue of $1.25 billion was nearly as large as our total ad revenue in Q4 of 
last year.
 
This growth continues to be very broad
-
based. The combination Mark spoke 
about of our growth in users and engagement and t
he effectiveness of our 
ads in newsfeed work together to provide marketers with a powerful way to 
reach people. This impact is evident in our results. This quarter, we saw 
healthy increases in every region around the world and positive momentum 
in all four
 
marketer segments.
 
There are three key drivers propelling our business. First and foremost is 
strong mobile engagement. Every day, more people around the world are 
spending more time on their mobile devices, and marketers are starting to 
shift their budge
ts to reach them.
 
This was especially clear during the holiday season, where not surprisingly, 
Black Friday was our single biggest mobile ad revenue day in the quarter. 



 
A recent study by Millward Brown Digital showed that while shopping in 
store, people who use Facebook do so at four times the rate of any other 
app or search. And for those people that use Facebook as a source before 
shopping, 
over half stated that it was a very influential source of information 
for them while they were shopping in the store.
 
The second driver of our ad business is a continued growth in the number of 
marketers using Facebook. Again, this growth is broad
-
based an
d diverse, 

of our four marketer segments.
 
Demand from direct response marketers was strong in the Q4 holiday 
shopping periods, particularly in ecommerce. These marketers focus on
 
short 

sales for them.
 
For example, online retailer NoMoreRack used Facebook to promote its 
holiday deals. They hit their aggressive ROI targets and they generated $8 
million d
ollars in revenue on Black Friday alone.
 

the industry have long considered the Holy Grail of online advertising, and a 

er.
 
In November, we reported that more than 25 million SMBs maintain an 

products over the last year, and that investment is working to convert these 
SMBs into advertisers. Of the ne
w SMB advertisers we acquired in Q4,72% 
started with our most simple ad product.
 
For developers, mobile apps are generating very healthy revenue growth. 
We launched mobile app [install] ads just over a year ago, and mobile app 
engagement ads last quarter, 
based on a very simple idea, that we can help 
people find and use great apps.
 

new customers and keep them engaged. We remain excited about the 
opportunities in this small but quick
ly growing category. In addition, last 
week we announced a small test to show Facebook ads in third
-
party mobile 

area for us to explore.
 

ith our brand marketers, 

in more dynamic ways, starting a small test of our new video ad product, 
and measuring our impact on their sales, which is super important to driving 
the
ir business.
 
The third driver for both the quarter and the full year has been our 


tools. Our goal, as Mark said, is t
o make our ads as useful as possible for 
consumers and to generate greater returns for marketers, eventually making 
all of our ads as valuable to users as our organic content.
 
Custom audiences is our most important product in this effort. When we 
launched 
it over a year ago, it allowed marketers to reach their current 

while maintaining user privacy.
 
These include lookalike targeting that lets marketers reach people who are 
similar to
 
their best customers and partner categories which use third
-
party 
data to improve our targeting. Now marketers can reach exactly the people 

market for a new car.
 

bled the number of partner categories in the U.S., and 

opportunity ahead, as we continue to improve our targeting capabilities.
 

e can 
measure the impact of our advertising on in
-
store sales. In December, we 
launched offline conversion measurement. To date, our results show that the 
average return on ad spend for newsfeed campaigns is 8x, a result that is 
really impressive when comp
ared to other returns marketers have available.
 
As Mark noted, this is the beginning of a new year, and our 10th 
anniversary, so I want to reflect really briefly on where our advertising 
business and we believe the marketing industry is headed. Before mass
 
media, all business was personal. Sales happened customer by customer at 
the local store or door to door. The evolution of mass media made it possible 
to sell at scale, but business was no longer personal.
 


platform that lets marketers personalize their messages at unprecedented 
scale. This is marketing where you are for who you are.
 
This shift to personalization represents the biggest shift in marketing in 

one that we are uniquely positioned to lead. Facebook 
is the only place where 750 million people visit every day, increasingly on 
mobile, to discover what matters to them. As we continue to leverage our 
understanding of people to make marketing more person
al, and do it at 
massive scale, we will dramatically improve the quality of ads and drive 
more personal discovery.
 
Facebook is making business personal again, and like Mark, I want to thank 
the teams that we get to work with every day at Facebook for doing
 
a great 

 
David Ebersman
 
Thanks, Sheryl. Overall, 2013 was a great year for Facebook. We performed 
well against all our key financial priorities, growing revenue to $7.9 billion, 
delivering ope
rating profit and free cash flow each of over $2.8 billion, and 
making investments that position the company for continued growth.
 


art with some user and 
engagement highlights. During the year, the population of people using 
Facebook on a daily basis increased by 139 million to 757 million, and the 
population of people using Facebook each month grew by 172 million to 1.23 
billion. In 
December, 62% of our monthly users used Facebook on an 
average day.
 
Mobile continues to drive our growth. When we began 2013, we had more 
daily users on desktop than mobile. By the end of this year, our daily users 
on mobile outnumbered desktop by around 2
00 million.
 

based on measures such as time spent per user and feedback per user. And 
none of these stats include Instagram, which doubled its user base over the 
past year. The netwo
rk of people who use our products remains the 


 
Turning now to the financials, in Q4, total revenue was $2.95 billion, up 
63%, and ad revenu
e was $2.34 billion, up 76%, for our highest year over 
year growth rate since mid
-
2011. Exchange rates had no meaningful impact. 
We continue to experience strong revenue growth around the world. Ad 
revenue in each of our four recorded geographic regions gr
ew by more than 
65% in Q4 compared to last year.
 
The key driver of ad revenue growth continued to be the strong performance 
of newsfeed ads on mobile and desktop, which helped us attract more 
advertiser demand. Mobile ad revenue increased from approximatel
y $881 
million in Q3 to approximately $1.25 billion in Q4, a healthy increase that of 
course benefited from seasonal effects.
 
In Q4, total ad impressions declined 8%, and the average effective price per 
ad was up 92% compared to last year. The decline in a
d impressions was 
primarily due to the shift in usage towards mobile devices, where people are 

ads on mobile.
 
The significant increase in average price per ad was driven by the mix shi
ft 
to more newsfeed ads that have much higher engagement and clickthrough 
rates, increasing the average effective price per ad impression. The price 
volume trends were pretty similar across our four geographies.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 
was $241 million, down 6% 
versus last year, remembering that in Q4 last year we recognized revenue 
from four months of payments transactions.
 
On a more apples
-
to
-
apples basis, payments revenue from games, which 
represents the substantial majority of our pa
yments and other fees revenue, 
grew approximately 8% in Q4 versus last year, despite the fact that our 
payments revenue from games is limited to our desktop users, a population 

 
Turning now to expenses, our Q4 GAAP expenses were $1.45 bill
ion, up 
37%, and non
-
GAAP expenses were $1.13 billion, up 33%. For the full year, 
our non

GAAP expenses were up 44%, driven largely by growth in 
infrastructure expense and a 37% increase in headcount over the year.
 

rd to stay disciplined in terms of 


achieved from many of our investments that we made in 2013, including 
those to
 
advance our ad products, improve mobile product quality, increase 
engagement, and drive efficiency improvements in our infrastructure.
 
Our Q4 GAAP operating income was $1.13 billion, representing a 44% 
operating margin, and our non
-
GAAP operating income w
as $1.46 billion, 
representing a 56% margin, up from 46% last year. As you know, margins 
are typically the strongest in the fourth quarter, given the seasonal strength 
in our advertising business.
 
Our GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates for Q4 were 54% and 46% res
pectively, 
and for the full year 2013, our GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates were 46% and 
41%. The tax rates in Q4 were higher than the rates for prior quarters of the 
year, primarily because of intercompany payments that occurred in Q4 
related to our internatio
nal operations. Also, at the end of 2013, we had a 
tax net operating loss, or NOL, carryforward of almost $8 billion.
 
In Q4, GAAP net income was $523 million, or $0.20 per share, and non
-
GAAP net income was $780 million, or $0.31 per share, up approximatel
y 
80% compared to last year. Capex was $483 million in Q4, and $1.37 billion 
for the full year.
 
Our efficiency investments, including the Open Compute project on the 
hardware side and proprietary work on the software side, have enabled us to 
significantly 
increase the amount of data and the number of users we can 
support with each server we buy, and these investments have saved us over 


 
without the success of these 
efficiency investments.
 
Our Q4 free cash flow was $748 million, and our full year free cash flow was 
$2.8 billion, including the benefit from a $419 million tax refund in Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year wit
h $11.4 billion in cash 
and investments. This number includes $1.5 billion from our secondary 
offering of 27 million shares in December at the time of our inclusion in the 
S&P 500 index.
 

re 
planning that our total 2014 GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue and 
including stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 35% to 40%, 
and non
-
GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock 
comp, will likely grow in the neighb
orhood of 40% to 45%.
 
We plan to invest with a continued emphasis on technical headcount and 
product development to take advantage of the opportunities we see to 
create new experiences and more value for our users, marketers, and 
developers.
 
On taxes, we e
xpect our GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates in 2014 to be 
roughly similar to our full year tax rates in 2013, although this could vary 
widely depending upon acquisitions, our international revenue and expense 
mix, and other factors.
 
Our tax rate in 2014 and over
 
the next several years will continue to reflect 

operations. Longer term, we expect our tax rate to be in line with peer 
companies who have similar operations and international revenu
e mixes.
 
We ended 2013 with 2.6 billion diluted shares outstanding, including the 
December stock offering, and we estimate that our diluted share count will 
increase roughly 2% to 2.5% by the end of 2014, although this may vary 
depending upon our stock pri
ce and new share issuances, for example to 
support M&A.
 
We anticipate our 2014 capex will increase to be in the range of $2 billion to 
$2.5 billion. The significant year over year growth will be driven by an 
expansion of our Menlo Park headquarters, infras
tructure
-
related expenses 
such as the buildout of our Iowa data center, and by our investment plans to 
support initiatives like internet.org that are designed to increase internet 

i
nvestments to improve capital efficiency.
 
Last, in terms of revenue, in 2014 we hope to build on our success from last 
year. 2013 strong growth in ads revenue was driven by the rapid ramp up of 
newsfeed ads, growth in users, engagement, and marketers using
 
Facebook, 
and by the product investments we made that improve the quality 
relevance, and performance of our ads.
 

advertising business and the mobile ad business in general. This mak
es for a 
difficult time to forecast near term revenues with any precision, but it also 

opportunity.
 
To sum up, Q4 was a strong end to a great year for Facebook. Thanks for

Mark Zuckerberg
 
And in terms of the focus on building new and separate experiences, our 
theory is that there are all these different ways that people want to share 
and communicate
. Almost any kind of content that you can imagine sharing: 
text, photos, videos, links, locations, events, games, any type of content,

on

one 
situation, or small groups, or with all of yo
ur friends, or a larger community, 
or publicly.
 

the things that we want to try to do over the next few years is build a 
handful of great new experiences that are separate from wha
t you think of 
as Facebook today that are just kind of helping to explore that space and 
give people new ways to share.

share with us how you see the competitive environment for Facebook in the 
area of messaging, in partic
ular in regions like Asia. And how do you see 
Facebook differentiating itself and maybe changing the user behavior from 
some of the newer companies that have aggregated a large number of users 
in the space?
 
And then my second question is just for David in 
regard to seasonality of ad 

at the point now where we should see seasonality of mobile ad revenue in 
Q1.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I can talk to Messenger a bit. If you think about the o
verall space of sharing 

want to have the ability to share any kind of content with any audience. 
There are going to be a lot of different apps that exist, and Facebook has 
always h
ad the mission of helping people share any kind of content with any 

 
And one of the stats that I shared today is that we now have more than half 
a billion people using Groups every month. And 

think a lot of people are paying attention to, because it was sort of seen as a 
feature of the Facebook app rather than its own product.
 

Messenger ever



so that way it gets room to breathe and
 
blossom as its own great 

a lot of new things.
 
I mean, some of the stats that I shared are incredibly promising. In the last 
few months, 70% more people are using it, and a lot of m

specific at this point in its evolution.
 
David Ebersman
 
Thanks for your question on seasonality. Of course seasonality is an 
important factor in 
an advertising business, and affects Q4 and makes it a 
typically strong quarter. At this point, given how new we are with the mobile 

seasonality. I think it will take some more time b
efore we can understand it 
better than we do.

making in terms of brand and real time 
conversation. I think on the user 
side, would love to get some interest in terms of the usage and engagement 
with video content early on, and real time conversations, particularly around 
entertainment related content. And then on the advertiser side, kind 
of early 
adoption by brand and TV

like advertisers with some of the brand and video 
solutions that you have out there.
 
And then for David, given the significant transition that the business 
continues to go through that is affecting these ad impression and 
average 
price metrics, can you give us a sense of the breakdown between the ad 
impressions between desktop and mobile?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

into some of the specifics. But I just want
 
to put this in the context of the 
overall strategy here. We were just talking about some of the standalone 
experiences and Messenger, and public content is part of this overall 
spectrum of content that people want to share and consume as well. In 
some way

-
on
-
one 

Facebook works really well.
 

to be able
 
to share public content, including premium content like videos and 
making it so that they can autoplay in feed. And this is an area where, just 

expect us to keep focusing on a lot.
 

that we think is quite valuable. I think Sheryl is going to get into some of the 
specifics.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Yeah, I can start with video and then go to the overall brand question you 
started with. We have a curren



what Mark has talked about, which is that marketers and u
sers are using 
video more, as they have the technology to do so. And we expect that to 
continue to grow.
 

we are with all of our market segments. All of the Ad Age Global 100 
adver
tised with us over the past year. And the real key there is proving 
measurement to our clients. Our team, led by Carolyn Everson and her 
people all around the world, really have to go client by client and show them 

ppiness or brand affiliation, but ring 
the cash register at the end of the day.
 
I think this is part of the big story for us in 2013, which is if you look back a 

and what the di
fferent in sales is. And now we have that. And we still have a 
lot of hard work to do, client by client, ahead of us, but being able to prove 
that we have really strong ROI, and I think increasingly efficient ROI,

ies they have, is what is going to 
move the brand marketers to Facebook and to mobile.
 
David Ebersman
 
Your second question about mobile and desktop impressions, as you know, 
per user or per unit of time on the desktop, we show a higher number of 
ads, becau



I described. So these ads perform well for ma
rketers and are still continuing 
to contribute to the positive user experience that Mark described earlier.

First, for David, I wonder if you could comment on
 
the ad load on Facebook. 
Do you expect that to continue to remain stable, or is there a possibility that 
the ad load creeps up over time?
 

slowly at first, but I wonder if you could al
so talk about how long it might 

 
And then one last question for Sheryl, I wonder is there a way, when you 
compare Facebook to television for brand marketers, to look at the disparity 
of RO
I, or I should say the improved ROI for Facebook, and sort of 
extrapolate where you think pricing could go. Obviously pricing doubling 
quite a bit. How much more upside to Facebook newsfeed pricing can we 
expect to see based on the ROI differential?
 
Mark Z
uckerberg
 
I just want to start off here, and then David can get into some of the details 
on the number of ads and all that. But you know, the strategy has been, for 
the last period, and will continue to be, to primarily focus on increasing the 
quality of t
he ads and the experience.
 

more ads then the business would grow faster in the short term, but 

wh
at improves the experience for the people who use the product. It drives 
greater returns for advertisers, and over time it increases the potential size 
of our business.
 

actually think 
that the results over the last couple of quarters have really 
shown that by focusing on improving quality instead of just increasing 
quantity, we can actually drive pretty incredible business results. So we 


doing.
 
David Ebersman
 
I think I can take most of the rest of this. In terms of ad load, the one piece 


ence, as you can 
measure that based on engagement or user feedback, etc. And ad load is 

well, such as the positioning of the ads, the size of the ads, and of course 
critically 
the quality of the ads. So ad load only gives a part of the picture.
 

provide the best experience. I think one of the most important pieces of 
positive news from 2013 was as we ram
ped up newsfeed ads, they 
performed as well as they did, delivering great value for marketers, having a 
very minimal effect on the user experience, and enabling Facebook to deliver 
the kind of results that we reported today.
 

e to tweak what we do in terms of trying to 
find the right balance and optimize the performance of the ads for marketers 
and for users, but generally, as Mark said, the most important place for us 
to invest is going to be in improving the quality and relev
ance of the ads.
 
You asked about Instagram and pricing, so let me just cover those quickly. 


what the ri


 
In terms of pricing, it was our expectation that if ads in newsfeed worked 
well, that they would deliver more value for markete
rs, be more engaging, 
and that they would contribute to the average price per ad on Facebook 
going up. And we also believe, looking forward, if we continue to improve 

we can driv
e pricing up in the future.

Just wanted to ask two things. First, you announced an initiative or perhaps 
an algorithm tweak, I think, in early December to 
have more news stories in 

from users there, and what are the implications on usage and engagement, 
and then also ad load. And then secondly, can you give us an update on teen 
engageme
nt trends?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
To start with the public content, the change that we made is basically a lot 
of what our algorithm looks at is straight engagement. So the amount of 
content that people click, like, comment, and share in feed. But what we 
found w
as that when we asked people qualitatively what they prefer getting, 


when you asked people, what they w
anted to see in feed, or what they were 

 
So we ended up doing an adjustment to the algorithm, which made it so that 
qualitatively things and especially public content and news that people rated 
as higher quality qualitat
ively scored more, and that was basically the 
adjustment to the algorithm. It had really no impact on ads. It was an 
organic content adjustment that we made to improve the quality of the 
experience. So I think David can talk about teens.

great products that all our users, including teens, will find useful and

what the product is, in terms of what we can see today relative to what your 
longer term aspirations are for the product.
 

integration into newsfeed. You know, a

more recently is trending and attaching trending to news articles in 
newsfeed as well. So if you could talk more broadly about your interest in 
real time information and news as it relates to public content, that would be 
h
elpful.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 



on desktop

content that people have shared on Facebook that simply building the 
infrastructure to index all of it and start ranking it is a multiyear effort, 

 
So the fir
st release indexed more than a trillion connections between all the 
people and interests and events and groups and things that everyone was 
connected to. The second release that we did recently was around all the 
updates. So there are more than a trillion 
status updates and unstructured 
text posts and photos and pieces of content that people have shared over 
the past 10 years, and indexing that was a really big deal, because as the 
number of people on the team who have worked on web search engines in 
the pa
st have told me, a trillion pieces of content is more than the index in 
any web search engine.
 


be an imp
ortant step, because most of the usage in Facebook overall is on 

from on Graph Search over time.
 


s a long roadmap of things that we need to do that I think is pretty 

this as an investment over a three to five year period rather than a one to 

 
how I think about that.
 
The other question was about trending topics, and that really ties into the 
public content push that we have. And we talked a bit about this before. 

want 
to share and consume with all audiences.
 
We think public content is great. Folks who are making news, or premium 
content on TV, or movies, or celebrities and different types of folks are 
extremely interesting and produce great content, and we want to be a 
great 
place for people to share that content, and for people to be able to learn 
about it and consume it. So trending topics is one step in what you will see 

great for public conten
t.

retargeting on desktop, b
ut how you can think about the evolution of 
retargeting in the mobile environment as a future product. And I guess 
second question for Mark, not a lot of talk on the payments business so far 
in the call, and just wanting to understand, maybe an update arou
nd games 
or other areas of ecommerce that you think are opportunities for the 
payments business.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On retargeting, retargeting has been proven really valuable across all 

ng it 
through our own products as well. As part of our custom audiences suite of 

audiences. And these all allow marketers to target ads in privacy safe ways 
that improve the relevance
 
and improve results.
 

is relevance, and taking the data and using it in a privacy safe way to 

on.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 


reach people with relevant messages. And payments historically has been a 
great way for game d
evelopers, especially on desktop, an efficient way for 
us to monetize that business, because instead of charging them up front for 
most of the ads, we can charge them only when their business grows 
because someone is paying for something.
 
On mobile, I thin
k the natural evolution of this is for that to move toward 

operating systems are integrated with that. But because a lot of the goods 
that people are buying in games are no marginal
 

economic incentive is to advertise to get more people to come into their flow 
for as many people as they can get to buy the goods.
 
So even though a game developer might be paying 30% to the operating 

nding that people also really want to

Two questions. First, Mark, you referenced 2014 as a year of rolling out new 
and engaging mobile products. Maybe could you provide some color or 
highlight the types of products that users can expect, or maybe how you 
thin
k about improving mobile engagement? And then just on Instagram, can 
you give us an update on the number of monthly active users ending 2013 
and give us a sense of how the data testing is going with advertisers, and 
when it might be available for all adver
tisers?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

touched on most of them already on the call, I also want to take a moment 


ing to start small compared to where the core of Facebook is.
 

engagement and sharing and our business are going to come from the core 
Facebook experience, because mathematically, it


multiyear investments to add up to that.
 
I mean, you can look at, for example, comScore puts out these numbers 
every month or so that reference the amount of t
ime that people spend in 
different mobile apps. Facebook I think is almost 5
-
10 times bigger than the 

things to turn into huge things.
 

t are all of the different kinds 
of ways that people might want to share different kinds of content with 


in 
the Facebook app.
 
Giving experiences like that room to breathe and really develop to be their 


of aud
ience and type of content that people might want to share.
 
Examples of things that we have done are Messenger is a really big focus for 

different kind of community than Facebook. We 
just launched Instagram 
Direct within Instagram, which is one on one or small group photo and video 

going to be rolling out.
 

 
kinds of things, and what 
I think you should take away from this is that while the core business growth 
is going to come from the main app that exists, just because the numbers 

wh
ere most of the momentum comes from.
 
You should also expect us to start building a few of these other things that 

things, like Messenger and Instagram are today.

Mark, I had a follow up from one of the previous questions, on closing the 
loop in mobile. You guys have made a lot of progress improving the total 

downloading apps 
and making purchases today. You guys have recently rolled out some new 
ad formats, and you have some partnerships with the likes of Braintree and 

removing some of this fr
iction for marketers, and do you envision a scenario 
where users can buy physical or digital products within the Facebook mobile 
apps?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I can take this. Obviously, the mobile app world is a new world, and not just 
the functionality in ads is
 
still developing, but the functionality of what then 
people can do. You can do a lot more on the desktop in many ways than you 
can on mobile. I think the best role we play is to help connect consumers 
with marketers and with companies and services, and I 
think reducing the 

direct ecommerce market, because the advertising products we provide I 
think are the best thing we can provide to help grow this market.

On contextual advertising, this is essentially the Holy Grail for Facebook, and

innings on 
getting contextual ads? And can you talk about the role that 
Instagram plays with visually appealing ads and the role that video plays?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

for us, and a huge opport
unity and challenge. Our goal is in a privacy safe 
way to get information we can about what consumers want, and then help 

serving relevant ads. Whether that information comes from the k
ind of 
things people like on Facebook or other websites they visit, or contextual 
statements they might make in their status updates, our goal is to use that 
information in a privacy safe way to improve the targeting of the ads on 
Facebook.
 
To take one exa

response business, which has been a very strong segment for us, if you look 
at people trying to find consumers, we offer the opportunity to get people 
before they search. We can judge interest based on 
other things, other 

consumers before they search so that they can then move them all the way 
down the funnel into purchase.

I just have a couple of questions. The first one, I guess, on app install ads, if 
you could quantify how much those are driving growth in newsfeed 
advertising.
 
And if not specifically, then maybe on a relative basis, through 
other mobile ad formats? And then second, Mark, the company has made 

you could characterize how important this init
iative is to the company, and 
how you think that AI will help Facebook over time.

by segme

ad strength is very broad

based. Our mobile ads are not just bought by 
people who are looking to drive engagement or usage of mobile apps, but is 
very broad
-

s, brand advertisers, and direct 
response advertisers as well.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
And I can speak to some of the deep learning work. In the last quarter, Yann 
Lecun, one of the really earliest folks, and one of the founders of deep 
learning, and a professor a
t NYU, joined us to lead our AI group. And this is 

over a longer, maybe five or ten year, period.
 
And their goal is really just to try to understand how everything on Facebook 
is 
connected, by understanding what the posts that people write mean, and 
the content that is in the photos and videos that people are sharing, help 

to transcribe that for people, 
so that they can receive it more easily.
 
So these are some pretty big tasks in AI that are things that we have teams 
that are working on that will need to be researched over time, and will have 
obvious implications for the products that we do, but over tim
e the real 
value will be if we can understand the meaning of all the content that people 
are sharing, that we can just provide much more relevant experiences for 
people across everything that we do.

marks, around basic financial services,

David, can you just talk about the sustainability of the gros
s margin that you 

redundant. When you think about the potential for ad quality at Facebook 

over the
 
last two years on ad quality, how do you think about what the 


real gap opportunities? Are there any prox
ies out there that you see that you 
say, well, this is where Facebook could be? Any thoughts on how much 
higher, how much better, over the years, ad quality could be on Facebook?
 
David Ebersman
 

as you know, 
gross margins tend to be seasonally strong, because revenue goes up in the 
fourth quarter and the costs associated with operating our infrastructure 

So directionally, I
 

2013, in terms of the efficiency investments that we made.
 
But going forward, this is a compute heavy service we provide. It requires a 

ing to continue to 
invest in those things and we do expect to increase our infrastructure costs 
over time while trying to do that as efficiently as possible.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

s
aid in my opening remarks that we have this long term goal of making the 
advertising quality content as good and as relevant and timely as the 
content that your friends are sharing with you. And at first blush, I think that 
seems kind of crazy in that your
 

advantage of being immediately socially relevant to you.
 
But at the same time, a lot of the folks who are advertising really invest in 

ds, 
and improving the targeting of their ads to deliver the right messages to the 

going to see here, although there are things like the video formats that 
really enable new kind
s of rich experiences, that folks who can invest in 
building those can really benefit from.
 
At the same time, I think a lot of this is going to be incremental. So as we 
make improvements, more advertisers come into the system, and as more 
advertisers come 
into the system, we have more options of relevant content 
to show to people, and that improves the quality as well. So this is just 

long way to go before we get to the quality le
vel that we want. But I think 
over a multiyear period, we can get there, or at least very close.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

opportunities we have is to make these ads [at scale] more personal. So ju
st 
as we can have social context, obviously, from the user content, we put 
social context into ads. So we can take these ads that marketers can deliver 
up scale, improve the targeting, and give them social context, which will 
help drive the kind of opportu
nities Mark is talking about to make the ads as 
relevant as the user content.

Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining today. This was a very 
busy quarter and a strong start to 2014. We continued to grow our 
community in size a
nd engagement, with nearly 1.28 billion people now 
using Facebook each month and almost 63% visiting daily.
 
We also reached new milestones as a mobile company, with more than one 
billion monthly actives on mobile and almost 55% of our daily actives only 
co
nnecting on mobile.

82%, our strongest annual growth rate in nearly three years. And mobile 
accounted for 59% of 
our advertising revenue.
 

a great position to continue making progress towards our mission.
 
This quarter we made a number of big investments in our future. We 
reached agreements to a
cquire WhatsApp and Oculus, and we announced 

expand Internet access around the world. These are important efforts that 
we believe will help us continue making progress towards our missio
n over 
the long term.
 

carefully improving our core products and business. Execution gives us the 
strength to bet on the future, and our success over the long term depends 
on us serving
 
our community today and delivering against our current 
strategy.
 

towards our three big company goals; connecting everyone, understanding 
the world and building the knowledge economy.
 
Connecting everyone is about making Internet services available to everyone 
in the world, and allowing everyone to connect with the people and things 
that they care about.
 
Our strategy for connecting everyone is based on two approaches. The first 
is about
 
giving people new apps for sharing different kinds of content with 
different people. Today our apps are at different stages of maturity.
 
Our core Facebook app has an audience of over one billion people, and has 
become an essential sharing infrastructure f

focused on building a great business around this, and our continuing 
revenue growth on mobile this quarter shows our strong momentum here.
 
For the next set of apps like Messenger, Instagram and hopefully soon 
WhatsApp, the cur
rent priority is growth. Messenger and Instagram both 
reached 200 million monthly actives this quarter. We believe these apps 
have a lot of room to grow and will start to be important businesses in the 

-
term priority 
here.
 


develop the technical foundations for these services so that we can rapidly 
launch new products a
nd then refine them based on the initial feedback from 
our community.
 
For Creative Labs projects that demonstrate a lot of value, our next priority 
will be to grow them to reach 100 million people, before we start developing 
them into significant businesse

Paper, our first app from Creative Labs, and we expect this to be a good test 
case for our strategy.
 
The longer term part of our strategy for connecting everyone is focused on 
Internet.org, our effort to make a
ffordable basic Internet services available 
to the entire world. We recently reached 100 million monthly actives in 

success.
 

 
mobile operators 

mobile data with our partners and brought almost three million more people 
onto the Internet.
 
Our early tests and research into new technologies such as drones and 
other 
infrastructure to connect people are promising. And over the long term we 
also expect WhatsApp to play an important part in connecting everyone by 
offering a simple, fast and reliable messaging system that could be as 
ubiquitous as Facebook one day. 

closes.
 

about using Facebook to build up long term knowledge about the world and 
helping to answer questions for people that no other service
 
can.
 
Next week Facebook holds our fifth f8 conference, the main event for our 
developer community. We do this because even with all the experiences 


want to keep serving developers 
better, and to help them build, grow and monetize their apps.
 

our best performing ad products, driving over 350 million installs to date. 
Over 60% of 
the top grossing apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play 
use Mobile App Ads, which is pretty impressive performance for a product 
that launched in January last year.
 
On desktop, games continue to be popular on our platform and over the last 
twelve mont
hs desktop game developers generated more than $3 billion in 
payments volume on Facebook.
 
It's worth noting that even though our mobile and desktop products seem 
completely different, they're both delivering the same value to developers; 
the ability to rea
ch a large targeted audience. That's what we provide, and 
regardless of the format we will continue to improve this value.
 
We see a big opportunity to continue improving the relevancy of the ads 
people see on and off Facebook, to help mobile developers bet
ter monetize 
their apps, and to help provide greater reach for marketers. I look forward 
to sharing more details next week at f8.
 

the knowledge economy is about building out the
 
technology platforms the 
world needs for the future, so everyone can use information to do their jobs 
better.
 
Advertising and the ability to reach people more broadly is one of the most 
important technology platforms for achieving this, and we're investin
g a lot 
to serve four major kinds of partners: small businesses, brands, developers 
and e
-
commerce partners.
 
After introducing News Feed ads, which increased the supply of ads in our 
system, our recent efforts have primarily focused on improving the 
releva
nce and quality of these ads.
 

marketers, so they have access to better targeting capabilities, simpler ad 
products and more useful measurement tools.
 
Our approach is less about developing n
ew products for marketers and more 
about improving our existing ones and helping businesses to use them 
efficiently. Our goal is to make our ads as interesting as organic content on 
Facebook, so that more people find ads useful and businesses can engage 
ef
fectively with our community and grow.
 
Our most recent data shows that this approach is working well, and we

grateful for the support of everyone here at Facebook, as well as our 
stockholders and partners, as we continue working to 
achieve our mission.
 
In addition to thanking our employees, I'd also like to thank one person in 
particular: David Ebersman, who is stepping down as CFO after almost five 
years. David has been a great partner in building Facebook.
 
He has set the right tone
 
about operating efficiently. He has set us up to 
make the long term investments we need. And most importantly, he has 
built an incredibly strong team, including Dave Wehner, who will be our next 
CFO.
 
I've learned a lot from David, both personally and prof
essionally, and I'm 
grateful for everything he has done to help make the world more open and 
connected.
 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks Mark and hi everyone. Before I start, I want to join Mark in thanking 
David for being an extraordi
nary partner and friend over these past five 
years. As Mark said, he has contributed so much to our company and I've 
learned so much, personally, working with him.
 

also really excite
d to continue working with Dave Wehner as he steps into 
his new role as our CFO.
 
We are off to an outstanding start in 2014. Our total revenues were up 72%

business. The team is staying focused on each element of our monetization 
strategy: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing 
the number of 
marketers who advertise with us, and investing in our ad products.
 
Mobile continues to be a big driver for us 

 
and a big opportunity. Mobile 
comprised 59% of our ad revenue in the quarter, up six percentage points 
from Q4. We continue to bel
ieve that this is because Facebook has the best 
mobile ad product in the market.
 
We also continue to grow the number of marketers using Facebook and saw 
growth from existing advertisers as well. Our growth is very broad
-
based 
and coming from all types of m
arketers, with particular strength from SMB 
and direct response.
 
We saw strong performance this quarter from verticals such as mobile 
gaming, e
-
commerce, and consumer
-
packaged goods.
 
I am especially pleased with what we are seeing and hearing from clients 
around the world as they shift budgets to online, to mobile, and to 

sports retailer.
 
They recently decided to pull their paper circulars, which their company have 
relied on as its primar
y ad vehicle for 92 years for two weeks and replace 
them completely with digital spend, a majority of which was on Facebook.
 
During those two weeks, national in
-
store sales grew 12% year
-
over
-
year 
and in
-
store sales of the items they promoted on Facebook g
rew 23%. As a 
result, they are going to continue with their tests and their goal is to 
transition more than 25% of their print spend to digital and Facebook in the 
next year.
 
And last week I was in Europe meetings with clients, agencies, SMBs and 
developer
s and what I heard from them was how FB was becoming 
increasingly important in driving their businesses.
 
Investing to improve and expand our ad products remains a very important 
priority for us. Our goal is to continue to develop new ways to help 
marketers reach their customers.
 

capabilities, simplifying our ad products, and improving our measurement 

 
First, targeting. Along with 

proprietary targeting to help them reach the right customers and create 
more personalized and, therefore, more efficient and effective ad campaigns. 
Ten times more marketers are now using our Custom Audiences
 
targeting 
feature compared to last year.
 

from its classic flavors. They used a wide range of our targeting capabilities, 
including Custom Audiences and Partner Categories, to reach
 
premium ice 
cream buyers.
 
Their campaign reached 14 million people, roughly 90% on mobile and drove 
an 8.1% sales lift from those consumers. As more marketers use our 
targeting tools, our ads become more relevant for our users and drive even 
better result
s for marketers.
 
Second, we are simplifying and enhancing our ad tools for the over one 
million advertisers on Facebook. The tools that were previously available to 
only the biggest and most sophisticated advertisers like Custom Audiences 
and Partner Categ
ories are now available in our self
-
service ad creation 
process.
 
By making these tools more accessible, we believe we can grow the number 
of advertisers on our platform and improve their results. Additionally, for 

e specific calls to action in our 

efficacy of these ads.
 

investments in measurement tools. Our online conve
rsion measurement 
tools enable our direct response advertisers to measure the impact their 
Facebook ad campaigns have on online sales. And, we recently launched 
new offline conversion tools to measure in
-
store sales, which have yielded 
positive initial res
ults.
 
Our ongoing focus will continue to be on improving the quality, relevance 
and performance of our ads and demonstrating value to marketers. We 
believe we still have a lot of opportunity to generate future returns by 
continuing to focus in these areas.
 
We also have significant opportunities to develop newer products like 
premium video, ads on Instagram and our recently launched ad network 

feedback from marketers in all of these areas.
 

we don't expect meaningful contributions from these projects this year.
 
To summarize, our ads business is performing very well. I want to take a 
minute to congratulate and thank our teams all around the world and our 
ads eng
ineering, product and design teams on the progress we have made.
 
I also want to thank our clients, agencies, PMDs, and other partners, who 
work with us every day to use our platform to build their relationships with 
their customers to create personalized m
arketing at scale.
 

conviction in the results they can achieve on Facebook. We have a great 

scale.
 

in that journey and we are going to stay focused on making the 
right investments in our ads business and executing against our plan.
 

 
David Ebersman
 
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Before I dive into the num
bers, 
I wanted to say a few words about my decision to step down as CFO.

enough for their friendship and s
upport and for letting me be a part of their

ensure a smooth transition.
 
I also want to thank our shareholders for your partnership and support. Now 
to the quarter.
 
Q1 was a strong quarter for us across the business. We increased our 
revenue growth rate, expanded op
erating margins, delivered free cash flow 
of over $900 million, and continued to make investments to position the 
company for near

term and long
-

metrics.
 
The number of people using Facebook on an average day in Mar
ch grew to 
802 million, up 137 million from a year ago. As Mark mentioned, this daily 
number represents almost 63% of the 1.28 billion people who used 
Facebook during the month. And overall engagement remains strong.
 

 
Instagram, which now has more than 
200 million monthly active users, showing the remarkable progress by the 
team. Two years ago this month, when the acquisition was announced, 
Instagram had fewer than 22 million monthly actives.
 
Turning now to the financi
als. Q1 total revenue was $2.50 billion, up 72% 
versus Q1 last year, and total ad revenue was $2.27 billion, up 82%. Ad 
revenue growth was strong around the world, with each of our four 
geographic regions growing by over 70%.
 
Mobile ad revenue was approxim
ately $1.3 billion, compared to around $377 
million in Q1 last year, and notably mobile ad revenue was up 7% 
sequentially, despite the seasonal benefits in Q4. Desktop ad revenue in Q1 
was up 8% compared to Q1 last year.
 
In Q1, the average effective price 
per ad displayed increased 118% year

year while total ad impressions declined 17%. The decrease in ad 
impressions was due to factors including the continued shift towards mobile 
use, where people are shown fewer ads compared to desktop.
 
The 
increase in average price per ad was primarily driven by a mix shift with 
more ads being shown in News Feed. News Feed ads have significantly 
higher engagement, click through rates, and price per ad compared to right 
hand column ads, so a higher proportion
 
of ads appearing in News Feed 
drives up the overall average price per ad.
 
The price volume trends were pretty consistent across our four geographic 
regions.
 
Total Payments and Other Fees revenue was $237 million, up 11% versus 
Q1 last year. However, the m
ore meaningful comparison, that better reflects 
the organic growth we saw in the Payments business, comes from looking at 
Payments volume from Games specifically, which was up 1% in Q1 
compared to Q1 last year, down from the 8% year
-
over
-
year growth rate w
e 
saw in Q4.
 

our Games Payments revenue comes from desktop only, where usage is flat 
or declining, so growing this business going forward will be challenging.
 
Turning to expense
s, our Q1 GAAP expenses were $1.4 billion, up 32%, and 
our non
-
GAAP expenses were $1.1 billion, up 26%. Our headcount increased 
39% from a year ago.
 
Our Q1 GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, representing a 43% 
operating margin, and our non
-
GAAP operat
ing income was $1.4 billion, 
representing a 55% margin, up from 39% last year.
 
While the margin improvement was helped by some non
-
recurring items that 

came mostly from cost of reve
nue and G&A.
 

while continuing to aggressively grow our investment in R&D along with 
marketing and sales to drive future performance.
 
Our GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates were 40% and 36
%, respectively. GAAP 
net income was $642 million or $0.25 per share, and non
-
GAAP net income 
was $885 million or $0.34 per share.
 
In Q1, we spent $363 million on CapEx and generated $922 million in free 
cash flow. We ended Q1 with $12.6 billion in cash an
d investments.
 
Now, looking forward. First, I want to note that the forward
-
looking 

announced acquisitions of WhatsApp and Oculus, neither of which has 

ll update our guidance as appropriate.
 

planning that our total 2014 GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue and 
stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 35% to 40%, and tha
t 
non
-
GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp, will 
likely grow in the neighborhood of 40% to 45%.
 
For taxes, we expect GAAP and non
-
GAAP rates for the rest of 2014 to be 
similar to or a bit higher than our Q1 rates, although this
 
could vary widely 
depending upon our international revenue and expense mix, and other 
factors including the impact from acquisitions.
 
We continue to anticipate our 2014 CapEx will be approximately $2 billion to 
$2.5 billion. We also continue to expect sha
res outstanding for calculating 
EPS to grow from around 2.6 billion at year
-
end 2013 by 2% to 2.5% in 

 
Those deals once closed will add another 207 million shares, as well as 
additional unvested RSUs that 
will affect our share count over the 
subsequent four to five years.
 
Turning last to ad revenue. As you know, our year
-
over
-
year comparables 
will get more challenging going forward from here because of the timing of 
the ramp up of News Feed ads in 2013.
 
As 
the comps become more difficult, we continue to expect that over the 
rest of 2014, our year
-
over
-
year ad revenue growth rates will decline from 
the Q1 rate and be meaningfully lower by the end of the year.
 
That being said, we believe, we are still in the e
arly stages of building our 
ads business, and we remain as optimistic as ever about the long
-
term 
opportunity to grow revenue impressively by improving the quality and 
relevance of our ads and increasing the value we bring to marketers.
 
In summary, Q1 was 
a great start to the year. We're very pleased with how 
well our ads performed. The strong marketer interest in our ads platform 
particularly on mobile and the investments we're making to build long
-
term 
shareholder value.

Great. T
hank you very much. I was just wondering, Mark or Sheryl, if you 
can share with us your vision of payments for Facebook, and how the 
Company might be able to play a role in reducing the friction that exists 
today when users are trying to engage in mobile e
-
commerce.
 
And then the follow
-
up question was just going to be if you could share with 
us what inning do you think we are in, in terms of improving the relevancy 
of the ads that you are showing? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On payments, our payments busines
s has been important in supporting 
some of the developer activity on Facebook, primarily games. So we 
continue to be interested in that.
 
I guess really important to know that, our advertising business is very 
relevant for e
-
commerce and that doesn't depend on taking payments and it 
doesn't depend on a payment strategy because we provide a really great 
opportunity for marketers to find custo
mers who are then going to go ahead 
and buy their products both online and offline.
 
In terms of relevance, I think we are in really early innings. I think people 
can see it from their own experience. Those people I talk to and certainly the 
data we have ac
ross the base of people use Facebook suggest that the ads 
are getting more relevant, but there is a long way to go.
 
Our goal is that every time you open newsfeed, every time you look at 
Facebook, you see something whether it's from consumers, or whether it
's 
from marketers, that really delights you, that you're genuinely happy to see.
 
I think we hit that more than we used to with our ads, but I think the truth 
is we still have a long way to go to hit that bar and that's the bar we are 
striving for.

Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is 
open.
 
Douglas Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. David, just wanted to ask you a little 
bit more about margins, in particular. If we look at this quarter, it lo
oks like 
the incremental margins here are 78% or so.
 
So, I was hoping you could drill down a little more just on the drivers within 
cost of revenues and how you are thinking about the sustainability of that 
going forward.
 
And is the 40% to 45% growth that 
you mentioned in non
-
GAAP OpEx, is 
that taking into account the acquisitions at all? Just thinking about how you 
can get to that level of spend given what you are starting the year. Thanks
 
David Ebersman
 
Yeah. Thanks for the question Doug. I think Q1 is tr
aditionally a light 
spending quarter for us because we budget with an annual cycle and often it 
takes some time to sort of ramp up the new program. So I don't think it's 
surprising that Q1 year
-
over
-
year increase would come in a little lighter than 
we expe
ct for the full year.
 
Additionally there were some one
-
time things that benefited the quarter, 
that kept expenses down particularly in cost of revenue as we continue to 
exit lease data centers and sort of amend our supply chain.
 
I think that going forward 
our expectation was and remains the 40% to 45% 
growth excluding the impact from the acquisitions. So, we will update that 
guidance once the integration plans are clearer and have a better sense for 
what those spend patterns will look like.
 
In general in te
rms of margins, the comments I would make are that, we 

-
to
-
quarter target margin that we're managing closely 
to. To do so, would require varying our spend patterns as revenue changes 
up and down over time.
 
And I think that's the wrong w
ay to focus on how you spend your money in 
the company. Our priority is really to try and make investments that are 
high quality that drive the creation of value and makes the business better.
 
And since many of those investments take a longer period to mat
ure, we 
want to be able to think about our spend increases over a longer term 
horizon.
 
And as you can see looking back at the last couple of years and then our 
plans for this year, there has been a pretty steady rate at which we've been 
growing spend parti
cularly in R&D and marketing and sales where we really 
want to focus on making sure we're growing smartly and thoughtfully at a 
rate we can manage wisely and doesn't get ahead of our ability to manage 
it.
 
On cost of revenue and G&A what you can see in the 
Q1 numbers is the 
fruits of a lot of labor trying to manage those parts of the business really 
efficiently and free up resources to invest elsewhere.
 
So, I think we've always believed that Facebook has the opportunity to be a 
sustainably high margin busine
ss and we continue to believe that, noting 
that there were some individual items that helped us in Q1.

The next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Your 
line is open.
 
Carlos Kirjner

Sanford Bernstein
 
I think for Mark, how 
do you think about the evolution of browser 
technology, HTML5, and development tools versus native apps? If you look 
two to three years out, do you think native apps could finally become less 
important for many use cases? Or, in other words, maybe you guys
 
were not 
wrong when you tried HTML5, you were just too early. Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yeah, well timing matters a lot and so, I do think that there's nothing wrong 
with the standard of HTML5 technically. I think a lot of what we see is what 
the main pl
atform providers want to push as the standard for developing on 
their own platforms.
 
And what we've seen is that both Apple and Google have really favored and 
made it easier to build high quality experiences in their own proprietary 
formats rather than the
 
open web format.
 
So, while our bias for a number of reasons would have been to have really 
pushed on HTML5 and I don't want to sound like we've walked away from 
this because a large number of people access Facebook from the mobile web 
and I don't know if 
we break that out specifically but it's quite a large 
number of people.
 
So, we're continuing to develop that, but for the foreseeable future, we see 
the best path to continuing to deliver great experiences by working on the 
native app 
experiences that we have now.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
 
Eric Sheridan

UBS
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations, David, on your future 
endeavors, as well. Mark, maybe a quick question for 
you about the way in 
which you think Facebook, and the various applications Facebook is 
developing also, move towards a communication ecosystem longer term.
 
A big picture question on where the various applications go, the ones that 
are in the process of be
ing acquired and the ones you are developing 
organically.
 
And then second question, to use the baseball analogy again, as you 
continue to take ad impressions out of the Facebook platform, wonder if we 
should think about where you get to longer term on a le
vel of ad impressions 
that you think are the perfect mix for balancing engagement and 
monetization, and what inning we are in that process.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. I think I can probably take both of those. So in terms of building out a 
whole communication e
cosystem, the way that we think about the new apps 
and products that we're building is that people want to share all kinds of 
different content with all kinds of different audiences.
 
Right so, sometimes you want to have one
-
on
-
one conversation or text or 
c
hat or voice call up to having a small group conversation to communicating, 
updating all your friends and something at once. And sometimes there is 

that.
 
At the intersection of e
ach type of content and each audience, we think that 
there is a really compelling experience to be built. And Facebook historically 
is focused on friends and public content, now with Messenger and WhatsApp 
we're taking a couple of different approaches towa
rds more private content 
as well.
 
You're going to see us do more things in more private content I think, I 

that speaks to why WhatsApp and Messenger are both growing 
independently qu
ickly is because they actually serve pretty different used 
cases within private sharing and private content.
 
In terms of our investments, I think you want to look at it, I kind of outline 
this in my remarks, but I think it's important enough to say again.
 
There are different stages of maturity for the different things that we're 
doing. So, the Facebook app by itself is the furthest along and more than a 
billion people use it and it's not only one of the most used apps, but it's the 
most used app it's also a
t the core of our business.
 
Then the second set of apps that we have are Messenger, Instagram and 
soon WhatsApp and you know Messenger and Instagram are each now 
greater than 200 million active users. I think the WhatsApp folks 
independently announced, I t
hink it was yesterday that they just passed 500 
million active.
 
So these are apps that are now at a pretty big scale and the immediate 
priority is going to be getting them to a billion people where they're 
continuing to focus on that before focusing on mon
etization and the way that 
we have with the core Facebook app, so that's kind of a second stage.
 
The third set are the new Facebook Creative Labs apps that we're just 
getting started. The things like Paper and a number of other things that we 
might announc
e that at some point. Those are even further along than even 
Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, where it will probably take few years 
for those to even to get to the stage that Instagram, Messenger and 
WhatsApp are at, which by themselves are probably a fe
w years away from 
being important businesses for us.
 
So that's kind of the pipeline of things that we see and there is kind of a full 
ecosystem of different ways the people want to share with different people.
 
In terms of ads going to your second question,
 
I don't actually think we have 
a strategy that decrease ad impression. I think what you're seeing and what 
David mentioned is, we have newsfeed ads, which are higher quality and 
perform better and then we have this legacy of right hand column ads on 
deskt
op, which generally are just showing higher volume and they 
performed less well per ad unit.
 
So as we shift more towards newsfeed, what you're seeing is the total raw 
number of impressions as decreasing, but actually the amount of value that 
we're deliveri
ng is increasing.
 
So that might continue to shift as we continue to shift towards mobile, but I 
think overall what we're trying to do is make it that the individual load on a 

drivin
g most of the wins in user experience, advertiser performance and our 
own revenue to increasing the quality primarily around newsfeed ads.
 
And we think that there is quite a lot to go there as Sheryl said. We want to 
get to a state where the ad content is 
as good as the organic content and we 
see we're getting pretty close in a few countries but we want to get to that 
everywhere.

Good aftern
oon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question 
about engagement. By one measure, DAU over MAU, it's at an all
-
time high. 
But no doubt you always have a body of last users. I'm wondering if you 
could share any color on what types of algorith
m or product tweaks that 
you've made have yielded the most return or the greatest return in terms of 
re
-
engaging last users.
 
And then, secondly, just quickly, any color you could provide on your 
estimate of the overlap of Instagram and Facebook users, perh
aps based on 
the linking of those accounts. Thank you very much.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

We are constantly doing things to make it so that people can share the 
content that they 
want, that they have the tools, that the new network 
showing them most relevant content to people.
 
That is always going to be the way that people will use the service not 
through some kind of trick or something that we're using to reengage 
people.
 
One stat
 
that I think is pretty interesting is that, you would expect naturally 
that as our 
--
 
the community continues to grow and we're getting into later 
and later adapters, that the percent of people who are using Facebook or 
use it every day would decrease. An
d I have actually predicted for a long 
time, that eventually that would flatten out and I thought it would decrease 
but actually it continues to increase much to our surprise and joys.
 
And you know now this quarter I think, we're add almost 63% of people w
ho 
use Facebook in a month will use it in a given day. And I think another stat, 
I think is actually quite interesting, is we tracked how many people use 
Facebook not just every day.
 
So I mean one day out of 
--
 
so what percent of our monthly folks use it 
t
oday. But what percent of people used it six out of seven days of the week. 
And that number for the first time in the last quarter passed 50%.
 
So I mean that's pretty crazy if you think about is that, you have this really 
big engaged community and not only
 
are almost 63% of people touching it 
in a given day and using the service because it's really engaging content, 
but we've gone to a period where more than 50% of people have used it six 
out of seven a week, almost every single day of a week.
 
That just spe
aks to I think 
-
 
just the underlying kind of fundamental strength 
in the content and the work that we're doing just surface the best content of 
best people.

First, David, let me add my congratulations on your success. And good luck 
with the future role. Mark, beyond games, do you see other categories of 
apps that are ramping?
 
And do you need to see that or can games continue to be the primary dr
iver 
of app install and app engagement ads? And then, separately, on Graph 
Search, do you see the potential for more partnerships for Graph Search in 
terms of additional data sets and distributions partners? Or is this more go
-
it
-
along? And then, finally, 
maybe for Sheryl or David, can you just give us a 
sense on pricing trends on app install ads? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, I mean on app
-
installs, I actually think we see more diversity in the 
customers and developers on mobile now then we saw on desktop w
ith 
Canvas. So Canvas the business was almost entirely games that is now 
--
 
we see that a lot of these games, but a lot of it is other kind of folks because 
I mean everyone who is building apps on mobile needs installs and we have 
the number one products o
ut there for delivering that.
 
So, we see that happening and we feel pretty good about that.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On pricing, we don't break our pricing by type of ad, but overall in the 
ecosystem, our prices are up as Mark said, the effective price per ad shown
 
is driven up by more ads and newsfeed, and that's because newsfeed ads 
have significantly higher engagement and click

Congratulations, David. And best of luck in your new endeavors, as well. 
One question for David 
and one for Sheryl. David, I just wondered if you 
could talk about your mix of impressions in terms of brand versus direct 
response. How has that changed this quarter versus prior quarters? And 
what else can be said about that split?
 
And then, secondly, fo
r Sheryl, just wondered if you could give us a little 
more of an update on premium video ads. Specifically, I'm curious as to how 
those are sold. Are they sold on an impression basis or on a performance 
basis, or some hybrid of the two?
 
And then I know 
you don't give pricing by property, but is there a way to 
think about the premium or premium multiple of price that premium video 
ads would go for as compared to core News Feed ads? Thanks for any color 
on that.
 
David Ebersman
 
Thanks Anthony, I'm happy to 
take the first part of the question. I think in 
the first quarter we delivered strong performance across all the advertiser 
segments that we focus on. And so I think they are all growing nicely.
 
We don't have a perfect measure for what kind of demand is, b
rand versus 
DR per say, because someone doesn't have to input that into the system 
when they come in. We've lots of things we do to try and find surrogates for 
that and are happy to see using some of that data, we're seeing nice growth 
across the various s
egments.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On video ads, video represents a really big opportunity, really driven by 
consumer behavior. Smartphones are going better and faster and more 
people have phones that can provide a great video experience. So we're 
seeing consumers d
o a lot more in video.
 
There's also a lot more video going through newsfeed that consumers are 
putting in and that creates an opportunity for us, both on the consumer side 
and the ad side.
 
We have our current product in the market, it's a click to play vid
eo ad, it's 
part of the page post, you can post the video.
 
Those are so both CPM and CPC and those are going really well and I think 
explains some of the growth we are seeing in our ads business.
 
We also have been in early conversations with some clients a
bout what 
would be a CPM autoplay video ad and in terms of the expectations for that, 
we really want to see autoplay video ads be something that's pretty common 
in the newsfeed experience based on consumer usage before we push very 
hard in the ads business
.
 
So we remain, long term very excited, we do expect that product, demand 
to premium product but as I said in my remarks, we won't see a material 
contribution from it this year.

On those autoplay videos, as an average Facebook user, I've noticed them

The questi
on I'd have for you is what have you seen internally in terms of 
engagement. I assume that since I'm seeing more, other people are too, and 
that users like having them in. But is there any way you could quantify or 
maybe talk broadly about the impact that'
s having on usage? Thank you.

Our goal is to make newsfeed as engaging as possible and I think if you look 
at the engagement we have on mobile, we're getting 20% of mobile time on 
Facebook in the U.S. and growing globally as well. I think y
ou see with that 
engagements grade, I'm sure your friends love seeing your kids play 
basketball. I think they probably like to see more of those.

how that revenue as a percentage of total, how important it is to you?
 
And then there's a lot of competitors targeting that market with new 
products. Maybe y
ou could outline some of Facebook's competitive 
advantages in that market. And then one for Dave. We will miss you. Maybe 
you could talk a little bit about maybe some things Facebook could do to 
offset some of the dilution from the acquisitions, if anythin
g. Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On mobile app ads, we've seen really strong adoption and this is a very 
nascent but growing market. I think people sometimes think that a lot of our 
mobile ad revenue is coming from this one type of ad and our mobile ad 
revenu
e is very broad based.
 
We know you're seeing in newsfeed and what we see are ads from brand 
marketer's direct response, SMB's end developers and so we're pretty 
distributed there and pretty happy about that.
 
I think it's not surprising that other people ar
e entering states, it's obviously 
growing, it's one that performs well. I think we continue to be excited by the 
results we're seeing for our marketers and developers.
 
The results we are seeing from consumers and we think the fact that we've 
already 
been investing and learning and growing, puts us in a great position 
to continue to have a very strong product offering even in a more 
competitive space.
 
David Ebersman
 
So, Justin on the 
--
 
the acquisition is the most important thing we'll do to 
truly I wo
uld say justify, the delusion will be to make those acquisitions 
successful and over time ensure that the unique assists that we're buying 
contribute to Facebook success and to our cash flows over time.
 
This business is obviously in really healthy shape ri

cash it's generating and we look forward at the moment to really continuing

Thank you very much. So firstly David, can you talk a little bit about the ad 
load during the quarter? We saw noticeable increases here in the holidays 
and through Q1 versus that 5% or 6%
 
you mentioned back on the Q3 call. 
Is the new ad load we are seeing sustainable, do you think, going forward?
 
And, second, maybe Mark or Sheryl, can you just talk a little bit about 
timing for monetization of Instagram? Are there any thresholds, either in
 
terms of users, user engagement, whatnot, before you can ramp that 
advertising, or advertise on that platform? I think, David, you were talking 
earlier about maybe reaching a billion, but I think that was a general 
comment. Thanks.
 
David Ebersman
 
Yeah, th
anks Youssef. So as Mark sort of alluded to earlier as it relates to ad 
load, what we're trying to do is optimize across multiple variables that really 
produce the best experience for people who use the network and help us to 
grow the business.
 
And ad load
 
is one of the variables that we look at. And of course we also 
look at things like the size of the ad, the prominence of the ads and of 
course the quality of the ads. And what we're trying to do is to continually 
really tweak all of those variables and th
en measure what impacts we're 
having on engagements, on feedback from people, on revenue and trying to 
optimize using that data and the changes that we've made.
 
And I think the story there is a really good one. Things continue to go very 
well obviously in 
terms of revenue what you see, but also in terms of 
engagement, in terms of feedback we get from people when we survey 
them. So we think we remain in a really very strong position in that way.
 
Actually we'd not validate the assertion that you gave that the
 
ad load 
increased dramatically in the timeframe you described since that's not 
consistent in aggregate with our data.
 
What I can say is that, every person who uses Facebook has their own 
experience and the experience including the ad experience is persona
lized 
based on the other content we have available based on how much they've 
engaged with ads we've shown in the past etcetera.
 
So, ideally we'd like to personalize not just the organic content that you see, 
but also your ad experience in a way that's real
ly optimized for you and your 
interests.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On Instagram, Instagram is a great product. I think that's why we see so 
much engagement from people who are using it and the gross passing 200 
million.
 
It's also a great advertising product and ther
e's just tons of demand because 
you know, the picture themselves are so visually appealing and also there's 
so much consumer engagement.
 
We're in really early days, we've seen some great results, just to mention 
one, Levi's is running an ad, which is basic
ally pictures of people wearing 
denim in really beautiful outdoor spaces.
 
They targeted people 18 to 34 in United States. Reached over seven million 
people and importantly they drove a 24%
--
 
24 point left in ad recall which 
was three times the control grou
p.
 
So, I think that shows that just as people engage with consumer pictures on 
Instagram, they're going to engaged with the right pictures from marketers. 
That said, we're very focused on consumer growth and we move slowly and 
deliberately in monetization.
 
So, we don't see the need or the urge to ramp this as quickly as we possibly 
could but really want to grow it slowly, grow it deliberately and continue the 
growth on the consumer side and a great returns for marketers.

Thanks, I appreciate the chance to ask two questions. The first one is, I 
wonder if there's any way we can generalize or correlate around the growth 
in mobile monetizat
ion with the shift to 4G LTE, and whether this could be a 
driver, as well, of improving monetization internationally, as those higher
-
speed networks are deployed in new markets.
 
And then, secondly, regarding Nearby Friends, just wondering how you plan 
to t
ie that feature and data set into more of a commercialized local offering 
for businesses, whether that's geo targeting or other related services. Thank 
you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Well, a lot of what we're trying to do with internet.org is making so that 
everyone has the cellular networks that they need to be able to get on the 
Internet and access basic services, which we think are text
-
based 
communication services, whether it's things like social networks or 
messaging or email or search, whether stock pri
ces,
--
 
like basic stuff like 
that, that people will use on a day
-
to
-
day basis, but don't require huge 
amount of data.
 
We're pretty happy with the early progress that we've made. We have a 
multi
-
year initiative to work with operators around the world to rol
l
-
out a 
program where folks can have free basic services. And as I mentioned 
before, a lot of the initial work is the initial partnerships were in the 
Philippines and Paraguay.
 
And what we're really pleased with, even just a few months of work, we 
were abl
e to help almost three million people get access to data for the first 
time.
 
So, there is no doubt that going from having no access to data to having 
some access is a huge jump in terms of the activity on the business that we 
see 
--
 
that's available from p
eople.
 
Moving towards things like LTE later on in the funnel, will be helpful as we 
move towards richer types of contents like higher resolution photos and 
videos.
 
so that will be important especially as the mix of content that people share 
moves towards t
he richer media. But we're really focused on both and we 
have a huge investment as well and the internet.org starting just making 
sure that everyone in the world gets connected.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
And Nearby Friends, it's a great new features, is an optional 
feature we just 
rolled out last week, I don't know if, people have had a chance to try it yet. 

to be able to offer.
 
We use the information like this to enhance all the services 
we provide, and 
make things more relevant including relevant ads.

Your next question comes from Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Your line

Pivotal Research
 
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First of all, I was wonderi
ng, with regard 
to the WhatsApp acquisition, I was wondering if you could update us on the 
status, if the current situation with Russia poses any issues given the 
development team space there. And then, separately, I was wondering if 
you could talk Nielsen
 
and the use of OCR with respect to advertisers' 
interest in using OCR tools. Do you find that that's making a difference at 
the present time in terms of brands spending money with you, in general?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On the first, yeah, the development team i
s located in Mountain View not in

Pivotal Research
 
And they are doing extremely well.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Yes, they're doing really well.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
The deal has been closed. We don't have anything to share. But I just would 
jus
t point you to a blog post that Jan wrote. I think it was yesterday 
announcing that they just help to connect 0.5 billion monthly asset. We're 
growing very quickly. So I think that's up to about 460 million monthly is 
just a couple of months ago when we an
nounced the deal was done in the 
first place.
 
David Ebersman
 
And I think that Jan specifically called out a few countries including Russia 
and Brazil and I think India is some of the fastest growing markets for 
WhatsApp. So I'd just direct you that stateme
nt and you should read that for 
more information on how they're doing and we'll update you more when the 
deal closes.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
And Nielsen OCR anything that helps advertisers measure their spend is 
really important. I've talked on the call a bunch a
bout how measuring online 
and in
-
store sales really matters. It also matters to marketers to be able to 
measure their spend compared to other investments they can make.
 
And what OCR has done, it's given advertisers and marketers comparability 
between TV an
d digital and our spend. I think in those comparisons we do 

why we see growing interest from clients.

Deutsche Bank. Your line

Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me now? Okay, Just two quick 
questions. Facebook's on pace to represent around 20% of global display 
advertising or non search
 
advertising in 2014. Do you view that as your 
addressable market?
 
And, if so, what do you see as the potential market share you guys can 
capture relative to the 
--
 
I think, Sheryl, you said it is 23% mobile 
consumption, ex
-
China, globally today. And then 
the second question is, 
there's been some press recently that Facebook is looking at building peer
-
to
-
peer money transfer services. Is that a market that you view as an 
opportunity? Would that fit into Messenger or potentially a standalone app?
 
Sheryl Sand
berg
 
We had our payments business for a while and we continue to have one and 
nothing new to apps there.
 
On the first question, I think our adjustable market is much bigger than 

shift from consumer time. So last year was the very first time those lines 
crossed and consumers spent more time in digital, which is mobile and 
desktop than they did on TV.
 
That continues to grow, so where we are right now is, the average U.S. 
consumer as
 
an example spent 4.5 hours per day on TV but five and three 

 
That means that as consumer time and attention shifts, we think ad budget 
shift as well particularly if you have good mobile ad produc
ts and you can 
measure results.
 
So we definitely believe there will be and continuous to be a shift happening. 
I talked about a print shift happening with that example of Sport Chek in 
Canada. But we see this across the board that marketers are looking for
 
the 
highest ROI they can find and they should be comparing us and everyone 
else across and they do that not just across digital but across print, across 
radio, across TV, across any other vehicle they can.
 
I think our investments and measurement really pa
y
-
off here. We say to our 
clients all around the world, we want to earn your business because we want 
to be the best dollar and the best minute you send because both their 
dollars and their time are so valuable.
 
And we want them to compare us to the other 
investments that could make 
to see who can drive the most value to the bottom line and that's what we 
are focused on and that goes way beyond digital.

Great. Thanks for the questions. Just wondered if you could discuss how 
Facebook's potential mobile ad network would provide additional value to 
advertisers than other ex
isting mobile ad networks.
 
And then just a second question for David. I don't know if you could help 
quantify what meaningfully lower year

over

year ad revenue growth is, or 
just give us a sense of how to think about it for modeling purposes. Thank 
you.
 
Sh
eryl Sandberg
 
On the ad network, we are in very testing for mobile ad network. We do see 
a big opportunity here. We think because we're people based, we have an 
opportunity first to provide greater reach for marketers and developers who 
are working with Fa
cebook across other platforms, but also improve the 
relevance of the ads people see both on and off Facebook.
 
And I think that has been our core advantage and will continue to be. That 
said, it's really early days and we're on the early testing phase.
 
Davi
d Ebersman
 
Yes John, obviously the Q1 ad revenues growth here was 82% which is 
fantastic and a real tribute to the team and the platform. One of the things 
that contributed to that growth rate is the ramp up of newsfeed ads that in 
Q1 of last year was stil
l really early in that part of the journey and so the 
comparison between the state of newsfeed ads in the Q1 we're reporting 
now in a year ago is meaningfully different.
 
As you'll remember from last year, newsfeed ad really ramped up in the 
second quarter 

to impact the comparisons in the subsequent quarters of the year.
 
Having said that, there is lots of things that we're focused on, that will 
continue to drive our ad revenue growth including more u
sers and critically 
more marketer demand. So bringing more marketers into the system, 
improving our products and tools to increase their returns and their ability to 
measure those returns and generally improving the quality and relevance 
and value of the a
d.
 
So those are the things that we'll stay focused on.
 
Deborah Crawford

Thanks, Deborah. And thanks, everyone, for joining today. This was another 
good quarter
 
and a good end to 2016. Our community continues to grow, 
and now with nearly 1.9 billion people using Facebook every month and 
more than 1.2 billion people using it every day. We've seen continued 
growth and engagements on our platform, and our ads busine
ss is doing 
well, too. Total revenue grew by 51% year
-
over
-
year to $8.8 billion, and 
advertising revenue was up 53% to $8.6 billion.
 
Facebook stands for connecting people and creating a global community. 
And, in 2016, more people than ever made their voice
s heard. We saw 
billions of conversations about everything from important elections to the 
Olympics to breaking news stories around the world. And more people are 
taking advantage of new tools to connect and share on our family of apps, 
especially with vid
eo.
 
2016 was also a year that reinforced the importance of connecting the world. 
Today is the five
-
year anniversary of the day we filed to go public. In our 
letter to potential shareholders, I wrote that there is a huge need and a 
huge opportunity to get e
veryone in the world connected, to give everyone a 
voice and to help transform society for the future. I believe that now more 
than ever. And as the largest global community, I see our responsibility as 
very important, and we will continue to focus on doin
g everything we can to 
bring the world closer together.
 
I want to give you an update on our progress over our 3, 5 and 10
-
year time 
horizons, with a particular focus on what we're going to be doing over the 
next three years. I've said before that I see vid
eo as a megatrend on the 
same order as mobile. That's why we're going to keep putting video first 
across our family of apps and making it easier for people to capture and 
share video in new ways.
 
To make it easier to find and watch videos, we've added a ta
b at the bottom 
of the Facebook app with top videos and recommendations. We've already 
rolled the tab out to everyone in the U.S., and we're planning to bring it to 
more countries soon.
 
We're also improving live video as more people use it. New Year's Eve 
was 
our biggest live moment ever, with more people going live than at any other 
time since we launched the product. We're experimenting with Live 360 
video, audio
-
only live for people with slower connections, and live face 
masks and more camera effects, an
d we'll have more updates soon.
 
Finally, we're looking for ways to grow the ecosystem of video content on 
Facebook. We want people to think of Facebook as a place for interesting 
and relevant video content from professional creators as well as their 
friend
s. Last year we started to invest in more original video content to help 
seed the ecosystem, and we're planning to do more in 2017.
 
We're also focused on building a more informed community. We see 
Facebook as a community, and ourselves, our role, as suppor
ting that 
community. We don't write the news that you read, but we want to be a 
place where people can access information and have meaningful 
conversations, and this is a responsibility that we take very seriously.
 
In the past, we've taken steps to reduce 
spam and clickbait, and now we're 
approaching misinformation and hoaxes the same way. In Q4, we started 
working with third
-
party fact
-
checkers in the U.S. to flag disputed stories 
and make them less likely to appear in News Feed. We've made it easier to 
re
port and identify misinformation and we're working to build stronger ties 
between Facebook and the news industry.
 
Our primary goal here is to do the right thing for our community. If we can 
help people stay informed and make Facebook a better place to unde
rstand 
what's going on in the world, then we think that's going to make our 
community stronger and a more positive force for good in the world. So 
that's the three
-
year update.
 
Over the next five years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around 
our ap
ps that a lot of people are already using. Growth and engagement on 
Instagram have been strong. We announced in December that Instagram 
now has over 600 million monthly actives and recently passed 400 million 
daily actives. Instagram Stories reached 150 mi
llion daily actives just five 
months after the launch, and we've added new features like Boomerang and 
Live into Stories and I'm excited to see that continue to grow.
 
Our messaging services are making good progress as well. In Q4, Messenger 
launched a new 
camera, group video chat for up to 50 people, and games. 
400 million people now use voice and video chat on Messenger every month.
 
WhatsApp is growing quickly, too. We recently reached 1.2 billion monthly 
actives and more than 50 billion messages are sent 
through WhatsApp every 
day. In the last quarter, we also added the ability to make video calls in the 
app.
 
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in these platforms 
and technologies that is going to give more people a voice and make shar
ing 
even more immersive. Through our efforts with Internet.org, we have now 
connected more than 50 million people to the Internet. And, in November, 
our Connectivity Lab set a world record by transmitting 20 gigabits per 
second over 13 kilometers using the
 
same amount of power that it takes to 
light a single light bulb. Ultimately, this technology is going to make it into 
the solar
-
powered planes that we're building to beam Internet to parts of the 
world that aren't connected.
 
On artificial intelligence, we
 
developed a new technique called style transfer 
that uses AI to study a painting and then can take your photos and videos 
and draw them in that style in real time on your phone. And if you post on 
Facebook looking for a place to eat or suggestions for whe
re to go, we can 
now use AI to understand the text of your post and understand what you're 
asking and surface (07:20) recommendations from the comments.
 
We're still early in our 10
-
year plans for virtual reality, but we've made some 
good progress. In Decem
ber, we shipped our Touch controllers, and the 
community response has been very positive. Samsung announced that 
they've now shipped more than 5 million Gear VRs. And we're bringing more 
social experiences to VR with apps like Oculus Rooms for Gear VR. We'
re 
going to keep making big investments in VR content, and I'm excited about 
what's coming in 2017, from new games to more immersive educational 
experiences.
 
As I said in our call last quarter, we're going to continue to invest and hire 
aggressively to hel
p improve our products, but also to build the 
infrastructure that will help us grow in the future. A few weeks ago, I visited 
our newest data center in Fort Worth, Texas. It's going to be the biggest 
data center we've built, powered by 100% renewable energ
y, and it's a 
great example of the investments that we're making to help us serve our 
community even better.
 
So we've made some good progress, but we have a lot more to do to help 
bring the world together. I want to thank our community, our teams, our 
part
ners, and all of you for being a part of this journey with us.
 
Now here's Sheryl.

Thanks, Mark, and hi everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter capping off a 
great 2016. Q4 ad revenue grew 53%. Mobile ad revenue 
reached $7.2 
billion, up 61% year
-
over
-
year, and was approximately 84% of total ad 
revenue. Our growth this quarter was broad
-
based across all regions, 
marketer segments, and verticals.
 
We're really excited to announce today that 65 million businesses are 
using 
our free Pages product and 5 million are using Instagram Business profiles. 
More and more of these businesses are becoming advertisers with over 4 
million advertising on Facebook and over 500,000 on Instagram. As a result, 
our revenue base is becomin
g more diverse. In Q4, our top 100 advertisers 
represented less than a quarter of our ad revenue, which is a decline from 
Q4 last year.
 
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to 
mobile, growing the number of marketers using
 
our ad products, and 
making our ads more relevant and effective.
 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. In Q4, we saw consumers use 
mobile for more of their holiday shopping. comScore found that mobile drove 
over $1 billion in total Cyber Monday sale
s for the first time ever. Marketers 
are increasingly seeing mobile as the opportunity it is. In 2016, we saw 
more marketers prioritizing mobile and especially mobile video.
 
People consume video differently on mobile, so the best marketers are 
optimizing t
heir creative. For example, Hershey's used Facebook Live and 
Video ads for the launch of their Cookie Layer Crunch. They optimized their 
video ads to grab attention in the first few seconds and used captions for 
people who were viewing without sound. Niels
en Brand Effect measured an 
11 point lift in brand awareness and a 20 point lift in ad recall.
 
We are helping more businesses connect with more people on mobile, both 
on Facebook and off. Last month, we announced that advertisers can reach 
over 1 billion p
eople a month on the Audience Network.
 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad 
products. It's clear that businesses of all sizes are using our platforms to 
reach customers. Two weeks ago, I visited Holzconnection, a family
-
run 
f
urniture maker in Berlin. When competition increased several years ago, the 
owner worried that he might have to close stores. His son joined the family 
business and convinced his father to market on Facebook. Holzconnection 
didn't change anything about the
ir traditional craft, just the way they 
reached customers. Since then, they've opened five new locations both 
domestic and internationally. We want to help more small businesses grow, 
so we've invited companies including Holzconnection to participate in Sm
all 
Business Councils around the world.
 
We continue to invest in making our free and paid products easier to use, 
expanding our online tutorials and offering creative tools to businesses of all 
sizes. For example, the owners of Distinctive Gardens, a garde
ning center in 
Illinois, watched one of our online tutorials and then used their mobile phone 
to shoot a holiday
-
themed video. They sold out their holiday inventory.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is 
to drive val
ue for our clients. As we grow the diversity of businesses on our 
platform, we've invested in building ad products that meet a broad set of 
objectives, from building brands to moving products off shelves online and 
in
-
stores.
 
To make our ad products as rel
evant and effective as possible, we're 
increasingly tailoring them by vertical. In 2016, we invested in Dynamic Ads, 
which allow advertisers to automatically promote products from their entire 
catalog. We expanded Dynamic Ads across Facebook, Instagram, an
d the 
Audience Network, and tailored them for verticals like travel and retail.
 
Dynamic Ads for travel enable businesses to show ads based on dates and 
destinations people are interested in, while Dynamic Ads for retail show 
people the products available a
t nearby locations in real
-
time. Last month, 
we introduced Dynamic Ads for broad audiences to help businesses reach 
new customers based on their interests on Facebook and online behavior. 
We're going to continue to work on building effective ad products an
d 
proving the value they drive.
 
We know that measurement is important to building advertiser trust. Last 
year, we discovered several metrics issues. And while no billable metrics 
were affected, we took action to fix the errors and reviewed all of our 
metri
cs. We also expanded our partnerships with third parties, given the 
important role they play in verification. We're going to continue to invest in 
measurement, including third
-
party partnerships, in the upcoming year.
 
We believe our strong 2016 is because 
of the value we drove for businesses 
on our platforms. We're inspired by the entrepreneurs we work with, like the 
owners of Holzconnection and Distinctive Gardens, and we're grateful for the 
opportunity to help them reach customers, grow their businesses, 
and hire 
more people.
 
With only a small fraction of the businesses on Facebook and Instagram 
advertising, we know we have a lot of opportunity and hard work ahead. In 
2017, we'll stay focused on helping businesses of all sizes reach customers 
around the wo
rld and grow.
 
Thanks. And now here's Dave.

Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. 2016 was another year of 
strong, profitable growth, and we continued to invest in building our 
business for the long term. Full year 2
016 revenue was $27.6 billion and 
grew 54% or 56% on a constant currency basis, and we generated over $10 
billion in GAAP net income.
 
Let's start with our community metrics. In December, 1.23 billion people 
used Facebook on an average day, up 189 million o
r 18% compared to last 
year. 1.86 billion people used Facebook during the month of December, up 
269 million or 17% compared to last year. In addition to our ongoing 
Internet.org and Android product efforts, we benefited from an increase in 
third
-
party prom
otional free data plans in Asia and rest of the world.
 
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.15 billion people accessing 
Facebook on mobile on an average day in December, up 212 million or 23% 
compared to last year. Given that the vast majority of m
onthly and daily 
usage now occurs on mobile devices, my comments will focus on total MAU 
and DAU beginning next quarter. And we do not plan to include mobile and 
mobile
-
only usage breakdowns in our supplemental investor materials after 
this quarter.
 
Turnin
g now to the financials. My prepared remarks will focus on our GAAP 
results unless otherwise noted. As I have noted before, we focus on GAAP 
results because stock
-
based compensation plays an important role in how 
employees are compensated in our business a
nd industry more broadly, and 
we view it as a real expense. Q4 total revenue was $8.8 billion, up 51%. Q4 
ad revenue was $8.6 billion, up 53% or 54% on a constant currency basis.
 
Mobile ad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 61%, and represented approximately 
84%
 
of total ad revenue. Desktop ad revenue grew 22%, despite a decline 
in desktop usage, helped by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on 
advertisements served on personal computers.
 
The same supply and demand factors we have discussed in the past
 
continue 
to drive our mobile ads revenue. On the demand side, we continued to 
improve our targeting, measurement and ad formats to drive strong results 
for marketers. As Sheryl mentioned, these efforts are working for an 
increasingly broad set of advertis
ers.
 
On the supply side, growth in users, time spent, and ad load also 
contributed to our strong results. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 
3% and the total number of ad impressions served increased 49%, driven 
primarily by mobile feed ads on Faceb
ook and Instagram. Payments and 
other fees revenue was $180 million, down 12%. Q4 total expenses were 
$4.2 billion, up 29%. We ended the year with approximately 17,000 
employees, up 34% compared to last year and an increase from the 31% 
growth rate last qu
arter.
 
Q4 operating income was $4.6 billion, representing a 52% margin. Our tax 
rate was 21%. Note that our tax rate reflects our early adoption of a new 
accounting standard ASU 2016
-
9. Under this standard, the tax benefit 
related to the difference between
 
the vesting price and the grant price of 
RSUs is now reflected in our income tax provision, whereas previously it was 
reflected as an adjustment to equity. This is purely an accounting convention 
change and does not change the cash taxes we pay. Excluding
 
the impact of 
this new standard, our Q4 GAAP tax rate would have been approximately 
26% and in line with the guidance we provided on the Q3 call.
 
Net income was $3.6 billion or $1.21 per share. Full year 2016 capital 
expenditures were approximately $4.5 b
illion, up 78%, as we continue to 
invest to support the rapid growth of the business around the world.
 
Over the course of 2016, we expanded four of our existing data centers and 
began construction of four new data centers. In 2016, we generated over 
$11.6 
billion in free cash flow and ended the year with $29.4 billion in cash 
and investments.
 
Also note that the new accounting standard changed how we present 
operating cash flow and the free cash flow calculation. In the past, we 
treated the excess tax benefi
t as a financing cash flow item and thus was 
not included in either cash flow metric. Adoption of this standard also 
resulted in a retrospective adjustment to certain 2016 quarterly financial line 
items. For more detail on these adjustments, please refer t
o the 
supplemental earnings slides available on our investor website.
 
Turning now to the outlook. First, on revenue, the outlook is unchanged. 
Consistent with my comments on the Q3 call, we continue to expect that our 
ad revenue growth rate will come 
down meaningfully in 2017. The factors 
driving this expectation remain the same. We also expect that our full year 
2017 payments and other fees revenue will decline compared to full year 
2016.
 
Second, on expenses. Consistent with what I said last quarter, 
we expect 
that 2017 will be an aggressive investment year. We saw hiring growth 
accelerate in Q4, and we plan to accelerate hiring further in 2017 from the 
34% growth rate. In addition to head count, we expect to increase 
investments in R&D, content, sales
 
and marketing and other areas as we 
execute on our near, medium and long
-
term priorities.
 
We expect that full year 2017 total GAAP expenses will grow 40% to 50% 
compared to the full year 2016. We anticipate that full year 2017 share
-
based compensation exp
enses will be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 
billion, approximately $1.3 billion of which is related to acquisitions, most 
notably WhatsApp.
 
We also expect full year 2017 amortization expenses to be approximately 
$700 million to $800 million. Accordi
ngly, on a non
-
GAAP basis, we would 
expect total expenses to grow approximately 47% to 57% compared to the 
full year 2016.
 
We anticipate our expense growth rates will increase over the course of the 
year. We expect our full year 2017 capital expenditures w
ill be in the range 
of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, as we fund the expansion of data center capacity 
and office facilities to support the continued rapid growth of our business.
 
Turning now to tax. At current stock prices, we expect that our full year 
2017 
GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates will be one to two percentage points 
lower than our respective 2016 tax rates. Let me note two additional factors 
with the new standard. First, our tax rate will vary based on stock price. And 
secondly, we anticipate the tax rat
e will start to lower in Q1 and then trend 
up throughout the year.
 
Before wrapping up, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter, our board of 
directors authorized a $6 billion stock repurchase program beginning in 2017 
with no fixed expiration date. Our main p
riority is to invest aggressively to 
grow the business while maintaining a strong cash position. At this time, the 
company's strong balance sheet and financial performance puts us in a 
position to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock from tim
e 
to time to help offset the dilution incurred through equity issuance.
 
To conclude, 2016 was a strong year for Facebook in terms of community 
growth, engagement, product innovation and the growth of our advertising 
business. We believe we have significant
 
opportunities ahead of us as we 
invest in our mission to make the world more open and connected.
 
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.

We will now open the lines for a question

Your first 
question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

Thanks for taking my question. Mark, it's been a couple of quarters that 
you've talked about video first. Can you just talk about the strategi
c 
importance of longer
-
form content? And then also how do you think about 
that in terms of distribution platforms both on the Facebook mobile app and 
then through other distribution formats as well? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
We're foc
using more on shorter
-
form content to start. So the thesis that we 
have now is that there were different parts of short
-
term content. There is 
the type of content that people will produce socially for friends. There's 
promotional content that businesses an
d celebrities and folks will produce. 
But there's also a whole class of premium content that the creators need to 
get paid a good amount in order to support the creation of that content, and 
we need to be able to support that with a business model, which w
e're 
working on through ads to fund that. So the biggest change that I think that 
we're going to see on the consumption in News Feed and in the tab over the 
next year or two is going to be much more video inventory and content 
coming in as we work through 
and make that business model start to really 
click for a lot of folks.
 
Over the longer term, I think as that works, people will experiment with 
longer forms of video as well and all kinds of different things. But that, I 
think, is the primary focus for the
 
foreseeable future.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah. And Doug, I think you asked about platforms. I mean we've always 
been focused on a variety of 

 
getting our services on a variety of platforms, 
but main focus is obviously on mobile.

Your
 
next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan 
Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one Mark is on 
Instagram, the 400 million daily active users. Curious to be 

 
hear (24:39) 
h
ow you think about the core use of Instagram now and how it differs from 
core Facebook. And how do you think about that evolving over time and the 
monetization of Instagram evolving over time? And then the second one, 
just to go back to Doug's question on 
the content, I know Dave, you 
mentioned content spend as being part of the investment. Should we think 
about the content investment as being more driven on rev share or do you 
see yourselves going out and writing and doing licensing deals? Thanks so 
much.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I can start on that latter question. Our goal really is to kick
-
start an 
ecosystem of partner content in the video tab, for example, and our model is 
really oriented towards revenue share with creators. We are funding some 
feed content to get the ecosystem going, but the focus is on rev share. And 
then I think your question was on how the core use case between Facebook 
and Instagram differs.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah, I can take that one. There are a numbe
r of differences. I think a lot of 
this comes down to the graphs in the community that you have in the 
different places. Instagram is a follow model, right, so it's 

 
they're not all 
bidirectional friendships. A larger portion of the content is public cont
ent. 
More of the content is visual, right. Facebook has a mix of text and news 
and links and visual content like photos and videos. And Instagram creates a 
pure experience that's focused on photos and videos. So all those good and 
subtle decisions that Kev
in has made over the years add up to creating a 
different kind of community that what we're finding and that's great, is that 
it's really complementary to what people are doing on Facebook.
 
And some of what we found is that as we encourage people to use bo
th 
Facebook and Instagram, engagement on both can increase. So that is 
great. And that I think speaks to how you can build these different kinds of 
communities with different connections in a way that really is creating new 
value in people's lives.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
 
Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, sticking on the same theme as 
what Doug and Brian just talked about. Sheryl, for you; would love to 
get a 
sense of how you think about some of the opportunities and challenges 
sitting ahead of the business now on monetizing all of the video that's being 
consumed on Facebook. And then maybe, Dave, for you. When we think 
about the P&L impacts of both monet
izing video and investing in video, is 
there anything we should be thinking about or you want to call out in terms 
of gross versus net on either the revenue side or the revenue share side that 
could be leading to mix shift to incremental revenue growth but
 
possibly 
lower margin revenue coming into the business? Thanks so much.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

On the video ad opportunity, we're seeing consumer video exploding on our 
platform, as Mark has talked about, and that really creates the opportuni
ty 
for video ads in the feed. And a lot of this happens within the current News 
Feed product. People post videos. People consume News Feed stories. Those 
stories include video stories from consumers, and then we have an 
opportunity to serve ads.
 
As consume
r video has grown in News Feed, it's given us that opportunity 
for video ads because the format of the ads fits the format of what 
consumers are doing. And we're seeing a lot of great examples of people 
using ads in the feed across Instagram and News Feed.
 
In terms of monetizing some of our newer attempts at products in News 
Feed such as Ad Break, those are really in early experimental stages, and for 
now, we're really focused primarily on our core business, our core ad 
products, of which video is one.
 
One 
of the things that's really important in this is helping marketers 
understand that they need to optimize those video ads. An ad that works 
really well 30 seconds in other platforms and more traditional platforms can 
work on ours, but the ones that are opti
mized and use our targeting really 
perform better. And we're working hard with advertisers to help them see 
that.
 
So to share one example, Motorola working with Ogilvy and Moto Mento 
(28:55) launched the Moto Z phone, and they did awareness boosting before
 
they launched, targeting Android users and Verizon subscribers. And they 
optimized their video for the Facebook and Instagram mobile feeds. And 
then after they launched, they did purchasing ads and re
-
targeted people 
who had viewed those initial ads.
 
That
's just a great example of someone using video ads, optimizing a 
format, but also using the pretty unique targeting we can offer to drive 
sales. They measured that they had over a 3.5% lift in sales driven by the 
Facebook and Instagram video ads. And so we
're pretty excited about the 
opportunity we have in our current business, and we're going to work client 
by client to get the video format of those ads right, get the targeting to be 
as good and as deep as it can be and make sure we're measuring all the wa
y 
through to sales.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
And Eric, you were asking about content and where that's going to get 
picked up in the P&L. There's no real simple answer in that. I would say in 
general where we're going to be, rev sharing with creator
s, that's going to 
be picked up in cost of revenue. So that's probably the simplest answer.
 
But as we do arrangements to get the ecosystem going, some of that could 
get picked up in sales and marketing, and then we have content as well 
that's getting picke
d up in R&D for the efforts we're making with Oculus. So 
you're seeing some of those get spread across several different lines in the 
P&L, so it's not going to be a clean one spot where you're going to find it.

Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
 
John Blackledge 
-
 
Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of questions. With the strategic shift to video, 
how do you view the state of the digital/mobile video 
measurement? Any 
callout on improvements being done industry wide and within Facebook? And 
then just on video search, could you just comment on improvements in 
video search capabilities for users? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Sheryl, do you 
want to take the question on video measurement and...
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
...how that's evolving?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah. So new platforms demand new measurement, and so people are 
me
asuring all kinds of different things from viewability to how many people 
see the ad to how long they run the ad. We're focused on all of these 
metrics and working hard with third parties and with our advertiser to get 
those metrics right.
 
We really 
believe that at the end of the day what matters the most is all the 
way through to sales. What matters the most is the A/B test that these 
people saw ads on Facebook and Instagram, these people didn't, and here's 
the sales lift. And all of the other metric
s, although important and we're 
working hard, are proxy metrics, and those metrics are going through a 
platform shift that we need to work on.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
And then, Mark.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
And for video search 

 
s
earch is a big priority and a thing that we're working 
on across all of the different verticals, not just video but also all the posts on 
Facebook, all of the content that people are selling in Marketplace, the 
groups that people are joining and sharing an
d all the news content. And it's 
an area that we've been working on for a while. It's growing steadily and 
doing well, and we hope to have more updates on that soon.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
 
Mark A. May 
-
 
Citig
roup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thanks for taking my questions. I think the first one might be directed at 
Sheryl. Your reported pricing metric, I realize there's typically been noise in 
that. I think it's up 3% year
-
on
-
year. First of all, is that sort of 
repres
entative for general pricing changes in the Marketplace? And do you 
think that there's still room for upside in pricing? And if so, where are some 
of the key areas where you see that coming from?
 
And then another question on video. As you've begun to push 
more video 
content to users within the Facebook app itself, are you witnessing any 
meaningful changes in engagement, time spent with a typical Facebook app 
user? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Mark, it's Dave. I can take those on the metrics. 
From the price
-
volume 
perspective, yeah, the price per ad increased modestly 3%. There's lots of 
different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really 

 
continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right
-
hand column ads, 
whic
h are lower price and lower value. And then, obviously impression 
growth is driven by the users' time spent in ad load.
 
In terms of the opportunities for price, it's really just continuing to focus on 
making our ads better targeted, more relevant, improvin
g all the different 
ways in which we can drive better outcomes for our advertisers and sort of 
meeting them with the results that they care about and delivering those 
results. We think there's 

 
continue to be great opportunities to do that, and 
how the su
pply
-
demand dynamics play out will kind of impact the overall 
direction of price. And it's going to depend obviously also on regional mixes 
too, because some regions have obviously lower prices.
 
I think the other question was on video. Video is one of the 
big drivers of 
engagement growth on Facebook. It's also helpful on Instagram where we're 
also seeing the benefit of ranking changes. So we continue to see good 
engagement and time spent growth across the Facebook family and on just 
Facebook, and video is a
 
part of that story. So it's an important part of that 
story.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. A couple things. First, we had a lot of poli
tical activity obviously in 
Q4. Did that contribute anything abnormally to revenues or users? Second 
question, and I know you'll be getting a lot of this over the next two or three 
months, but just any difference on trends 

 
Millennials on the platform 
ver
sus other cohorts or groups? Just thinking about how those are trending 
versus the other groups. And then finally, I think we've seen some ads on 
Messenger being tested in certain regions of the world. Any commentary on 
that would be helpful. Thank you.
 
Sh
eryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah. I'll take a few of those. So on elections, we run a very large and 
diversified business. So there are these events that are obviously big like the 
U.S. elections, the World Cup, Super Bowl, but there are enough of th
ese all 
around the world that no one event is that big for our business. Even last 
quarter, political spending even within the U.S. alone was not a top
-
10 
vertical for us.
 
When you think about ads in Messenger, we right now are really focused on 
consumer g
rowth and engagement because we know that over time that 
creates the monetization opportunity. We're seeing a lot of organic 
connections between businesses and consumers. We're now per month at a 
billion messages sent between people and businesses, and we 
think that's 
very promising for our ability for people to use this platform to make those 
connections that will ultimately drive business opportunities.
 
We're in the very early stages, some of those ads you're seeing of exploring 
how to build more of these
 
connections. But right now, we're going to 
remain focused on user experience and the experimentation we're doing.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah. And Justin, just adding to the question on elections, I'd also point out 
that our reported daily activ
e and monthly active numbers reflect usage in 
December. So even for the U.S. that doesn't really pick up the election 
period just because of the way that we tabulate those results.
 
On Millennials, we were really pleased 

 
this was a fantastic quarter for 
o
verall growth of the Facebook community, our strongest absolute MAU and 
DAU additions year
-
over
-
year since being a public company, so really 
pleased with that. So within that context, we're not breaking out specific 
cohorts, but we remain a great place for
 
advertisers to reach Millennials. And 
Instagram is obviously another great place to reach Millennials, and we 
continue to build our products to serve a wide variety of audiences, including 
Millennials as well.

Your next question comes from the li
ne of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital

David, I think you just talked about these pretty material increases in MAUs. 
Could I ask two questions? The Asia area MAU growth in particular 

 
I think 
it was 
something like 44 million sequentially, that's the biggest that I think 
you've ever had. So could you just talk about was there some particular 
markets in particular region there that added to it? And then talking Asia, 
could you just comment, Mark, on Chi
na and how you think about it at long
-
term as a market opportunity and your level of optimism that Facebook can 
have a material presence in that market in 5 to 10 years? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So, Mark, Asia benefits proba
bly more than any other region around 
the sort of three factors that I called out in my prepared remarks. And those 
are Internet.org efforts, Android product improvements that we've continued 
to make a big area like Android 

 
Facebook Lite platform on Andr
oid has 
been a great grower for us. But then particularly in the fourth quarter, one 
of the callouts that we've seen, an increase in third
-
party promotional free 
data plans in places like India. So that clearly is having an impact in APAC 
and India was our
 
strongest growth market. So that would be something 
that I would say is a little bit more unique this past quarter.

Yeah. Sorry. Mark's going to take China second (39:12).
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Sure. So as I've said a number of times before, our mission is to connect 
everyone in the world, and it's hard to do that over the long term if we don't 
find a 
way to serve more than a billion people who live in China. So that's 
certainly a thing that we're going to look out at over the long term. In the 
specific time horizon that you mentioned, I think it's really hard to predict 
how this will play out or what w
e will end up doing. But one of the big things 
that we need to think about here is, of course, we're only going to do this in 
a way that we're comfortable with over the long term. So this is something 
that we're going to continue engaging in and thinking a
bout, how to move 
forward on, and long
-
term it's very important. But no news at all in the

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman 
Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini 
-
 
Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great. Thank you for taking t
he questions. I had two. I was just wondering, 
Mark, you mentioned similar to how you referenced Facebook and Instagram 
being complementary, how do you think about WhatsApp and Messenger? 
And I'm wondering if there's different paths to monetization over ti
me for 
each of these?
 
And then my second question, I guess, might be for any of you. Just you, 
Dave, have mentioned expectations for slower growth in ad load on core 
Facebook in the second half of this year. How should we think about the 
potential for ad l
oad growth on Instagram? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I'll take Messenger and WhatsApp and you can take ad load. So yes is the 
basic answer that Messenger and WhatsApp serve somewhat different 
utilities for people. WhatsApp really tak
es the place of SMS in a lot of the 
markets where it operates. The graph is based on phone numbers. You're as 
likely to text your barber or someone that you're going to transact with, who 
you would have a phone number with, as you would be a friend. Wherea
s on 
Facebook Messenger, the graph is your friends, and you're more likely to, 
say, wish an acquaintance happy birthday on Facebook Messenger than on 
WhatsApp or you might not have their phone number in the first place.
 
So you can think about some overlap 
in the core use case, you might 
message your close friends and family on either. But what we found in 
general is that if you look at some of the markets that are strongest for both 
of them, they can each grow in those markets, and as messaging has 
become m
ore affordable and more reliable for people, the volumes of 
messaging have just gone through the roof in terms of what people want to 
do.
 
My understanding from looking at a bunch of analytics is that the peak of 
global SMS reached somewhere in the low 20 b
illion messages per day, and 
we already have many times more than that. Three times or more, more 
than that across WhatsApp and Messenger. And, of course, there are other 
messaging products in the world besides these as well. So we're pretty 
confident that
 
this is going to keep on growing.
 
I do think to your point that the monetization paths are going to be 
somewhat different, reflecting the differences in product philosophy. So 
Messenger is much more focused on being an expressive and rich 
environment that
 
has lots of different types of content. Kind of more like 
Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp 
I think is a much more utilitarian experience with a much more stark UI 
where there's just not as much emphasis on having a l
ot of different ways to 
engage.
 
So we did the experiment that you asked about before around ads and 
Messenger and different ways that businesses can interact and there's a lot 
of flexibility around how we can explore there, which is why I think you'll see 
more of that on the Messenger side than on the WhatsApp side in the near 
term. But giving businesses the opportunity to connect in WhatsApp and 
reach the people that they want and eventually have increasingly, hopefully, 
transactional interactions I think 
will be a really useful thing on that platform 
as well.

Heather, it's Dave. Just on Instagram versus Facebook and ad load, clearly 
the biggest driver of our business is core Facebook just in terms of sheer 
size and even she
er contribution to growth. Instagram is growing quicker on 
a percentage basis, but it's much smaller. The ad load opportunities are 
higher on Instagram because Instagram is at a lower ad load than Facebook, 
so there is an opportunity for us to continue to 
grow ad load on Instagram 
probably beyond 

 
in a longer timeframe than there is on Facebook because 
of that disparity in terms of where they are today. But given the scale of 
Facebook and the importance of driving overall revenue, that's why I 
continue to 
express what our expectations are for advertising growth in 
2017 and the reduction in the growth rate that we expect, given the 
potential to grow ad load on Facebook that we expect to come down in 
2017.

Thanks very much. Two for Sheryl, if I could. First of all, Sheryl, when it 
comes to measurement, I'm curious if you could comment on what appear to 
be the really succes
sful efforts you've had in linking on Facebook ad 
exposure to both offline and online sales of your customers. And, I guess, 
when we think across maybe your 1,000 largest clients, any chance you 
could give us a sense of what percentage are utilizing this l
evel of kind of 
advanced measurement in terms of measuring actual sales lift and share 
gains?
 
And then, secondly, just wondering if there's any color around the pretty 
recent rollout of buy buttons on Instagram? Thank you very much.
 
Sheryl K.

Yeah. So when you think on measurement, your question gets to the heart 
of the matter, which is, there's a lot of conversations on what we measure. 
And when you see platform shifts, as you are in the ad market, from more 
tradition
al forms of media to display, to now mobile, we're seeing those 
metrics change, and there's obviously a lot of conversation and a lot of 
concern out there about what we're measuring. We think the answer to all of 
this is to remember that what really matter
s is going all the way through 
from the ad itself to the sale, whether that sale is online or offline. And we 
are working hard to work on the data in a privacy protected way to be able 
to do that. And we're making progress across verticals, across our larg
e 
customers.
 
I don't have the percentage of exactly how many customers are working on 
this type of measurement with us. It's certainly growing. It's certainly 
something we're working on vertical
-
by
-
vertical. But it has really important 
impacts, not just in
 
their ability to serve the right ads to the right person at 
the right time, but also their ability to optimize their ads for our format. That 
once they understand what's really moving their product off shelves, online 
and off, that's where we get to the r
eal work we need to do to optimize the 
ad and really work on the targeting. And so I remain very optimistic. We 
have a lot of hard work to do to get to all of our ad campaigns having that 
kind of measurement. That's going to take a long time. But the more 
we can 
do it, even in studies with each client, the better our ads get.

Oh, buy button. Yeah, sorry. Just to address the buy button. The core of our 
business is really connecting people wit
h what they care about. And so we're 
looking at getting the right message the right time. We've worked hard on 
products ads that get to products. So you've seen us work on dynamic ads, 
carousel ads, estimated store visits. Things that help our ad business 
sell 
products. You are seeing us take other steps like a buy button, like the 
Marketplace launch, which are really aimed at improving some of the 
experiences we think people are trying to have and already having in organic 
ways on Facebook. But the core of
 
our focus is still very much focused on 
ads and how we can do ads at the product level.

Thanks. Just on the OpEx for 2017, you mentioned R&D, conten
t, sales, 
marketing. As we think about R&D and also the talent shortages that are in 
data science and engineering, not to mention the potentially getting worse 
around immigration, et cetera, how should we think about that potentially 
factoring in as we loo
k out through 2017 and maybe a little bit further out? 
Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner

Sure, Ken. I mean, we obviously are focused on hiring top engineering 
talent. It's key to our 2017 goals and executing on our three, five, and 10
-
year roadma
p, the one that Mark outlined. One thing that we're optimistic 
about is our ability to hire technical talent outside of the Bay Area as well as 
in the Bay Area. And that's because we've built up engineering locations in 
key areas like Seattle, London, New 
York, Boston, Tel Aviv. So we've got 
other markets in which we can recruit and grow engineering and other 
technical team. And that's really different from where we were a couple 
years ago. So that's an important part of the infrastructure that we've put in
 
place in the last two years that we're pleased with.

Thanks. Mark, on AI maybe. You mentioned improved recommendations and 
we've interacted with chatbots on Messenger. Maybe curious overall how you 
see artificial intelligence and machine learning processes impacting your 
business over time?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
Well, I think AI is going to be great for the e
xperience that people have in 
our community. So there are a few types of systems here that we're working 
on around understanding content. One is around visual content and the 
other is about language. So, for visual content, we want to be able to look at 
a 
photo and understand what's in it, right, and whether that's something 
that you're going to be interested in, right? And similarly, we want to be able 
look at a video and watch it and understand whether that's something that 
you're going to be interested i
n.
 
And you can imagine that today, we consider putting things in your News 
Feed that you're connected to in some way, right, that are from a friend or a 
page that you're following or that one of your friends likes. But there's no 
reason that we shouldn't b
e able to match you up with any of the millions of 
pieces of content that you might be interested in that gets shared on 
Facebook every day, except for the fact that we don't have the AI 
technology to know what those are about and if they match your intere
st 
today. So, a combination of being able to understand the text that people 
message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the 
videos, look at the photos, are going to be great, too.
 
Another area where I'm really excited about this is
 
our ability to keep the 
community safe, right? So there's an increasing focus on objectionable 
content, right, and a lot of unfortunate things, right, that people share on 
Facebook. And it's a minority of the content, but I'm really focused on 
making sure
 
that our company gets faster at taking the bad stuff down. And 
we can do better with people, but ultimately the best thing that we can do is 
build AI systems that can watch a video and understand that it's going to be 
problematic and violate the policies 
of our community and that people aren't 
going to want to see it and then just not show it to people before bad 
experiences happen and things like violence gets spread through 

 
violent 
content gets spread through the network.
 
So I think it's both going to 
be 

 
AI is both going to be great on showing 
people content that's really good and helping us enforce the community 
standards that we have to make sure that everyone has a good and fair 
experience.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott D

Hi. Thanks. I have two questions for Mark. Wondering, Mark, if you could 
talk a bit more about the new video tab, just early engagement trends, user 
feedback, and really just how the product wo
rks in terms of categorization of 
content, user preference targeting, and maybe how the content flows into 
the tab versus being in the News Feed and, to the extent, that there's 
duplication there.
 
And then separately, VR and AR continues to be in the 10
-
ye
ar vision for the 
business. Mark, I was wondering if you could provide some detail on what 
you think the friction points are that are keeping that from being on a more 
accelerated commercialization path. Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
So I'll take video first and then I can talk about VR as well. So, for the video 
tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that 
when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's 
going on 
with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure 
that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place 
knowing that that's going to show them all the content that they're 
interested in.
 
So that's a pretty different in
tent than how people come to Facebook today. 
Today, for the most part, people pull Facebook out when they have a few 
minutes, when they want to catch up and see what's going on in the world 
with their friends and in the news and everything that's going on.
 
That's 
very different from saying, hey, I want to watch video content now. And 
that's what I think we're going to unlock with this tab.
 
So, all of the content that is on Facebook is eligible to go in the tab. I mean, 
we're showing video content, not all t
he rest of it, but there isn't a concrete 
difference between what can be a News Feed and what can be here. It's just 
that the experience is designed to deliver on that promise of, you want to 
watch videos, you want to keep up with the content that you watc
h 
episodically week
-
over
-
week, this is going to the place where you go to do 
that.
 
I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really 
starts to click here, right? Because a lot of the best episodic content is 
professionally cre
ated, and those folks need to make a good amount of 
money in order to support their business model. So having mid
-
roll ads, 
we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user 
experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that
 
I think is 
going to take us to the next level.
 
The early trends are good, but I think this is really going to be an area that 
is proportional to the amount of quality content that is in the system, and 
the business model is really going to be the thing th
at enables that.
 
All right. Sorry. I forgot about that for a second. All right. So VR and AR, 
what can accelerate that? I think that there are parts of this that are on a 
good trajectory and parts where we're a little behind where we would want 
to be.
 
I th
ink Samsung shipping 5 million Gear VRs. I mean, that's their product, 
not ours, but we build technology that powers it. I think that's quite a good 
result, right, and one that we're very happy with, and just shows how strong 
of a company Samsung is at bei
ng able to build these products and sell them 
through into the world.
 
On the side of the products that we built, Rift and Touch were both a little 
delayed, so that was obviously somewhat of a disappointment. And if you 
want to accelerate development, obvio
usly, we need to get our products in 
the market at a good pace. But in terms of the content development, I 
actually think that that's coming at a reasonable clip.
 
Early on, there is this issue, which is that if you're a AAA game developer, 
until there's a 
certain volume of units in the field, you're not going to be able 
to make enough money to fund your game development just based off of 
people buying your content. So that's why we're investing so much capital in 
content to feed the ecosystem and solve this
 
chicken and egg problem if you 
need the content in order to create the ecosystem. But I don't think that 
there is really a strategy to pull this in from 10 years to five, I just think it's 
going to be a 10
-
year thing.
 
The analogy that I always use is the 
first smartphones came out in 2003, 
right, the BlackBerry and Palm Treo, and it took 10 years to get to 1 billion 
units. And, I mean, I don't know if there was something that folks could 
have done to make that happen fast, but I think that was pretty good.
 
And, 
I mean, if we can be on a similar trajectory of anywhere near 10 years for 
VR and AR, then I would feel very good about that, and I feel like we're 
making the right bets now to plant the seeds for that. But I would ask for 
the patience of the investo
r community in doing that because we're going to 
invest a lot in this, and it's not going to return or be really profitable for us 
for quite a while.

Thanks a lot for fitting me in. A couple for Mark. Mark, just on the theme of 
video, given the strong cash position that Facebook has, the cash on t
he 
balance sheet, the free cash flow generation of the company, are there any 
possible acquisitions out there that you think would or could supercharge 
your growth in the video space, in the original content space, given this 
evolution?
 
And maybe along tho
se lines, what do you think about live sports in terms of 
the video use case? Is that working on Facebook? You've experimented with 
NBA games on Facebook outside the U.S., NBA D

League on Facebook, so 
just wanted to get your thoughts on how those have gone
. Thanks a lot.

So, Anthony, I can just take the first part of that at least, which is 

 
look, 
our focus is on kick

starting the ecosystem here for the video tab that Mark 
talked about. We're looking at a wide range of cont
ent, and we're really 
working towards a revenue share model with creators. We're certainly going 
to be seeding content to get the ecosystem going, but that's not about doing 
big deals. So we're certainly looking at a variety of different types of content 
t
o look at.

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Despite facing 
important challenges, our community and business
 
are off to a strong start 
in 2018. More than 2.2 billion people now use Facebook every month, and 
more than 1.4 billion people use it every day. Our business grew 49% year
-
over
-
year to $12 billion. But as you know, we have important issues to 
address.
 
For
 
most of our existence, we've focused on all the good that connecting 
people can bring. But it's clear now we didn't do enough to prevent these 
tools from being used for harm as well, whether that's foreign interference in 
elections, fake news, hate speech
, or app developers and data privacy. So 
now, we're going through every part of our relationship with people and 
making sure we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility, not just 
to build tools, but to make sure those tools are used for good. Th
is means 
continuing to invest heavily in safety, security and privacy.
 
Some of this will come in the form of new technology. We're restricting that 
data developers can access. We're building advanced AI tools that have 
helped us detect and remove tens of t
housands of fake accounts ahead of 
the elections in France, Germany and Alabama last year. We're investing 
more in people. We are doubling our team working on security and content 
review to more than 20,000 people by the end of this year, and this includes
 
content reviewers with specific language skills to detect hate speech in 
places like Myanmar. We're also working to protect political discourse by 
making ads more transparent.
 
We recently announced that from now on we will require everyone running 
politic
al and issue ads or running a large page to be verified with a 
government ID. And we're also starting to roll out ads transparency tools 
that bring our ads to an even higher standard of transparency than TV or 
print ads. You'll be able to see who is runnin
g a political ad, who they're 
targeting, how much they're paying, and what other messages they're 
sending to different people. And we're going to get this done in time for the 
2018 U.S. midterm as well as upcoming elections in Mexico, Brazil, India, 
Pakist
an and more.
 
We have a responsibility to keep our community safe and secure, and we're 
going to invest heavily to do that. At the same time, we also have a 
responsibility to keep moving forward and keep building tools that bring 
people together in meaningf
ul new ways. That's what makes Facebook so 
important to so many people and that's our responsibility too.
 
I'm proud that more than 2 billion people use our services to stay connected 
with the people that matter to them most. In just the last several months
, 
we've seen the #metoo movement and the March for Our Lives, organized, 
at least in part, on Facebook. We've seen people come together after 
Hurricane Harvey to raise more than $20 million for relief, and we've seen 
more than 80 million small businesses u
se Facebook to grow and create 
jobs.
 
That's why beyond the investments we're making to secure our platform, 
we're going to invest even more in building the experiences that bring 
people together on Facebook in the first place. Over the next three years, 
we
're going to keep building Facebook to not only be a service that people 
love to use, but also one that's good for people and good for society.
 
Last quarter, we shared our well
-
being research into the good and bad uses 
of technology that showed that when y
ou use the internet to interact and 
build relationships that's correlated with greater long
-
term well
-
being and 
greater health and happiness over time. But when you're just passively 
watching videos or news online, that's not as positive.
 
This quarter, we'
ve continued shifting from passive consumption to 
encouraging meaningful interaction. It's still early, but we're starting to see 
some signs that this is working. Some types of sharing are increasing even 
as passive consumption of video is down. And at the
 
same time, we're rolling 
out more interactive video features like Watch Party that let you watch video 
with your friend. This is something we can uniquely do and the feedback on 
it so far is great.
 
Groups is also a major focus for us. This quarter, we ann
ounced that 200 
million people are now members of meaningful groups on Facebook. Now we 
just need to keep doubling that for the next few years to reach our goal of 
helping 1 billion people belong to meaningful groups. As membership in 
physical groups conti
nues declining as it has for decades, we hope helping 
people connect online will help strengthen our society's social fabric.
 
Stories is also a big part of the future of video sharing, which is why we're 
all in on it across our family. Instagram was the fi
rst to really take off here, 
Facebook started slower, but is now growing quickly, too, and WhatsApp 
Status is by far the biggest of views products and continues to grow quickly. 
There's also a clear trend towards sharing with smaller groups, which is why 
m
essaging is so important. Between WhatsApp and Messenger, people now 
send almost 100 billion messages every day. They also do more than 3 
billion minutes of video and voice calling every day, making us by far the 
largest network for video calling as well.
 
Over the next five years, we're focused on building out the business 
ecosystems around our apps like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. This 
quarter, we released WhatsApp Business, which lets small businesses create 
a presence and offers better tools for m
essaging. And in just a few months 
more than 3 million people are actively using WhatsApp Business. It's a hit 
and it's growing quickly.
 
One of the interesting opportunities and challenges over the coming years 
will be making sure that ads are as good in S
tories as they are in feeds. If 
we don't do this well, then as more sharing shifts to Stories, that could hurt 
our business. But there's real upside here, too, if we do a good job. And 
we're leading the way here with Instagram, and the results so far are 
p
romising both on product quality and business performance.
 
Over the next 10 years, we're continuing to work on the long
-
term 
technology that we need to break down barriers and bring the world closer 
together. We continue to work on connectivity and our Int
ernet.org efforts 
have now helped almost 100 million people get access to the Internet who 
may not have had it otherwise.
 
AI is the most important technological trend right now and I'm optimistic 
that it can help us amplify the good that's happening on our
 
services as well 
as proactively remove harmful content. For example, one thing that I'm 
proud of is our AI tools that help us take down ISIS and Al Qaeda related 
terror content, with 99% of that content being removed before any person 
flags it to us.
 
We'v
e also built AI tools that have flagged when people are posting thoughts 
about suicide. And these tools have helped us reach out to first responders 
to get over 1,000 people the help they need quickly.
 
On the positive side, AI will help us understand the c
ontext of what people 
are sharing so we can help encourage more connection and conversations 
between people as well.
 
And finally, we have some big moments for virtual reality coming up, and 
I'm excited to get Oculus Go in people's hands soon.
 
Overall, 2018
 
is a year of important investment to keep people safe and also 
to keep building the experiences people expect from us. We are taking a 
broader view of our responsibility and investing to make sure our tools are 
used for good.
 
And we also need to keep 
moving forward, building new tools to help people 
connect, build community and bring the world closer together. Thanks to all 
of you for being a part of this journey. I'm looking forward to making more 
progress together.
 
Now, here's Sheryl to talk about ou
r business.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Hi, everyone. Before going through our results, I want to take a minute to 
talk about ads and privacy. At Facebook, we have always built privacy 
protections into our ad system. We use the information you pr
ovide and that 
we receive from websites to target ads for advertisers, but we don't tell 
them who you are. We don't sell your information to advertisers or anyone 
else.
 
We also believe that people should control their advertising experience. For 
every ad w
e show, there's an option to find out why you're seeing that ad 
and to turn off ads from that advertiser entirely. And you can opt out of 
being targeted based on certain information, like the websites you visit or 
your relationship status.
 
Advertising and 
protecting people's information are not at odds. We do both. 
Targeted ads that respect people's privacy are better ads. They show people 
things that they're more likely to be interested in. We regularly hear from 
people who use Facebook that they prefer to
 
see ads that are relevant to 
them and their lives.
 
Effective advertising is also critical to helping businesses grow. This is 
especially important for small businesses who wouldn't otherwise be able to 
afford to buy broad reach media. As Mark shared, we n
ow have more than 
80 million small businesses around the world using Facebook pages and 
many of them are building their businesses on Facebook.
 
Small businesses are the backbone of local communities and create the 
majority of jobs around the world and thei
r growth creates millions of new 
jobs. We surveyed small businesses in 18 countries, and more than half of 
SMBs on Facebook say they've been able to hire more people due to growth 
in demand since joining our platform.
 
Last month, I was in Houston for Faceb
ook's Community Boost event. I met 
Patrice Farooq, who runs a small business called Cupcake Kitchen. After 
Hurricane Harvey damaged her business last year, she used Facebook to find 
new customers. Now more than half her business come from Facebook and 
she'
s getting ready to open a second store.
 
We're proud of the ad model we've built. It ensures that people see more 
useful ads, allows millions of businesses to grow and enables us to provide a 
global service that's free for all to use. The fastest way to bri
dge the digital 
divide in the United States or around the world is by offering services free to 
any consumer regardless of their circumstance. Advertising supported 
businesses like Facebook equalize access and improve opportunity.
 
At the same time, we know
 
that people want control over how their 
information is used, and we want them to feel confident that the ads they're 
seeing are authentic. That's why we're building industry
-
leading 
transparency tools. This includes a way to see ads an advertiser is runni
ng, 
even if they aren't targeted to you. This new feature is live in Canada and 
will roll out in Ireland and the U.S. soon.
 
In the coming months, GDPR will give us another opportunity to make sure 
people fully understand how their information is used by ou
r services. It's an 
EU regulation, but as Mark said a few weeks ago, we're going to extend 
these controls to everyone who uses Facebook regardless of where in the 
world they live. Our commitment to you is that we will continue to improve 
our ads model by s
trengthening privacy and choice, while giving businesses 
of all sizes new and better tools to help them grow.
 
With that, I'd like to turn to our results. It was a great quarter for our 
business. Q1 ad revenue grew 50% year
-
over
-
year. Mobile ad revenue was 
$10.7 billion, up 60% from last year and contributed approximately 91% of 
total ad revenue. Revenue growth was broad
-
based across regions, 
marketer segments and verticals.
 
We continue to make progress on our three priorities: helping businesses 
leverage th
e power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our 
ads more relevant and effective.
 
First, leveraging the power of mobile. Advertisers recognize the importance 
of reaching their audience on mobile. During the Super Bowl this year, over 
90% of na
tional TV advertisers were also advertising on Facebook. This 
shows that the largest advertisers understand the value of broad
-
based 
campaigns with us.
 
Take Tourism Australia. To get more Americans interested in visiting 
Australia, they ran ads on Facebook
 
and Instagram in the week leading up to 
the game. On Super Bowl Sunday, they ran short video ads on Facebook 
before their big TV spot at halftime. This drove 22% incremental reach on 
top of TV and a 35 point lift in awareness. During the campaign, 50% of 
leads on the Tourism Australia site came from Facebook.
 
Second, developing new ad products. Instagram Stories is changing how 
people share and express themselves. Advertisers are also finding creative 
ways to use the format. This quarter, we made carousel 
ads available in 
Stories so advertisers can share up to three images or videos per ad instead 
of just one. People can swipe up on the ads to visit the advertiser's website.
 
We also announced a number of innovations to help retailers reach 
customers. We rol
led out a more personalized shopping experience in News 
Feed. Now when people click on a collection ad, they'll see a full
-
screen 
catalog organized according to their interests.
 
We also introduced a new way to reach people before they've shown interest 
in 
making a specific purchase. If someone is generally interested in 
furniture, a business can now run ads focused on different categories of their 
products, such as couches or tables, to inspire them to shop.
 
And last, making our ads more relevant and effect
ive. Our investments in 
measurement are helping advertisers of all sizes understand their results 
and make good investment decisions.
 
We've heard from many of our advertisers that they want third
-
party 
verification to prove that we're helping them achieve 
their marketing goals. 
We were recently accredited by the Media Ratings Council for News Feed 
served ad impressions on desktop and mobile. We're working with them on 
accreditation in other areas as well.
 
Going forward, we will continue to focus on these th
ree priorities and ensure 
that people's privacy is protected on Facebook.
 
I want to close by thanking our teams around the world for the work they do 
each and every day and each and every quarter to make our company and 
our services better. I'm also truly 
grateful to our partners who work with us 
to grow their businesses.
 
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Our community and business 
both showed solid growth in the first quarter. Let's 
start with our community 
metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.45 billion, up 13% 
compared to last year, led by user growth in India, Indonesia and Vietnam. 
This number represents approximately 66% of our 2.2 billion monthly active 
users in Q1.
 
MAUs were up 260 million or 13% compared to last year.
 
Turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $12 billion, up 49% or 42% on 
a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tail
winds contributed $536 
million of revenue in Q1. Additionally, the adoption of ASC 606, the new 
revenue standard, resulted in approximately $130 million of incremental 
revenue in Q1 due to a change from net to gross accounting for our Instant 
Articles prod
uct.
 
Q1 total ad revenue was $11.8 billion, up 50% or 43% on a constant 
currency basis. Mobile ad revenue was $10.7 billion, up 60%. In Q1, the 
average price per ad increased 39%, and the number of ad impressions 
served increased 8%, driven primarily by fe
ed ads on Facebook and 
Instagram. Payments and other fees revenue was $171 million, down 2%.
 
Turning to expenses, total expenses were $6.5 billion, up 39%. In Q1, we 
added over 2,600 employees, which was a record level of net new hires. We 
ended Q1 with over 27,700 full
-
time employees, up 48% compared to last 
year. We are focused on growing techni
cal head count as well as a variety of 
other groups that support the business.
 
Operating income was $5.4 billion, representing a 46% operating margin. 
Our effective tax rate was 11%. Net income was $5 billion or $1.69 per 
share. Capital expenditures were $
2.8 billion, driven by investments in data 
centers, servers, network infrastructure and office facilities. In Q1, we 
generated $5 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with 
approximately $44 billion in cash and investments.
 
In Q1, we bought back 
approximately $1.9 billion of our Class A common 
stock. Given our existing repurchase program is nearly fully executed, our 
Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $9 
billion of stock.
 
Turning to our outlook, the changes tha
t Mark and Sheryl described will, we 
believe, benefit our community and our business and will serve to 
strengthen Facebook overall. At the highest level, we believe that we can 
continue to build the great ads business while protecting people's privacy. 
Tha
t said, with regard to GDPR and other initiatives around data usage, 
while it's early and difficult to know the business implications in advance, we 
anticipate a couple of impacts.
 
First, as you might expect, we believe that European MAU and DAU may be 
fla
t to slightly down sequentially in Q2 as a result of the GDPR rollout. 
Second, while we do not anticipate these changes will significantly impact 
advertising revenue, there is certainly the potential for some impact and we 
will be monitoring this closely.
 
Importantly, GDPR affects the entire online advertising industry, so the 
Facebook specific impact is difficult to model in advance. In terms of our 
overall 2018 revenue outlook, we continue to anticipate revenue growth 
rates will decelerate on a constant c
urrency basis throughout the year.
 
On the expense side, we are tightening our initial expense guidance range. 
We now expect that full year 2018 total expenses will grow 50% to 60% 
compared to our prior range of 45% to 60%. This narrowed range reflects 
the 
significant investments we're making in areas like safety and security, 
content acquisition and our long
-
term innovation efforts.
 
Turning to capital expenditures, we expect that our full year 2018 capital 
expenditures will be around $15 billion, at the hig
h end of our prior range of 
$14 billion to $15 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, 
network infrastructure and office facilities. We also expect continued growth 
in capital expenditures beyond 2018 to support global growth and ongoing 
p
roduct improvements.
 
Turning now to tax, at current stock prices, we expect that our Q2 and full 
year 2018 tax rate will be in the mid
-
teens. As a reminder, fluctuations in 
our stock price will impact our tax rate.
 
In summary, our first quarter results dem
onstrated the growth in our 
business and global community remains strong. We have a lot of work ahead 
and are investing aggressively to enhance safety, security and privacy, while 
also focusing on our mission of giving people the power to build community 
a
nd bring the world closer together.

Great. Thanks for taking the question. One for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, 
so you focused on bringing people together and clearly have this massive 
platform with strong engagement, but can you talk about
 
some of the 
business opportunities for Facebook on the platform away from advertising, 
and where you're most focused there?
 
And then Dave, just on the OpEx, can you talk about kind of more 
specifically where some of the incremental costs would fall that t
ake the 
previous low end of the range here off the table, given what you've seen 
over the last couple months? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
I could take the first question. So we think that ads is a great business 
model that is aligned wi
th our mission. We want to build a service that can 
help connect everyone around the world, so we want to offer that service for 
free and have it be affordable, and that's completely aligned with what we're 
trying to do.
 
So even when we do other things, li
ke we're running tests of payments, we 
have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways 
that we could think about making money from those, but in general our 
strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesse
s can 
bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system. We think that that is 
both the most efficient way to run the business, it offers every business in 
the world the lowest prices that we can potentially offer, and it provides a 
great free service 
to people around the world.
 
I know that a lot of people have had questions about the business model, 
and this is something that I just think we at Facebook are very proud of. And 
we think that it is the right way to build a service that connects everyone 
a
round the world.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Hey, Doug. It's Dave. So if you recall, it's very consistent with what we've 
been talking about the last couple of quarters which is the acceleration of 
expense growth is really driven by three factors. So 
it's the investments that 
we're making in safety and security, it's the content investments we're 
making to support Watch, and then finally it's the innovation initiatives 
around our longer term bets like AI, AR, VR and connectivity.
 
So it's those three fa
ctors. If I had to point to what's really leading us to 
tighten the range, it's really the first factor which is the safety and security 
investments. Specifically, we're putting more behind that more quickly than 
we anticipated, and so that's where you're 
going to see it come up.
 
If you look at the current results from this quarter, you'll see that our sales 
and marketing expense grew 51% in the quarter 

 
one of the 

 
year
-
over
-
year. One of the factors driving that is that's where we're categorizing our 
com
munity operations investment and other operations teams that support 
the quality initiatives and the safety initiatives. So you're already seeing 
some of that getting picked up in the quarter and you'll see that carry 
through in the year.

Your nex
t question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
 
Mark A. May

Citi Investment Research
 
Thank you. This question's probably aimed at Dave. You commented that 
you do not expect any significant, maybe some impact from the 
implementation of GDPR, yet 
you also voiced some uncertainty there. I 
guess the question is what gives you confidence in coming out now and 
saying that you expect no significant impact on the ad business, maybe 
some?
 
And then maybe more for Mark, there have been some recent reports t
hat 
imply that even some seemingly simple things that Facebook may not be 
proactively identifying or addressing have come up and I guess the question 
is, is it that it's not as simple as it may seem, or is it that these reports 
aren't accurate, this just h
as to do with some of the sensitive data like social 
security information being showing up online? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Hey, Mark. It's Dave. So on GDPR, I think fundamentally we believe we can 
continue to build a great ads business 
while protecting the privacy of the 
people who use Facebook. As part of the rollout of GDPR, we're providing a 
lot of control to people around their ad settings and we're committed, as 
Sheryl and Mark mentioned, to providing those same controls worldwide.
 
And while we don't expect these changes will significantly impact advertising 
revenue, there's certainly potential for some impact. Any change of the 
ability for us and our advertisers to use data can impact our optimization 
potential at the margin, which 
could impact our ability to drive price 
improvements in the long run. So we'll just have to watch how that plays out 
over time.
 
I think it's important to note that GDPR is affecting the entire online 
advertising industry. And so what's really most importan
t in winning budgets 
is our relative performance versus other opportunities presented to 
marketers. And that's why it will be important to watch kind of how this 
plays out at the industry level.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

On the social security 
information, social security is not an input people put 
into Facebook and posts containing information like social security numbers 
or credit cards are not allowed on our site and we remove them as soon as 
we become aware of it. So we're continually workin
g to improve these 
efforts and we encourage our community to report anything like this that 
they see, but that's not data that Facebook is collecting in any way.

Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question, maybe two if I can. Mark, in the changes you 
talked about at the product level at the beginning part of the year, as you've 
started to make those changes and some of the content people see on the 
platform 
has evolved, what does that mean for engagement? What are you 
seeing in terms of the way people are using Facebook? I know it's early 
days, but curious if you've seen anything in terms of change of behavior.
 
And then, Sheryl, we're starting to pick up from
 
advertisers a lot of 
momentum and positive commentary on messaging platforms, especially 
Facebook Messenger. Wanted to know if you'd give us any color about your 
own conversations on the business side, on the messaging apps, WhatsApp, 
Facebook Messenger, 
and how investors should think about the opportunity 
there. Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I can speak to the first point. So we made a number of changes and are still 
making changes to prioritize meaningful interactions between people ove
r 
passive consumption of content. And that follows a lot of feedback directly 
from our community that people want Facebook to be more about friends 
and family and less about just content consumption. And it also follows the 
well
-
being research that we've d
one that suggests that when people use the 
Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is 
correlated with all of the positive measures of well
-
being that you just 
expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connecte
d and 
less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily 
positive on those dimensions.
 
So we've been rolling out a number of changes, both product changes and 
ranking the News Feed. As I said in my opening remarks, that has increased 
or we've observed increases in some types of sharing and interaction 
between people based on that. We've also observed some continued declines 
as we've done this and in the passive consumption of video, specifically.
 
Overall, I'd say that these changes are
 
doing what we expected that they 
would do and helping people to connect more and have more meaningful 
interactions. I think that that's the thing that people can uniquely do on 
Facebook that they can't do on other services that may be more about just 
cons
uming content.
 
So we think that this is going in the direction of building a stronger 
community and a stronger business over the long term, and we're optimistic 
about what we're seeing here.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
On Messenger, we continue t
o be primarily focused on consumer growth and 
engagement, and we're being slow and deliberate with monetization. It's 
worth noting this isn't a feed product, so there are some more unknowns 
here.
 
But I think the potential is real and big and growing. We se
e a lot of organic 
connections between businesses and consumers, and our experience is that 
where are those 

 
where we have those organic connections, that's very 
promising to turn that into monetization as well.
 
We have over 18 million businesses now comm
unicating with their 
customers through Messenger. We have 2 billion messages sent between 
people and businesses a month, which includes automated messages.
 
And we're focused on launching new tools that help businesses use 
Messenger. For this quarter, we la
unched new quick replies for customers. 
We're seeing ads in inbox, which are now available to all advertisers.
 
It's really early, but nice pick up and nice buzz there. And click to Messenger 
ads on Facebook are actually very promising as well because adver
tisers 
want to see a return for the money they spend. And when they have an ad 
and they can get a direct contact one to one with a customer, that's been 
something that people are really excited about. So early days, but I think a 
lot of potential here.

Thank you. I'd like to follow
-
up a little bit on usage just because of the 
comments last quarter. Any update to the 
time spent trends on Facebook 
post your changes?
 
I guess, a second question is, do you think time spent on Facebook can start 
to grow again?
 
And then third, when you look holistically at Instagram, which seems to be 
doing really well in 
third
-
party services, how do you think about the whole 
platform in total, Facebook plus Instagram? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah, so I'll take that. In terms of time spent on Facebook, we're not 
providing a specific update on that. I wou
ld note that Mark talked about 
some of the changes we're making to focus on connections over 
consumption. So we're seeing a decrease in certain types of time spent such 
as passive video consumption as a result of that and an increase in areas 
like sharing.
 
So, we're not really optimizing the business on time spent, but 
rather the kind of quality of conversations and connections.
 
So we're continuing to invest in that work, and we think it's the right thing 
for the Facebook community in the long run. And I th
ink it's also good for 
overall engagement.
 
For Instagram, that continues to perform very well, not providing kind of a 
separate breakout of that, but Instagram continues to grow nicely, both as a 

 
both from an engagement perspective and a business perspec
tive.

Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman 
Sachs.
 
Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could talk a little about 
Watch. I know it's early, but I was wondering
 
if you could share with us your 
initial thoughts on how it's going versus your expectations? How you see it 
evolving over the next couple years? And ultimately, how would you define 
success for it as you look out? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Faceb
ook, Inc.
 
So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways 
that people can connect, right? So it's very different from video and News 
Feed, the passive consumption that I'm talking about on response to some 
of the other questions
 
because it's intentional, right? I mean, people go to it 
to watch specific content.
 
And we're trying to make a different experience than what you might be able 
to get on YouTube or any of these other services by making it more about 
connecting with people
 
in different ways.
 
So a good example of this is what I talked about with Watch Party, where 
now people 

 
groups of people can get together and can watch videos at the 
same time and you can interact around that. And we think that that's the 
kind of experie
nce that we can uniquely build and that that's going to further 
our mission and just be a unique thing that we can add to the world.
 
So what we're seeing so far is that a bunch of the content that has come 
onto Watch is good and is working and people watch
 
it. We're continuing to 
treat the product to emphasize that kind of content more while building 
more of these social features.
 
I'd say it's still pretty early overall in terms of the growth of this, but it's 
clearly an area that's important where I think 
we have something unique 
that we're going to bring to make this successful.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Great. Just two questions. Dave, is the impression growth accel
eration to 
8% a function of easier comps or is it a function of some of the changes that 
Mark was talking about around the News Feed content that you put in in 
January?
 
And then is the North America ad revenue growth acceleration being driven 
by that, that
 
change on core Facebook? Or is it more coming from 
Instagram? Any color there on those two accelerating trends would be great.
 
And then the last one is just a follow
-
up on the GDPR topic. Dave, you 
mentioned that MAUs and DAUs might be down a little bit i
n 2Q in Europe. Is 
that what you've seen already from these new screens that just came out 
with the new terms of service? Or is that just a guess of what you might see 
in the future? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So I think I'll take al
l of those, Ross. So the impression growth 
acceleration, you've got a couple factors going on there. One of the factors is 
just that the desktop roll
-
off is just continuing. So as it gets smaller, it has 
less of a depressive effect on the overall impressio
n growth number, 
because if you recall, desktop has quite a number of impressions per DAU, 
just given it's the right
-
hand column that has multiple impressions on each 
screen. So that's one of the reasons. And obviously, Instagram is continuing 
to grow nice
ly as well, so that's another contributing factor there.
 
In terms of the North America revenue growth acceleration, one of the big 
factors there is really just also that's where you're picking up some of the 
accounting change from the Instant Articles goin
g from net to gross, so 
that's contributing to that acceleration. Obviously, I'm very pleased with the 
strength of North American ad revenue and, overall, all the different regions, 
but that's a factor there, and IG is, obviously, contributing nicely to gr
owth 
in North America and worldwide.
 
Finally, on the GDPR trend, that's just based on what we're expecting given 
that you're having to bring people through these consent flows, and we have 
been modeling it and expect there would be a flat to down impact on
 
MAU 
and DAU. It's very early in our rollout, but nothing inconsistent with what 
we've been modeling. So that's why we're giving that indication of what we 
expect.

Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two; one for Dave and 
one for Mark. Dave, will the privacy policy or the opt
-
in process differ in 
Europe versus other geographies post GDPR? Your prepared remarks 
sugg
ested that those controls would extend to the rest of the world. And if 
that is the case, why wouldn't we also potentially see an impact to MAU 
and/or DAU outside of just Europe? And then Mark, just simple question, 
having watched most of your testimony on
 
Capitol Hill, I just wonder what 
did you learn, or what surprised you the most personally from that 
experience? Thank you.

Yeah. On the GDPR changes, 
so we just started rolling out the GDPR controls 
in Europe and we're going to make all the same controls and settings 
available every way, which gives people the same opportunities to make the 
same choices. It's not going to be exactly the same format. It'
s going to be 
localized instead for different parts of the world. And so we think some of 
the differences will come from that.

And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was 
an important m
oment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering 
about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions 
around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're 
taking on data privacy and developers to make sure
 
that this doesn't happen 
again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.
 
I mean, the hearings didn't just touch on that. They also touched on a 
number of the other issues that we face, including foreign interference in 
elections and that's
 
something that we're incredibly focused on. 2018 is 
going to be an incredibly important year on this. There are big elections, not 
just the U.S. midterms, but the major elections upcoming in Mexico, in 
Brazil, in India, and Pakistan, and a number of other
 
countries around the 
world. So this is important and it was an important moment for the company 
to hear the feedback and to show what we're doing. And now I think the 
important thing is that we execute on all the things that we need to do to 
make sure tha
t we keep people safe.

John Blackledge with Cowen.

Great. Thanks
. Two questions. First, you posted another strong quarter for 
ad growth. Just wondering given the recent events, has there been any 
change in kind of advertisers' views about the platform, or concerns about 
ROI going forward? And then second on video, was 
there much investment 
in video content in the first quarter, or do you expect the bulk of the video 
content spend to hit kind of through the rest of the year, and what types of 
content will you be investing in?
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
To the 
first, in the immediate days of the concern, we heard from a handful 
of advertisers who paused spend, one of whom has already come back, and 
we haven't seen a meaningful trend or anything much since then. 
Advertisers ask the same questions as people are, t
hat they want to make 
sure their and their customers' data is protected, and I think we are able to 
answer those questions in a compelling way.
 
In terms of ROI on the platform, the ROI is really determined by the ability 
of advertisers to put the right ad 
in front of the right person in the right 
format. And I think we're seeing impressive growth in all of those areas. We 
have more advertisers using the ability to target their ads to the right 
person. We have more advertisers experimenting with different fo
rmats. 
Stories on Instagram are a very promising one, and we're seeing some nice 
experimentation there.
 
And we have more advertisers really embracing the measurement that helps 
close the loop and helps make their ads more effective. So I think in terms 
of 
the ROI we are able to offer our marketers, the signs are strong, and we 
also continue to see there's a lot of room for improvement.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah, John, on the video investment in the first quarter, it's clearly going to 
be more we
ighted towards the rest of the year, but we're already seeing the 
impact of some of that. So if you look at just the cost of revenue line where 
that's getting picked up, we saw cost of revenue grow 66% year
-
over
-
year. 
If you look at the gross margin, it dr
opped from 86% to 84%.
 
There's really two kind main 

 
two big factors in that compression there. 
One of those is the video content investment. The other is the move to gross 
versus net accounting on the Instant Articles product. So those are the two 
things
 
that I'd point to as being drivers of that margin compression getting 
picked up in cost of revenue. So video is having an impact, but we grew 
expenses 39% year
-
over
-
year in the first quarter. We're obviously expecting 
faster growth in the back half 

 
back
 
three quarters of the year, so that's 

 
video's going to be a component in driving that.

Thanks very much. A couple
 
for Sheryl, if I may. A couple on GDPR. Do you 
think it's going to have any impact on your measurement capabilities? So 
that's one. And then secondly, if users elect to take the strictest possible 
approach to their data management, would their product exp
erience change 
in any way on Facebook? I mean, we have a sense that their advertising 
experience might change, but in terms of their use of News Feed or any of 
your products, would the actual product functionality materially change for 
them? Thanks very mu
ch.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
When you think about the way people have the choice to restrict data use, I 
think it would affect the product. There is lots of ways we use data to make 
the product better. It really depends what that would be. I 
don't think we 
have full visibility into what those changes would be over the long time.
 
In terms of measurement capabilities, I don't think there's a direct thing 
we're exactly worried about right now. It's more what happens over the long 
time. The way we
 
think about it, and Dave said this, is that the amount of 
uncertainty there is for us and all the other companies in the digital 
advertising industry is reasonably higher than it's been right now because 
we're in the process of rolling out GDPR.
 
We're goi
ng to all know a lot more after we roll out, but the thing that won't 
change is that advertisers are going to look at the highest ROI opportunity. 
And what's most important in winning budgets is relative performance in the 
industry. And so we think that ce
rtainly we want to provide the best 
advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our 
ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's 
happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.

Thanks for taking my question. Sorry. Technological challenges. There's 
been a lot of good questions around core Facebook. Can you ta
lk a little bit 
about Instagram, Mark, and how do you see the product evolving over the 
next 12 months? What are your visions for how it could continue to drive 
more engagement and maybe even higher quality connections on 
Instagram? And then second one on 
payments. Could you talk a little about 
philosophically how you think about the importance of enabling more 
frictionless payments to drive a higher quality advertising experience on 
Messenger and WhatsApp?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So, 
on Instagram, there are a number of really exciting opportunities. 
The main focus is on helping people capture and share any moment that 
they want, and also the whole theme that we have around community plays 
out a little bit differently on Instagram. So f
or example, while there is no 
formal groups product on Instagram, people use Explore. More than 200 
million people use Explore in order to see content that's interesting to them 
and interact with people beyond their friends and the people who are 

 
who 
the
y follow directly.
 
We launched hashtag following in December. That's a product that has done 
very well. I think now more than 100 million people follow different 
hashtags, which is a way that people can form ad hoc communities, and that 

 
it all goes towar
ds the overall mission that we have as a company of 
helping to build community and bring people closer together. Private 
sharing, both with Stories and direct messaging, are growing incredibly 
quickly on Instagram, and I think that those are both very exci
ting areas for 
development of products as well.
 
You asked about payments in WhatsApp and Messenger, was that right?
 
Brian Nowak 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Yes.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So I think that this is going to be a really big opportu
nity. And again, like I 
said earlier, the point here isn't to charge for payments. It's that messaging 
can be a more transactional medium than feed. So I think what you're going 
to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on 
Face
book or Instagram. You see content from that page. You can click 
through or tap through to a message thread, and then you can either get 
customer support or complete a transaction or do a follow
-
on transaction. 
And that will be very valuable for businesses
.
 
So we view the payment in that context not as the goal, but as something 
that's helping the business and the person succeed at having the transaction 
or doing what they're trying to do. And that's going to make people's 
experience better, somebody can ju
st do that online, and it's going to make 
businesses 

 
it's going to make the experience of being on Facebook as a 
business more valuable because you can complete the transactions there.
 
I'll add one more thing that I think is interesting on payments. I th
ink this is 
probably different from what you're asking about, but I think it's cool. We've 
been running an experiment with mobile financial services in Messenger, and 
one of the things that we found in the Philippines, for example, is that 
people can buy a
ccess to data plans through Messenger.
 
And because it allows the mobile carriers to not have to have the whole 
supply chain and sales and retail that they have otherwise, they're able to 
sell the data plans for on average about 10% less than they would be 
able to 
otherwise, which actually is allowing more people to get on the internet in 
the first place because they can now afford data plans.
 
So it's an interesting example of how having payments in messaging can 
increase efficiency for businesses and how in
 
this case that's contributing to 
our Internet.org and connectivity goals of helping more people access the 
internet who wouldn't have otherwise been able to. In other cases, it will be 
able to help people accomplish their goals with different businesses m
ore 
easily.

Great. Thanks, and good afternoon. First off, related to the machine learning 
capabilities and more specifi
cally how that's deployed into content filtering, I 
wonder if you can compare the ability of the machines to analyze content 
today versus six months or even a year ago? Meaning, is that ability 
improving at a rate where you have a higher degree of confiden
ce in that 
reliability?
 
And then secondly, wonder if you've been able to discern any impact to date 
on content publishers or apps that are utilizing Facebook for reach and 
engagement following the rollout of changes in access to APIs, login and 
other devel
oper resources. Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
I could take the first one. So on AI, I think that there's a very big shift in 
how we're going to think about content moderation on the platform.
 
And I mean, this goes back to the beginning
 
of the service, right? So in 
2004, when I was starting in my dorm room, for a number of reasons, it was 
just me, so we didn't have a lot of capacity to have thousands of people 
reviewing content. AI technology was not developed at the time.
 
The only real 
logical way to run the service was to enable people to share 
what they wanted and then reactively, if people in the community saw 
something that was offensive or they thought was against the rules, they'd 
flag it for us. And we'd look at it and take things
 
down that didn't belong.
 
Now it is becoming increasingly possible, both because we can build the AI 
tools, but couple that with being able to hire thousands and thousands of 
people to do faster review of the content and look at something proactively. 
We'r
e shifting over the next few years to a much more proactive model of 
moderation.
 
Now, one of the things that I think is going to be interesting, and in some 
cases a little frustrating, is that AI tools lend themselves towards identifying 
certain content a 
lot more easily than others.
 
So one area where I'm very proud that we're doing great work is around 
identifying terrorist content. And I mentioned this before that 99% of the 
ISIS and Al Qaeda related content that we take down, we're removing 
before any pe
rson flags it to us. And that's great, right? That's doing a good 
job.
 
But if you look at areas like hate speech, which are just much more nuanced 
linguistically, it really depends on the local language, that's an area where I 
think it's going to take 
more years to be able to do something reasonably.
 
So one of the pieces of criticism that I think we get that I think is fair is 
we're much better able to enforce our nudity policies, for example, than we 
are hate speech. And the reason for that is it's muc
h easier to build an AI 
system that can detect a nipple than it is to determine what is linguistically 
hate speech.
 
So this is something that I think we will make progress on and will get better 
on over time. These are not unsolvable problems, although it'
s worth calling 
out that our adversaries have all the same AI tools 

 
or some of them, I 
think. I'd like to think that we're a little bit ahead. But we'll have a lot of the 
same tools as the field develops.
 
But the combination of building AI and hiring wha
t is going to be tens of 
thousands of people to work on these problems, I think will see us make 
very meaningful progress going forward.

To your second question, when we think about what's happening with 
developers, we
 
are doing an audit of large developers and doing some 
investigation. We don't break out marketer segments, but mobile app install 
ads, which is where the revenue would come from developers, is a relatively 
small part of our advertising revenue. And our mo
bile app install ads help 
apps of all kinds, not those running on our platform.
 
So we think the investigatory work we're doing into APIs, into the use, is 
very important, and we don't expect it to have an impact on revenue.

Okay. Two questions, please. David, could you just try to spell out a little bit 
more how GDPR could actually impact advertising revenue growth in the 
future, 
like, what's the doomsday scenario here? Is it just that it's clipped 
down because there would be a hit maybe near term to MAUs and DAUs? Or 
is there a reasonable scenario under which tracking or targeting would be 
impaired? Just spell out what the worst c
ase scenario is. I'm kind of skeptical 
that there is one. But if there is one, please spell it out.
 
And then, Mark, on Oculus, could you just give us a little bit of an update on 
your kind of long
-
term thinking about Oculus? There hasn't been a lot of 
focu
s on it. But Oculus Go is coming out. So maybe we all should take 
another 

 
have another thought on it, like the opportunity you see there, 
where you think the product development is at this point? Are we years 
away from something mass marketable? Any comm
entary like that would be 
really helpful. Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So, Mark, on the first question, I don't know that we really see a doomsday 
scenario here. I think what we think is that depending on how people react 
to the controls and
 
the ad settings, there could be some limitations to data 
usage. We believe that those will be relatively minor. But depending on how 
broadly the controls are adopted and set, there is a potential to impact 
targeting for our advertisers.
 
Obviously, if they
 
are less able to target effectively, they'll get a lower ROI 
on their advertising campaigns. They'll then bid differently into the auction. 
That ultimately will flow through into how we can realize price on the 
impressions that we're selling.
 
So I think t
hat's the mitigating issue that we could see, depending on how 
GDPR and our broader commitment to providing these same controls 
worldwide could play out.
 
We think that there is a great case for not just our business, but also for the 
user experience on Fac
ebook to have targeting because we think it's a better 
experience for the people who use Facebook to have targeted ads. We think 
we can do that in a privacy
-
protected way, and it's just a better experience. 
You get more relevant ads. And I think overall be
nefits not only the 
advertisers, but also the people who use Facebook.
 
So I don't think we see a real doomsday scenario here. We see an 
opportunity to really make the case.

Your next question...
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
And on virtu
al reality...
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Mark has a second part of that question.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So on virtual reality here, I think the big picture is that every 10 to 15 years 
or so there is a major new computing paradigm, 
right, whether that's DOS 
and then Windows and kind of desktop UI and then web browsers and now 
mobile phones and apps. So it strikes me as inevitable that that progression 
will continue. And each one gets to be more natural to interact with, more 
natural 
gestures for controlling, more immersive, more portable.
 
So I think it strikes me as very likely that the next one is going to be around 
virtual and augmented reality. So we're investing a lot in this because, 
frankly, we haven't to date been a hardware co
mpany or an operating 
system company. And we think that we need to build up a lot of different 
muscles in order to be competitive and be able to succeed in that space and 
to be able to shape that space.
 
One of my great regrets in how we've run the company 
so far is I feel like 
we didn't get to shape the way that mobile platforms developed as much as 
would be good because they were developed contemporaneously with 
Facebook early on, right. I mean, iOS and Android came out around 2007. 
We were really small co
mpany at that point. So that just wasn't a thing that 
we were working on.
 
But now I think we're living in a world where 

 
the way that I think about 
this is that people should really be at the center of how we design 
technology. It shouldn't be 
designed around apps. It should be designed 
around our relationships because that's what matters to people. And that's 
not the world we're on on mobile. So I really am very committed to this idea 
of making sure that the next platform reflects those values 
that Facebook 
stands for.
 
I think this is going to be an exciting year. As you mentioned, Oculus Go is 
coming out. We have the prototype and the developer kit around the higher
-
end stand
-
alone coming out as well, and we're doing a number of other 
things th
at I think are going to be quite exciting over time as well. But that's 
how I think about the whole space.
 
I don't know exactly when it's going to be a big deal. When we started 
talking about this, I said that I thought that this was going to be a 10
-
year 
journey before this was really a very mainstream, major platform. And I 
think the reality is Facebook needs to be investing before it is a big thing in 
order to build some of the muscles to be competitive. We're committed to 
doing that because I think that
 
this is important for our mission.

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you think about the opportunities 
for the business broadly, you obvious
ly are crushing it from an advertising 
standpoint when you look at any measure of growth. But wondering as you 
think about how you take this massive platform of users and engagement 
that you have across all your platforms, I'm thinking about if you look at
 
like 
what Spotify has been able to achieve in music subscriptions, what Apple 
even has done in music subscriptions, what Netflix is doing in video, Amazon 
obviously now crossing 100 million subscribers. Like, is there other lines of 
business, other revenu
e streams that people should be thinking about that 
create substantial opportunities, and specifically subscription, and then 
maybe if you could just touch on from a commerce standpoint now that 
Instagram's starting to be such a big driver of commerce, how
 
do you think 
about diversifying revenues versus essentially being almost pure 
advertising? Thanks so much.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
We've certainly thought about lots of other forms of monetization, including 
subscriptions, and we'll always c
ontinue to consider everything. Ads for us is 
a very natural fit for our business, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us. 
We've done 

 
obviously, we have 80 million now pages, so we have 80 
million businesses using Facebook on a monthly basis, of which 6
 
million are 
advertisers. On Instagram, we have 25 million Instagram business profiles, 
of which 2 million are advertisers. So even if we just convert people who are 
advertising on Facebook into Instagram, that's a lot of a growth opportunity. 
Then you can
 
start thinking about Messenger and some of the other 
platforms we have.
 
What's I think interesting and strong about our potential business growth is 
that we're able to do this across these services. So as I mentioned before, 
running an ad that has a click
 
to Messenger ad that goes into Messenger is 
just an early example of what's possible. And I think if you look at a large 
base of businesses who use us without paying, the growing base of 
businesses who do pay us and then the runway we have in services tha
t are 
1 billion plus (59:48) that we're really not monetizing, I think a strong focus 
on ads continues to be the best investment we can make. It's also very core 
to our mission. Ads gives us the ability to provide a free service to the world. 
And if your g
oal is to connect to everyone and make sure that people can all 
participate, that ads
-
based model makes a lot of sense and we're going to 
continue to invest very heavily there.

Thank you very much. I guess two quick questions for David. Growth in 
MAUs in rest of world was up about 11%; I think last ye
ar, it was up almost 
double that, 19% or so. Anything changed there that maybe could explain 
the slowdown? And I think we saw also a slighter 

 
slightly lower growth in 
pricing as well. And then lastly, on the buyback, how much do you still have 
left on th
e old authorization to which we need to add the new $9 billion? And 
how do you look at it? Is it being (01:00:54) opportunistic, or do you have a 
timeline by which you guys are planning to complete the repurchase? Thank 
you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc
.
 
Sure, Youssef. On the growth in MAUs in rest of world, we've had certain 
slowdowns. There was an internet shutdown in Ethiopia that contributed a 
little bit to that. So you've got some kind of one
-
time factors that do come 
into play there. So I think tha
t's probably what I would point to. Nothing that 
notable to call out there.
 
In terms of the share repurchase authorization, I would just say that we've 
just about gotten our way through that. We had about $2 billion left as of 
the end of the quarter. But w
e think it's 

 
we asked the board and the board 
approved a $9 billion additional authorization. We look at it on two fronts: 
just offsetting the dilution from the share issuances that we have and then 
secondarily, to be opportunistic. And we think with the
 
cash flow that we're 
generating, we have a strong financial position with which to fund that.

Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining today. This was a good 

to gr
ow our community in size and engagement with 1.32 billion people now 
connecting on Facebook each month, and 63% of them visiting daily. Our 
momentum remains especially strong on mobile to now 829 million people 
using Facebook everyday with more than 650 mi
llion people using our 
services on mobile every day.
 

average, people on the Facebook in the U.S. spend around 40 minutes each 
day using our service, including about one in five minut
es on mobile. This is 
more than any other app by are, but overall people in the U.S. spend about 
nine hours per day engaging with digital media on TVs, phones and 
computers. So there is a big opportunity to improve the way that people 
connect and share acr
oss 
--
 
how we all engage with the rest of media as 
well.
 
Now when it comes to our business, we continue to be pleased with our 
growth. This quarter, our total revenue grew to over 2.9 billion and 
advertising revenue grew by 67% from a year ago. Mobile now 
accounts for 
62% of our advertising revenue, which is a good sign of how the growth of 
our community mobile is also producing better business results for our 
partners. The results this quarter show our continued focus on improving our 
core products and bus


also going to stay focused on our core products and business. This is the 
best way for us to continue creating value for our
 
community.
 

goals; connecting everyone; understanding the world; and building the 
knowledge economy. Our strategy for connecting everyone has two basic 
approaches. Our first approach 
is Internet.org; our effort to bring affordable 
Internet access to every person in the world. Our second approach is by 
giving everyone more tools for connecting, so they can share all the different 
kinds of content they want with the right people. Instagr
am, Messenger and 
creative laptops are a part of the second approach.
 

with global operators and laid a foundation for running tests in more 
countries. Already, our initial partner
ships in the Philippine, Paraguay and 
Tanzania have helped around 3 million people connect to the Internet who 

acquired Pryte, which has a lot of expertise bringing affordable Inte
rnet 
access to communities by partnering with mobile operators, app developers 
and content providers. Later this year, we expect to launch a broader set of 
free basic Internet services in a number of other countries as well.
 

nuing to build momentum with messaging. 
People now send than 12 billion messages a day on Facebook, and in April 
we reached 200 million monthly actives on messenger. Last month we 
announced that David Marcus will be joining us from PayPal to lead our 
messa
ging efforts. We expect David to continue growing Messenger, building 
out new experiences to serve our community and ultimately to build 
Messenger into an important business.
 
Instagram continues to make great progress in giving people new ways to 
share the
ir stories through photos and videos. Last month we made one of 
the biggest updates ever to Instagram by adding new creative tools that 
allow people to refine exactly how their photos look and feel. This is an 

ability as a platform and 
serving the creativity of the Instagram community.
 

more than 1 billion search queries are made every day on Facebook. This is 
a great milestone and it s
hows we're in a unique position to answer a lot of 
questions for people. But this is just a start. And over the next few years as 
we make progress on building out search and our broader efforts in artificial 
intelligence, I expect us to deliver even greate
r utility for people.
 
Our progress on public content is also very promising. As part of helping 
people to better understand the world, we want to help you connect around 
important public moments and personalities. And now nearly 800 million 
people on Faceb
ook are connected to public figures. These connections are 
driving conversations at a huge scale. During the World Cup over 350 million 
people made over 3 billion interactions on Facebook. To enable even more of 
these conversations, we've improved the rank
ing of videos and newsfeed 
and launched new APIs to help TV and media organizations use Facebook 
content in their productions. Public content will continue to be a growing 
focus for us over the coming months and we plan to invest in building more 
great pro
ducts and partnerships in this area.
 

something we do alone. Supporting developers is a key part of our strategy, 
and in our F8 conference in April we announced new ways to help mobile 
devel
opers build, grow and monetize their apps. Over 1 billion people use 
Facebook on their phones every month and more than 80% of the top apps 

position to be the cross platform

platform 
that lets developers build great 
apps across every platform.
 

our new method of deep linking to specific content in any app is now being 
used by 100s of apps across iOS, Android and Wi
ndows phone, with links to 
more than 1 billion individual destinations in these apps. We also launched 
our Audience Network, our first big effort to help developers monetize on 


over the coming months and are excited by the opportunities ahead.
 


e reached some new milestones in the 
business. Now more than 30 million small businesses use Facebook pages to 
connect with their customers and more than 1.5 million of them are active 
marketers on Facebook. To continue delivering the best returns for 
mark

experiences for our community. Our goal here is to make ads as interesting 

this area. In this quarter we launched 
a number of efforts to improve the 
quality and relevance of our ads, including our new ads preferences tool, 
interest based advertising and improvements to News Feed design to reduce 
low quality content.
 
In some countries our surveys indicate that our ads 
are getting close to the 
quality level of organic content. But in most developed countries we still 
have lot to do. We expect to continue to focusing on this for a long time.
 

been 
a quarter with good performance and continued momentum. So I want 
to thank everyone who works with Facebook and is part of our community, 

continuing to make progress towards our missio
n to help connect the world, 

grateful for your support and to have the chance to work with all of you.
 
Thanks and now here's Sheryl.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks Mark and hi everyone. As Mark
 
said, we had a strong second 
quarter. Ad revenue grew 67% year
-
over
-
year to more than 2.6 billion. 
Mobile ad revenue grew 151% year
-
over
-
year and that makes up 62% of 
our ad revenue. We continue to focus on three key areas in investment; 
capitalizing on t
he shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using 
Facebook; and building our ad products. These investments continue to 
generate broad based growth.
 
All geographies and all marketer segments performed well this quarter. Our 
team has a really strong
 



join Mark in congratulating our global teams on 
their continued execution.
 
Today I'm going to focus on two of our key marketer segments; small 
business and brand marketers, as well as cover some of the investments 

-
tech front. We believe that personalized 
marketing of s
cale can drivers else for all types of marketers. Just a few 
weeks ago, I was in India and I hosted our first India SMB roundtable. One 
of the entrepreneurs I met, Vivek Prabhakar built his house just a few years 
ago to raise the money to start his and his
 


leading marketing channel and is responsible for 35% of online revenue and 
38% of their Web site traffic. Their Facebook ads deliver a 5x return on 
advertis
ing spend and has helped company grow to more than 150 
employees in three offices.
 
We have more than 30 million active small business pages, and over 19 
million of these are active on mobile. We think we have a big opportunity to 
help SMBs like Chumbak gro
w their businesses, and I'm pleased to

increasingly recognize how our scale, targeting and measurement 
capabilities can drive great results. For example, P&G and Gillette worked 
with us and agencies IVS and Mediacom to launch its Vector III razor to men 
in India. 80% of the 100 million Facebook users in India are on mobile and a 
majority of these are using 
feature phones. This was our first feature phone 
only Facebook campaign. It reached 60% of Gillette's target audience and 
generated significant lift in both message and ad recall.
 
As we work with brand marketers around the world, we focus on how they 
can l
everage our technology platform to build their brands to create a story 
telling. We saw many great examples of this, at the recent online festival. 
We were excited that campaigns that make Facebook a key part of their 
effort took home prestigious awards.
 
T
he World Cup also provided a great opportunity for brand building on 
Facebook. Facebook was an important part of this global event with 350 
million people joining a conversation, generating 3 billion interactions. The 
final was the single most talked about
 
sporting event in Facebook history, 
generating 280 million interactions from 88 million people.
 
Brands such as Diesel, Nike, Ford and McDonalds capitalize on this global 
conversation. McDonalds worked with agencies, OMD, Framestore, and ARC 
sponsorship, a
s well as Facebook's Creative Shop to produce 30 videos that 
used french fries as players. FryFutbol recreated the most spectacular World 
Cup moments and ran them as videos the very next day with the french fries 
acting as the players. This campaign reache
d 125 million people in 158 
countries.
 
We also remain committed to investing in product development to drive 
higher returns for all of our marketers. Our custom audience's capabilities, 
which enable better targeting are been adopted quickly and are now bee
n 
used by 91 Ad Age 100. Earlier this year, we launched website Custom 
Audiences, which enabled marketers to target recent visitors to their 

works across both web and mobile. We're 
pleased with the early reaction 
from marketers.
 
We also introduced premium autoplay video ads this year. Video on 
Facebook helps brands extend their TV investments by combining traditional 
reach focus campaigns with our unparalleled targeting abilities. To
day, we 
run about a dozen campaigns and the early data show promising results. 


rolling these ads outs ca
refully as well.
 
In all of this we remained focused on the transition to mobile. Our recently 
launched audience network lets advertisers use Facebook targeting while 
extending their campaign beyond Facebook. This can improve the relevance 
of ad peoples see
 

early response.
 
Finally, earlier this summer we announced the acquisition of LiveRail, a 
leading online video advertising platform that enables customers like 
MLB.com and A&E Networks to monetize their 
video inventory efficiently. We

making. We're the first plat
form that can deliver personalized marketing at 
scale and marketers are increasingly recognizing to great result so we can 
drive for them. Staying focused and executing will remain a major thing for 
us moving forward. Our teams know that our future success
 
depends upon 
our continued acquisition and our plan is to stay focused.
 
Thanks. And now here is Dave.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Thanks, Sheryl. And good afternoon everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us 
across our key operating and financial metrics. We generated strong
 
revenue 
growth in operating margins and delivered $872 million of free cash flow and 
we continue to make investments to drive our core business, as well as to 
support our long term strategic priorities.
 

cuting well on our 
ongoing mission to connect everyone. 829 million people use Facebook on 
an average day in June, up 130 million from a year ago. This represents 
63% of the 1.32 billion people who used Facebook during June.
 
Mobile continues to be a strong
 
driver of our growth with over 1 billion 

more ways for people to connect and share beyond the core Facebook app. 
For instance, both Instagram and Messenger have each passed over 200 
million MAU and continue to grow nicely.
 
Turning now to the financials, total revenue in the second quarter was 2.9 
billion up 61% or 59% on a constant currency basis. Total ad revenue was 
$2.7 billion, up 67% or 65% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenu
e 
growth was strong around the world with each of our four geographic 
regions growing by over 60%. Mobile ad revenue was approximately 1.66 
billion or 62% of ad revenue, compared to approximately $660 million or 
41% of ad revenue last year.
 
Desktop ad reve
nue was up 8% year
-
over
-
year. In Q2, the average affective 
price per ad increased 123% compared to last year, while total ad 
impressions declined 25%. The decrease in ad impressions continues to be 
driven by the shift towards mobile usage where people are 
shown fewer ads 
compared to desktop.
 
The increase in the average price per ad was primarily driven by an increase 
in the percentage of our ads being served in News Feed. The price volume 
trends were generally consistent across all four reported geographic 
regions.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was $234 million up 9% versus last 
year. As we have noted in the past we believe the more meaningful 
comparison that better reflects the organic growth rate of the payments 
business, comes from looking at paym
ents volume from games specifically, 
which was up 1% in Q2 versus last year.
 
Our current games payment revenue comes entirely from desktop usage and 
we are seeing declines in the number of people using Facebook on desktop, 
a trend that will make growing th
is business challenging going forward.
 
Turning to expenses, our Q2 GAAP expenses were $1.5 billion, up 22%, and 
our non
-
GAAP expenses were $1.2 billion, up 18%. Note that cost of 
revenue grew 2% on a GAAP basis and 1% on a non
-
GAAP basis, mainly 
driven by 
unusually high expenses in 2013 related to the transition out of 
certain leased data centers. This flatness in cost of revenue was the primary 
reason overall expenses grew relatively slowly.
 
Operating expenses excluding cost of revenue grew 33% on a GAAP b
asis 
and 31% on a non
-
GAAP basis. We ended Q2 with 7185 employees, up 36% 
from last year. Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, representing 
a 48% operating margin, up from 31% last year and our non
-
GAAP 
operating income was $1.7 billion, represen
ting a 59% non
-
GAAP operating 
margin, up from 44% last year. Our GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates were 
43% and 36%, respectively. GAAP net income was $791 million or $0.30 per 
share, and non
-
GAAP net income was $1.1 billion or $0.42 per share.
 
In Q2, we spent $
469 million on CapEx and generated $872 million of free 
cash flow. We ended Q2 with approximately $14 billion in cash and 
investments. This excludes the impact of the Oculus acquisition which was 
closed earlier this week and included am approximately $400 
million cash 
payment.
 
Now looking forward, let me start by noting that the forward
-
looking 

closed acquisition of Oculus, but exclude except where otherwise noted the 
impact from WhatsA
pp which we continue to expect will close later this year.
 
In terms of expenses, we expect that our total 2014 GAAP expenses, 
including cost of revenue and stock compensation, will likely grow in the 
neighborhood of 30% to 35%, and that our non
-
GAAP expens
es, including 
cost of revenue but excluding stock compensation, will grow at a similar 
rate. These rates are slightly lower than our prior expectations due to the 
efficiencies in areas like cost of revenue and G&A.
 
However, we believe that we are still in 
the early days of building out all of 

continue to invest aggressively in people, products and infrastructure in the 
second half of 2014 and beyond. Though it is premature to give a sp
ecific 
outlook for 2015 expenses, I wanted to note that we expect significant 
stock
-
based compensation and amortization expenses, as well as substantial 
incremental operating costs related to the acquisitions of Oculus and 
WhatsApp. This will add to our ov
erall expenses in 2015 and subsequent 
periods. These costs will be incremental to core Facebook expenses, which 
will continue to grow significantly in 2015 as we ramp investments in people, 
products and infrastructure.
 
For taxes, we expect GAAP and non
-
GAA
P rates for the rest of 2014 to be 
similar to our Q2 rates, although these could vary widely depending on our 
international revenue and expense mix, and other factors, most notably the 
impact from acquisitions, including the expected closing of WhatsApp la
ter 
this year. We continue to anticipate that 2014 CapEx will be approximately 
$2 billion to $2.5 billion. We expect shares outstanding to grow from around 
2.6 billion at the end of 2013 to approximately 2.9 billion at the end of 2014, 
again assuming Whats
App closes by the end of the year.
 
Turning last to revenue. As we saw in Q2, our year
-
over
-
year growth rate 
declined from 72% in Q1 to 61% in Q2 or 59% on a constant currency basis. 
This is consistent with our comments on the Q1 call when we indicated that
 
over the course of 2014, the year
-
over
-
year growth rates in revenue would 
decline meaningfully as the comps became more difficult. We expect this 
trend to continue over the course of the second half of the year.
 
While we are excited about the long
-
term po
tential of our app initiatives like 
Instagram, autoplay video, and the Audience Network, we are still in the 
early days of building these businesses and expect their revenue 
contribution to remain small in the near term. We remain optimistic as ever 
about 
the long
-
term opportunity to grow revenue by improving the quality 
and relevance of our ads and increasing the value we bring to marketers 
through our products, tools and technologies.
 
In summary, we're very pleased with our overall performance in Q2 
and in 
particular the continued growth of our mobile audience, the strength of our 
ads business and the investments we're making to build long
-
term 
shareholder value.

relevant for people and marketers, and increasingly with the 
Audience Network we have a goal to do that for publishers as well. Video is 

both desktop and mobile. So LiveRail has a l

Two quick questions from me. First would just be, if you could share with us 
any qualitative commentary about the breadth of mobile ad
 
revenue. There 
is always a lot of debate back and forth about how big mobile app installs 
are. And if there is anything you could share with us about the breadth of 
these 
--
 
the breadth of mobile has kind of been changing over the last year 
or so? And the
n the follow up question would just be related to; how your 
conversations with advertisers are changing as people start to think 
collectively about their TV and video budget together. I'm just wondering if 

 
TV advertisers start to 
change somewhat over the last six months or so? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So when you think about our mobile ads, and I'm really glad you asked this 
question. I do think sometimes people think that mobile app install ads are 
all o


broad based. We have large brand advertisers, small SMBs, direct response 
advertisers as well as developers us
ing our mobile ads. The mobile app 
install ads, which are run not only by developers but also by large companies 
that want to get people to install apps are growing. They remain a good part 

s there. 
But we see our opportunities in mobile ads as much broader than just 
installing apps.
 

last really year, year and a half on Facebook, is people understanding how 
strong the
 


the move to mobile and our ads on News Feed, an opportunity to do great 
creative story telling. A great recent exa
mple is the progressive baby ads if 

making a really important point, which is people should be buying their own 
insurance, but the ability for them to do that ad is based on the technolo
gy 

their agency on the creative part.
 
And so I think for a long time people have thought TV whisper creative 
storytelling and online ads work for more targeted text based results. And I
 


budgets work much better together.

So, on the buy button, we launched a small test in the U.S. only, which 
enables people to hit a buy button and on pages or in page post ads on 
Facebook. It 
streamlines the process of buying from our clients. No one is 

clients. I think commerce is really important and is a growing important part 
of our business as all marketer segments are 

people should confuse that with Facebook selling things directly. The more 
people buy online, the more people buy things they discover through their 
mobile phones, the more people discover things from a News Feed and go 
on to pur
chase, the more important we are in driving e
-
commerce and I 

have to sell products.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, and I'd just add to that because some of the question was about 
payments that 
we will clearly do work in payments to accept payments for 
advertising and on platform and other things that we do. But just because 

--
 
we still basically view ourselves as a partner to 
other companies in the payment space rathe
r than trying to compete directly 
for that. Our main business is advertising and I think we're mostly, to the 

make one more point, just related to that because I think some of the
 

in the other apps outside of Facebook. So things like Messenger and 
WhatsApp over time, when that closes and Instagram, I really do just want 
to emphasize that there is a lot of work 
to set up the foundation for having a 

going to be years of work before those are huge businesses for us. And I'm 
liking where we are now on something like the Messenger, to where we were
 
on Facebook in like 2006 or 2007, where it was primarily consumer product 
at that time where you really only communicated with friends.
 
And a bunch of people asked us, and said that we should put ads. But before 
we did that we wanted to create really good
 
organic consumer experiences 
for people to interact with different entities. So we created Pages, so people 
could interact with organic businesses. And then in order to make it so that 
businesses and public figures and folks would create pages, we offered
 
Insights on different products. And we gave all those things away for free. 

million businesses today, using Pages on the platform, and Insights, we kind 
of give away for free in o
rder to enable more folks to use Pages.
 
Then only after we had a good kind of organic interaction that people could 
and would want to interact with these different businesses and entities; that 
we really layer ads on top of that and start to build the busi
ness that we 

a number of comments that we think that some of these newer initiatives 
are going to ramp over time. We really do mean that. And we are serious 
about doing this the
 
right way and building up new ecosystems and I think 

that we need to make it be something that's scalable over time, rather than 
trying to have this be an impact that you will 

know, short

To the World Cup part of your question; brands certainly use the World Cup 
and big events like this to launch things as they continue to as ad campaign. 
They also have other big e
vents that come along as well as their own events 
around product launches. And so we think, obviously not every day is a 
World Cup, but there are lots of opportunities throughout the year and 
through the product cycle to work with brand advertisers in big 
ways.

I have one question for Mark on the product side and then one for Dave. 
Mark, so App Links just launched, if you go out a few year

you think something like deep linking could increase engagement or ad 
effectiveness for Facebook and for those 1 billion links that you have up and 
running already, what are you seeing in those early tests? And then Dave,

share here on App Links. 
It's still early. People have marked up a bunch of apps with this metadata, 
that allows us to search for it, but Search for Facebook is going to be a 
multiyear voyage and there is just so much content that is unique to the 
Facebook
 
ecosystem that we can answer questions for you that really no 
other service can. Just like the other day I was curious about finding out 

know any other service where you can just
 
go do that query but on 
Facebook you can and the secret to this is going to be basically just over a 
long period of time indexing all of the different content that's on Facebook in 
every different way.
 
So we started off with people. There's obviously a ne
ed to be able to find 
people in order to use the product and add friends and just have our core 
kind of ecosystem work but we're indexing more into connections and now 
we're getting into more of the content and it's a huge amount of contents. I 
think there
 
was more than a trillion posts, which some of the search 
engineers on the team like to remind me is bigger than any web search 


ng to start of 

those questions elsewhere.
 
App Links by definition of being outside of Facebook are not going to be 
unique to Facebook. So we'll get to that overtime. I think it wi
ll be a valuable 
part of the ecosystem. But honestly we're mostly interested in that to enable 
value for other developers and pushing distribution to them than we are for 

able to m
ake a set of people in their app, can share content on Facebook 
and then link directly to the right part of the app, and enable some 
engagement ads. So that way a developer can say a person was using my 
app and they were going to buy something but they dro
pped out of the 

to the checkout flow, so that they can complete their conversion. And you

Dave Wehner
 
Yes, and Ross on your question on mobile ads. Mobile BAU is ramping nicely, 

regions. Of course mobile ads are ramping as well. In terms of pric
ing we 

made clear, the 123% increase in price was driven by a mix shift with a 
higher percentage of News Feed ads. And new feed ads are really effective 
for marketers and that inc
ludes mobile News Feed ads as well. They deliver 

auction, because the price of ads really correlates to the value that they 
create. And we continue to focus on making those ad u
nits better and better, 
more relevant and targeted for the people who use Facebook as well as for 


all of that

So you mentioned over 1 billion users, 80% of app developers use the 
Facebook 
login on iOS and Android. When we think about Facebook as a 
platform, can you provide any stats on the number of developers who are 
starting to build their experience on Facebook? And then how do they need 
to be to see things like app linking, data formats
, auto play video or other? 
Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 


a little bit more of this dynamic with Ken, just o

shifted the strategy to helping developers with three things, build, grow and 
monetize their apps. And we have a number of services that developers can 
plug into their apps to help out with all three of those. So for example we 
hav
e

and for helping people build their app, we do things like login and we 
have services like parse that help developers build apps more easily. That 
stuff is all great for helping folks build social apps in a way that's faster than 
they could have otherw
ise.
 
In terms of growth, I think we offer tools like sharing and messaging that 
people can enable. Our developer can enable their users to be able to 
organically spread the app. We also have things like app installs and 
engagement ads that make it so that 
developers and pay to increase that. 
And then on the monetize side, we are rolling out the Audience Network and

could just walk us through your current thoughts. The reason I asked is 
because Facebook recently introduced the anonymous l

specifically opt in, can you just give us a sense, is this kind of a change of a 
strategic shift in thinking or tone with regards to privacy? Thank you so 
much.
 
Mar
k Zuckerberg
 
This is 
-
 

about Facebook. One of the things that we focused on the most is creating 
private faces for people to share things and have interactions that they 

elsewhere. So if you go back to the very beginning of 

you could be completely public and there were emails right. So you could 
circulate something completely privately.
 
So there was no s
pace where you could share with just your friends and 
have that 
--
 

completely public and that it's 100 or 150 of the people that you care about. 
And creating that space, which was a space that had the
 
kind of privacy that 
no one had ever seen before was what enabled and continues to enable the 
kind of interactions and the content that people feel comfortable sharing in 

 
So we're comfortably loo
king for new opportunities to create new dynamics 
like that and open up new different private spaces for people where they can 
then feel comfortable sharing and having the freedom to express something 

ons why I'm personally 
so excited about messaging. Because like right now I think at some level, 

your friends. We still think that there's more to do there but it's like the 
amoun
t of messaging and how quickly we see that growing, it's crazy. 
Because like there is just a lot more that people want to express and that 
they need the tools to express with smaller groups of people, not just one 
person at a time but smaller groups as wel
l. Things like anonymous login 
totally unlocks different behavior. So how many times would you want to 

with that app but if you can do it anonymously, we think that can unlock o
f 
lot of different interactions and experiences that people want to have. So we 
do our jobs as like very fundamentally providing people with these spaces 
and tools, which I think is very different from how a lot of people think about 
what Facebook is but i

I can talk a



have been talking about for a really long t

the technology that this team has developed. And this hits on a different 
part of our strategy, which 
--
 
the way that I organize my remarks every 
quarter are around these 10 year goals and themes that we have for the 
Compan
y, connecting everyone, understanding the world, helping to build 
the knowledge economy and these future platforms. So when I'm talking 

further out than you think, I think that this 
stuff is actually even further out 
than that.
 
But there are huge opportunities to build the next generation of computing 
platform. When mobile was getting defined we were basically just getting 
founded, in 2004. The first Smartphone came out and 2003. 
And we have 
mostly been a company that has played on top of the different mobile 
foundations that other companies have built. And one of the things that I 
care really deeply about on some of the tenures arc for the company is 
having a different relationshi
p to whatever the next set of computing 
platforms are and investing accordingly now to make sure that when the 
next set of computing platforms get defined, we can help define what the 
next generation of computing is going to be.
 
So I think virtual reality,
 
augmented reality, vision, some of the AI work that 



the coin is to emphasize 

these things to do it right over the long term. And so I think David pointed 
out that we expect to continue investing heavily and that our costs will 
increa

have a lot more new strategic priorities, but we expect to go very deep on 
the priorities that we have to make

Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had 
another solid quarter. Revenue grew
 
42% year
-
over
-
year to $13.2 billion. 
And Facebook now has more than 2.2 billion monthly active with almost 1.5 
billion actives using it every day.
 
For the first time today, we're also releasing how many people use at least 
one of our apps, Facebook, Whats
App, Instagram or Messenger, and that's 
2.5 billion people each month. This number better reflects our community 
for a couple of reasons. First, it refers to individual people rather than active 
accounts, so it excludes when people have multiple active acc
ounts on a 
single app. And second, it reflects that many people use more than one of 
our services. And Dave will explain this in a little more detail later.
 
I want to start by talking about all the investments we've made over the last 
six months to improve
 
safety, security and privacy across our services. This 
has been a lot of hard work and it's starting to pay off.
 
We recently launched two important ad transparency tools: one to let 
anyone see the ads any page is running even if the ads aren't targeted to
 
you; and the other an archive of ads with political or issue content that's 
starting in the U.S. ready for the midterm election. These ads are now 
labeled so you can clearly see who's paying for them and, within the 
archives, you can see the budget associ
ated with each ad, how many people 
saw it, and search all ads with political or issue content that an advertiser 
has run for up to seven years. This level of transparency will mean increased 
accountability and responsibility for advertisers globally.
 
Over 
the next 18 months, there are important elections beyond the U.S. in 
Brazil, India, and the EU, and these will all be real tests for Facebook. But 
I'm confident that we will get this right given our results during last year's 
French and German elections, t
he Alabama special election, as well as this 
month's presidential election in Mexico, where our systems found and 
removed thousands of fake account pages and groups that violated our 
policies.
 
Of course, security is not a problem that you ever fully solve.
 
We face 
sophisticated well
-
funded adversaries who are constantly evolving. But, 
during each election, we learn and improve too. We're also making progress 
in the fight against misinformation. We're getting rid of the financial 
incentives for spammers to c
reate fake news, much of which is economically 
motivated. We stopped pages that repeatedly spread false information from 
buying ads. And we also use AI to prevent fake accounts that generate a lot 
of the problematic content from ever being created in the f
irst place.
 
Our investments in AI mean that we can now remove more bad content 
quickly because we don't have to wait until after it's reported. It frees our 
reviewers to work on cases where human expertise is needed to understand 
the context or nuance of a
 
situation.
 
In Q1, for example, almost 90% of graphic violence content that we 
removed or added a warning label to was identified using AI. This shift from 
reactive to proactive detection is a big change, and it will make Facebook 
safer for everyone.
 
I als
o want to talk about privacy. GDPR was an important moment for our 
industry. We did see a decline in monthly actives in Europe, down by about 
1 million people as a result. And at the same time, it was encouraging to see 
the vast majority of people affirm t
hat they want us to use context, including 
from websites they visit, to make their ads more relevant and improve their 
overall product experience.
 
Looking ahead, we will continue to invest heavily in security and privacy 
because we have a responsibility to
 
keep people safe. But, as I've said on 
past calls, we're investing so much in security that it will significantly impact 
our profitability. We're starting to see that this quarter. But, in addition to 
this, we also have a responsibility to keep building s
ervices that bring people 
closer together in new ways as well.
 
Now, in light of increased investment in security, we could choose to 
decrease our investment in new product areas, but we're not going to, 
because that wouldn't be the right way to serve our c
ommunity and because 
we run this company for the long term not for the next quarter. And Dave 
will talk about this in a few minutes.
 
Now, perhaps one of the most important things we've done this year to bring 
people closer together is to shift News Feed to
 
encourage connection with 
friends and family over passive consumption of content. We've launched 
multiple changes over the last half to News Feed that encourage more 
interaction and engagement between people, and we plan to keep launching 
more like this.
 
Now, of course, connecting isn't limited to News Feed. Now, there are more 
than 200 million people that are members of meaningful groups on 
Facebook, and these are communities that, upon joining, they become the 
most important part of your Facebook experie
nce and a big part of your real 
world social infrastructure. These are groups for new parents, for people 
with rare diseases, for volunteering, for military families deployed to a new 
base and more.
 
We believe there is a community for every one on Facebook
. And these 
meaningful communities often spend online and offline and bring people 
together in person. We found that every great community has an engaged 
leader. But running a group can take a lot of time. So we have a road map 
to make this easier. That wi
ll enable more meaningful groups to get formed, 
which will help us to find relevant ones to recommend to you, and eventually 
achieve our five
-
year goal of helping 1 billion people be a part of meaningful 
communities.
 
Now, since the 1970s, there has been th
is long decline in people joining 
physical groups around the world, and that has contributed to a broad 
feeling of loneliness and isolation. But if we can help 1 billion people be a 
part of something meaningful, then that can help reverse this trend.
 
Talki
ng about being a part of something meaningful, it's been inspiring to 
see how people are using our fundraising tools to make a difference. Last 
month, a campaign to raise $1,500 for undocumented children separated 
from their families at the border ended up
 
going viral and raising more than 
$20 million from more than 0.5 million donors all around the world. This 
quarter, we added the ability for pages to create and donate to fundraisers 
for causes that they care about too.
 
This quarter, we also reached a mil
estone with now more than 1 billion 
actives on Instagram. And this is a moment to reflect on how this acquisition 
has been an amazing success. When Instagram joined us the team had only 
16 people. And since then, Kevin and the team have built Stories, Dire
ct, 
and now IGTV. This has been a story of great innovation and product 
execution. And it's also a story of how effective the integration has been.
 
We believe Instagram has been able to use Facebook's infrastructure to 
grow more than twice as quickly as it
 
would have on its own. So a big 
congratulations to the Instagram team and to all the teams across our 
company that have contributed to this success.
 
I'm really excited about video too. And this quarter, we launched IGTV. 
People are watching less TV, but m
ore video, but most video is not yet 
optimized for mobile. IGTV will help solve that problem. It's designed 
specifically for mobile and makes watching long
-
form vertical video from 
creators easy. There's a stand
-
alone IGTV app, but you can also watch 
withi
n the Instagram app, so that means the entire Instagram community 
has been able to use it from the start.
 
We're also seeing Watch start to grow more quickly on Facebook too. Our 
teams are focused on building new experiences that help people connect and 
start conversation. We recently rolled out Watch Party to all groups, so you 
can watch and chat with friends at the same time. And we're seeing some 
real traction with some of the original program, from the talk show Red 
Table Talk, featuring Jada Pinkett 
Smith, to Skam, an interactive series that 
started in Norway and features a new style of storytelling where the 
characters have accounts on Facebook and Instagram, and key parts of the 
story are told not just through video, but through posts on their pages
.
 
Stories continue to be a big part of the future of sharing too, and they're 
growing quickly across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. 
While we started off just implementing the basic Stories format, we've now 
moved well beyond it, and have buil
t lots of new features like polls, 
questions, and collaborative stories and groups and events. And we're also 
making progress developing Stories into a great format for ads. We've made 
the most progress here on Instagram, but this quarter, we started testi
ng 
Stories ads on Facebook too.
 
The other major trend we're seeing is the shift to more private messaging. 
There's a lot to build here. We've been testing payments on WhatsApp in 
India, and it gives people a really simple way to send money to each other 
an
d contribute to greater financial inclusion. And of the people who have 
tested this, feedback and usage have been very strong. All signs point to a 
lot of people wanting to use this when the government gives us the green 
light. And in the meantime, we've b
roadened our focus to building this for 
other countries so we can give more people this ability faster. Over the next 
five years, we're focused on building out the business ecosystem around 
messaging on WhatsApp and Messenger.
 
More broadly, our strategy is
 
to use Facebook's computing infrastructure, 
business platforms and security systems to serve people across all of our 
apps. For example, we made the decision a decade ago to build our own 
data centers, and we opened our first custom
-
built data center in 2
011. 
Today, we have six data centers around the world, and we're working on 
building eight more. We're using AI systems in our global community 
operations team to fight spam, harassment, hate speech, and terrorism 
across all of our apps to keep people safe
. And this is incredibly useful for 
apps like WhatsApp and Instagram as it helps us manage the challenges of 
hyper
-
growth there more effectively.
 
Beyond apps and looking at the next 10 years, we're making a lot of 
progress with virtual reality. Our goal is
 
to create that feeling of presence 
like you're right there with people you care about even if you might be 
halfway around the world. Oculus Go is off to a good start, and at $199, it's 
going to be how a lot of people experience virtual reality for the fir
st time. 
Overall, this is a critical year for Facebook. We've made progress preventing 
abuse, forged ahead with new innovation, and are adapting our services to 
the new trends of messaging, Stories, videos and groups.
 
As always, thank you for being a part 
of this journey, and I'm looking 
forward to making more progress together. And now, here is Sheryl to talk 
about our business.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
Hi, everyone. It was a good second quarter with ad revenue growing 42% 
year
-
over
-
year. Mobi
le ad revenue was $11.9 billion, a 50% increase year
-
over
-
year, making up approximately 91% of total ad revenue. Our growth, 
again, was broad
-
based across regions, marketer segments and verticals.
 
We are working to ensure that Facebook is a safe place for 
people and 
businesses. We've taken strong steps to address a number of issues, 
including election integrity, fake news and protecting people's information. 
One of the most important things we can do to affect change is to increase 
transparency because tran
sparency leads to greater accountability.
 
For example, when anyone can see any ad on Facebook, advertisers have to 
stand behind the ads they run. Transparency also allows us to get more 
input from our community and from experts around the world, so that we
 
can find and fix problems. We wish we could find everything ourselves, but 
we never will, so we're building tools to make it easier for people to report 
issues to us.
 
As Mark mentioned, this quarter, we took major steps to make advertising in 
pages more t
ransparent. Now anyone can see all the ads a page is running 
across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Audience Network. You can also 
learn more about pages even if they don't advertise. You can see when a 
page was created and if they've changed their name
.
 
For political and issue ads, we're going even further. Advertisers placing ads 
with political content are now required to verify their identity and location. 
These ads will be labeled with a disclosure about who paid for them and 
saved in a searchable ar
chive.
 
The vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations 
from small businesses looking for new customers to advocacy groups raising 
money for their causes. But we've seen that bad actors can misuse our 
products too, so we're erring o
n the side of transparency. We're being 
intentionally broad in our interpretation of political and issue ads. This 
includes ads for books about politicians and brand campaigns that touch on 
national issues.
 
Given our commitment to transparency, we think it
's important to apply this 
policy to more ads rather than fewer. These steps are just the start. We'll 
keep looking for ways to improve, and we hope these tools become standard 
across the industry. As we make these investments in transparency and 
accountab
ility, we remain focused on our key priorities: helping businesses 
leverage the power of mobile, developing innovative ad products, and 
making our ads more relevant and effective.
 
First: leveraging the power of mobile. For businesses, winning on mobile 
now
 
means winning on video. Globally, people are creating and watching 
more video, especially on mobile devices. According to eMarketer, nearly a 
quarter of the world's population will watch video on a mobile phone this 
year. We see this trend toward video ac
ross all of our apps, from people 
sharing more video with their friends on Facebook, to watching more video 
from creators on Instagram, to having more video calls on WhatsApp and 
Messenger.
 
Marketers are making more video of their own. We're seeing healthy
 
growth 
in video ads among all advertiser segments. M&M's UK recently used mobile
-
optimized five
-
second video ads on Facebook and Instagram to introduce 
M&M's Mix, a bag of three kinds of M&M's in one. Their campaign worked, 
driving results not just for th
eir new product but for the brand overall. Their 
sales increased by over 10% and 80% of that came from households that 
had not bought M&M's in the previous 26 weeks.
 
Second: developing new ad products. We know that creating video can be 
more difficult for 
small businesses that have fewer resources, so we've 
launched new tools on Facebook to help anyone make videos that work well 
on mobile. Last quarter, we released Ads Animator, a simple way to create 
eye
-
catching video ads using photos and other content th
at's already on a 
company's Facebook page. We're also testing Video Creation Kit, which gives 
advertisers easy
-
to
-
use video templates for different marketing objectives. 
By learning what performs best across our platform, we can help other 
businesses succe
ed.
 
We're also making it easier to run ads on Instagram and in Stories. Ads in 
Stories are an immersive engaging way for people to interact with 
businesses. When online retailer Overstock wanted to gain new customers 
and increase furniture sales, they ran 
video ads in Instagram Stories with a 
shop now button. They saw an 18% increase in return on ad spend and a 
20% decrease in cost per acquisition. This quarter, we made it easier for 
more advertisers to adopt the Stories format. When an advertiser uploads 
v
ideo in a square or horizontal format for feed, we can automatically 
transform it into the full
-
screen vertical format of Stories.
 
Third: making our ads more relevant and effective. We're building new 
products and improving existing ones to ensure advertis
ers can reach the 
right audience. For example, automatic placements help advertisers get 
better results by showing ads across our platform wherever they'll perform 
best and at the lowest cost. SumUp, a German payment start
-
up that helps 
small businesses ac
cept debit and credit cards, switched from manual to 
automatic placements and increased sales by 34% in one week.
 
Advertisers of all sizes want to know if their ads are working and how to 
make them better, but smaller businesses don't always have this capa
bility. 
We're changing that. Last year, we introduced Test and Learn, a way for 
advertisers to run variations of their ads and measure the results in just a 
few steps. We started with tools for direct response advertisers to figure out 
what drives conversi
ons.
 
In Q2, we added a way for companies to understand the effect of their ads 
on brand perception. We plan to roll this out to all advertisers, big and small, 
so they can easily experiment with different strategies and find the ones that 
work best.
 
As alw
ays, I'm grateful to our teams around the world. Their work over the 
past several months has helped millions of businesses grow and created new 
levels of transparency in advertising. I'd also like to thank our partners and 
the businesses of all sizes who t
urned to us to reach their customers and 
give us the feedback that helps make us better.
 
Thank you. And now, here's Dave.

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with our 
community metrics. Daily active us
ers on Facebook reached 1.47 billion, up 
11% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia and the 
Philippines. This number represents approximately 66% of the 2.23 billion 
monthly active users in Q2. MAUs were up 228 million or 11% compared to 
last year. It's worth noting that MAU and DAU in Europe were both down 
slightly quarter
-
over
-
quarter due to the GDPR roll out, consistent with the 
outlook we gave on the Q1 call.
 
As Mark mentioned, we're also introducing a family
-
wide audience metric, 
2.5 
billion people worldwide used one of our applications in June. This is our 
best estimate of our de
-
duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, 
Messenger, and WhatsApp. We believe this number better reflects the size of 
our community and the fact that m
any people are using more than one of 
these services.
 
Note that, for comparison purposes, Facebook MAU does count multiple 
accounts for a single user when such accounts exist, and we estimate those 
represent approximately 10% of our Facebook MAU as previou
sly disclosed 
in the limitation of key metrics section in our SEC filings. The family 
audience metric only counts a single user in these instances.
 
Turning now to the financials; all comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q2 tota
l revenue was $13.2 billion, up 42% or 38% 
on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange tailwinds contributed 
approximately $370 million of revenue in Q2. Q2 ad revenue was $13 billion, 
up 42% or 38% on a constant currency basis.
 
In terms of ad 
revenue by region, Europe and Asia
-
Pacific both grew fastest 
at 47% each and benefited from foreign exchange tailwinds. I'd note that 
European ad revenue growth decelerated more quickly than other regions 
and was impacted primarily by reduced currency tail
winds and, to a lesser 
extent, the roll out of GDPR.
 
Mobile ad revenue was $11.9 billion, up 50%, and represents approximately 
91% of ad revenue. In Q2, the average price per ad increased 17% and the 
number of ad impressions served across our services incr
eased 21%, driven 
primarily by ads in feed on Instagram and Facebook. Payments and other 
fees revenue was $193 million, up 23%.
 
Turning now to expenses; total expenses were $7.4 billion, up 50%. We 
ended Q2 with over 30,000 full
-
time employees, up 47% comp
ared to last 
year. Operating income was $5.9 billion, representing a 44% operating 
margin. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 13%.
 
Net income was $5.1 billion or $1.74 per share. Capital expenditures were 
$3.5 billion, driven by investments in data 
centers, servers, network 
infrastructure, and office facilities. In Q2, we generated $2.8 billion of free 
cash flow and ended the quarter with approximately $42 billion in cash and 
investments. And, in the second quarter, we bought back approximately 
$3.2 
billion of our Class A common stock.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook; our total revenue growth rate 
decelerated approximately 7 percentage points in Q2 compared to Q1. Our 
total revenue growth rates will continue to decelerate in the second half of 
2018
, and we expect our revenue growth rates to decline by high
-
single digit 
percentages from prior quarters sequentially in both Q3 and Q4.
 
There are several factors contributing to that deceleration. For example, we 
expect currency to be a slight headwind in
 
the second half versus the 
tailwinds we have experienced over the last several quarters. We plan to 
grow and promote certain engaging experiences like Stories that currently 
have lower levels of monetization, and we are also giving people who use 
our serv
ices more choices around data privacy, which may have an impact 
on our revenue growth.
 
Turning now to expenses; we continue to expect that full
-
year 2018 total 
expenses will grow in the range of 50% to 60% compared to last year. In 
addition to increases in
 
core product development and infrastructure, this 
growth is driven by increasing investment in areas like safety and security, 
AR/VR, marketing, and content acquisition. Looking beyond 2018, we 
anticipate that total expense growth will exceed revenue grow
th in 2019.
 
Over the next several years, we would anticipate that our operating margins 
will trend towards the mid
-
30s on a percentage basis. We expect full
-
year 
2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $15 billion, driven by 
investments in data cen
ters, servers, network infrastructure, and office 
facilities. We plan to continue to grow capital expenditures beyond 2018 to 
support global growth and our ongoing product needs.
 
Turning now to tax; at current stock prices, we expect our full
-
year 2018 tax
 
rate will be in the mid
-
teens, but that our Q3 tax rate will be 25% to 30% 
due to a one
-
time charge related to a recent court ruling in the IRS versus 
Altera case. As a reminder, fluctuations in our stock price will impact our tax 
price.
 
In summary, our c
ommunity and business growth remain solid. Our financial 
strength has enabled us to invest heavily to improve our ability to serve our 
global community through our family of apps as well as to prepare us for the 
future.
 
With that, operator, let's open up t
he call for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my questions. Two. Just the first one on monetization of 
Facebo
ok core versus Instagram; can you talk a little bit about how you 
think about monetization levels and the key drivers currently and, going 
forward, when we think about ad load, pricing and the importance of ad 
improvements across the two platforms over the
 
next, call it, year or so?
 
And the second one on Instagram TV, maybe just talk about how you look at 

 
think about the core consumer offering, how it varies from Facebook 
Watch and, philosophically, how you think about investing in premium 
content or spor
ts content across these two products. Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Brian, I'll take the first one. In terms of Facebook versus Instagram, they're 
obviously both contributing to revenue growth. Instagram is growing more 
quickly and making an inc
reasing contribution to growth. And we've been 
pleased with how Instagram is growing. Facebook and Instagram are really 
one ads ecosystem. I think, from a supply perspective, both now from a feed 
perspective are at similar ad loads. Instagram has more heav
y usage of 
Stories, so that's an area of continued growth opportunity because the 
effective levels of monetization in Stories are lower.
 
On the demand side, we see a good traction across both platforms, and 
we're rolling out more ability for advertisers to
 
leverage ads in Stories with 
more formats and the like. So that's, again, an important opportunity for 
growth is just continuing to build out more products on the demand side for 
Stories.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
And I can take the second p
art of the question about the 

 
what we're trying 
to do with IGTV and Watch at the same time. The IGTV product approach is 
very focused on helping people connect with creators in a mobile
-
native 
vertical video format and helping people not only see content
 
that they love 
from people that they want to follow, but build a community around those 
creators, which is what we see people are trying to do. And creators now 
uniquely have the ability to both reach a large audience and connect and 
engage the community 
through the social network on Instagram at the same 
time.
 
With Watch, a lot of what we're trying to do is make it so the video content 
that's on Facebook and some of the content that we're acquiring through 
original programming that people can come togethe
r with their friends to 
watch that content through things like Watch Party and engage and build 
community that way.
 
So there's a big space here in terms of helping people have real connections 
and interactions around video. These are two different takes on
 
this. Overall, 
what you're going to see from us on video is not just try to optimize for 
overall watch time, but to optimize for building products that help bring 
people together and help facilitate real interactions between people.
 
Operator
 
Your next que
stion comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
 
Eric J. Sheridan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe going back to the OpEx and your 
comments, Dave, looking out sort of medium to longer term, just wanted to 
understand if we can 
get a little bit more color on some of the drivers of 
that. How much of it could be video in support of where you want to take the 
business over the medium and long term versus things that maybe don't 
necessarily have a revenue component to them like the s
ecurity and the 
protection of the ecosystem that the whole team has been talking about 
since the end of last year? Thanks so much.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah, Eric, it's going to be a combination of those factors. I would say we're 
going to 
continue to invest in core product development and infrastructure. 
And so, you've seen that already in terms of the ramp that we have in 
capital expenditures. We're continuing to build out features and functionality 
for the community across a wide range of
 
different products, whether it be 
the ad products that Sheryl talked about or IGTV and the like.
 
In addition to those core developments, we're also making the significant 
long
-
term investments in safety and security. Those investments are in the 
billions 
of dollars per year. Those will have a negative impact on margins. 
We think that's the right thing to do for the business in terms of ensuring 
the community's safety and security and the durability of the franchise. So 
those are important investments from 
an ROI perspective, but they don't 
have, obviously, immediate translation into revenue dollars.
 
Secondly, we're continuing to make big investments in innovation. Those, 
we believe, are attractive long
-
term investments. The things that I would 
point to are 
things like AI as well as our investments in AR and VR. Those 
are things that will play out 

 
AI in the near
-
term, but the investments in AR 
and VR are really about building the next generation of computing, and 
that's got a longer
-
term return window. So, 
attractive investments we 
believe, but ones that will take longer
-
term to pay off, and those would have 
a dilutive effect on margins in the near
-
term. Those are the two factors that 
I would point to.
 
In addition, on the CapEx side, we're continuing to inve
st heavily on capital 
expenditures, first, to just get ahead of user growth and engagement and 
then also to make sure that we've got the compute available to support the 
growth of a number of the key drivers of our business around feed ranking 
and ads rank
ing. So, I think those are the things that I would point to, all 
factoring into the margin guidance that I gave.

Okay. Sorry. Dave, I think you said that the quarter
-
on
-
quarter growth rates 
are going to be high
-
single digits lower than the prior
-
year quarter
-
on
-
quarter growth rates versus 3Q and 4Q. That would imply around a 20% 
year
-
on
-
ye
ar growth rate exiting fourth quarter. So just want to clarify, is 
that what you actually said? And if so, what's driving this fairly dramatic 
deceleration in revenue growth?
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Ross, so, yes, so we grew at 42% in the current 
quarter and we would 
expect decel in the high
-
single digits for the next couple quarters. In terms 
of what is driving the deceleration, it's a combination of factors, and I think I 
outlined those in my commentary. First of all, there's the currency, which 
is 
going from being a tailwind to being a modest headwind, we expect.
 
Secondly, we're going to be focusing on growing engaging new experiences 
like Stories and promoting those. And that's going to have a negative impact 
on revenue growth. And then, finally
, we're giving people who use the 
services more choice around privacy, and that's coming both in terms of 
impacts that could be ongoing from things like GDPR as well as other 
product options that we're providing that could have an impact on revenue 
growth.
 
So it's a combination of all those factors that is leading to the 
deceleration of revenue growth in the second half.

Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Great. Thanks fo
r taking the question. A question for Mark. I was hoping you 
could talk about the company's focus on meaningful social interactions. 
Several months into some of those changes, do you think behavior on 
platform has shifted at all? And would you expect the i
mprovements in the 
experience to ultimately drive a rebound in core Facebook engagement? 
Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So, we've launched a number of changes that are focused towards 
trying to encourage more interaction at the expen
se of some passive 
consumption on the network. And we found that these have generally 
encouraged more interaction or positives, so we're going to keep on moving 
in this direction.
 
We're doing this for a number of reasons. One is that we just started 
getting 
a lot of feedback from people in the community that they wanted Facebook 
to be more about connecting with people, which is really the core of what it's 
always been, less so about viral videos or news content and just passive 
consumption. So that's 
one.
 
Another big driver is we've focused on trying to make sure that we 
understand the effects of using our services on people's well
-
being. That's 
important for all companies. And the research there is very clear that when 
people are using the Internet, a
nd including our services, to interact with 
other people, that's associated with all the positive elements of well
-
being 
that you'd expect: feeling more connected, feeling less lonely, feeling 
happier, and long
-
term measures of health but when you're simpl
y using the 
Internet to passively consume content that isn't necessarily associated with 
positive improvements to well
-
being.
 
So, both because of the feedback that we were getting and the research, we 
felt like this was really the right direction to go in.
 
We're seeing positive 
signs in terms of how it's encouraging people to interact more. Of the usage 
on the platform, we do think that that is the most valuable usage, but that's 
why we're going in that direction. And everything that we've seen so far 
sugge
sts to us that we should continue moving in that direction more.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
 
Great. Thank you. And, Mark, thank you for all the detailed co
mmentary in 
the beginning. I was just wondering if you could share with us, as you look 
ahead over the next 12 to 24 months and you think of assets that you have 
that you aren't currently monetizing in material ways, which of those do you 
think about 

 
whe
n you think about kind of layering on the next leg of the 
stool, if you will, which one of those would you expect us or would you 
expect to see start to contribute in a more meaningful way over the next 
couple of years? How would you rank order those asset
s that are not 
currently being monetized in a significant way at this point? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I'll take it. So, obviously, we started with ads in Facebook, and that was 
something we have grown and they continue to grow. The 
ads have 
expanded quite nicely to Instagram, and Instagram represents a very 
healthy part of the growth and we expect that to continue as well. When you 
think about things that are further out, I think you then start talking about 
our messaging apps.
 
We ar
e furthest ahead in Messenger, but it's still very early days. We're 
quite happy with consumer engagement with 1.3 billion monthly actives on 
the platform, and we continue to see a lot of organic connections between 
businesses and consumers on the messagin
g platform. We now have over 8 
billion messages sent between people and businesses per month, which 
includes automated messages. We're being very slow and deliberate with 
monetization. It's still in early days. But I think we've launched some things 
that p
eople are excited about and interested in like click
-
to
-
Messenger ads.
 
We also have some early nice results we can share from clients. One of them 
recently was LEGO. They launched a Messenger bot to help with gift 
recommendations, and they created a click
-
to
-
Messenger ads that link to a 
LEGO bot which helped provide product and gift recommendations.
 
They reached people over 25 years old in the U.S., UK, France and 
Germany, and targeted people who are interested in LEGO toys and 
shopping, and they found a 3.
4 times higher return on ad spend for click
-
to
-
Messenger ads versus those that just linked to the LEGO website. And I 
share that case because it shows what we're excited about. We're excited 
about a new surface where businesses can interact with consumers,
 
but also 
really a new functionality.
 
If you go further out, you would then start thinking about WhatsApp. We are 
very focused there on the user experience, but we're also focused even 
earlier stages on growing our business ecosystem. The WhatsApp Business
 
app has launched, and we now have more than 3 million people actively 
using it to test business solutions. So that's further out, but we think it has 
potential as well.

Mark Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Two questions, please; a near term one and a long term one. The near term 
one is can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of MAU 
recovery growth trends in Europe? You haven't 

 
you gave us what turned 
o
ut to be a pretty accurate read into the June quarter, so do you have a 
read into whether things have based out and started to improve again post 
GDPR implementation?
 
And then, I know, Sheryl, you just talked about this, but can I just ask you 
to just mayb
e comment a little bit more on Facebook Messenger? I've just 
seen the ad units there. They seem to be 

 
there seemed like there's been a 
pickup recently in implementation of ads there that seemed to me to be 
highly effective and reasonably well targeted. S
o any learnings just from 
those, the basic ad units that you put in there beyond the 

 
kind of the 
business metrics you just reported on? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Hey, Mark. It's Dave. On Europe, yeah, we don't have any update on trends.
 
We had indicated in the first quarter that we would expect to see a decline. 
We're not providing any guidance on MAU and DAU in Europe on this call.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
In terms of number two, we have an ad model where we're able to use 
the 
targeting capabilities for Facebook. But when we put ads into a new surface, 
we obviously learn and evolve. So, one example of some of the things that 
we're excited about, again, are the click
-
to
-
Messenger ads. That's something 
we can put in News Feed 
in Instagram and Messenger and it both grows the 
ecosystem and creates a new opportunity for interaction.
 
We also have inbox ads where we're enabling advertisers to extend their 
reach to people in Messenger, which is still really early. And we're also in t
he 
early days of sponsored messages, which enable businesses to reengage 
people once a conversation has started. And so, when we think about the

Great. Thanks. Mark or Sheryl, could you discuss your view about the 
importance of Instagram as a discovery platform for new and/or emerging 
brands and merchants? And then, over time, as these merchants and brands 
mature, how do you vie
w Instagram's ability to monetize? And then just a 
quick one on North American ad revenue; it was a bit lower than we 
expected in the second quarter. Don't know if you guys have any color 
there. Thank you.

On the 
first, when we think about Instagram, we think we have a great 
opportunity; 25 million Instagram business profiles, 2 million advertisers. 
We're growing quite nicely across brand and DR. And with 1 billion active 
people on the platform, I think Instagram i
s definitely both a direct response 
opportunity but an opportunity for discovery. Part of it's the format. The 
format is so visually appealing and people are telling stories with pictures, so 
we see both anecdotally and in the data that this is a great pla
ce for people 
to become aware of a product in the first place. And we see a lot of small 
businesses really able to do things on the platform.
 
I'll share a recent example. We just launched a shopping experience that 
was just expanded in Q2 to all consumers 
in an additional 45 countries. 
DefShop is an e
-
commerce fashion brand in Germany. They were an early 
tester for IG Shopping. And what they did in that test is tag each article of 
clothing. They had 56% more website visitors and a 64% increase in sales 
for 
tagged products. And I think a lot of those were discovered and 
purchased right through that advertising funnel.

John, its Dave. Just on the North American deceleration in ad revenue 
growth, kind of consistent with the tren
ds we've seen, so nothing there 
notable. I would say we're pleased at the growth that we're seeing at the 
scale at which we're operating. When you look at the deceleration, the one 
that I called out was really Europe where you saw the currency impact as 
we
ll as, to a lesser extent, GDPR causing sort of faster deceleration than in 
the other regions. I would say North America was more kind of within kind of 
what we're seeing across the rest of the business.

Great. Thank you. The guidance for the deceleration might raise some 
questions just on Facebook engagement. So just wondering how you're 
seeing activity within just 
core Facebook right now? Is it growing at a

with GDPR. Just wondering how you're thinking about how that will impact 
your ad targeting over the next year. Thank you.

Sure, Justin. I'll take that. So we're continuing to see good growth in the 
Facebook ecosystem with 11% DAU growth. And obviously, we've got 
broader family growth as well. In terms of, I guess, going to the GDPR 
question, we've talked about 

 
oh, sorry. Sheryl, were you going to take the 
GDPR question?
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah, I can talk about GDPR. GDPR has not had a revenue impact, but we 
also recognize it wasn't fully rolled out this quarter. It was very 
encouraging 
for us to see that the vast majority of people affirmed that they want us to 
use information, including from the websites they visit, to make their ads 
more relevant. But, as we look further out, we recognize that there's still 
risk, and we're 
going to watch closely.
 
Advertisers are still adapting to the changes, so it's early to know the 
longer
-
term impact. And things like GDPR and other privacy changes that 
may happen from us or may happen with regulation could make ads more 
relevant. One thin
g that we know that's not going to change is that 
advertisers are always looking for the highest ROI opportunity. And what's 
most important in winning budget is our relative performance in the 
industry, and we believe we'll continue to do very well on that
.

I'll give a little bit more color 

 
sorry. I wanted to give a little bit more color 
on some of the different regional trends we're seeing on Facebook DAU. U.S. 
and Canada, sort of consistent
 
with past quarters, has been flat at about 185 
million, and we would expect that to continue to bounce around. Europe, we 
saw the declines that we anticipated from GDPR. And I would say there, 
really, those impacts were purely due to the GDPR impact, not 
other 
engagement trends. So I would point to that. Otherwise, I think feeling good 
about Europe.
 
Worldwide, we've got kind of different puts and takes. Indonesia had a SIM 
card registration requirement that caused a little bit of a headwind in APAC. 
And th
en rest of world, we saw some countries come back online like 
Ethiopia came back online. So some different puts and takes, but overall, 
still seeing regional growth across all regions with the exception of the 
U.S./Canada being flat.

Thanks. Just following up on the comments, Sheryl mentioned that there's 
really no meaningful impact on GDPR to the ad business, at least as of now. 
But then, Dav
e, I think you mentioned that because you're giving people 
more control over their privacy and data that this is one of the reasons why 
you're expecting the meaningful decel in the second half; so just trying to 
recognize those two things. Maybe the questi
ons have been too specific 
around the impact of GDPR and should be more broad around data and 
privacy? And I guess, ultimately, the question is what impact, if any, these 
greater controls that you're giving users having on ad revenue growth and 
monetizatio
n? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure, Mark. Let me take that. So GDPR didn't have a significant impact in 
Q2, partially because of its implementation date. So you're just seeing 
effectively one month of it in terms of revenue. We do think that 
there will 
be some modest impact, and I don't want to overplay these factors, but 
you've got a couple of things going on. You've got the impact of the opt
-
outs. And while we're very pleased with the vast majority of people opting 
into the third
-
party data 
use, some did not. So that will have a small impact 
on revenue growth. And then we're seeing some impact from how 
advertisers are using their own data for targeting. So, again, that will have a 
modest impact on growth.
 
And then in addition, we're continuin
g to focus our product development 
around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some 
impact on revenue growth. So it's really a combination of kind of how we're 
approaching privacy as well as GDPR and the like. So I think all of those
 
factors together are one of the factors that we're talking about; the other 
being, obviously, the currency flip.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG.
 
Richard Greenfield

BTIG LLC
 
Hey. Thanks for taking the 
question. So I guess one of the things as you 
look at, you talked about the growth you're seeing in users overseas or 
basically everywhere but the U.S. and Canada. But when you look at ARPU, 
your ARPU outside, even in Europe, is still only a real tiny frac
tion of where 
you are in the U.S. and, obviously in Asia and rest of world, an infinitesimal 
fraction of where you are in the U.S.
 
How does that factor into as you think about your long
-
term guidance that 
you just talked about, especially with margins movi
ng towards the mid
-
30s, 
just given how early you are in those non
-
U.S. markets and how much 
headroom they have to grow as those ad markets mature. How do you have 
confidence that you, in that type of deceleration, when you look at how 
much upside there is 
in that ARPU?
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah, I guess you've got a couple of different factors going on there. You've 
got the opportunity, I think, for ARPU growth in those regions, and that's 
going to depend on the mix of countries in those regions
 
and the GDP per 
capita in those countries as well as the relative size of the ad markets. And 
that correlates very strongly to our opportunity and our potential ARPU. And 
I think you've got upside growth potential in the long run in those markets.
 
As it r
elates to margin profile, you also just have the factor that you're 
increasing growth 

 
the increasing mix of the business is shifting towards 
Asia and towards what are currently lower ARPU markets. And so, while 
those are very attractive, we believe, to s
erve both in the near and in the 
long run, they're going to have a different impact on margin because the 
cost to support those users relative to the revenue they bring in does have 
an impact on margins in the medium
-
term.

Thank you. I have two; one for Sheryl and one for Mark. Sheryl, in Dave's 
comments and the comments about the business impact of engagement 
shifting to Stories vers
us feed products, if you could spell out for us I guess 
the specific reasons why Stories monetization is not as strong as feed today 
and in the context perhaps of what needs to happen in the future for Stories 
monetization to rebound to, let's say, parity 
to where feed is today and sort 
of get through that negative impact.
 
And then, for Mark, I think perhaps Heather was getting at this in her 
question, but the company's investing so much into owned data centers. You 
talked about that I think in your prepare
d remarks. Are there ways to 
improve the return on investment of those investments in data center 
servers, network infrastructure? And what I'm thinking is in order to perhaps 
service third
-
parties to maybe just improve those returns in the way that 
other 
tech and Internet companies have in terms of investments in 
infrastructure. Thank you.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
So, on Stories, we've seen great progress with Stories as a format for people 
to share on our platforms. We have 400 million people
 
sharing with 
Instagram Stories, 450 million with WhatsApp Status. Facebook is newer, 
but we're seeing good progress there. The question is will this monetize at 
the same rate as News Feed? And we honestly don't know. We'll have to see 
what happens. There 
are good reasons to be very optimistic about the 
monetization. The opportunity, full
-
screen, authentic, very engaging, 
different format than feed, gives us an opportunity to grow.
 
We also don't have all of our advertisers yet creating story ads. So, 
obviou
sly, as more and more advertisers come in and do that, the more and 
the better ads we'll have. I think getting that ramp will take a while because 
Stories is a new format, and we definitely see that it takes a while for 
advertisers to adopt new formats.
 
I 
think one of the other things we feel good about over the long run, not 
really the short run, is that since we have so many different places where 
you have Stories formats in Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, as 
volume increases of the opportunity, adve
rtisers get more interested. But we 
won't know for a while if it's going to monetize at the same rate. We do feel 
very good about a new and very engaging opportunity for ads.

And I can 
quickly answer the second part around data centers. I mean the 
quick answer is that we're not planning on going in to the cloud services. 
We're not planning on doing that. We have to build out all this capacity to 
serve our community. It's a very computati
onally and resource
-
intensive set 
of services that we provide and we need to build that out.
 
We are very optimistic. I'm very optimistic about AI overall and being able to 
use more computing resources to be able to crunch more data to be able to 
rank News 
Feed and ads and search and friend suggestions, and all the 
important things that we use our AI systems to do in addition to the integrity 
and security work. Part of the advance in AI technology now allows us to use 
more compute to use all the data that's 
in the system to provide better 
results, so we certainly plan on doing that.

Thanks. One for Sheryl and then one for
 
Dave. Sheryl, just on the SMB side, 
wondering if you could give us any color by region, if possible. And then 
secondly, on the go
-
to
-
market strategy, to what extent is Facebook 
dependent upon or leveraging resellers versus small businesses discovering 
the
 
ad platform on their own? How key is that reseller channel for you on the 
small business side? And then, for Dave, given that you've given us some 
kind of relatively specific guidance on the revenue growth decel through the 
remainder of the year, I'm wond
ering if you could give us some color on 
what that embeds from an FX expectation at this point. Thank you very 
much.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So SMBs are very core to our business and, with over 80 million SMB pages 
that are using Facebook on 
a monthly basis, we know they're core to theirs. 
Our 6 million advertisers come from those pages, and so the fact that we 
have so much room to grow is exciting for us. We don't break this out by 
region, but we do see very strong SMB participation across th
e board and 
around the world, particularly as SMBs come online, the more. So, you can 
imagine that some of it goes with Internet penetration and Internet use.
 
In terms of resellers, we think it's a big opportunity. We don't break that out 
either. But, obvi
ously, some of our ads are sold directly and bought directly 
through our online interfaces. We also have third
-
parties that sell our ads 
and we welcome that as well.
 
David M. Wehner

Peter, its Dave. Just on the FX, we're just looking at cu

Brent Thill from Jefferies.
 
Brent Thill

Thanks. Dave, I want to go back to the magnitude of the deceleration. I 
think many investors are having a hard time reconciling that type of 
deceleration considering how good the advertiser feedback i
s on your 
platform. And I realize you've outlined FX and Stories and the other factors, 
but is there something that you're hearing now from advertisers that is 
giving you more confidence that they're seeing something different about 
what we're all hearing 
right now? It just seems like the magnitude is beyond 
anything we've seen, especially across a number of tech names we all cover.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah. Brent, I'll take that. And if Sheryl wants to add color, she should step 
in as well. Th
is is consistent 

 
we consistently have seen over last eight 
quarters constant currency deceleration. So, there's a continuation of this 
trend. I don't think there's anything beyond that in the factors that I 
outlined.
 
I would note we've been benefiting fr
om continued growth across Instagram. 
Instagram ad load in feed is at the same level as Facebook, so that would be 

 
that's certainly been helpful in our recent quarters. So I think when you 
look at the factors going forward, I would say we've got the curr
ency impact, 
we've got some of the impacts around privacy and the like, but we continue 
to get good advertiser feedback on ROI. We continue to believe we're 
delivering great ROI for advertisers. So I don't think there's anything from 
the advertiser perspec
tive that's necessarily playing out differently than 
expectations. Sheryl can add any color there.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah, I'd add there. Even at decreasing growth rates, we are still growing 
and predicting growth at very healthy rates,
 
and that's based on returning 
for advertisers. We're very focused on helping advertisers meet their 
ultimate goals, looking at their ROI, looking at the return they get on ringing 
the cash register, whether that cash register rings online or offline. And 
we 
hear from them and we continue to see in our results that we continue to 
deliver strong results. So we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We're 
going to continue investing in that opportunity. And what we're hearing from 
advertisers all over the wor
ld is that they want to continue to grow and 
invest with us as well.

Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
 
Great. Thanks. Just a couple of follow ups for me. First off, Dave, maybe I 
missed this, but what timeframe are you referring to in terms of getting 
down to the mid
-
30s operating margin? And does that outlook assume any 
mean
ingful contribution from any of the new areas of innovation that you 
highlighted on the call? Just trying to figure out how much of that might be 
more conservatism.
 
And then, on the near
-
term trends and the midterm elections in the U.S., 
given the amount o
f scrutiny that will exist in your platform, how should we 
think about your level of preparation on one hand to manage content? And 
then, on the other hand, is this part of the potential impact on monetization 
revenue growth in the back half of the year th
at you're taking into 
consideration? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure, Collin. Let me take a crack at that. So, in terms of the guidance, I've 
given guidance. This is several years, so more than two but less than many. 
So it's over a timeframe
 
more than two years is our expectation. And then in 
terms of does that have any meaningful contribution from areas of 
innovation, we talked about some of the areas that we're investing in. 
Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that a
re layering 
in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't 
necessarily have a revenue impact. So it certainly takes those into account.
 
It also takes into account the ongoing investments we're making in the 
longer
-
term innovation wor
k, which I don't think will necessarily have any 
meaningful revenue relative to the size of the business in those time frames. 
We're also investing in things like video, Watch and the like, which have the 
potential to condition tribute on the revenue side,
 
but still relatively small in 
perspective of the overall business.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
All right. And I can take the question on the midterm elections. So, yes, the 
short answer is that we're much more confident that we're going to get
 
this 
right for the elections in the 2018, which include the U.S. midterms, but also 
the elections in Brazil and upcoming elections in early
-
2019 in India and the 
EU. And the reason why we're confident that we can get this right is because 
there have been 
several elections since the 2016 ones that have had much 
better results, including the French presidential election, the German 
elections, the Alabama special election, and the Mexican election about a 
month ago.
 
And in each of these 

 
going back to 2016, 
we were 

 
we have a very big 
security team that was focused on security around even the 2016 election 
and we found hacking and phishing attacks that the Russian government 
was trying to do, and we notified the right people about those. But 2016 was 
really 
the first time that we saw this kind of coordinated information 
operation. And since then, we've built the playbook out that has included 
building AI tools to identify thousands of fake accounts and groups and 
pages that violate the policies. It's included
 
growing the security and content 
review teams to 20,000 people to be able to handle the volume of work that 
we need to do. And it includes a lot of the transparency work around 
advertising in general, but also the political and issue ads archive and 
verif
ying all advertisers who are trying to run political and issue ads.
 
There are a number of other things that we're doing too, including creating 
an external program for independent academics to study how the impact of 
social media and how foreign government
s try to interfere in elections. And 
that will have a longer
-
term impact as well. But the short answer here is 
we've been very focused on this. 2018 is a big year. And because of the 
successful results that we've seen in a number of elections recently, we 
feel 
like our road map and our level of preparation is much higher now than it 
has been. And we feel relatively confident going into these elections.

Thanks, Deborah, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a solid 
quarter, and our community an
d business continue to grow quickly. 2.3 
billion people now use Facebook every month, and 1.5 billion every day. 
Revenue grew 33% year over year to $13.7 billion.
 
Last quarter, for the first time, we also shared the number of people who 
use at least one of
 
our apps each month. We believe this is a better way to 
measure our community over time because so many people use more than 
one of our apps. There are now more than 2.6 billion people using Facebook, 
WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger each month, up from a
round 2.5 billion 
last quarter. But now, on average, more than 2 billion people use at least 
one of our services every day.
 
Today, I want to talk about our strategy overall as we navigate challenges 
and opportunities on several fronts. For one, we're seein
g the way people 
connect shifting to private messaging and stories. We have great products 
here that people love, but it will take some time for our business to catch up 
to our community growth.
 
Two, we're seeing video grow dramatically across the ecosyste
m. And while 
Watch is now growing very quickly, we're well behind YouTube and still 
working to make this a unique people
-
centric experience. Three, we continue 
to face increased safety and security threats. We've significantly improved 
our systems here, bu
t we have more to do.
 
So let's start with messaging and stories. Public sharing will always be very 
important, but people increasingly want to share privately too, and that 
includes both just smaller audiences with messaging and ephemerally with 
stories. P
eople feel more comfortable being themselves when they know 
their content will only be seen by a smaller group and when their content 
won't stick around forever. Messaging and stories make up the vast majority 
of growth in the sharing that we're seeing.
 
On
 
messaging specifically, we think we've built the best messaging apps in 
the world. People now send around 100 billion messages each day using our 
services that even our second most popular service, Messenger, has a higher 
daily message volume than SMS had
 
globally at its peak. And this isn't just 
text. People share more photos, videos and links on WhatsApp and 
Messenger than they do on social networks.
 
We are leading in most countries, but our biggest competitor by far is 
iMessage. And in important countri
es like the U.S., where the iPhone is 
strong, Apple bundled iMessage as a default texting app and it's still ahead. 
In countries where there's more competition between iOS and Android, like 
much of Europe, people tend to prefer our services.
 
Now, it's wort
h noting that one of the main reasons people prefer our 
services, especially WhatsApp, is because of its stronger record on privacy. 
WhatsApp is completely end
-
to
-
end encrypted, does not store your 
messages and doesn't store the keys to your messages in Ch
ina or 
anywhere else. And this is important because if our systems can't see your 
messages, then that means that governments and bad actors won't be able 
to access them through us either.
 
Our roadmap focuses on continuing to make WhatsApp and Messenger eve
n 
simpler, faster and adding basic utility features like payments. We found 
that every time we make our services faster and simpler, people 
communicate more. We'll also keep pushing our messaging services to be 
more private and secure, and we believe this 
will continue to be a 
competitive advantage for us.
 
On the business side of messaging, our first step has been to enable people 
to connect with businesses organically in ways they find useful, and then the 
second step is to give businesses additional paid 
tools to increase those 
interactions. We're well into step one at this point, with more than 3 million 
accounts on WhatsApp Business. We'll begin step two with a couple of 
products, paid messaging and ads in Stories.
 
And by making businesses pay to send me
ssages, we believe it will make 
them more selective with what they send. Payments will make each of these 
services more useful for people and businesses, even though we don't plan 
to profit from it directly. I'll update with more progress on each of these 
efforts in the next few quarters.
 
On Stories, we are even better
-
positioned. People now share more than 1 
billion stories every day. We lead in almost every country. There are a 
couple of reasons we've focused on building Stories in all of our apps. First,
 
I 
just think that this is the future. People want to share in ways that don't 
stick around permanently, and I want to make sure that we fully embrace 
this.
 
Second, Stories is a medium like feeds that can feel very different in very 
different contexts. So 
just like most major social apps have feeds, including 
Pinterest, Twitter, or LinkedIn, but you wouldn't say that those services do 
the same things, I think many services will have Stories in the future too, 
but will serve different functions.
 
Now, while t
his effort is going well, we're also working through a couple of 
challenges here. One is that while WhatsApp Status and Instagram Stories 
immediately took off and have been huge successes, Facebook Stories 
started off slower. It's now growing quickly and I
 
think we'll be in a better 
position soon, but our effort to shift Facebook from News Feed first to 
Stories first hasn't been as smooth as I had hoped. But this is important for 
the Facebook community long term.
 
Another challenge is that we're earlier in d
eveloping our ads products for 
Stories, so we don't make as much money from them yet as we do from 
feed ads. We're following our normal playbook here of building out the best 
consumer products first and focusing on succeeding there before ramping up 
ads. I
'm optimistic that we'll get ads in Stories to perform as well as feed 
over time, and that the opportunity will be even bigger because it looks like 
Stories will be a bigger medium than feed has been.
 
But I want to be up front that even assuming that we ge
t to where we want 
to go from a feed
-
only world to a feed plus Stories world, it will take some 
time and our revenue growth may be slower during that period like it was 
while transitioning our products to mobile.
 
Now, talking about messaging and Stories ra
ises the question of what's the 
future of our feed product and the Facebook app overall. On feed 
specifically, people continue to use them heavily and we don't expect that to 
decrease. From a business perspective, feeds will drive the majority of our 
growt
h over the next couple of years, at least until Stories become an even 
bigger driver.
 
On the Facebook app overall, what we see is that we are generally stable, 
although we may be close to saturated in developed countries while we 
continue to grow quickly i
n developing countries. For a few years, we saw a 
trend where people's time was increasing primarily because they were 
consuming more video and public content, even as they interacted with 
friends and family less. But people were telling us what they wante
d was to 
interact with people more. So we didn't think that this trend was sustainable.
 
We've made a number of changes this year to focus the product on 
meaningful social interactions, and those generally seem to be working. That 
means the trends in how pe
ople are interacting have improved, even though 
we've purposefully reduced time spent on things like lower
-
quality viral 
videos and news to achieve this.
 
While there's a lot to do to improve News Feed, our roadmap for the 
Facebook app is very 
focused on a few priorities: Stories, which we've 
discussed; video, which I'll get to in a moment; and a much bigger focus on 
communities and groups.
 
If the last 10 years have been about friends and family, then the next 10 
years will be about your communi
ties as well. When we say communities, we 
mean both helping people connect with people who share their interests, 
which is a major need in people's lives, and also building out specific 
services for bringing people closer together, like helping you find so
meone to 
date, or find a job, or buy and sell things, or grow your small business, or 
create an event, or start fundraisers, or bring together a group to volunteer.
 
A lot of these services are growing quickly. Hundreds of millions of people 
now belong to m
eaningful communities that are a central part of their social 
support structure. Marketplace is now used by 800 million people and is 
emerging as one of the most popular places to buy vehicles online. On jobs, 
our new tool has helped people find more than 
1 million jobs. On 
fundraisers, in the last year we've helped people raise more than $300 
million for charities on their birthdays alone. And I'm looking forward to 
rolling out dating across the world soon too.
 
These are services that generally benefit fro
m having everyone you know 
connected on a single platform. And while people may not spend as much 
time on some of these tools as they do in News Feed, these are very high
-
value activities for our community.
 
Now, we're seeing a similar dynamic in Instagram,
 
where there's still a lot to 
improve in feed, but we're increasingly focused on other experiences as well. 
But in Instagram, instead of focusing on communities, we're very focused on 
helping you explore your interests. So this will take the form of IGTV, 
which 
I'll discuss more in a minute, plus new shopping experiences and really 
building out Explore. These areas have huge potential for serving our 
community and a lot of potential for businesses as well. For example, 
Explore is already about 20% of the ti
me that people spend in Instagram. 
But unlike feed, we haven't built any ads experience for it yet, so that's an 
opportunity.
 
Now, I want to discuss what we're seeing with video specifically, since it's 
such an important and growing area. Our efforts here 
have grown, but we've 
had challenges reconciling all this passive video consumption with what 
people uniquely want from us, which is meaningful social interaction.
 
Video has grown a lot on our services, but as I mentioned earlier, we hit a 
dynamic where wh
en it grows in feeds in Facebook and Instagram, it 
displaces some social interactions, and people tell us it makes the 
experience less valuable even though they're spending more time on it.
 
So the solution to this has been building separate video experienc
es outside 
of our feeds with Watch on Facebook and IGTV on Instagram. And what we 
found is that when people seek out video experiences intentionally, they 
don't displace social interactions as much, and the quality of the experience 
is generally higher. We
've also been able to build experiences that help 
creators build communities around their content, which fits our mission and 
our focus to encourage meaningful interactions.
 
At this point, Watch has really hit its stride and it's growing incredibly 
quickly
, about 3x in the last few months in the U.S. alone. IGTV is still 
earlier in its development, but I think we have a good sense of how to make 
it work as well. To be clear, these services are still well behind YouTube, 
which is our primary competitor in th
is space, but they're growing very 
quickly.
 
Now, that said, beyond the mission challenges of video displacing social 
interactions, there is also a business challenge, which is that video 
monetizes significantly less well per minute than people interacting 
in feeds. 
So this means that even though we've made video more community
-
oriented and minimized displacement of social interactions, as video grows, 
it will still displace some other services where we'd probably make more 
money.
 
From a mission and a busine
ss perspective, though, we still believe this is 
the right thing to do. Video is a critical part of the future. It's what our 
community wants as long as we can make it social, and I think will end up 
being a large part of our business as well.
 
All right, n
ext I want to talk about safety and security. So let me start by 
saying that last month, we had a serious security issue. Our teams did well 
to find and close the vulnerability quickly, but we have a long road ahead to 
prevent these kinds of attacks in the
 
future. Over the last couple years, 
though, we've done a lot of work and made a lot of progress. We still have 
at least a year before our systems are at the level that we want, but they're 
getting better every day, and that's both technology and people.
 
O
ur systems for proactively identifying harmful content are improving. Our 
systems for detecting interference in elections are a lot more mature now. 
The upcoming elections will be a real test of the protections we've put in 
place. With a community of more 
than 2 billion people, we will see all the 
good and bad that humanity can do. And we will never be perfect, but I'm 
proud of the work that we're doing here.
 
We've reduced the incentives to spread misinformation. We're partnering 
more closely with governmen
ts and outside experts to improve security, 
including here in the U.S. And we set a new standard for transparency in 
advertising. This quarter alone, we've found and taken down foreign 
influence campaigns from Russia and Iran attempting to interfere in the
 
U.S., UK, Middle East, and elsewhere, as well as groups in Brazil that have 
been active in their own country. We still have a lot of work to do in all of 
these areas that I've talked about.
 
News Feed continues to be very important. We're building the best
 
messaging and stories and community tools in the world. Our video services 
are getting better and growing quickly, and we still have a lot of work to do 
on safety. And we're also heavily investing in AR and VR, as well as 
hardware for bringing people clos
er together, like Portal for video presence 
and Oculus Quest, the all
-
in
-
one VR experience that delivers rift like quality 
with no wires attached.
 
So with all of this ahead, I expect 2019 to be another year of significant 
investment. Dave will say more abo
ut this in a moment, but I want you to 
know that looking out beyond 2019, I know that we need to make sure our 
costs and revenue are better matched over time; and that's something that 
I'm focused on as well.
 
So, overall, this has been an important year. I
t's been a tough year, but 
we've built products that I'm proud of and we've made a lot of progress on 
some of our hardest issues. As always, I appreciate your support. And thank 
you for being a part of this journey with us.
 
And now, here is Sheryl.

Hi, everyone.
 
It was another good quarter for our business, with ad revenue up 33% year 
over year. Our growth was broad
-
based across regions, marketer segments 
and verticals. Mobile ad revenue grew 40% to $12.5 billion, makin
g up 
approximately 92% of our total ad revenue. Since Facebook launched its 
first ad products, we've been in the business of growing our clients' 
businesses, from the largest brands in the world, to the entrepreneur in her 
living room.
 
Over 90 million busi
nesses rely on Facebook pages to reach potential 
customers for free. In a global survey, half of small businesses with a 
presence on Facebook said that they are hiring because of growth they're 
able to achieve through our platform. More than 6 million adve
rtisers are 
active across Facebook, Instagram and our other services. With more than 2 
billion people using at least one of our services every day, we're the best 
place for these advertisers to show people ads that work.
 
We know that our continued growth d
epends upon maintaining the trust of 
the people who use our services and earning our clients' business each and 
every day in a very competitive environment. Every time I meet with clients, 
I tell them that we want to be the best minute and the best dollar,
 
euro or 
peso they spend. As we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, we're focused on 
continuing to build our clients' businesses and ours by helping advertisers 
reach consumers where they are and making ads better.
 
First, helping advertisers connect with people
 
where they are. Consumers 
often adopt new technologies before businesses do. Our competitive 
advantage is helping advertisers close that gap. We've done this before on 
desktop, mobile and News Feed. In the early days, we helped businesses 
deliver personal
ized marketing at scale on desktop. With the shift to mobile, 
we've helped companies large and small build their mobile presence.
 
Now, we're doing it again with stories, messaging, Marketplace and Watch. 
Today, the primary way advertisers are reaching peop
le on our services is 
through Facebook News Feed and Instagram Feed. Feed ads on Facebook 
and Instagram represent the majority of our revenue growth and the 
majority of opportunities for marketers to generate ROI.
 
Quarter after quarter, we make improvement
s that help advertisers use feed 
ads to launch new products, find new customers, build awareness and 
increase sales, all in a highly efficient way. We're always working to enable 
more marketers to achieve their goals through mobile feed, and we see 
continu
ed opportunity here going forward.
 
At the same time, as Mark mentioned, more and more consumers are using 
stories and private messaging in addition to the time they spend in News 
Feed and Instagram Feed. Because our services share a common platform, 
advert
isers can use the same tools to buy across all our ad services.
 
Building on the strength of ads and Instagram Stories, we rolled out ads in 
Facebook Stories in Q3 and announced plans to introduce ads in WhatsApp 
Status next year. We know it's not enough to
 
make a new format available. 
We also need to make it easy for advertisers to optimize their campaigns.
 
In Q3, we improved how ads from News Feed look in Stories. This is 
important for advertisers like Pandora, which uses Facebook and Instagram 
to 
reach potential listeners. Previously, they would buy Instagram Story ad 
separately and develop unique creative each time. Now, with automatic 
placements, our technology converts their horizontal video and captions 
from Facebook into a design that looks na
tive to the vertical Instagram 
Stories format. For Pandora, this resulted in a 10% lower cost per view than 
their stand
-
alone campaigns simply by checking a box in our ad tool.
 
When it comes to messaging, we have an opportunity to help people and 
businesse
s connect in ways that are valuable for both. On Messenger, over 
10 billion messages are sent between people and businesses every month. 
It's still early, but we're exploring how we can help advertisers reach people 
in Messenger through sponsored messages 
and inbox ads.
 
For WhatsApp, we're growing our business ecosystem starting with the 
WhatsApp Business model app on Android. In August, we launched the 
WhatsApp Business API to help larger companies send useful information 
such as boarding passes or deliver
y confirmations. This paid messaging 
model will ensure that companies are selective about what they send and 
don't clutter people's chats. As always, people will be able to block any 
business they want with one tap. As we build the business on WhatsApp, 
we
're determined to maintain the simple private user experience that people 
love.
 
That's also true for Marketplace and Watch. Last year, we started allowing 
advertisers to extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace, helping 
businesses reach people where they 
already shop. In Q3, we expanded 
Marketplace ads to nearly 70 marketers. It's early days, but advertisers are 
seeing good results.
 
With Facebook Watch, we've been working closely with advertisers to better 
fit their current planning and buying process for 
video. In Q3, we introduced 
a way for advertisers to buy video placements from a selection of the most 
engaging publishers, choose specific content categories they want their ads 
to play alongside, and pay only for ads that are watched to the end. Again, 
i
t's still early, but we're pleased with advertiser interest and results so far.
 
We have a big opportunity to help our large and growing advertiser base 
expand to new platforms and formats to reach potential customers. Our 
service makes it possible for ever
y business to access the same tools as the 
largest brands. We start by making it simple for small businesses to 
transition from using our consumer apps to using our business tools, and 
then we make it easy to run more sophisticated campaigns.
 
This has been
 
true every step of our journey so far, from online to mobile 
and now for messaging and stories. In the future, this will include 
opportunities with the new VR/AR platforms that we're creating as well.
 
We're also focused on making ads better. One of the to
p things people tell 
us about our ads is that they want them to be relevant. We create value for 
people when we show ads they are likely to find useful, for advertisers when 
we deliver ads to the right audience, and for our own business by performing 
this 
match effectively.
 
Our business model is and always has been to connect people and 
businesses with relevant marketing messages without sharing people's 
personal information. Protecting people's privacy is incredibly important 
because people and businesses 
will only use our services if they feel 
Facebook can be trusted and if sharing on our platform is safe. That's why 
we're making significant ongoing investments to better protect privacy and 
security.
 
In Q3, we completed the shutdown of partner categories a
nd tightened our 
standards for Custom Audiences. These changes help protect peoples' 
privacy and ensure that advertisers have more oversight of the information 
they use for advertising. We also continue to invest heavily in technology 
and people to remove 
bad content as quickly as possible and prevent it from 
going up in the first place, while giving advertisers more control over where 
their ads are placed.
 
This quarter, we added more tools for advertisers to see where their ads 
might appear in Audience Net
work, Instant Articles and instream placements 
like Watch. They can block their ads from running in videos or articles from 
certain publishers or categories of content and review all of their placements 
at the end of each campaign.
 
Making ads better also m
eans increasing efficiency for advertisers. In Q3, we 
expanded campaign budget optimization so advertisers of all sizes can now 
set a single budget, and our system automatically finds the best 
opportunities across each of those segments. Improvements like 
this one 
add up and help businesses maximize the value they're gaining from our 
products over time. This is critical for small businesses that don't have large 
advertising budgets or expertise, and it's an important way we support 
economic growth and job c
reation around the world.
 
As we wrap up the year, I want to thank our clients for their partnership and 
their continued feedback which helps us improve. And I also want to thank 
our teams at Facebook for helping these businesses reach their customers 
and g
row.
 
And now, here is Dave.

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's start with our 
community metrics. Daily active users on Facebook reached 1.49 billion, up 
9% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Ind
onesia and the 
Philippines. This number represents approximately 66% of the 2.27 billion 
monthly active users in Q3. MAUs were up 199 million or 10% compared to 
last year.
 
Note that our Q3 2018 community metrics reflect an update to our 
calculation methodo
logy. This resulted in the removal of the small 
percentage of accounts or approximately 15 million DAU and 9 million MAU 
worldwide. This change will modestly impact our year
-
over
-
year user growth 
rates until we lap it next year. Further details are include
d in the earnings 
slides on our IR website.
 
Turning now to the financials, all comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis, 
unless otherwise noted. Q3 revenue was $13.7 billion, up 33% or 34% on a 
constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained 
constant 
compared to last year, Q3 total revenue would have been $159 million 
higher.
 
Q3 total ad revenue was $13.5 billion, up 33% or 35% on a constant 
currency basis. In terms of regional ad growth, Asia Pacific was strongest at 
38%, followed by Europe a
nd North America at 34% and 33%, respectively. 
Rest of world ad growth trailed at 26% due to both currency weakness and 
economic challenges in Latin America.
 
Mobile ad revenue was $12.5 billion, up 40%, and represented 
approximately 92% of total ad revenue
. In Q3, the average price per ad 
increased 7% and the number of ad impressions served across our services 
increased 25%, driven primarily by feed ads on Instagram and Facebook.
 
Our impression growth in Q3 came primarily from product surfaces and 
geographi
es that monetize at relatively lower rates. For example, ads in 
Instagram Stories contributed to our impression growth this quarter, 
although these ads currently monetize at lower rates compared to feed ads. 
Payments and other fees revenue was $188 million
, up 1%.
 
Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $7.9 billion, up 53%. We 
ended Q3 with approximately 33,600 full
-
time employees. That's up 45%. 
The majority of our new hires in the past year have been in technical 
functions. Operating income was $5.8
 
billion, representing a 42% operating 
margin. Our Q3 tax rate was 13%. This was lower than we expected because 
we did not take the one
-
time charge that we anticipated due to the Ninth 
Circuit Court withdrawing its decision in the Altera case.
 
Net income w
as $5.1 billion or $1.76 per share. Capital expenditures were 
$3.3 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network 
infrastructure and office facilities. In Q3, we generated $4.2 billion in free 
cash flow and ended the quarter with approxim
ately $41.2 billion in cash and 
investments. In the third quarter, we bought back approximately $4.3 billion 
of our Class A common stock.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook, in Q4, we expect that our total revenue 
growth rate will decelerate by a mid to hi
gh single
-
digit percentage 
compared to our Q3 total revenue growth rate. Several factors are 
contributing to this deceleration. First, we expect more of our impression 
growth to continue to come from product services and geographies that 
monetize at lower 
rates. Second, we are seeing some impact from data 
privacy initiatives on pricing growth. And third, as we focus more of our 
product efforts on the growth of Stories, its more prominent placement on 
Facebook will displace some ad impression opportunities.
 
Turning now to the expense outlook, we anticipate our full
-
year 2018 total 
expenses will grow approximately 50% to 55% versus our prior range of 
50% to 60%. We anticipate that full
-
year 2018 capital expenditures will be 
approximately $14 billion to $14.5 b
illion compared to our prior estimate of 
$15 billion.
 
Turning to tax, at current stock prices, we expect that our Q4 tax rate will be 
in the mid
-
teens. As a reminder, fluctuations in our stock price will impact 
our tax rate.
 
I'd also like to share our init
ial outlook on 2019 operating expenses and 
CapEx. As Mark mentioned, we plan to continue to invest aggressively 
across the business and expect that full
-
year 2019 total expenses will grow 
40% to 50% compared to full
-
year 2018. We also expect that full
-
year
 
2019 
capital expenditures will be approximately $18 billion to $20 billion, driven 
by a continuation of our data center build strategy that seeks to put in place 
adequate capacity ahead of our needs. We anticipate that our full
-
year 2019 
tax rate will be 
in the mid
-
teens.
 
The third quarter marked a period of both solid revenue growth across the 
globe and heavy investment as we make progress on our mission to bring 
the world closer together. We are confident in our ability to improve the 
products that our c
ommunity loves as well as to provide innovative new 
experiences in the near and long
-
term.

Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two. First for Mark, I 
was just hoping you could talk a lit
tle bit more about some of the challenges 
that you see for Stories within Facebook relative to their stronger adoption in 
Instagram and for WhatsApp Status. And then also, what if Stories don't 
gain traction on Facebook over time here? How do you think abo
ut that for 
the platform as well?
 
And then, secondly, for Dave, just on OpEx for 2019, the 40% to 50% 
growth, should we think about that as still the same buckets of spend that 
you've been talking about over the last year or so, and does their 
prioritizati
on change at all for next year? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure, so I can take the first part. I think a lot of this is really basic. When I 
say that we got started slower on Facebook, that starts with literally rolling 
out on Facebook
 
a number of months after we had rolled out on either 
WhatsApp or Instagram. And then the initial version of what we shipped I 
just think wasn't as high
-
quality as where it needed to be. It wasn't as fast. 
There were bugs. And we've been working on dialing
 
that in.
 
I'm less worried at this point about it not working because we're starting to 
see it really take off. Certainly, with different groups of people, it's stronger 
on Instagram or WhatsApp or Facebook, but across all three at this point, 
it's growing
. And as I said in my opening remarks, I think we're going to be 
a lot better positioned here in Facebook in the next year.
 
David M. Wehner

Hey, Doug. It's Dave. Just on the 2019 expense growth guide, a lot of that is 
consistent with what 
we've been talking about as our big investment areas. 
If you look at just head count growth in the past year, it's up 45%. So that 
compensation expense base that we're bringing into 2019 is really factoring 
into the overall growth guidance for the total ex
pense guide, so that's a big 
factor there.
 
In addition, we've been investing significantly in CapEx, and those 
investments are starting to flow through the P&L in terms of depreciation. 
And then I'd point to significant investment areas like AR/VR efforts,
 
the 
content ecosystem around video, and the ongoing investment in safety and 
security.

Thank you so much, maybe one for Sheryl. When you think
 
about some of 
the friction points you're trying to solve for on either the creative side or the 
selling
-
through side with respect to video and Stories, maybe you could call 
out some of the conversations you're having with advertisers and how you 
see some 
of the moves Facebook can make to solve for those friction points 
looking out to 2019 and beyond. Thanks so much.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks for the question. We have a very large and growing advertiser base, 
and that gives us we think a 
really strong position to get people into new 
formats. When you do that, a couple of things really matter. One is that the 
format of an ad really has to match the format of the consumer experience. 
So the right ad in News Feed is different than the right a
d in an Instagram or 
a Facebook story is different than the right ad in Watch, which would be 
video
-
only. And so making these new formats of ads is actually hard for 
people and expensive. And so we're working hard on tools to make the 
formats easier, and I
 
talked about one of those examples before.
 
What's nice is that the same targeting, the same measurement systems 
really work. Because we are looking to show relevant ads to the right person 
at the right time, the systems we have that understand in a privac
y
-
protected way what ads people are likely to be more interested in, those 
work, whether you're in Stories or Watch or Instagram Feed or News Feed.
 
And the other thing is that our systems for measuring the effectiveness of 
ads, which help advertisers get a
ll the way through to their ROI, which help 
them bid in our system, also work. And so we take the advertiser base, we 
take the systems we have for targeting and measuring ads, and then we 
help advertisers move to the new format. And I think that's the proc
ess 
we're on.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, last quarter, 
Dave, you made some comments about a multiyear
 
margin outlook, and I 
appreciate the comment this quarter about engagement in the feed, et 
cetera. I was just curious when you thought about that margin outlook, how 
do you think about the one or two key drivers of News Feed monetization 
over the next few
 
years, given you expect to be flat overall engagement?
 
And then secondly on Watch, I'm wondering, Mark. Could you just talk about 
the key one to two steps you need to sort of clear in order to drive higher 
Watch and video engagement to sort of catch up wi
th some of the 
competitors? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Hey, Brian. It's Dave. In terms of what we're seeing as opportunities, I 
mean, we continue to see good growth opportunities for revenue across both 
Facebook and Instagram, including both 
feed and Stories. I think in terms of 
impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, 
probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth 
opportunities in both places. So that's obviously what we're looking for when 
we lo
ok forward. Beyond that, I don't have much to update on in terms of 
any more specific revenue outlook.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

And to the video questions, the biggest thing that we need to do is make 
sure that the video experience is 
people
-
centric and that we're helping 
creators build community and we're helping people interact with each other. 
Our journey with video has been a little bit funny, in that people really want 
to watch a lot of video. And to a large degree, we've had to li
mit its growth 
and we had to do the things so we can stop limiting it.
 
The things that have caused us to limit it are, on the one hand, when we see 
passive consumption of video displacing social interactions, that's not 
something that we've wanted because 
we feel like that's what Facebook is. 
We build social products that help people interact. There are lots of places in 
the world that you can go to consume content, but we're the Internet 
service that people use to help connect with other people and we're n
ot 
going to let passive consumption get in the way of that.
 
So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can 
also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from 
Facebook. And now, I think we're starting to w
ork through what the formula 
is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow 
at the rate it wants to. And I think that's a very exciting opportunity ahead, 
and that's one of the reasons that I'm very optimistic about the Watc
h 
growth that we've started to see recently up about 3x in the last few months 
in the U.S. alone.

Merrill Lynch.

Thank you. Mark
, first, on Facebook engagement. There are some questions 
about usage. And when you look at the engagement, do you see it stable? I 
think you mentioned that earlier. And does that include some of the changes 
you've made on video earlier in the year?
 
And th
en, secondly, some usage may be moving over to Instagram. When 
you look at Facebook plus Instagram, how do you feel about how that usage 
is trending? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So I mean across the whole family of apps, I mean
 
all of this 
engagement is growing quickly and we're very happy with how we're 
enabling people to share. As I said, the vast majority or the majority of the 
growth that we're seeing in sharing is coming from private messaging and 
story sharing. So that's k
ind of the big thing.
 
The basic story that we've seen within the Facebook app is, over the last few 
years, the amount of time that people were spending in the app was 
increasing primarily because people were consuming more public content, 
like passive vide
o consumption and news. But it was coming at the expense 
of people interacting with each other as much. So interactions were down. 
And we got a lot of feedback from people saying that's not what they 
wanted.
 
We don't think that that's what we're uniquely h
ere to do. It's not the 
mission of the company. So we felt like that was not sustainable. So we've 
made a lot of shift this year, which I've talked a lot about on a bunch of 
these calls, to encourage more meaningful social interactions instead. And 
we have
 
seen that those changes have improved the trajectory of how 
people are interacting.
 
Now, at the same time that we have intentionally reduced time spent on 
certain things, like lower
-
quality viral videos, some news, some passive 
content, but that's what I 
was talking about before when I said that now the 
trend 

 
and you can kind of look at it in developed markets and developing. 
In developed markets, it is stable and we feel like we're pretty close to 
saturation in a lot of countries, like the U.S. And in d
eveloping countries, 
where a lot of people are still getting on the Internet, it continues to grow at 
a fast rate. And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community 
that people want there.
 
So that's kind of what we're seeing overall. Across the 
whole family, I would 
say it's very positive. On Facebook overall, I feel like we have a handle on 
what the drivers of this are and we're kind of driving it to be what people tell 
us they want and what we think is going to be sustainable over time. That's 
the picture that we have.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler

Barclays Capital, Inc.
 
Great. Two questions. Dave, you mentioned 4Q revenue is going to have a 
mid to high
-
single digit deceleration. Th
at's a tad better than what you 
stated 90 days ago. So just I know it's a small change, but I think folks on 
the line are looking for anything incremental in terms of what you're seeing. 
Has anything improved? And then, any initial read on what kind of 
dec
eleration we can expect to see in 2019, if at all, as you start turning on 
the ads on WhatsApp?
 
And then, one for Sheryl. The shopping experience on Instagram, how do 
you compare, I guess, just the overall commercial intent on Instagram 
compared to Faceboo
k? And what do you think that says about the long
-
term monetization potential for Instagram versus Facebook?
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
All right. Ross, I'll start off on that. I think the outlook that we're giving for 
Q4 deceleration is broadly cons
istent with the outlook that I gave last 
quarter with the benefit of a little bit more visibility. I'd just reiterate the 
points that I'd made in the earnings script around what's driving that 
deceleration.
 
And as far as to how that plays into 2019, we're 
not providing a specific 
revenue outlook for 2019. We continue to see good growth opportunities 
across the platform on both Facebook and Instagram and feed and Stories. 
Those are going to be the drivers. I would characterize the launch of Status 
apps on Wh
atsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 
revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook. 
The same factors that I discussed impacting Q4 growth will likely continue to 
play out to some extent in 2019, but we've got 
a lot of good growth 
opportunities for next year.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

When you look at the Instagram Shopping experience, we're seeing some 
really nice growth. We have 90 million people tap to reveal product tags and 
posts every month to 
learn more about them, and we're putting real 
investments behind this. In Q3, we rolled out Shopping in Stories globally 
and began testing the Shopping Channel in Explore. And so, we think the 
opportunities are big.
 
As you think about commercial intent in 
Facebook versus Instagram, there's 
so much activity on both. We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to 
have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it 
because they see things they're interested in, in both. Instagram can be
 
more interest
-
based in some places than Facebook. So there are places in 
Instagram like Fashion or like Shopping that have very high signal, and that 
gives us I think a very strong opportunity there.

Your next question comes from the line of Lloy
d Walmsley from Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Lloyd Walmsley 
-
 
Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Thank you. Two questions, if I can. First, just, Mark, your comments in 
prepared remarks on Stories having potential to be a bigger medium than 
News Feed suggests that the 
engagement is a net positive in terms of time 
spent or sessions per user. Is that the right way to interpret that as you see 
people engage in this they actually spend more time overall?
 
And then, second question for Dave. Last quarter, you guided to kind o
f 
long
-
term operating margins in the mid
-
30s range. The guidance on OpEx 
for next year kind of implies we may already be there. Is that the right 
interpretation and should we expect it to be kind of stable beyond that based 
on some of the comments from Mar
k about recognizing that revenue and 
costs should be matched over the long
-
term? Any help you could give there 
would be great.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So on Stories, I don't know if we've given any metrics on time spent or 
anything on that 
side. But what I can say is that all of the trends that we've 
seen suggests that in the not too distant future people will be sharing more 
into Stories than they will into feeds, and that the whole market across all of 
the Stories type of products will be 
bigger in a market where people are 
sharing more moments from their days into Stories
-
type products than into 
feed
-
type products.
 
And this happened very quickly, right? I mean this whole trend is much 
newer than the trend with News Feed and feeds overall a
nd it continues to 
grow incredibly quickly. So we just see that there is a lot of upside there.
 
Now, on the flip side, I try to be very careful in my remarks to be clear that 
this is one of those situations where the community growth that we're seeing 
is o
utpacing the progress that we've made so far on developing the ads in 
that space. And I think we'll get there over time, where the performance for 
Stories ads will converge with what we have seen in feed. And I think that 
the opportunity will be bigger bec
ause there will be more in Stories 

 
or 
more Stories overall than in feed. But I can't tell you just yet what that 
timeframe is going to look like, but I think we're well
-
positioned over the 
long
-
term because we're leading in Stories in basically every cou
ntry.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
And, Lloyd, on the margin question, as I mentioned, 2019 will be a big 
investment year. So I would expect us to have the biggest change in our 
margin structure to happen in 2019 and for it to moderate from there. It's
 
hard to be too prescriptive about 2020 and beyond, but I think the biggest 
change will be 2019.

Thanks. Just on Europe, there's been a more pronounc

in your model and maybe a little more color on the pricing.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Yeah. Hey, Brent. It's Dave. I think, I guess, if you're talkin
g about DAU and 
MAU, Europe is stable on that front in terms of Facebook overall. The 
accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth 
rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside. And we had 
some impact from GDPR ove
r the last two quarters. So I think, from that 
perspective, it is broadly stable for Facebook there.
 
European growth rate I think was healthy from a revenue point of view. So I 
think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot 
of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world 
where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like 
Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth.

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
 
Thanks for taking my questions. You seem confident that Stories will 
ultimately be a more effective canvas both for users and businesses and 
maybe even more so than the
 
feed, but you also talked the transitional 
challenges. What specifically are those challenges? And since Instagram is 
further along with Stories, are there any things you're seeing with Instagram 
Stories monetization that gives you line of sight to reachi
ng monetization 
parity, not only at Instagram, but also at core Facebook eventually?
 
And then maybe just a second one. In addition to Stories, Mark also 
discussed how private messaging is also a growth use case. In private 
messaging, the company has, under
standably so, been cautious on the 
monetization side. So just curious if you could discuss how optimistic you 
are about building a meaningful business around private messaging.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I can take those. When you think about th
e transition or people using feed 
versus Stories, there are a couple of things that are different. One is just the 
format. And again, we have a lot of experience at this. People had display 
ads or search ads before they really did Facebook ads, if you look
 
back a 
decade. And teaching people here is what a Facebook ad looks like was a 
new format people had to understand. Then, as we moved into more photos 
with Instagram, more videos, a video ad on Facebook or Instagram is a very 
different thing if they perfo
rm well. They need to be natively social than a 
video ad that runs on TV.
 
So Stories is a new format. It has multiple pictures, multiple screens, words 
and phrases intermixed in a different way. And so again, that's a new muscle 
for advertisers. I think we
're getting people up the curve well this time. 
We've learned that we can't just rely on teaching our clients and teaching 
the ad agencies to do it, but helping them do that. And so some of the tools 
we've rolled out that I talked about where we can take y
our Facebook 
pictures and your posts and make it a story, that makes that process faster.
 
I think when you think about the long
-
term monetization opportunities, it's 
really going to depend upon the time people spend. The amount of ads we 
would feel comfort
able inserting into a consumer experience really depends 
upon how many different things you go through. So if you spend more time 
in Stories, they'll be need to be more engaging because there will be fewer 
ads in there.
 
Now that may be possible because the
re's high, high, high engagement in 
Stories. So we're going to have to see the length and how quickly people 
scroll through them to see how many ad opportunities there are and to see 
how effective those ad opportunities are. Our business depends upon the 
a
mount of ads that we can share and the effectiveness of those ads, which 
drives up ROI and ultimately the price.
 
When you think about messaging, if we've already made the transition in a 
big way to feed, if we are starting to see real success in Stories, m
essaging 
is in a much earlier stage. And what we're doing on Messenger and on 
WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, 
and then in the early stages of testing messaging. So we think paid 
messaging, as we've talked about.
 
And
 
WhatsApp is interesting because by virtue of paying, businesses are 
going to have to be careful about the content they send. You're not going to 
send a lot of things people don't want to see if you're paying for them. And 
so really focused on the consumer
 
experience there and figuring out over 
time.
 
The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than 
people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with 
click
-
to
-
Messenger ads. So one of the things 
advertisers are trying to do 
when they're in feed and ultimately when they're in Stories is drive to 
transactions and real engagement, one
-
on
-
one with a consumer is often part 
of that.
 
So a click
-
to
-
Messenger ad takes advantage of having both of those 
plat
forms so that businesses can deepen their relationship with the 
consumer. And I think those experiences and the interaction between them, 
we're even in earlier days there, but I think we have a lot of opportunity to 
explore there.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Faceboo
k, Inc.
 
And, Mark, this is Dave. I just wanted to add in. I think you asked about line 
of sight on monetization parity on Stories versus feed. It's obviously hard to 
say that because they're both dynamic, they're auctions, there's a lot going 
on. But I wou
ld say that at least in the near term, the impression growth 
opportunity is significant on Stories. Pricing will take time. So as we bring 
more formats to Stories and bring more advertisers to Stories, we can build 
up that demand and balance that out with 
supply. But I think in terms of it 
converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's 
going to take years, not quarters. So it's going to take time.

Thank you very much for taking my question. Just really one for Mark, which 
is, I don't think anyone has asked much about the security investments that 
Facebook is making. And when I talk to investors, people are cur
ious 
whether it's one
-
off or recurring. And so as you think about 2019, the 
magnitude of the resources that the company plans to deploy to protect 
privacy, to protect security, it sounds like you're in or will be in, hopefully, a 
better position to ward of
f bad actors than you were prior to the 2016 
election.
 
But I just wonder. Do you look at this as an endless arms race, or is there 
some point in this investment where you might be able to get some better 
efficiencies on those investments, also relative to 
others in the industry who 
are making investments that don't seem quite as sizable as Facebook's? 
Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
This is a really important question. I do think that we are up against 
sophisticated adversaries who will cont
inue to evolve. So there is a large 
element of this, which is an arms race. And when you're talking about 
security issues and some of the safety and content issues, these are not 
problems that we fix. They're problems that you manage over time and try 
to r
educe and prevent issues from coming up, but there's no silver bullet 
where you do the thing and then you're done.
 
That said, I do think that we were quite behind where we needed to be a 
couple of years ago. We started a roadmap, which we said was going to
 
be 
about a three
-
year roadmap. I think that we have some confidence in that 
timeframe, which takes us through the end of about 2019, to get our 
systems to the level that we generally think that they should be at, where 
we're building AI systems that can f
lag content that might be problematic to 
a much larger security and review team that can manage the larger volume 
of stuff that our tools are flagging to them.
 
We're judging our success by, go through all of the categories of harmful 
content and behavior, 
whether it's terrorism, or self
-
harm, or hate speech, 
or just any different kind of thing that you'd be worried about. We're judging 
our success by how proactive can we get, so what percent of the stuff that 
we're taking down are we identifying before othe
r people identify it for us. 
We've started issuing transparency reports so we can be held publicly 
accountable on this.
 
What we see internally is that generally every week and every quarter that 
goes by, we're getting better and better at this. But I antic
ipate that it will 
be about the end of next year when we feel like we're as dialed in as we 
would generally all like us to be. And even at that point, we're not going to 
be perfect because more than 2 billion people are communicating on the 
service. There 
are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how 
well
-
tuned we are.
 
But I think we're making progress. We've made a lot of progress in the last 
couple of years on content overall. Elections are a special case, an extremely 
important special case
 
of the content and safety issues and security issues 
that we face. But across all of the different types of content issues of people 
trying to spread hate or incite violence. We are making progress, and I feel 
good about the progress that we're making. An
d I think we will continue 
investing more. But I do think that to some degree the last few years and 
next year are probably going to be the biggest growth in the investment in 
the security efforts that we'll see.

Great. Thank you. I just had two questions and I guess maybe you just 
touched on some of this, Mark. But the CapEx growth that you guys gave for 
next year, how far ah
ead should we think about you guys building out 
capacity? And can you help us think about the ongoing trend, in particular in 
light of your comments that you just made about how you'll feel about being 
more dialed in at the end of 2019? But how do we think
 
about kind of that 
continued growth and CapEx number? And is there anything there that's a 
one
-
time item?
 
And I guess the other question would just be related to Stories. And I guess, 
I'm just wondering, I know it's early days in terms of advertisers putt
ing ad 
units in there at this point. But given that you've got the technology that 
converts to creative and kind of help people with that process of how to do a 
good Stories ad, how effective do you think that's been in terms of helping 
to drive their adop
tion of this ad unit thus far?

Heather, I'll take the first question regarding CapEx. So, yeah, we are 
investing ahead of user growth, given the long lead time in deploying data 
centers and network capacity. So we are build
ing some capacity ahead of 
our immediate needs. So that is playing into it. But we're also making 
investments to support the core growth of the business. There's a lot of 
compute that goes behind, things like feed ranking and ads ranking. We 
think there is
 
good ROI to putting more servers behind things like choosing 
the right ad for the right impression opportunity that we have. So we are 
putting more compute behind that.
 
And then, I'd also make the comment that a lot of our growth is coming 
from markets in
 
Asia, our top growth countries were India, Indonesia and 
the Philippines. So we're building capacity to serve that Asian peak and 
those users are at a lower ARPU. So that impacts the overall capital 
intensity. So we're continuing to invest and we're seein
g increased CapEx in 
2019, albeit at a much slower growth rate than we had in 2018.

I'll talk about Stories and I'll share a fun and, I think, important example. 
We know that when people are using more of the opportuni
ties to reach 
consumers, their returns often go up. So the fun example is the Furbo Dog 
Camera. They're a Taiwanese company. They built this camera where you 
can see/talk and you can see and talk and toss dog treats to your dog when 
you're not at home. The
y ran a video ad campaign across Facebook and 
Instagram Stories and they targeted people with dog
-
related interests and 
used Custom Audiences to exclude people who had already purchased their 
product. By running across Facebook Stories and Instagram Storie
s, they 
drove 20% more leads than our other digital campaigns. So anecdotally, 
with our early, early adopters, we can see that we believe the increased 
opportunities here really work, and we have other examples like this.
 
In terms of how early it is for ad
option, it's super early. We just rolled out 
the ability to do this in August, and we have to drive awareness and drive 
people into trying it. And even when we make it super easy for people to get 
their ads into the right format, from the smallest mom
-
and
-
pop to the 
largest brands, people want to understand the creative of their ad and it 
needs to be in a format they feel comfortable. So as more people use 
Stories, we think they will increasingly feel comfortable in Stories. But we 
have a long road ahead of
 
us even with tools that make it easy to drive 
awareness and adoption. We think once we do, the returns will be good.

Operator, we are going to take one last question.

Ralph Schackart from William Blair.

Good afternoon. Maybe switching gears to feed, you talked about it being a 
major growth driver and a lot of opportunities for improvement. Can you 
maybe share some perspec
tive on what those opportunities look like from 
both a user, as well as an advertiser? And then also, maybe just more 
longer
-
term, how can feed continue to be a strong growth driver? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Kara Sandberg

I can take that. When you t
hink about feed, what people are doing is 
sharing. They're sharing in Instagram and Facebook. And that means 
there's, in many ways, almost limitless opportunity for consumers to do 
more. I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of 
meanin
gful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to 
develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as 
they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very 
meaningful and important experience in feed as t
hey're sharing.
 
Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us 
helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in 
many ways, positive for people. And I think the product teams, led by Mark, 
have done a 
great job of that over time and you're seeing the continued 
investment there. Along with that, goes the advertising opportunities. As 
there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook 
and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more 
opportunities just on the 
supply side of ads.
 
On the demand side, all of the things we do to get more advertisers active in 
our system, means we'll have more ads to choose from, to make those ads 
more relevant, to measure the ROI of those ads so that peopl
e can then 
iterate and, again, make those more relevant. I think we've made real 
improvements there, but I think there's a lot more we can do.
 
And one of the ways I talk to people about it is just ask what percentage of 
the ads do you see in your feed are 
as good as the very best posts you see 
from friends. And I think most people will honestly say that certainly 
compared to a few years ago, those ads are much more relevant to them, 
but not all of them. And you can see in that example, even in your own feed
, 
the opportunities we have to improve, finding the right ad and giving it to 
the right person at the right time, which drives businesses all around the 
world and drives our business as well.

Thanks Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining today. This has been a 

boa
rd. We've continued to grow our community in both size and 
engagement with 1.35 billion people now using each month and 64% using 
Facebook daily. On mobile 1.12 billion people now use Facebook each month 
and 703 million people each day, nearly 40% growth f
rom this time last 
year.
 
Looking to our business, we continue to do well. This quarter total revenue 
reached $3.2 billion and advertising revenue grew 64% year
-
over
-
year. 
Mobile now accounts for 66% of our advertising revenue. These results show 
that Faceb
ook is getting stronger every day, as a community, a partner for 
developers and marketers and as a business.
 

aggressively and making progress towards our big long
-
term goals, we al
so 
continue to execute well against our near
-
term priorities. On previous calls, 

understanding the world and building the next generation of platforms. 
These goals are important for u
s and part of our foundation of our strategy 
for the next decade, but achieving these will involve many different efforts 
and steps along the way, some that will be achieved rapidly and others that 
are going to take longer.
 

o run through our progress this quarter on the 
different efforts that we expect to deliver a lot of impact over the next three, 
five and 10 years. Let's begin with our three
-
year goals. Over the next three 
years, our main goals are around continuing to gro
w and serve our existing 
communities and businesses and help them reach their full potential. When 
you look at the size and engagement of our community, our progress 
remains very strong. 864 million use Facebook every day and across our 
core products, we c
ontinue to see huge engagement. For example around 
700 million people now use Facebook Groups every month. Achieving this 
scale shows that we're delivering experiences for the way that people want 
to share and connect.
 
Another example is our progress on pu
blic content. Last quarter I talked 
about how we're working to connect people around important public 
moments and personalities on Facebook. This quarter we've continued to 
build on our results and there are now more than 1 billion interactions every 
week 
between public figures and their fans on Facebook.
 
The investments we have made in video have also played a big part here. 
This quarter we announced a new milestone for video on Facebook achieving 
1 billion video views, a day of made of videos. During the 
summers the ice 
bucket challenge drew more than 10 billion video views by 440 million 
people which is a good sign of how far our video product has come.
 
Instagram has also made a lot of progress this quarter. In August, the 
Instagram team launched Hyperlap
se, a standalone app for time lapse of 
videos on iOS. The team has also invested heavily in improving the speed 
and performance of Instagram on Android. This has helped drive Instagram's 
strong international growth which in some countries has achieved more
 
than 
100% year
-
over
-
year growth. Globally, people using Instagram now spend 
around 21 minutes a day on average using the app. This is a strong figure 
compared to the industry and a good sign that Instagram's strategy is on 
the right path. Our other big fo
cus over the next three years is to continue 
to serving businesses well and creating a lot of value for marketers.
 
As our results show, our approach here is working. To continue delivering 
value for businesses, we work to improve the quality of ads and new
s feed 
by reducing low quality content and improving our targeting to show more 

tech, most importantly the launch of our new Atlas platform. Atlas offers 
marketers a lot of new capabi
lities to help reach people across devices, 
platforms and publishers as well as improving measurement in online 
campaign. We're very excited for the future of Atlas and Cheryl is going to 
talk more about this in a moment.
 
Next, let's talk about our strateg
y over the next five years. Over the next 
five years, our goals are around taking our next generation of services, 
Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Search and helping them connect 
billions of people and become important businesses in their own right.
 
One
 
big priority for us here is messaging. And continuing to build and grow 
Messenger and now WhatsApp as well as great services. This quarter we 
made an important change to our mobile messaging efforts by transitioning 
people to Messenger on iOS, Android and
 
Windows Phone. We believe that 
this change allows us to offer a better and faster messaging experience on 
mobile, and our data shows that people who use Messenger, usually respond 
to messages about 20% faster.
 
This month we also completed our acquisition 
of WhatsApp. I'm excited to 
be working with this team and John to join our Board. WhatsApp continues 
to be on a path to connect more than 1 billion people around the world and 
we're going to be working into accelerate their efforts here. Another key part 
o
f our strategy is helping developers to build more great social experiences 
on our platform.
 
Over the next few years, our goal is to make Facebook a cross
-
platform 
platform that allows developers to build, grow and monetize their apps 
across every major mo

here. This quarter, we opened our audience networks to all developers and 
publishers, allowing over 1.5 million advertisers on Facebook to extend their 
campaigns across mobile and for developers to begin
 
monetizing their apps.
 
We're also excited by the continued adoption of App Links, our deep
-
linking 
technology for mobile apps. App Links is now used by hundreds of apps 
across iOS, Android and Windows phone and in just the past six months, the 
developers 
have created links to more than 3 billion individual destinations 
in these apps.
 
Now let's talk about how we're approaching our goals over the next 10 
years. For the next 10 years our focus is on driving the fundamental changes 
in the world that we need to
 
achieve our mission, connecting the whole 
world, understanding a world with big leaps in AIs and developing the next 
generation of platforms, especially in computing.
 
This is a very big period, a very busy period for our efforts with Internet.org. 
In July
 
we worked with Airtel to launch the Internet.org app in Zambia. This 
provides free data access to a set of basic internet services for health, 
education, employment and communication. The results from this are very 
encouraging. We've already heard a lot a
mazing stories about how people 
are using the internet to add value to their lives. We hope to bring the 
Internet.org app to many more countries soon.
 
Over the last few months, I've also travelled to several countries and met 
with policy makers, key distri
butors and people and communities that are 
coming online for the first time. Increasingly industry and governments are 
seeing expanding internet access as one of their core priorities. This is 
positive development for our work with Internet.org in our long
-
term goal of 
connecting everyone in the world.
 
Finally, let's talk for a minute about our progress of Oculus. As I've said 
before, with Oculus, we're making a long
-
term bet on the future of 
computing. Every 10 to 15 years, a new major computing platform a
rrives 
and we think that virtual and augmented reality are important parts of this 
upcoming next platform. This quarter, Oculus continued to make progress 
towards this vision.
 
In September, the first Oculus developer conference took place, where we 
announc
ed a new prototype VR headset on the path of a consumer version 
of the Rift. We continue to see a lot of excitement in the developer 
community and we've now shipped more than 100,000 of Rift developer kit 
to over a 130 countries. It's still early for Oculu
s but we are encouraged to 
see the variety of apps and games being developed for this platform.
 
Internet.org and Oculus are just two of the huge opportunities ahead. Our 
efforts here will take longer to achieve their full impact, but we're going to 
continu


focusing on our big goals of connecting everyone, understanding the world 
and building the next generation of p
latforms.
 
This has been a quarter with strong results. I want to thank the entire 
Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our stockholders for 
their continued support. Because of your contribution, Facebook continues to 
grow in strength and to 
create greater value in the world for people, 


 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks Mark and hi 

continuing to execute well on our priorities; capitalizing on the shift to 
mobile; growing the number of Facebook marketers and building products to 
make our ads more relevant. Our growth this quarter was a
gain very broad
-
based. We saw strong performance around the world as well as across 
verticals on our four marketer segments, brands, direct marketers, 
developers and small and medium businesses.
 

duct front and 
then focus on important new investments we're making in ad
-
tech. One of 
our main ad protocols is to make ads more relevant. Just like content and 
news feed, when ads are more relevant, they provide a better experience for 
people using Facebo
ok and a better return for marketers.
 
One of the best ways to improve relevance is to help advertisers reach the 
right audience with their messages. Facebook age and gender targeting is 
45% more accurate than the digital industry average. Working with 
Face
book advertisers can also target based on peoples interests. In addition, 


pleased with the response from client

penetration with those existing and new clients.
 
We also offer lookalike audiences, which help marketers find potential new 
customers who are similar to their current customers. To share one recent 
example, earlier thi
s year global financial services company MetLife wanted 
to find new customers for life insurance policies. Working with this agency 
Markel, they used lookalike audiences to find people more like their existing 
customers, MetLife ran ads that let people to 
their get a quote website page. 
Over the six

month campaign, the leads that came from Facebook resulted

continuing to roll our ads on Instagram. We think there is good opportunity 
with both video and Instagram ads but we're going to remain 
deliberate and 
slow in our approach to scaling those businesses.
 

-
term investments that we believe will be important 
for Facebook and the ad industry. In Q3, we re
-
launched Atlas, closed our 
acquisition of LiveRail and rolled out ou
r audience network. So I want to 
spend a few minutes discussing our longer
-
term ad
-

investing in ad
-
tech for a simple reason. Consumers are shifting quickly to 
mobile and the advertising industry is not keeping up.
 
2013 was the first ye
ar the average American adults spent more time on 
digital media than watching TV and that gap has continued to grow. Today 
the average adult in the U.S. spends nearly 25% of their media time on 
mobile, but advertisers spend only about 11% of their budgets 
there. One of 


returns on mobile. Current solutions work well for person with one device, 
especially, a PC 
and for sales that happen online.
 
But today people often have multiple devices and still make many purchases 
in physical stores. Nilsson OCR [ph] data shows that the digital industry is 
less than 60% accurate in demographic targeting of ads, which means th
at 
four in 10 people are seeing the wrong ads.
 
Similarly marketers are not confident that they can measure mobile ad 
performance. Many of the most commonly used measurement systems over 
emphasize the value of the last click. This does not make sense, given
 
that 
studies of Facebook campaigns show that over 90% of ad driven in

store 

 
It's clear that marketers and publishers need better tools for the mobile 
world. This is an industry problem that we b
elieve we are well placed to 
solve. Our re
-
launch of Atlas last month during Adweek was an important 
early step that builds on the advancements and measurements we have 
made over the past two years. The new Atlas is an ad serving and 
measurement platform, 
we completely rebuilt. By using Facebook data, Atlas 
can deliver highly relevant ads, regardless of device.
 
Atlas is also able to provide accurate measurement by connecting online 
marketing to in store sales. Importantly, Atlas does all of this in a privac
y 
protected way. Neither Atlas nor Facebook tells marketers who you are. At 
Adweek, we had productive conversations about Atlas with many marketers 
and agencies. We are pleased with their interest.

Thanks everyone and now here is Dave.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Thanks, Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Q3 was a solid quarter across 
the board. We had strong revenue gro
wth, generated $766 million in free 
cash flow and continued to make investments to position us for long
-
term 
growth. 864 million people use Facebook on an average day in September, 
up a 136 million from last year. This represents 64% of the 1.35 billion 
pe
ople that used Facebook during the month of September.
 
Mobile continues to be the core driver of our growth. Over 1.1 billion people 
used Facebook on mobile during the month of September, up 250 million 
from last year. In addition, we have hundreds of mill
ions of people on mobile 
using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.
 
Turning now to the financials. Total revenue in Q3 was $3.2 billion, up 59% 
compared to last year or 58% on a constant currency basis. Total ad 
revenue was nearly $3 billion, up 64% compared
 
to last year or 63% on a 
constant currency basis. Ad revenue growth was strong around the world 
with each of our four reported geographic regions growing by 50% or more 
compared to last year.
 
Mobile ad revenue was approximately $1.9 billion or 66% ad reve
nue, 
compared to approximately $881 million or 49% of ad revenue last year. 
Desktop ad revenue was up 11% compared to last year, but was flat 
sequentially. In Q3, the average price per ad increased 274% compared to 
last year, while total ad impressions dec
lined 56%. The increase in the 
average effective price per ad was driven primarily by the redesign of our 
right hand column ads which resulted in larger, more engaging ads that 
delivered more value to marketers and thus had higher reflective prices. 
These 
right hand column ads were also fewer in number, which drove the 
decrease of impressions in the quarter. To a lesser degree, the shift of usage 
to mobile, where we don't have right hand column ads also continued to 
contribute to the reported price volume t
rends. The price volume trends 
were largely consistent across our four geographic regions.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was $246 million, up 13% versus 
last year, however payments volume from gains which represents the 
substantial majority of our 
payments and other fees revenue declined 2% 
compared to last year, notably for the first time and we expect this trend to 
continue as desktop usage continues to decline.
 
Turning now to expenses. Note that beginning in Q3 our definition of non
-
GAAP also exc
ludes the amortization of intangible assets and historical non
-
GAAP measures discussed today have been updated accordingly. You can 
find our GAAP to non
-
GAAP reconciliations on page 10 of the Q3 press 
release.
 
Our Q3 total GAAP expenses were $1.8 billion, 
up 41% from last year and 
non
-
GAAP expenses were $1.4 billion, up 39% from last year. Cost of 
revenue grew 11% on a GAAP basis and 7% on a non
-
GAAP basis. We 
incurred expenses in the third quarter of 2013 related to the transition out of 
certain lease data
 
centers. This mitigated our cost of revenue growth rate in 
Q3 2014, as it has done in the last two quarters. Operating expenses 
excluding cost of revenue were up 61% on a GAAP basis and 72% on a non
-
GAAP basis versus last year, primarily due to an increas
e in headcount 
related costs.
 
We ended Q3 with 8,348 employees, up 44% from last year. Of the nearly 
1,200 people we added sequentially about a quarter were from acquisition. 
Organic growth was high as the third quarter is our seasonally strongest new 
hire
 
start period. Overall we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain 
talented people who enable us to make strong progress against our mission.
 
Q3 operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 44% operating margin, 
up from 37% last year and our
 
non
-
GAAP operating income was $1.8 billion, 
representing 57% operating margin, up from 51% last year. Interest and 
other income and expense was a net expense of $61 million in the quarter, 
versus a net expense of $10 million last year. This increase in ex
pense was 
primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic re
-
measurement of our foreign currency balances and largely resulted from the 
substantial reduction in the value of the euro relative to the dollar 
experienced form the beginnin
g to the end of the quarter. Our GAAP and 
non
-
GAAP tax rates for the quarter were 40% and 35% respectively.
 
GAAP net income was $806 million or $0.30 per share and our non
-
GAAP net 
income was $1.1 billion or $0.43 per share. In Q3, we spent $482 million on
 
CapEx and generated $766 million of free cash flow. We ended Q3 with 
approximately $14.3 billion in cash and investments. This does not reflect 
the approximately $4.6 billion cash payment that we made in conjunction 
with the WhatsApp acquisition, which cl
osed earlier this month.
 
Turning now to outlook. I'd like to start by noting that my forward
-
looking 
statements include the impact of both Oculus and WhatsApp. In addition, as 
part of the WhatsApp deal, we agreed to file a registration statement to 
register for resale approximately 178 million shares issued to the WhatsApp 
stockholders. Nearly all of those shares will be fully registered and tradable 
during open trading windows in Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 under the registration 
statement we plan to file l
ater this week.
 
In light of our recent acquisitions and our plans to file this registration 
statement, we are providing some additional guidance this quarter, including 
a more specific outlook on the current quarter revenue and a preliminary 
view on 2015 e
xpenses. This is a more detailed outlook than we have 
historically provided or plan to provide on future earnings calls.
 
Let me start with 2014 expenses, we expect our full year 2014 total GAAP 
expenses, including cost of revenues, stock compensation and t
he 
amortization of intangibles will grow approximately 45% to 50% versus the 
full year 2013. This increase from our prior range of 30% to 35% is primarily 
due to the impact of this WhatsApp acquisition on stock
-
based compensation 
charges in the fourth quar
ter.
 
We continue to expect that our full year 2014 total non
-
GAAP expenses, 
including cost of revenue but excluding stock compensation and amortization 
of intangibles will likely grow in the neighborhood of 30% to 35% versus the 
full year 2013.
 
Turning now
 
to revenue, we expect that total revenue in the fourth quarter 
will grow in the range of 40% to 47% versus the same quarter of last year. 
Please keep in mind that Q4 of 2013 was our first holiday season with the 
rollout of new seed ads at scale, which mak
es for a difficult comparison.
 
For taxes, we anticipate the GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter will be 
approximately 45% to 50%, which is higher than the current rate due to 
large non
-
deductible stock
-
based compensation charges related to the 
closing of t
he WhatsApp transaction. Our Q4 non
-
GAAP tax rate should be 
similar to our Q3 rate.
 
For share count, we expected our fourth quarter fully diluted share count will 
be approximately 2.8 billion shares, taking into account the shares that we 
issued upon the c
losing of the WhatsApp deal. We expect that our 2014 
CapEx will be at the low end of our prior $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx 
guidance.
 
And lastly, while it is relatively early, I wanted to provide some preliminary 
color on our expense outlook for 2015. 
As Mark discussed in his remarks, we 
believe that we have very substantial growth opportunities in front of us and 
we plan to invest aggressively to capitalize on those opportunities. As such, 
we plan on 2015 being a significant investment year.
 
Our curren
t expectation is that total cost and expenses on a GAAP basis, 
inclusive of stock
-
based compensation charges related to the recent 
transactions are likely to increase 55% to 75% compared to the full year 
2014. On a non
-
GAAP basis, we expect total cost to i
ncrease approximately 
50% to 70% compared to 2014. Tax rates for 2015 should be similar to our 
fourth quarter rates on both a GAAP and non
-
GAAP basis.

was 
talking about.
 
From an infrastructure side, we plan to invest to support the growth of the 
core business. That includes things like video. It also includes things like our 

ly kind of investing 
across the board on that. And I guess in summary, we've got 
--
 
the strength 
of the business today is really putting us in a strong position to invest 

 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

ery strong growth among our brand marketer 


platform to offer the ability to do creativity and storytelling app 
scale in a 
personal way and we talk a lot with our clients and partners about personal 
marketing at scale. You'll find that our clients 
--
 
that they are different parts 

want any produ
cts or think about their ongoing
 
messages without including 
Facebook and there are some for whom we're not yet core and we are 
working on that.
 
With all of this, we know we need to go client by client and we're especially 
focused on measurement because mea
surement is so key for this segment. 
A lot of the products that brand marketers are selling are bought in store 
and so showing that online and mobile ads lead to in store purchases is a 
hugely important part of our strategy going forward as I talked about,
 
and 
video is really exciting as well.
 
When you think about the holiday season, Q4 is a really important time for 
our client and that makes it a really important time for us. And I think 
people are increasingly recognizing that mobile is important. 65% of 
people 
use their phones while they are out shopping and people are recognizing 
that opportunity.
 
From an earnings perspective, last Q4 was a great quarter, both because our 
business was growing but also because that was when we rolled out ads fully 
into ne

how you think about our business going forward.

A few questions. David, th
ere was no mention of a '15 revenue range but I 
was wondering if you could give us any thoughts on how much margin 
should compress in '15 versus '14? Then a couple for Mark. Mark, now that 
you've spent more time with the Oculus team, can you update us on h
ow 
your plans for Oculus have evolved since you first tried the device on. And 
then you mentioned it when you talked about your 10 year outlook. Does 
that mean we shouldn't expect any consumer Oculus product in the next one 
or two years? And then similarly
 
on Search, you mentioned your five plan. 

years?
 
Dave Wehner
 
Hey, Ben, it's Dave. We're not really giving any guidance on 2015 revenue. 
We gave the growth range that we're 
expecting on Q4, which was 40% to 
47% and that's down from 59% in Q3. But we're not providing any specific 
guidance on 2015. Revenue sort of outlined the expense growth that we 
expect because of the substantial investments that we're making, also 
driven by
 
some of the acquisitions that we've made. So hope that, that is 
helpful for everybody.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. And on your questions around Oculus and Search and some of the 
other things that we're doing; the strategy for Oculus is to help accelerate 
their 
growth. They have two products around Rift on PC and they are 
supporting Gear VR and the Samsung team and building the mobile version. 
And I'm really excited about both of them.
 
I don't think that this is going to be 
--
 
it needs to rich a very large sale, 
50 
million to 100 million units before it will really be a very meaningful thing as 
a computing platform. So I do think it's going to take a bunch of years to get 
there. Maybe 
--
 

going to ge
t to 50 million or 100 million units in the next few years. So that 
will take a few cycles of the device to get there and that's kind of what I'm 
talking about.
 
And then when you get to that scale, that's when it starts to be interesting 
as a business in t
erms of developing out the ecosystem. So when I'm talking 
about that as a 10 year thing, its building the first set of devices and 
building the audience and the ecosystem around that until it eventually 
becomes a business.
 
Some of the things like Search an
d some of these other products, this may 
sound a little ridiculous to say, but for us, products don't really get that 
interesting to turn into businesses until they have about a 1 billion people 
using them. And so for Facebook, we're there with News Feed a
nd that's 
why in the near term our priority is really around continuing to grow and 
serve that community and making sure that the business around News Feed 
and those mobile ads fully reach their potential.
 
Over a five year time frame, we have a number of s
ervices, which we think 
are well on their way to reaching a 1 billion people. Messenger, WhatsApp, 
Instagram and Search are a number of them. And once we get to that scale, 
then we think that they will start to become meaningful businesses in their 
own rig
ht. And I think that the right way to think about that, as I've tried to 
say repeatedly on these calls is, not that we're going to try to monetize 
them very aggressively in the next year or two, because I really think for 
each of those categories, the righ
t strategy is to first focus on connecting 1 
billion plus people and reaching the full potential before very aggressively 
turning them into businesses.
 
But I do think that this is such a big opportunity ahead of us. I can't think of 
that many other compani
es or products that have multiple lines of products 
that are on track to reach and connect 1 billion that have a clear path of how 
we can turn them into a business. So that will be a very fun and exciting 
challenge to work on over the next five years.

Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your 
line is open.
 
Heather Bellini

Goldman Sachs
 
I just had two. I guess, one for Sheryl, if you could talk about the comments 
you made about giving advertisers a better feel for attr
ibution, I was just 
wondering what percent of attribution do you find today is given to the last 
click and how overstated do you think that is right now? And then just a 
follow up question for Dave. Given your total expense range of 50 to 70, 
wider than wh
at we've seen in the past. I'm just wondering how should we 
think about the low end versus the high end. Under what scenarios are you 
thinking about those ranges?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Heather to your first question. We think measurement really, really needs to 
evolve for the world we're in today in many ways. One of those is over 
emphasizing the last click and the percentages by which that's done really 
varies but we think substantially across the industry are over emphasized. 
But there are also other problems. 
The current measurement systems don't 
work on mobile, because they are largely cookie based. They are not 
accurate and we think they are only 59% accurate in even the most basic 
demographic targeting, they just go offline to online. They really work well 
f
or one person with one device, usually a PC, thus making online purchases. 
The world we live in today, I bet you, everyone on his phone call has 
multiple devices and people look at ads online and then purchase offline, as 
well as deserve more relevant ads 
and better targeting. So, as we re
-
launch 
Atlas, as we think about investing in ad
-

these problems and we think our re
-
launch is the first step in doing that.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Heather, yes, and on the range of guidance, it is 
wider, it is obviously an 
early view into 2015. And so consequently it is a wide range. It's giving you 

the future in terms of the expense guidance range that we have in the past 
o
n an annual basis each quarter. So the big drivers will be things like the 
pace of hiring, the success we have in building, the great teams that we

on Facebook. I'd love to get deeper thoughts there about the way you think 
content distributions sort of develops on
 
pace over the longer term? And 
then one for Sheryl. With the ad
-

over the last year or to two, wanted to know when you think we should be 
looking at ad
-
tech being fully deployed in the marketplace, and what sort of 
r
eturns that might generate for Facebook? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure, well I can start off by talking about public content. So historically a lot 
of people use Facebook for sharing moments in their lives with their friends 
and smaller sets of people, righ
t? So we have Messenger for one
-
to
-
one 
communication, Group that just reached 700 million monthly active this 
quarter and then News Feed, which is kind of the primary thing that people 
are using to share with all their friends at once.
 
And one of the big t
hings that we 
--
 
looking at the FICO system, thought 
that there was a big opportunity in was public content, where its content 
that people are either comfortable sharing with everyone or want to 

king at a few 
different areas. Video is a very big priority. News is a very big priority, 
because a lot of people want to share that on Facebook already. And 
enabling public figures, whether they are celebrities, they are athletes, they 
are actors, or poli
ticians or leaders in different kind of communities to get on 
Facebook and use the platform to distribute the content that they want. So 
those are the three areas that where 
--
 
that you'll probably see us investing 
the most in over the next year or so. And
 



 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
On ad
-

from marketing t
hat is cookie based on a PC, one desktop to people based 
marketing on multiple devices, to marketing that is primarily for online 
sales, to marketing that affects those online and offline sales on mobile. So I 
think we're right now in a pretty big shift an

deployed there. We have a lot of pieces to do. Our Atlas re
-
launch is new. 

and we're putting these other pieces in place on audience network and 
LiveRa
il. So I think we're pretty far from being fully deployed on even this 
big shift. But I think in our industry nothing ever fully deployed, that as soon 
as we catch up here, there is going to be another movement and something 
else that happens that we have 
to react to and build the technology for. And 
so we remain

we're a long term company run by a founder with a long run 
vision and we want to keep our eyes ahead on these changes and

I just have two questions, one for Mark and then a quick one for Dave. Mark, 

There has been some speculation of payment offerings within Messenger. 
Can you give us a sense at a hi
gh level of what you've envisioned Facebook 
potentially doing in the payment space longer
-
term across merchant 
payments, consumers' products like savings and lending or peer
-
to
-
peer? 
And then how do you see social interactions tied in with payments evolvin
g? 

 
And then Dave, just a clarification. So the high end of the 4Q revenue 
guidance assumes a pretty sharp drop
-
off, even normalizing for some extra 
currency hit. So are you seeing any
thing out there that makes you 
concerned about pacing into the quarter or is it largely business as usual or 
it's just a tougher law of large numbers type situation?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

busi


solutions, rather than trying to compete and do it as a business ourselves. 

oach is it's very important for all 
online businesses and our customers and partners that there is a good 
online payment system. People run ads to get customers and sell products 
and at the end of that conversion, if there is a good payment system that is 
smooth, then people will buy more things, which ultimately makes the ads 
and all of whole online flow more valuable for those partners and therefore 
more revenue and profit for our business as well.
 
We view the ads part of the business as a more efficient 
part of the 
businesses than payments itself. Payments tends to be fixed fee whereas 
and ad, because of the option model, there is really good price 
discrimination built in. So a partner or business who is willing to pay us 30% 
of their revenue can bid that
 
and some of these willing to only pay 5% of the 
revenue can bid that and the auction model inherently takes care of that.
 
So we think that focusing on the ads part is going end up being the more 

ant for the ad 
system over time for and for all of our partners for there to be a payment 
system, which is why we're excited about partnering with credit card 
companies and partnering with PayPal and all of the different folks doing 
online payments to make
 
their solutions as good as possible as well.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Hey Ross, it's Dave. Our view now is that Q4 revenue will come in that 40% 
to 47% year
-
over
-
year growth range. As I mentioned, Q4 of '13 was just an 
absolutely fantastic quarter for us. We had News 
Feed sort of rolled out at 
scale. It was our first $1 billion dollar mobile quarter. So we're comping 
against just really outstanding quarter last year. That's really the largest 
issue. You asked about currency. We did see the euro drop about 7% in 
value o
ver the course of Q3 and that really didn't pick up as you saw. It 
didn't pick up in an impact in Q3 at all because it happened at the end of the 
quarter. So that will be a headwind that we see and that's factored into the 
guidance.

Great, Sheryl. You talked about being careful about

and slow about the 
rolling of the video ads

auto play video ads and Instagram monetiz
ation. 
Have you seen any pushback in terms of user experiences to date on videos 
or on video ads, is that overall caution? Is there anything you've seen in the 
data that suggests that you want to keep it at a really slow pace? Thank 
you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
We
're pleased with the consumer response we've had on both fronts and we 
remain really optimistic over the long run about Instagram and Video, 
because there's a lot of interest. I spoke before about creative story telling 
images. Video can be such a big part
 
of that and it create a really resonant 
experience for brands and companies. We really believe in going slow, that 
as we grow products, we pay attention to the consumer experience. We 
want the consumer experience always to come first. So although we're ve
ry 
optimistic about the opportunity here, we continue to grow slowly and pay 
lot of attention to the quality of the advertising we see.
 
To share one example, we are seeing people using both Facebook and 
Instagram and also Video and other ad products in com
bination. Mercedes 
Benz launched the GLA, which was their first compact SUV on Facebook and 
Instagram and they found that by doing Facebook and Instagram together, 
they got a 54% increase on their website visit. So a lot of our products as 
you do one, you 
also do more Facebook ads as well and that's something 
we're paying a lot of attention to.

Just a couple of questions on video. How should we think about Facebook as 
a video platform and how does the mix of video between user generated 
versus public content v
ersus professionally produced content evolve over 
time? And for example, is the upcoming short
-
film content produced by 
Lionsgate around the Twilight franchise that will be shown exclusively on 
Facebook. Would that increasingly be the type of content Faceb
ook users will 
see in the future? And then if you could just give an update on the 
Instagram monthly active user comp, that would be great? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I can speak to the video point. I think it's going to be all of the above in 
terms of wha
t you said. Most of the content on Facebook is things that 
people are sharing with their friends and the people around them. So I think 

-
trend 
over the last few years where, if you go b
ack five years most of the content 
was text. Now a lot of it is photos and if you look in the future, as networks 
get letter and the ability to capture good video and share in a good way 
improves then 
--
 
I think that going forward a lot of the content that
 
people 
share will be video. It's just a very compelling.
 

form content that they are mentioning I think will fit very well into the feed 
form factor that people consume on Fac

a lot of both of these things and it's going to be an evolution over the next 
few years. But I think you can expect to see a ramp up of all this.

Mark it seems like you taking a portfolio approach to apps and
 
you've got a 
several different experiences for people on mobile devices and other devices. 
Can you give us your philosophy around that? And as people use things like 

reported metri
cs and how do you think about putting this altogether and 
helping every app kind of work?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

increased focus for apps to do one thing really well. Like so on desktop a lo
t 
of the things that might have fit well into a single Facebook website now are 
--
 
in order to best serve people, you need to build multiple standalone 

work that we did to kind of spl
it out Messenger from the Facebook app to 
give a dedicated experience or an app that we think is a better experience. 


 

een is that the use cases for products like Instagram 
and WhatsApp are actually more different and nuanced from then the 
products that people compare them to, that Facebook had already built. So 
for example on the WhatsApp and Messenger side, Messenger is 
primarily 
used today for people to chat with their Facebook friends, within this context 
of maybe it's not like a real
-
time text. Like you would send an SMS on your 
phone, but it's something that you are sending to one of your Facebook 
friends and if they 
happen to be there, then you can text back and forth or 
maybe they respond later.
 
SMS and WhatsApp are more for kind of real
-
time activity. People have 

Their graphs are somewhat diffe
rent. So one of the things that we found 
interestingly to us as well was that, Messenger and WhatsApp are actually 
growing quickly in the lot of the same countries. There's countries that 
they're growing in that are different and there are countries that t
hey are 
growing in that are the same, which to me suggests that they actually are in 
more different markets than you probably intuitively would have thought 
and that was definitely our understanding as we dug more into this.
 
Same with Instagram, and the ty
pe of sharing that happens on Instagram 

accelerate the growth of Instagram from the Facebook app itself because 

ount 
of sharing the people can do and connecting what they can do within our 
whole family of apps. So we're definitely seeing that this is all accretive and 
positive and we think that in the future there will probably be room for more 
apps for sharing as w
ell.

First for Sheryl, I want to just come back to the theme of media 
measurement you gave us in good 
perspective. Can you help me with first 
party data versus third party data? Can you get where you need to go with 
brand marketers using your in
-
house tools like Atlas or do you think you 
need the validity and integrity of a third party measurement source i
.e. 
Nicholson in order to get there.
 
And then second question for Mark. Mark I was just wondering, where do 
you see Facebook at this point in terms of its place in the hardware 

poss
ible that you could get more aggressive in devices, in hardware in order 
to achieve some of your longer
-
term or 10 year goals that you've laid out?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
To your first question, data is really important for both the measurement 
and targeting. And
 
when you think about first party and third party data, 
you have to think about both of those usage. Certainly with measurement, 
third party verification of that data can be very important. A lot of our 
largest clients and agencies also build their own dat
a systems, which are a 
very important part of measuring and kind of certifying everything we do 
with them. So we're using a combination of first party and third party.
 
I think where this really gets interesting is around relevance. And as I spoke 
about, th
at's a major theme for us because we think one of the best things 
we can do to drive more value for marketers and improve the consumer 
experience on Facebook is improve relevance, and data is a great way of 
doing that.
 
So for example with custom 
audiences, custom audiences is a combination 
of our clients using the data they have on their client base, combined with 
the data we have that we can target. Let's say target one ad to existing 
customers to get them to engage more and buy more; and one add
 
to brand 
new customers. And you could see how you're different ads for people who 
have never bought your product and a different ad for people who are 
currently buying your product would make a lot of sense. And then you look 
at something like look alike 
audiences, where we're looking to map 
customers who share characteristics, age, demos, likes, interests with 
current customers. And all of this takes a combination of first party and third 
party data, all of which we do in a very privacy protected way.

So Sheryl, from a product development perspective, it feels like from the 
outside looking in that you have accelerated the roll out and delivery
 
of 
various products. So wondering how you are thinking about how your 
product delivery cadence will change, especially given the investments you 
have guided to for 2015. Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Before we go to that, I'll just quickly answer the hardware q
uestion that we 

more with hardware already than is apparent because we design and work 
with folks to build up all of our data centers and the servers there. So I do 
think that if t
hat ever became the right thing for us to focus on from a 
product perspective, we have some of the skills there already.
 
And when we are thinking about working Oculus, that's actually one of the 
areas where we think we can help out because we've up a suppl
y chain team 
and we've been I think pretty effective at delivering what we've needed to 
run Facebook as this large system of scale. So 
--
 
but that said, I think that 
there is a huge amount of value in delivering these network and software 
services and that
's where you should expect to focus, on the things that we 
talked about.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
To the question about the roll out of products. I think the usual way we do 
things is that we roll out products slowly and then we iterate. So one 
example is custom au
diences. We roll out custom audiences. Then we add 
on that website custom audiences to target ads to people visiting websites 
or then mobile app custom audiences, ads to people who have visited mobile 
apps. And one is building on the next, building on the 
next.
 
Similarly, this month 
--
 
earlier this month we have launched local awareness 
targeting. It's a new option that allows local businesses to reach nearby 
customers. And what you saw that 
--
 
it wasn't a massive launch. It was a 
small launch where we enab
led this targeting, get people to use it and we'll 
develop it. Then there are the exceptions such as Atlas. Atlas was one big 
launch that we're still in the process of doing and that's really because of the 
product that we've bought and needed to rebuild. 
But for the most part, our 
product development tends to be very iterative and that's what you can 
expect from us going forward.

First question for 
Mark. Mark you recently came back from China. How do 
you think about that opportunity and what gives you the confidence that you 
can actually be successful where so many have failed. And then the second 
on Instagram; we've seen some very complementary data
 
that shows that 
Instagram is actually becoming more popular than ever with some brand 
marketers. Just wondering what are the best performing ads formats on the 
platform right now and where is the ad load versus where Facebook is.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So 
on China, we're already doing more in China on the business side 
than I think a lot of folks think about. A lot of Chinese businesses use 
Facebook to grow their export businesses and to help find customers around 
the rest of the world and grow the Chinese 
economy there. So that's actually 
a pretty meaningful thing for us already and we always are looking to find 
ways to help businesses around the world to grow. And that will be just a 
long term thing. I mean our approach to China and all these 
--
 
and every 
country is very kind of long term. We're going to be here for decades and we 
want to create good relationships with these countries and businesses 
around the world that will help and grow over the long
-
term.
 
On the Instagram side, I think we're pretty earl
y. There have been a number 
of good ads, both video and images that I think have been pretty effective, 
but it's fairly early and in the growth phase at this point, the top priority for 
Instagram is to grow from 200 to more and eventually connect billion o
r 
more people and I think that that's something that should be possible and 

building out some of the parts of the business as well.

I think this question is for Sheryl. The app download business seems to have 
grown quickly and become a big contributor of the ad 
revenue total for 
Facebook and just wondering how you think about app reengagement 
relative to app downloads and which of those you think is a larger, long
-
term 
opportunity for the Company. Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I'm glad you asked the question because I 
think there has been some 
confusion around our mobile apps and our mobile app ads and our mobile 
app engagement ads. So engagement ads, it's still pretty early and we have 
rolled those out and rolled those out after mobile app ads. So we definitely 
seen lo
ts of them. But we do think there is an opportunity. I think the 
broader point is that our growth in mobile ads is very broad based. It's 
across all market or segments and it's across all of our different ad formats 
and we talk about our mobile ad business
 
growing. Mobile app ads are a 
small part of that, that's growing in line with our total business.
 
The other thing that I think people get a little confused about is who is using 
mobile app ads. I think commonly when you think about mobile app ads, 
people 
often think about developers and developers are moving them and 
we're pleased we're able to help them grow. But they're also being used by 
some of the largest branders and marketers in the world.
 
So for example Burger King. Burger King just used our mobile
 
app ads to do 
app installs for their app. And the app was to find Burger King, look at their 
menu and nutritional options, use mobile coupons and use virtual gift cards. 
So that was one use of our mobile app ads, which is not what people 
typically think o
f.

Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. We had another 
good
 
quarter and first half of the year. Our community continues to grow 
around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 
billion people use it every day. Our business is growing at a healthy rate as 
well. Total revenue grew by 59% yea
r
-
over
-
year to $6.4 billion and 
advertising revenue was up 63% to $6.2 billion.
 
Our results show our progress as we work to make the world more open and 
connected across our three
-
year, five
-
year, and ten
-
year horizons. Over the 
next three years, we're foc
used on continuing to build our community and 
help people share more of what matters to them. The next five years are 
about building our newer products into full ecosystems, developers and 
businesses. And over the next ten years, we're working to build new
 
technologies to help everyone connect in new ways.
 
I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas. Starting with 
how we're working to
 
deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to 
share and more of what they care
 
with anyone they want.
 
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, 
we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. 
And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double
-
digit 
percentages yea
r
-
over
-
year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, 
and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet.
 
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing 
countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted 
here at ho
me. So, over the past couple of years, we've been making steady 
improvement throughout to make them work regardless of the device or 
connection that people are using. We've also built a lightweight version of 
our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tun
ed to work on 2G networks 
and is now used by more than 100 million.
 
We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and 
understand what's going on with the people they care about. Ten years ago, 
most of what we shared and consumed online 
was text. Now it's photos, and 
soon most of it will be video. We see a world that is video first with video at 
the heart of all of our apps and service.
 
Over the past six months, we've been particularly focused on Live video. 
Live represents the new way to
 
share what's happening in more immediate 
and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca mask video 
was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see 
politics, as news organization, delegates go live from the Republican 
and 
Democratic conventions, and we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live 
can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
 
This quarter we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera 
to take them. You just take a panorama or use the 3
60 cam or app on your 
phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360 photos 
have been shared on Facebook with 1 million more being shared every 
week.
 
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app, like 
search. A gro
wing way that people use search is to find what people are 
saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. 
Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up 
people, businesses, and other things that the
y care about. Continuous 
steady improvement in services like search are an important part of helping 
people connect and realizing our mission.
 
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our 
business with more engaging ads. We've also
 
emphasized the importance of 
measurements and value in driving real results for the businesses that use 
Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevant and engaging 
ads. Over the next five years, we're working hard to build ecosystems 
around so
me of our newer products.
 
Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly active with more than 
300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more 
engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed because we know that 
people have a b
etter experience when they see more of the stories they care 
about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the 
amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our 
advertising tools on Instagram and we're seeing m
arketers engage with 
people in creative and innovative ways.
 
In the two years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook 
app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved 
performance and given people new ways to express th
emselves. And now, 
for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every 
month.
 
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp, which also has 
a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new 
desktop app
s, end
-
to
-
end encryption and millions of people are using 
WhatsApp's voice calling features.
 
The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that 
they are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also 
making it easier
 
for people to connect in groups and businesses as well. 
We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
 
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our ten
-
year 
initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more p
eople a voice, 
including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet 
online. And we're helping more people take advantage of the opportunities 
that come with the internet.
 
We're still early in our journey, lots of hard work ahead. But 
we're making 
good progress, like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar powered 
aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. 
Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments 
around the world to 
connect people on the outskirts of cities, rural areas, 
and disastrous zones where you can't get traditional connectivity today.
 
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial 
intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we annou
nced DeepText, a deep 
learning based engine that can understand the context of several thousand 
posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long
-
term project, 
but it also has some near
-
term benefits like helping show people more of 
what they 
want to see and filtering out less of what they don't want to see.
 
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We 
believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help 
everyone understand what's going on
 
around the world. It's really early for 
us in VR, but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second 
quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile 
phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 a
pps 
are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We filled all of our 
preorders for Oculus Rift and we're seeing increasing demand from retail 
stores planned for the holidays. While it's still early for augmented reality, 
we're doing AR research 
and are seeing lightweight versions of AR 
technology in mobile apps like MSQRD.
 
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our ten
-
year plan. We 
have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done. And while I'm 
happy with our 
progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our 
community and connect the whole world. That means making big 
investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on 
what it can be.
 
I want to thank everyone in our community, all of ou
r teams, our partners 
and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. And now here's 
Sheryl.

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great second quarter. Q2 ad 
revenue grew 63%. Mobil
e ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year
-
over
-
year, and was approximately 84% of total ad revenue. Our growth was 
broad
-
based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
 
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active 
busine
ss pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active 
advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products 
are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. We continue 
to focus on our three priorities, c
apitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing 
the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more 
relevant and effective.
 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising 
industry has gathered in (9:55) to celebrat
e creativity. People have shifted 
to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a 
nice to do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help 
them make this transition.
 
The best marketers understand that people wa
tch video differently in mobile 
feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as thumb
-
stopping creative, 
videos that grab attention in the first few seconds even without sound. For 
example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids Gum, Mondelez targeted 
tee
ns with non
-
chocolate candy interests. Working with the VaynerMedia, 
Carat and the Facebook Creative Shop, they created punchy, ten
-
second 
looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped 
the Sour Patch Kids portfolio beat sales benc
hmarks for the entire candy 
industry.
 
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off 
Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand 
objectives. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ad
s, 
not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites.
 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad 
products. Over a third of small businesses and medium businesses in the 
U.S. don't have a website and having 
a mobile presence is even more 
difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as 
setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the mobile 
solutions for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each 
mont
h in the U.S. and around the world. We've made it easy for business 
owners to manage their Facebook page from their mobile device. Over 85% 
of active business pages use mobile, and 40% of active advertisers have 
created a Facebook ad on their mobile device
.
 
In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote 
posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. We've worked 
hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these 
businesses. With just a few steps and f
or as little as a few dollars, 
businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad 
products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 
started with simplified products like boosted posts. Once these businesses
 
begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of 
even our most sophisticated capabilities.
 
For example, Lighting Etc., a third generation family
-
owned business used 
Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in
-
store sales. They targeted 
25
-
year
-
old to 45
-
year
-
old homeowners interested in interior design living within 35 
miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. It was striking to them that on 
Facebook, the size of our community meant that they could reach over 
300,000 people even with
 
such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% 
increase in revenue in 2016, and they attribute this increase to their ads on 
Facebook and Instagram.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is 
to help our clients grow their 
businesses, whether it be moving products off 
shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly 
looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. 
Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a
 
large audience 
with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive 
formats like video and Canvas ads.
 
Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high quality 
leads and convert them to actions. We introduced lead ads in
 
Q1 to make it 
easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In 
Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or 
completed a lead ad form. For example, Nissan Turkey and the SCM agency 
used lead ads to co
llect over 20,000 high quality leads from people 
interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant 
ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove 
vehicle sales. The cost of a high quality lead was 9.3 times lo
wer on 
Facebook than all other online media.
 
Businesses selling products are getting search like ROI from dynamic ads. 
Dynamic ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target 
people with specific products in real
-
time. Over 300 million pe
ople see 
dynamic ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been 
uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded dynamic ads to Instagram and 
also launched dynamic ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise 
specific destinations and dates f
or hotel rooms.
 
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress 
we're making across our three priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 
million business page is advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We 
also ha
ve a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to 
mobile and to drive results for our clients.
 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their 
ongoing input, which informs our product development. I also want to 
congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank 
them for their dedication to our mission.
 
Thanks, everyone. And now here's Dave.

Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was anothe
r strong 
quarter for Facebook. Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we 
generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the 
continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength 
of our ads business as advertiser
s benefit from our increasingly broad and 
deep portfolio of targeting, creative and measurement tools.
 
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest 
in over three years in terms of absolute year
-
over
-
year growth of monthly 
and
 
daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on 
an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number 
represents 66% of 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of 
June.
 
Mobile continues to drive our growth,
 
with over 1 billion people accessing 
Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared 
to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. 
WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and
 
Instagram surpassed 500 million.
 
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP 
financial metrics and all of our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non
-
GAAP financial 
metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
 
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, 
up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rate this 
quarter as headwinds in certain currencies w
ere offset by tailwinds in others. 
U.S. and Canada, and Asia
-
Pacific were our fastest growing regions with 
advertising growth rates of 69% and 67% respectively. Mobile ad revenue 
was $5.2 billion, up 81%, and representing approximately 84% of total ad 
reve
nue.
 
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our 
growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad 
range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply side factors, 
including growth in users, t
ime spent and ad load, all contributed to our Q2 
revenue growth. In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9% while total ad 
impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven 
by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only 
show higher price 
News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads and lower priced 
right
-
hand column ads on personal computers.
 
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in 
ad impressions served in Facebook mobile News Feed
 
where the majority of 
our ads are shown. Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, 
down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue largely 
generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as 
people spend less time on th
eir PCs.
 
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of 
share
-
based compensation related expenses as well as $193 million of 
amortization of intangible assets. Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, 
representing a 43% operating ma
rgin. We continue to be pleased with the 
profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long
-
term.
 
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year
-
over
-
year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, the majority of those in 
tech
nical functions. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire 
top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
 
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion 
or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 bill
ion. Year
-
to
-
date 
capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data 
centers, servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. Facebook 
generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016. And as of 
June 30, we
 
had over $23 billion in cash and investment.
 
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We have been 
pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. 
As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the 
main drivers of our 
advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face 
tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue 
growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we 
anticipate lower 
advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter 
in 2016.
 
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow 
modestly over the next 12 months, and then will be a less significant factor 
driving revenue growth after mid
-
2017. S
ince ad load has been one of the 
important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect 
the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly.
 
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of 
t
he year, we are tightening our expense guidelines ranges. We expect that 
full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 
35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 
2016 amortization expenses to be approximat
ely $700 million to $800 
million, and full year 2016 stock
-
based compensation related expenses to be 
approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion.
 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non
-
GAAP expenses, which excludes 
stock
-
based compensation and amorti
zation, will grow in the range of 45% 
to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full 
year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion as we 
invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect tha
t 
our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
 
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the 
strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued 
broad
-
based strength of our ad business. We'
re pleased with the results, and 
we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long
-
term growth opportunities.
 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. We will now open 
the lines for a question
-
and
-
answer session. 
[Operation Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric 
Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
 
Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two. One on the video p
latform 
going forward and how you think about video as a distribution mechanism. 
How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on 
both technical infrastructure side as well as the sourcing of content type sort 
of broadened out the vid
eo offering over the next couple of years? And then 
maybe on the last comment on ad load, just wanted to go back to that for a 
minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region, because we're 
seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. 
and Canada and 
the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad 
products? Thank you so much.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and 
the ad load questi
on, and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it 
back to Sheryl. So, on the video platform, clearly, from a investment 
perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially. 
And that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billi
on of CapEx which, if you 
recall, is at the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our 
infrastructure to prepare ourself for growth across all of our different 
services. And part of that investment is really to support video. That is 
definite
ly more taxing on the network and we're investing heavily on the 
network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the 
data center, servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're 
investing in heavily and we expect to be in
vesting in heavily going forward, 
Eric.
 
And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies that 
dramatically by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. 
Really what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad dem
and across 
region. And we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front, 
but ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's 
really something that maps very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets 
per populati
on in those countries. So it's not an ad load question.
 
And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video from a content 
perspective.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
When you think about what's happening on video on our platf
orm, we're 
really excited by the production and consumption of video, and we're seeing 
the full range from people posting the things in their personal lives. The 
power of what a mobile phone can produce and distribute now is pretty 
incredible, when you com
pare it to just a few years ago, to some of the most 
sophisticated content producers in the world producing for us.
 
We're experimenting across a wide variety of things. We're doing a 
partnership with the NBA to stream some U.S. Men's Olympic team games in 
the next couple of weeks. That said, our primary focus is on short form 
content, not long form content, and we're pretty excited to see the different 
forms of content people will create, both to share messages, to create new 
content and to engage audiences
 
around the world.

The next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
 
Douglas T. Anmuth

JPMorgan Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two. First on engagement, 
obviously, the DAU and MAU numbers wer
e strong. You gave the increase in 
the daily activity as well in the double
-
digits. But can you just give us some 
color on the user trends underneath that a little bit, and more specifically 
perhaps what you might be seeing in terms of younger users in dif
ferent age 
demographics?
 
And then secondly, just going back to the ad load, we have in the past heard 
some caution from you guys before in that area, and granted it was a few 
years ago and at a much earlier stage. But I guess my question is, if 
targeting c
ontinues to improve along with click
-
through
-
rate and then 
ultimately ROI, why does ad load have to become less of a factor going 
forward? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Doug. On the DAU and MAU front, couple of thi
ngs. 
One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year
-
over
-
year on all regions, 
and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters. So, really 
good strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. We don't do 
specific break downs of those m
etrics by demographic. We're obviously 
pleased with our overall level of growth in engagement.
 
On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach 
the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very 

 
remain engage
d on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has 
evolved over the years. And in addition to Facebook, they're using 
Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So, from a teen perspective, that's 
some color there.
 
On the ad load front, ad load is definitely
 
up from where we were a few 
years ago. It has been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I 
think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving 
the quality and the relevance of the ads, as you've mentioned. And we've
 
been be able to do that without negatively impacting the user experience. 
We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall 
growth, especially after mid
-
2017.
 
The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefull
y 
tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years. 
We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about 
making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance 
of organic and ad content
. And that factors into how we think about ad load 
and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking 
about our expectation that as you get into mid
-
2017, ad load will not be a 
big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still s
ee the opportunity to 
grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook, as 
well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad 
load than Facebook.

The next question is from Brian Nowak with Morgan 
Stanley. Your line is 
open.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my question today. I have two. The first one on the U.S. 
advertising, it was up particularly strong. Any specific ad category, branded, 
direct response, et cetera, or add 
unit like video that's driving this growth in 
the U.S.? And then the second one, just on Live video, recognizing it's very 
early with Live video, but any help at all on what percentage of your users 
are engaging with Live video and the type of uplift you'r
e seeing on 
engagement? Thanks.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Our growth this quarter was very broad
-
based across all of the regions. We 
had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was 
part of the growth.
 
In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct 
response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. 
We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small 
business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly bas
is. And we're very 
focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising products. We think 
we have a good track record there.
 
We're also seeing a lot of strength in brand. And I think that's because we 
have a combination of the creative and the story t
elling, so the art with the 
science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see 
great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack In The Box use our 
Canvas ads, which are very immersive ads. They're really good for a brand 
experience,
 
to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger. They 
worked with agencies Horizon, David & Goliath and Adaptly, and they 
targeted millennials on Facebook to create two different custom audience 
groups.
 
One group was customers who had visited the re
staurant web page or 
engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that 
hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick service restaurant 
purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those 
Canvas ads, so clearly peop
le were really engaged in the brand experience 
of the ads, and they had a 13
-
point lift in add recall and a 9
-
point lift in 
purchase intent.
 
And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people 
have from brand marketers to direct r
esponse to SMBs to developers, as our 
ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurements get 
better. They have an increased opportunity to grow, and that's why we think 
our growth to
-
date continues to be broad
-
based.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief
 
Financial Officer
 
Yeah, and, Brian, I'll take the Live video question. It's hard to compete with 
the Double Jack burger. But in terms of Live video, it's really early. We're 
really excited about it in terms of it providing an authentic and real form of 
sh
aring for people, and we're really trying to give people the full range of 
tools to share what they care about with anyone that they want, and Live is 
really effective there. And we've seen experiences both in terms of a 
lighthearted like Candace Payne and
 
also more serious, more serious issues 
around the U.S. and around the globe. So it's really an important part of 
what we're offering for people to share real experiences. Video as a whole is 
making a significant contribution to time spent growth. So, when
 
we talk 
about the time spent per DAU growing worldwide across our family in 
double
-
digit percentages, video is making a contribution there more broadly.

The next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
 
Justin Post

Me
rrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.
 
Yeah, I have a couple. First, Mark, maybe on core Facebook, there's been 
commentary out there that maybe there's less personal sharing. Just maybe 
comments on the direction of Facebook? What the activities are goin
g on, 
how you feel about that? And then just about the ad loads, I mean how are 
you deciding how much ads to show? Could you hold back a bit and drive 
higher pricing? How are you balancing that? And why not hold back a little 
bit more now for longevity the
re? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. So I'll talk about sharing, and then I think Dave can probably talk 
about ad loads and pricing. So, the overall level of sharing is up on 
Facebook. And what we're see
ing is that how people share is evolving as we 
move from desktop to mobile, right. So you can imagine more photos on 
people's mobile cameras, fewer long full photo albums, more ability to 
capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile. So th
ere's this 
evolution.
 
The other thing that we see is that now people have tools to share more 
privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you 
shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you see in News Feed, 
right. So sharing wi
th all of your friends, sharing in groups on Facebook and 
public sharing, which are the trends that I was just talking about. But 
another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, 
where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we'r
e around 60 billion 
messages a day, which I think is something like three times more than the 
peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly 
and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue 
worki
ng on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to 
public, and across the spectrum from text
-
based and simple communication 
to richer type of media like photos, videos, and then, eventually, more 
immersive forms like VR.
 
David M. Wehner
 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, and Justin, in terms of ad load, we've talked about the different 
factors that go into it, obviously, just in driving the overall business. 
Advertiser demand, that was particularly strong this period, and then also 
we match
ed that with supply. And the supply 

 
the two big drivers are user 
and time spent and then ad load.
 
And getting the balance and mix right is important, and clearly, how the 
pricing plays out is via the auction. And we've had a good balance of 
demand growth
 
and supply growth, and that's led to our good strong 
financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So 
we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's 
opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we
 
look forward into 2017, we 
think it'll be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. But we still 
think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time 
spent.
 
I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load t
o drive 
pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers, 
and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI, as well as 
obviously providing better targeting and measurement tools for our 
advertisers.

The n
ext question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is

Anthony DiClemente

Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one for Mark and one for 
Sheryl. Mark, you mentioned search in your prepared
 
remarks, two billion 
searches a day on Facebook. I also noticed you said you're making it easier 
for users to connect to businesses. How far away are you from commercial 
search on Facebook being viable? Why can't you do that today? And how big 
of an oppor
tunity could commercial search be?
 
And then, Sheryl, you mentioned the expansion of the Facebook Audience 
Network. Can you talk more about the revenue opportunity of bringing 
Facebook's targeting tools to other video publishers? How fast is Audience 
Networ
k monetization growing? Is it accelerating, for example, and how do 
you see the revenue opportunity of expanding the Audience Network across 
the mobile web as well? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
I can 
take search. So when we talk about our strategy, I often talk about 
how when we develop new products we think about it in three phases. First, 
building a consumer use case; then, second, making it so that people can 
organically interact with
 
businesses; an
d then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of 
people interacting with businesses. Give businesses tools to reach more 
people and pay, and that's ultimately the business opportunity.
 
So, I'd say, we're around the second phase of that in searc
h now. You know, 
we have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and 
pages and groups that they want to get to and look at in search. One of the 
big growing use case is that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content 
in the e
cosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about, which 
helps people find more content. But certainly there's a reasonable amount of 
behavior in there which is looking for things that, over time, could be 
monetizable or commercial intent. And at
 
some point we will probably want 
to work on that, but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for 
people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses 
organically.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
On the Au
dience Network, we continue to invest in ad tech, and the 
Audience Network is a key part of our focus there. We don't break out 
revenue by our different platforms. But the opportunity to take not just 
video ads, but other ad formats we have, bring them to 
the rest of the web 
and other apps with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one. 
And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram 
and Audience Network to drive their objective in a cohesive way.
 
So to share an ex
ample, Garmin launched the Fenix 3 Sapphire watch, and 
they did it with videos ads on Facebook that worked without sound. They 
targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the 
Instagram videos with Carousel ads on Facebook that highlighte
d the 
product features.
 
Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and 
they used the Facebook Pixels to measure the incremental sales, and got to 
a 9.7 times return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you 
can take t
argeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, 
Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And 
we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better 
job of combining the interfaces. So, for example
, you can buy now in one 
interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network.
 
David M. Wehner

And then, Anthony, just one thing to add on top of that, just the 

 
we 
recognize the majority of our third
-
party advertising revenues 
of the 
Audience Network on a net rather than gross basis. So that will also 
minimize the impact that will have on the top line.

Mark, when you see the what seems like phenomenal success of Pokémon 
Go, what are your reactions to that? And then, David, could you talk about 
the monetization ramp that you're seeing on the messaging platforms? I 
know it's still very early days. Anyt
hing in there that strike you as being 
particularly substantive for material yet? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Well, I, like everyone else, am enjoying Pokémon Go. And the biggest thing 
that I think we can
 
take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in 
addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the 
mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become 
mainstream rather than glasses form factor that p
eople will wear on their 
face. So I think we're seeing this in a number of places, whether it's location 
through Pokémon or some of the face filter activity. I referenced the MSQRD 
app that we acquired earlier in my remarks. That's a kind of a fun way to 
a
ugment. You know, social experience that you're having with someone. I 
think that there's a big opportunity to build out that platform and a lot more 
functionality around that.
 
And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video 
first
, right, and as people look for richer and richer ways to express 
themselves just like people in the past just shared a lot of text and photos 
on Facebook, we think that in the future more of that is going to be video. 
And more of these augmented reality t
ools I think are going to be an 
important part of delivering that experience to making that fun to use and 
expressive as it can be.
 
David M. Wehner

Chief Financial Officer
 
And, Mark, we've talked about our strategy on how we go about monetizing 
the diffe
rent apps in our portfolio, and we usually talk about it in terms of 
three phases. Phase one is really growing the user base and engagement. 
And we're really pleased with where we are with Messenger and WhatsApp in 
that perspective with it's over 1 billion
 
monthly actives. The second phase is 
really working on buildings organic interactions between businesses and 
consumers; and then finally, the third phases is about building those 
commercial opportunities.
 
With Messenger, we're really at the beginning of p
hase two. Messenger 
today has 1 billion organic interactions between businesses and consumers 
each month. But in terms of where we are in having in terms of actual 
monetization, incredibly early on that front. We're really in the 

 
in that 
phase two where

Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering, and I guess this is
 
a follow 
up on Anthony's question. Is there a way to think about maybe the 
percentage of your kind of top 100 customers, or however you want to 
define it, that might be using FAN as an ad on to their Facebook spending? I 
guess I'm wondering if you're seei
ng increasing leverage of FAN.
 
And then the other question would just be political spending, obviously, 
wasn't a big driver for you guys in 2012, but it does seem like it is 
potentially a great opportunity in the back half of the year. I was just 
wondering
 
if you could comment on that at all. Thank you.

On the political spending, our business is broad
-
based, not that no one event 
drives our business, we're pretty large and diversified. And while the po
litical 
campaign, obviously, a lot a money is spend in ads. That's also true of an 
Olympics; it's true of a World Cup, it's also true of a Super Bowl. And so, 
with all of these events taking place around the world, there's no one event 
that we think drives
 
a huge portion of revenue.
 
That said, we are pleased by what's happened on Facebook for the elections 
cycle, not just on the paid side but actually on the organic side as well. We 
really see Facebook being embraced by politicians all over the world to get
 
in 
touch with their constituents. And we're pleased with that. Every member of 
Congress right now has a Facebook presence.
 
And we're seeing people like, one example is Elise Stefanik, the youngest 
person in the Congress. She made a pledge when she was ele
cted that she 
would explain every vote she takes, and she explains every vote she takes 
on Facebook. With shorter explanations if they're not controversial but 
longer explanations. That's the kind of mission based work that we're happy 
about because it bri
ngs people closer to the people who are representing 
them.
 
We don't break out how many advertisers are advertising on the Audience 
Network, but we're seeing solid and growing adoption of the Audience 
Network across the board, as we are with 
Instagram. And we think all of 
these platforms together really help give us the ability to serve our clients in 
a very leveraged way, and use the targeting and measurement capabilities 
we have invested in across multiple platforms.

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, some people believe that much of 
what users see in their News Feed is driven by their behavior and 
p
references. And as a consequence, the stories they end up seeing are 
always, or almost always, in line with their existing views and preferences. 
Does this phenomenon in the end increase 

 
does this phenomenon lead to 
increased adoption in use of Facebook 
creating more polarization of views 
and less effective communication, at least in some areas of people's lives? 
Mark, how do you think about this line of thought that because people see 
things that they are already in line with what they believe, communica
tion is 
hindered? Second, when it comes to video ad formats, are you 
philosophically opposed to pre
-
rolls, and if yes, why? And if not, what is 
missing for you to adopt that? Thank you.

S
o we have studied the effect that you're talking about, and published the 
results of our research that show that Facebook is actually, and social media 
in general, are the most diverse forms of media that are out there. And 
basically what 

 
the way to thin
k about this is that, even if a lot of your 
friends come from the same kind of background or have the same political or 
religious beliefs, if you know a couple of hundred people, there's a good 
chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15%
 
of 
them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are 
now going to be shown in your News Feed.
 
And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick 
a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and 
just get 100% of 
the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more 
different kinds of content through social media than they would have 
otherwise or have been in the past. So it's a good sounding theory, and I 
can get why people repeat i
t, but it's not true. So I think that that's 
something that if folks read the research that we put out there, then they'll 
see that.
 
What was the other question?
 
Unknown Speaker
 
Pre
-
roll.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Oh, pre
-
roll. I can take that one too. So we don't think it would be a good 
experience in News Feed, right, because a lot of when people are finding 
videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through News Feed, you're looking at 
what story seems interesting t
o you, which is why we did the auto play 
videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start 
experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's 
something that you're interested in.
 
But if we started playing an ad in t
he middle of a feed before you got to the 
video, then that would really go against that. I think people just would watch 
a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the 
important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really 

 
we don't need to 
do pre
-
roll because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to 
watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed and putting the ads 
in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for 
the user experie
nce.

Great. I had two product related questions for Mark. So, Mark, you guys 
mentioned when you released the latest 
Instagram MAU crossing the 500 
million mark, you give out the breakdown of U.S., international. It looks like 
U.S. has been around 100 million for about the past nine months. So is that 
just a pause along the growth path or is there something else that you
're 
seeing that's causing that growth to stall out a bit in light of what you just 
said about engagement being up since you did the algorithm reranking? Any 
color there would be helpful. And then the second question is just any 
update on Messenger M and ho
w do you see that product potentially 
impacting engagement monetization on Messenger? Thanks.

On any update on M, I can start with that one. Do you

I was going to take that one.
 
David M. Wehner

Chief Financial Officer
 
Oh. You were going to take that one? On the Instagram MAU question, I 
don't think we're breaking out by region Instagram MAU. So, no, I don't 
think there's any update there that I
'm aware of.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Okay. Yeah, so we just haven't updated that.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yeah, all right.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Yeah, so for M, we've released the Messenger platform M bot in the last six 
months 

 
F8 was the big announcement there. And I think since then, I 
think we've announced we have more than 10,000 bots in the system, which 
are basically making it so th
at different businesses can build automated 
ways to communicate with people.
 
The way we think about this experience is that, qualitatively, I don't know a 
single person really who wants to call a business to get support or interact 
with it. Whether that's 
trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting 
customer support or calling to buy something. And those are slow 
interactions. They're synchronous. They consume your whole attention while 
you're doing them. And if we can make it so that you can hav
e some of 
those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then 
just get a response back quickly, but asynchronously so it doesn't take up 
your full attention, then I think that's going to be a much better experience 
that people really 
enjoy and like.
 
So we're in the experimentation phase I think with the platform. We're 
seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out. And I personally enjoy a lot of 
the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news one 
where you get t
hese digests at the end of the day of different kinds of 
content. And between that and M, which is kind of our own internal bot that 
we're building, I think that this is going to be an interesting area to watch 
and encourage more interaction between people
 
and businesses and 
messaging.

The next question is from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
 
Benjamin Schachter

Macquarie Capital (

Couple of questions for Mark. The firs
t one, what are the lessons you're 
learning from seeing the growth of Snapchat and some of the other newer 
networks, particularly among young people? And obviously Facebook is 
continuing to do well but these things are growing. And then second, related 
to 
video, what are the key problems that you really think you need to solve 
for consumers and video producers and how is Facebook going to evolve to 
help solve those problems? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. 
And they're related. So, overall, people are spending more and more 
time on mobile, and that means that there are always more services that 
people use whether it's YouTube or there's some really interesting ones with 
younger folks, especially like musical.
ly and live.ly that I think are pretty 
interesting as well, the Snapchat, which you mentioned.
 
And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different 
ways that people want to share so many different kinds of content, ranging 
from tex
t to photo to video, just richer and richer and more immersive 
content. And also there's a range from private one
-
on
-
one type sharing to 
small groups, all of your friends at once, large interface communities, and 
then ultimately fully public. And there are
 
different apps that explore 
different regions of that space and do a good job with it, and offer ideas that 
I think the whole market needs to learn from.
 
Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to 
become video first. And 
what I mean by that is that there's this trend where 
ten years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text, and then 
we went through a phase where most of it is photos. And we really believed 
that, and call it five years, or whatever the period o
f time that it takes to get 
there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And 
that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools 
and consumption experiences for enabling that.
 
For production, I think that mean
s that you need to get the camera 
experience, and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that 
you've captured to be much better in a more central part the of the 
experience. On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like auto 
play in 
feed, but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people 
can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in 
News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I 
think you're going to see this across al
l of our apps. More focused on 
producing this kind of content, and making it first class to consume as well, 
both in private and public context. And I think that that's just a big trend 
across the market, and one of the big things that if we get right, I t
hink it's 
going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunities.

Great. Thanks. For Instant Articles, I think it went live globally for all 
publishers around the time of F8 in April. Just wondering if you can provide 
an update on the progress and how you see Instant Articles evolving over 
the next co
uple of years? And then maybe Dave, on the 49% year
-
over
-
year 
impression growth, how much of that was driven by ad loads? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
If I can take Instant Articles quickly. I think it's g
oing well. It's a good user 
experience. People like it. The hypothesis when we rolled it out was that if 
we removed the latency, which is often 10 seconds to 15 seconds of opening 
up a web view from News Feed that more people would read news. I think 
the i
nitial data suggests that that's probably true. So that's good. We're 
getting more partners on. And over the long
-
term, I think one of the big 
things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for 
engagement for our partners, but also a re
ally positive business driver for 
them too. So that's something that I'm excited about, and we'll hopefully 
have more news on that coming up.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
So, on the 49% year
-
over
-
year growth in impression, we're not providing 
a 
specific break down there. I would say that it's primarily driven by growth in 
Facebook mobile News Feed. We've talked about the drivers of supply being 
growth in DAU, growth in time spent per DAU and ad load, and obviously, 
we've given stats around roug
h stats around 

 
we've given specific stats 
around DAU. We've talked about time spent per DAU being up double
-
digit. 
So I think you can make some assumptions around that. So that's probably 
the way to triangulate on that.
 
I think we have time for one more 
question, Chris.
 
Operator

Mark A. May

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Thanks a lot. I had two as well. You probably won't give specific revenue 
numbers, but just if you'
re 

 
if you kind of, in aggregate, look at some of the 
non
-
Facebook app revenue streams, if it is FAN, Instagram, et cetera. 
Curious to get a sense of the traction and materiality of those. Would you 
expect, Dave, that in aggregate, those would become kind
 
of material, 
meaning that sort of 10% plus threshold sometime this year? Just trying to 
get a ballpark sense of the level of traction and diversification of revenue 
outside the core Facebook app. And then along the lines of your commentary 
around ad load,
 
how should we be thinking about, your MAUs are obviously 
very significant, DAU to MAU quite high. Do you continue to see that as 
being a primary driver of ad impression and ad revenue growth going 
forward as well? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief 
Financial Officer
 
Yeah, thanks, Mark. Like you said, we're not specifically breaking out 
revenue numbers. One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram is known and 
operated property is represented gross in our revenue, so whereas as I 
mentioned the Audience
 
Network is by and large going to be recognized net 
rather than gross. And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to 
appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven 
predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly maki
ng a contribution and 
as is the Audience Network.
 
In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply, so 
it certainly has been helpful. But there's also DAU growth and time spent per 
DAU growth so time spent per person. And we cont
inue to feel that there are 
opportunities to execute on those and to continue to grow inventory in that 
way. So that's where we would focus. You know, as we drive DAU faster 
than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio, but we're really focused 
on dr
iving DAU and time spent per person.

content on our platforms. People come to our services to connect with

more of those meaningful social interactions is how 
we succeed.
 
And we have a plan to further reduce the amount of harmful content. Our AI 
systems already proactively identify about 90% of hate speech that we 
remove before anyone reports it and no other i
nternet service does anything 
remotely as sophisticated as this, and we are committed to continuing to

with the Global Alliance for Responsible Media to provide gr
eater 
transparency into our measurement of hate speech numbers.
 
Some also seem to wrongly assume that our business is dependent on a few 
large advertisers. While we value every single one of the businesses that use 
our platforms, the biggest part of our bu
siness is serving small businesses. 
Our advertising is one of the most effective tools that small businesses have 

why I am often troubled by the calls to go after internet advertis
ing, 
especially during a time of such economic turmoil like we face today with 

revenue of companies like Facebook. But the much bigger cost of such a 
move would be to reduce the 
effectiveness of the ads and opportunities for 
small businesses to grow. This would reduce opportunities for small 
businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level. 
Is that really what policymakers want in the middle of a pandemic
 
and 

safe while allowing the benefits of this kind of personalized and relevant 
advertising.
 
Looking forward, I expect the rest of this year to continue to be 
unpredictable. From 
a health perspective, with COVID growing quickly in the 
U.S., there is currently no end in sight for when our teams here will be able 
to return to our offices. It is incredibly disappointing because it seems like

Thanks Mark, and hi,

I want to start by building on what Mark said about hate speech. Facebook 
stands firmly against hate. Being a platform where everyone can make their 

people to spread h



technology to find and remove hateful content and to 
protect the integrity of

Commission shows that these investments are paying off and that Facebook 
acts faster and removes a greater percentage of the hate speech on our

progress but this work is never finished. Earlier this month, 
we met with the organizers of the ads boycott and other civil rights leaders 
to listen to their concerns, and we published our civil rights audit. We were 
the first social media company to under
take an audit of this kind, an 
independent two

year review of the civil rights impact of our products and 

to meet this challenge, not because of pressure from advertisers but 
beca
use it is the right thing to do.
 
We are also working every day to support people and businesses through 
this difficult period. The pandemic is not just a public health crisis, but an 
economic crisis that has hit businesses around the world hard. I want to 
talk 
about what we are seeing in our own business and how we are supporting 
small businesses as they transition online in order to weather this storm.
 
After seeing flat year
-
over

year revenue growth in the first few weeks of 
April, we saw a considerable re
covery in May and June. Our total ad revenue 
for Q2 was $18.3 billion, which is a 10% year

year increase. This 
demonstrates not only our resilience as a company, but a wider trend that 
has been underway for some time, people are spending more and more
 
time 
online, so businesses need to be online too. This was true long before the 

in person. In the United States before the crisis, 1 in 3 companies still did 
not have a website.
 
Now more and more businesses realize they have to be 
online.
 
This month, in partnership with the World Bank and OECD, we published our 
first Global State of Small Business Report, based on a survey of more than 
30,000 small business leaders across more th

paints a sobering picture of the struggle businesses are facing, but it also 
points to the scale of the digital transformation we are witnessing. In the

than 180 million businesses use our tools every month.

our platforms to reach audiences interested in their products, and we enable

important than ever.
 
Due to social distancing restrictions, Italian coffee shop owner Nicola Taranto 
had to get creative and reimagine what a virtua
l coffee experience could look 
like. With the help of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, he promoted 
online sales and free home delivery to people interested in coffee within 10 
to 12 miles of his store and he saw a 20x return on ad spend.
 

ll businesses that have used personalized ads to help them 

the U.S., shifted its focus online and used Facebook ads targeted at adults 
within 10

15 miles of their stores to driv
e sales with curbside pickup. This is 
the type of customer acquisition that is only possible with personalized ads, 
and as a result, they saw a 24 times return on ad spend and 3 times 
increase in these sales, directly attributable to Facebook.
 
As Mark disc
ussed, regulatory and platform challenges threaten this lifeline 
for businesses, but we remain committed to doing everything we can to help 
them adapt so they can survive and thrive in the online economy. We 
recently launched the Businesses Nearby tool to 
help people find businesses 
in their neighborhoods and we continue to develop Shops to make selling 
online quick and easy.
 
We know making tools available is not enough. We also need to ensure 
business owners have the digital skills to use these tools effec
tively. In 
March, we launched our Business Resource Hub to share free training and 
resources, and since then, over 20 million people have visited. We then 
launched our Summer of Support program in June to share even more 
advice for businesses, whether or n
ot they use our services. Since launch, 
more than 15 million people have tuned in to hear practical tips for 
rebuilding and strengthening their business.
 
In addition to tools and training, businesses have told us they need direct 
financial help. In mid

Mar
ch we announced a $100 million grant program to 
help small businesses around the world. And since we opened applications 
for the program, we have seen a huge amount of interest from Black

businesses, so we know they are facing enormous challenges. Bl
ack 
businesses have faced systemic barriers for generations, and they have also 
been hit hardest by the economic impact of the pandemic.
 
Last month, we announced an additional $100 million investment in Black

owned small businesses, Black creators, and non
profits that serve the Black 
community in the U.S. Our grant program is on top of a goal we set 
previously to spend at least $1 billion with diverse suppliers next year and 

annually

are acutely aware of the responsibility we have to keep people connected 
during this turb

I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners around the world 
who continue to give us valuable feedback and hold us accountable and to

Dave Wehner
 
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone.
 
We continue to 
operate in an uncertain and challenging environment around 
the world. At the same time, we are seeing accelerated participation in the 
digital economy, and Facebook is helping alleviate the economic challenges 
associated with COVID
-
19. We are pleased to su
pport people and businesses 
through these very trying times.
 
Turning now to our results.
 
Our Q2 growth and engagement metrics reflected increased engagement 
due to the impact of the pandemic. However, as expected, we are seeing 
signs of normalization as sh
elter
-
in
-
place measures have eased around the 
world. I will provide more detail in the outlook.
 
In June, we estimate that approximately 2.5 billion people used at least one 
of our services on a daily basis, and that approximately 3.1 billion people 
used at
 
least one of our services on a monthly basis. Note that these Q2 
Family metrics reflect new data from a recent user survey and certain 
methodology improvements. Further details are included in the earnings 
slides on our IR website.
 
Facebook itself continu
ed to grow with daily active users reaching 1.79 
billion, up 12% compared to last year. DAUs represented approximately 
66% of the 2.7 billion monthly active users in June. MAUs grew by 287 
million or 12% compared to last year.
 
Turning now to the financials
.
 
Q2 total revenue was $18.7 billion, up 11% or 12% on a constant currency 
basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q2 of last year, 
total revenue would have been $297 million higher. Q2 ad revenue was 
$18.3 billion, up 10% or 12% on a cons
tant currency basis. As Sheryl 
mentioned, ad revenue growth in the quarter was stronger in May and June 
relative to April. In terms of verticals, we saw particular strength from both 
new and existing online commerce and services advertisers who primarily 
l
everage our direct response ad formats.
 
Facebook has been a lifeline of economic activity during a time when offline 
activity has been curtailed. Our growth was primarily driven by small and 
medium sized businesses around the world who leveraged our advert
ising 
platforms to connect with customers. As a result, we continue to see 
increased diversification among our advertiser base. In Q2, our top 100 
advertisers represented 16% of our ad revenue, which is a lower percentage 
than a year ago.
 
On a user 
regional basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in US & Canada, 
Asia
-
Pacific, and Europe which grew 14%, 11%, and 9%, respectively. Rest 
of World declined 6% and was impacted by challenging macroeconomic 
conditions as well as foreign currency headwinds.
 
Tu
rning now to our price and volume metrics.
 
In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services 
increased 40% and the average price per ad decreased 21%. Similar to last 
quarter, the growth in impressions was primarily driven by Facebook Mo
bile 
News Feed, due to product changes and increased engagement compared to 
last year. The decline in average price per ad was largely attributable to the 
economic impact of the pandemic, although we saw year
-
over
-
year pricing 
trends improve in the latter 
half of the quarter. Other revenue was $366 
million, up 40%, driven primarily by sales of Oculus and Portal products.
 
Turning now to expenses.
 
Q2 total expenses were $12.7 billion, up 4% on a reported basis. Excluding 
the $2 billion expense that we recorde
d in Q2 of last year related to our 
settlement with the FTC, total expenses were up 24% year
-
over
-
year, an 11 
percentage
-
point deceleration compared to Q1. The biggest factor in the 
deceleration of expense growth from the first quarter was a decline in 
peo
ple
-
related costs like travel, events and amenities as our employees 
worked almost entirely from home. By line item, the trends were as follows: 
Cost of revenue increased 16%, driven primarily by depreciation related to 
our data center spend; R&D grew 35%,
 
driven primarily by investments in 
core products as well as our innovation efforts, notably in AR/VR; marketing 
and sales grew 18%, driven primarily by consumer and growth marketing; 
and finally, excluding the FTC expense from Q2 of 2019, G&A expenses gre
w 
30%, driven primarily by higher legal expenses.
 
As Mark mentioned, we continued to invest throughout the economic 
downturn in order to build products and services for the future. We had our 
strongest hiring quarter ever in Q2, adding over 4,200 net new h
ires, 
primarily in technical functions. We ended the quarter with over 52,500 full
-
time employees, up 32% year
-
over
-
year. We are pleased with our ability to 
recruit, onboard, and retain talent in this environment.
 
Operating income was $6 billion, represent
ing a 32% operating margin. Our 
tax rate was 16%. Net income was $5.2 billion or $1.80 per share.
 
Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion driven by investments in data centers, 
servers, office buildings, and network infrastructure. Note that this is a 
decli
ne of 11% compared to last year, primarily due to a pause in data 
center construction for roughly half of the quarter due to the shelter
-
in
-
place 
measures. We have since resumed our data center construction efforts with 
proper safety precautions in place. 
In Q2, we announced a new data center 
in Illinois which will be supported by 100% renewable energy. We remain 
committed to minimizing our environmental impact and earlier this month, 
we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which is available on 
F

 
Free cash flow was $514 million and, as a reminder, this is net of the $5 
billion FTC settlement that was paid in Q2 but as previously noted was 
expensed in 2019.
 
We purchased $1.4 billion of our Class A common stock and e
nded the 
quarter with $58.2 billion in cash and investments. In July, we closed our 
investment in Jio Platforms Limited and paid approximately $5.8 billion in 
cash.
 
Turning now to the outlook.
 
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing signs of normalization in
 
user growth 
and engagement as shelter
-
in
-
place measures have eased around the world, 

Looking forward, as shelter
-
in
-
place restrictions continue to ease, we expect 
the number of Face
book DAUs and MAUs to be flat or slightly down in most 
regions in Q3 compared to Q2.
 
In the first three weeks of July, our year
-
over
-
year ad revenue growth rate 
was approximately in
-
line with our Q2 ad revenue growth rate of 10%. We 
expect our full quarter
 
Q3 year
-
over
-
year ad revenue growth rate to be 
roughly similar to this July performance. There are several factors 
contributing to this: First, continued macroeconomic uncertainty including 
the pace of recovery and the prospects for additional economic st
imulus; 
second, the expectation that some of the recent surge in community 
engagement will normalize as regions reopen; third, the impact from certain 
advertisers pausing spend on our platforms related to the current boycott 
which is reflected in our July 
trends; and lastly, headwinds related to ad 
targeting and measurement, including the impact of regulation, such as the 
California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as headwinds from expected 
changes to mobile operating platforms, which we anticipate will be 
in
creasingly significant as the year progresses.
 
Turning now to expenses.
 
We expect total expenses in 2020 to be in the range of $52 billion to $55 
billion, narrowed slightly from our prior range of $52 billion to $56 billion. 
We expect capital expenditures 
to be approximately $16 billion, at the high 
end of our previous $15 billion to $16 billion (sic) [$14 billion to $16 billion] 
range, as we have resumed data center construction efforts earlier than 
expected. However, a great deal of uncertainty remains in
 
our outlook, and 
our full
-
year capital expenditures will depend on how the pandemic impacts 
our ability to construct data centers and refresh equipment.
 
Turning now to tax.
 
We expect our full
-
year 2020 tax rate to be in the mid
-
teens, although we 
may see 
fluctuations in our quarterly rate depending on our financial results.
 
We are proud of the role that Facebook has played in keeping people 
connected during the COVID crisis and the role that we have played in 
helping businesses reach consumers online durin
g these challenging times.

the excitement about bringing more and more merchants and

and direct them to a thread where they can do commerce and messaging, 

WhatsApp as well.
 
But as 

roll that out in more places, I think that that will only grow as a trend. So,

noting, like I said in my opening re
marks, this really is primarily focused on 
small businesses, individual entrepreneurs. Small businesses are the biggest 
part of our business, not the large businesses. Of course, we want them to 
be using our platform too. We want to serve everyone. But, if
 
you as

not just this quarter, but for many years is that 
advertisers, large and small, 


advertisers as large advertisers. And certainly, large advertisers ofte
n do 
brand campaigns. But both, large and small advertisers we see on our 
platform are increasingly interested in measurable results. We also believe 
that we provide a better advertising experience for both the marketer in 
terms of ROI and the end user in 

more interested in, when the ads are more personalized. And the more 

a specific audience and I think the better they work.
 

initely seeing a trend towards, what you said in this 

any kind of measurable result. And we offer a lot of different actions you 
might want someone to take. And that is definitely
 
much more important

Could you talk about some of the potential headwinds in the secon

could impact your business? And then, on the longer term, Mark, I believe 

Asia comps. Do you feel
 
like that business is really starting to gel and 
materialize? You obviously had some positive comments. And can that be 
something that starts to contribute in two or three years? Thank you.
 
Dave Wehner
 


few factors that are obviously important in the second half. One of the things 

precisely how the overall economic climate is going to develop, but we do 
know tha
t stimulus is probably applying to some extent through to our 
business. And, the current CARES Act, for instance is expiring at the end of 

like. And to the extent that stimulus decreas
es in the future and recession 
lingers, that could impact consumer purchasing power for advertisers in 
areas like e

commerce. So, that

In addition, we did specifically call out changes on mobile operating 
platforms,
 
and that, as you correctly identified, specifically with the Apple 
latest announcement regarding iOS 14 in mind. So, this is one of the factors 
that is included in our outlook for Q3, but it really will have more of a 
pronounced impact in Q4 and beyond, g

on Facebook

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
I just wanted to dig a little deeper on some of the e

commerce topics. 
Sheryl, I know
 


there. And then, just when you think about monetization over time, do you 
expect more of that through incremental adver
tising dollars or through 
commission fees the sellers use, checkout? And then second, Mark, can you 
comment on your efforts with WhatsApp Pay in India and Brazil? And I 

those markets? Th
anks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So, we launched Shops in May, as you know, and Shops is a really 
immersive full screen storefront. So, it enables businesses to build their 

really long time, 
we exist in many ways at the top of the funnel, and we help 
drive people down. But, we are a great place on Facebook and Instagram for 

all the way through to purchase. The Shops 
helps you that on the advertiser 


seeing nice results from businesses and the people who are using these
 
shops. Our focus is getting this product experience right? And as we do, 

 
If you look into the foreseeable future or the several years future, 
advertising is such a high margin business that ob
viously it contributes much 
more to the bottom
-
line than any other fees we might charge. And I think 
we see this as really focused on increasing the experience people can have, 
going all the way through the funnel of purchase on Facebook and the 
experience
 
businesses can have, and closing that loop and selling online and 

we get from any fees charged by these services.

Okay. We can go to next question, Mike.

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali from SunTrust.
 
Youssef Squali
 

seeing just incredible growth and 
engagement is online gaming and 
streaming in particular. You guys recently got Mixer from Microsoft. It looks 
like Facebook is now firmly in third place in that market. What is your value 
proposition to gamers relative to the big competitors basically Twit
ch and 
YouTube? How do you monetize it over time? Is it, as Sheryl just talked 
about on a different topic, mostly advertising? And is it conceivable that 
gaming may become kind of the third leg of that stool, your third largest 
revenue source over time aft
er Facebook and Instagram. Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 



ributing content, 

a number of ways, which is something that is just a lot harder to do on A 
YouTube or Twitch or other products like that, even though those are also 
great products f


lot of people. So, that part is working well, too.
 
I agree with you overall that gaming is going to be increasingly impo
rtant in 
the future. The other area, of course, where we have a very large 
investment in gaming is the area around virtual and augmented reality 

from independent developers and l
arge AAA developers and increasingly 
some of the in
-


 
Dave Wehner
 
Yes. And I would just add Youssef that gaming continues to be a 
top five 
vertical for us in terms of advertising. And we saw strong growth in the 
second quarter, especially in the beginning of the quarter when prices were 
lower in the option. We saw a lot of demand from our gaming advertisers. 
And so, it was a, I think
, a good example of where the option is very 
effective at filling in. So, we continue to be important top of the funnel 
discovery for game developers around the world.

And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman 
Sach
s.
 
Heather Bellini
 
Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Most of them have been 
answered, but just a couple quick ones. Dave, I was wondering if you could 
just 
--
 
you gave us some great commentary to think about Q3. So, thank 
you for that. Just
 
wondering if you could share with us kind of pricing trends 
at the end of the quarter and into July? And also, just given the uncertainty 
on the second half of the year for all the reasons you mentioned, any 
comments you want to share with us on kind of h
ow to think about even 
qualitatively seasonality in Q4?
 
Dave Wehner
 
Hey, Heather. Yes. I mean, I think to get to the second part of your 


he macroeconomic situation 


think about. I think, clearly, e
-
commerce will continue to be really 
impo
rtant, as we go into Q4, given that big 
--
 
macro theme for us and the 
whole industry has been the strength of e
-
commerce through the second 
quarter. So, I would expect that play into the fourth quarter as well to some 
extent with the holiday season.
 
In ter
ms of pricing trends, we did see pricing improve through the quarter. 
So, early in the quarter, demand was much weaker. So, we saw pricing 
depressed throughout the world. And we saw, as I mentioned just before 
Youssef, we saw backfill with some advertisers
 
coming in and taking 
advantage of low prices for like games, e
-
commerce providers as well. And 
then, as prices improved throughout the quarter, we saw some of those 
advertisers pull back as others came into the auction and began winning 
more. But, it cont
inues to be, as noted, from the price volume metrics in the 

just from a macroeconomic perspective, concerned about that.
 
As we get further into the year as well, I do want to poin

targeting 
--
 
advertising, targeting and measurement headwinds. That will 
effects pricing as well. That will be we believe more pronounced in Q4, given 
some of the, for instance, the Apple IDFA changes, which I think could prove 
to be a cha
llenging headwind.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
I wanted to ask about the 
--
 
addressing the boycott issues. And, Mark, I 

 
--
 

on trying not to moderate too much content, trying not to be in that role. 
But, are there 
--
 

things like labeling, is that not 
addressing the issues, the concerns of some 
of the boycott participants? How hard do you think it will be to address their 
concerns? And then, I could stick on this with political advertising. I know 

terial, but the 

should be online. And I think, as far as I can tell, Facebook offers just about 
the best way to do political ad targeting, different districts, et cetera. Why 
woul

in transparency and executio

resolve it. We work across the board we have worked with and continue to 
talk to civil rights organ

with them and Mark few weeks ago. We continue to work really closely with 
other civil rights organizations, as well as our civil rights auditor on the

particularly. GARM is working with us to partner on brand safety standards

just a small part of the overall advertising landscape, even in election years.

commentary. And again, I would just point to the backdrop factors that I 
outlined in my comments in terms of things out there, including 
macroeconomic headwinds, normalization of engagement trends as COVID 
restrictions ease, boycott, and then headwinds on targeting and 
measurement.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Operator, we have time for one last question.
 
Operator
 
Your last question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik Bernstein.
 
Mark Shmulik
 
Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking t

about this little bit. But, with the WhatsApp business growing to 50 million 

astounding growth. Any color you can share on what drove that
 
growth? And 
then, secondly, as you know, as we just think about the growth kind of 
quarter to date in July, and I know you called out that the rest of the world 
was the one that declined due to structural headwinds. Any incremental 
color, you can share if
 

Thank you.
 
Dave Wehner
 
I can take the second part, I guess, first on the rest of world. So, I think 


ve just got foreign currency headwinds, particularly in 
places like Brazil. And so that played a role in the year
-
over
-
year decline in 

of online verticals, things like e
-
commer

exposed to, things like, traditional retail and brand. And with COVID, the 
online verticals performed well; and those dependent ultimately like on in 
person conversions and interactions, less so. So, I think that impacted rest 
o
f world as well.
 

played into it and gave more strength in those markets as opposed to rest of 
the world. But, that could also be part of the relative strength in more the 
develo
ped world, rather than the developing world.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 


demand for people to interact with businesses. And I think for small business 
owners in particular to have
 
some separation between their personal 
WhatsApp account and their business accounts, and some of the additional 
features and tools that you get through WhatsApp business to be able to 
connect with people and manage that a bit better. So, I think that that
 
will 
continue growing quite well. And we have a long roadmap ahead to build up 
all the different commerce features that we talked about on this call, but 

the exciting opportuniti

building for the next few years, but which we think is pretty fundamental for 
serving people and enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs around the

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today.
 
We had another good quarter. Our community continues to
 
grow around the 
world. We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook 
every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it every day. It's also great to 
see the continued growth and strength of engagement on our platform, and 
our ads growth i
s growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 
56% year over year to $7 billion, and advertising revenue was up 59% to 
$6.8 billion.
 
I want to start by talking about our work around putting video first across 
our apps. People are creating and s
haring more video, and we think it's 
pretty clear that video is only going to become more important. So that's 
why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking 
steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in 
richer 
ways.
 
One way we're putting video first is through live video on Facebook. Since 
May, the number of people going live at any given moment has grown by 
four times. And people have gone live from all seven continents and also 
from outer space.
 
Another
 
recent example is Instagram Stories, which we launched in August. 
Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their 
day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and 
disappear after 24 hours. Stories now has mo
re than 100 million daily 
actives. We also improved the Explore tab in Instagram to include more 
videos and stories, and it has 100 million daily actives now as well.
 
In addition to making it easy to share video, we also want to make it easier 
to capture v
ideo. In most social apps today, a text box is still the default 
way we share. Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we 
share. We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with a version 
that has a camera, directly just one swipe away 
from News Feed, with 
creative effects for your photos and videos. And in Messenger, we're testing 
new camera and video features. We'll be experimenting with even more 
visual messaging tools over the next few months as well.
 
So those are a few examples of s
ome of the things that we're doing to put 
video first across our family of apps. Now, I'll give you an update on our 
progress over our 3, 5, and 10
-
year time horizon.
 
Over the next 3 years, we're focusing on making our core services more 
useful and engagin
g. The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook, 
with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions. Facebook 
helped bring the world together. And athletes, fans, and media went live 
throughout the games, including athletes who went live
 
from the Olympic 
Village, and Michael Phelps, who even announced his retirement on our 
platform.
 
This election season has also driven a lot of conversation, including on 
Facebook, where we've made it easier for voters and candidates to 
communicate with ea
ch other. In the first nine months of this year, 109 
million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, 
comments, and likes and shares related to the election. During the primaries 
and in September, we also added a Register to Vote li
nk at the top of our 
Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to 
vote, some who were registering for the first time. Facebook really is the 
new town hall, and we're proud of the role that we've played in enabling 
dialogue an
d increasing civic engagement. That's the 3
-
year update.
 
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around 
products that a lot of people already use every day. Instagram, Messenger, 
and WhatsApp each have large communities, but we have 
a lot more work to 
do on all of them. I think about our progress here in three phases. The first 
phase is building a great consumer experience and getting it to scale. The 
second phase is about enabling people to organically interact with 
businesses. And t
hen the third phase is to give businesses tools to reach 
more people, and that's where we build our business.
 
Right now, Instagram has moved into that third phase. Instagram has more 
than 500 million monthly actives and more than 300 million daily actives.
 
We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use 
Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few 
minutes.
 
Messenger is early in the second phase. We're helping businesses and 
consumers increasingly interact in richer wa
ys. Today there are 33,000 bots 
live on Messenger. We also launched Messenger Lite, which is designed to 
make messaging fast and easy with a wide variety of Android phones and for 
people who are on slower networks as well.
 
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp 
already, but we're going to really start 
working on the second phase in the next year. Right now, we're testing new 
camera features and we're continuing to keep features fast and reliable on 
multiple devices and every network condition.
 
Finally, we're star
ting to build communities around completely new apps. 
This quarter, we launched Workplace to help make organizations more 
connected and productive. Workplace is a communications platform that 
uses features that people know, like News Feed, groups, and mess
ages to 
help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do 
everywhere else. Already, more than 1,000 organizations are using 
Workplace, including Starbucks, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Danone, and 
we're adding more all the time.
 
We're also g
etting new services to scale in the core app. In October, we also 
launched the Marketplace tab to help people discover, buy, and sell things 
with people in their community. While we just launched Marketplace, many 
millions of people have been buying and se
lling things in Facebook for
-
sale 
groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going 
forward.
 
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms 
and technologies that will connect more people and more place
s and allow 
everyone in the world to have a voice. We focused our long
-
term innovation 
roadmap around three areas: connectivity initiatives that bring more people 
online; artificial intelligence; and virtual and augmented reality.
 
On connectivity, through 
our efforts with internet.org, we've connected 40 
million people, based on our best estimate. And we're making good progress 
with our Express Wifi program, which empowers entrepreneurs to build a 
business by providing their community with access to the Int
ernet.
 
On artificial intelligence, we're starting to see the impact that AI can have on 
enhancing people's experiences on Facebook and showing them more of 
what they care about. More than 40 teams at Facebook and more than 25% 
of our engineers are already 
using AI to power the products and services 
they build. We've made changes and improvements to our AI in order to 
filter out misleading clickbait stories from News Feed. And we're using AI to 
help find terrorist propaganda on Facebook. It's still early, bu
t we think that 
AI will help improve the quality of what people see and can share on our 
platform.
 
We also took some important steps forward on virtual reality to help people 
experience the world in richer and more immersive ways. At Oculus Connect, 
we ann
ounced that touch controllers for Rift will ship in early December with 
35 games and experiences exclusively built for touch. And since we believe 
the next phase of VR is great software experiences, we're investing another 
$250 million in virtual reality c
ontent on top of the money that we've already 
invested.
 
So this was a very busy third quarter, and 2016 is shaping up to be a year of 
important progress for Facebook. Our business is performing well. And while 
I'm happy about what we've 
accomplished, we're really just getting started. 
We want to continue to invest aggressively to accomplish our goals, which is 
why we're hiring, especially in engineering, which is going to be one of our 
top priorities going into 2017, and Dave will say mor
e about this in his 
remarks.
 
Everything we do is about opening the world to everyone and helping more 
people to connect and share. So I want to thank our entire community, all of 
our teams, our partners, and our shareholders for being a part of this 
journe
y with us.
 
Now, here's Sheryl.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
 
We had a great third quarter. Q3 ad revenue grew 59%. Mobile ad revenue 
reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year
-
over
-
year, and was approximately 84% of 
total ad re
venue. Our growth was broad
-
based across all regions, marketer 
segments, and verticals. In Q3, we announced that we have over 4 million 
active advertisers on Facebook and over 500,000 active advertisers on 
Instagram. The number of advertisers on both platf
orms continues to grow 
quickly, and we're pleased to see more and more of them using the full 
range of our ad products.
 
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to 
mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products
; and 
making our ads more relevant and effective.
 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile, people have shifted to mobile, and 
we remain focused on helping businesses catch up. We know that marketing 
shifts take time. The first TV ads showed people stand
ing in front of 
microphones reading their radio ads. Similarly, many of the first mobile 
video ads were TV ads dropped into mobile. Ads optimized for each platform 
often perform better, so marketers are increasingly tailoring their creative 
for mobile.
 
We'
re excited to see the world's largest advertisers realize that the small 
screen is big. In September, P&G Chief Brand Officer, Marc Pritchard, GM 
CEO, Mary Barra, and I addressed the Adweek audience together. Marc 
described how P&G is creating mobile video
 
ads designed to grab attention 
in the first few seconds. He shared the example of Tide. In a typical TV ad, 
they start with a clean dress or shirt, show it getting stained, and then 
cleaned it with Tide. On mobile, they need to communicate the product's 
v
alue more quickly, so they start by showing Tide cleaning a stained 
garment.
 
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads. In Q3, GM 
subsidiary, Holden, used carousel ads with video to maximize its sponsorship 
of Australia's premier rugby tourna
ment. Holden created a video series 
about their support of the youth rugby. The ads generated an 8
-
point lift in 
brand favorability for the overall audience and a 15
-
point lift amongst their 
target audience of women over 35.
 
For many small businesses, the 
shift to mobile means leveraging video for 
the very first time. Rather than needing a camera crew and production 
budget, anyone with a smartphone can shoot a video and share it on 
Facebook. In the past month alone, over 3 million small businesses have 
post
ed a video on Facebook, including organic posts and ads.
 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad 
products. We continue to focus on our advertiser pipeline. In Q2, we 
announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Faceboo
k Pages 
product each month. And we introduced the Instagram equivalent, Business 
Profiles, which are being used by 1.5 million businesses.
 
On past calls, I talked about product simplification as a driver of advertiser 
growth on Facebook. Now with the launc
h of Promoted Posts, we are seeing 
that on Instagram too. Like Boosted Posts on Facebook, Promoted Posts on 
Instagram are an easy way to start advertising, and we're pleased with the 
adoption.
 
Over 85% of business pages are active on mobile, so we're makin
g it easier 
for advertisers to manage campaigns from their phones. In Q3, we added a 
feature that shows marketers a preview of a potential ad in News Feed, just 
as their customers would see it. They can then run the ad with just a few 
taps from their mobil
e device.
 
Making it easy to advertise from a mobile phone is especially important in 
emerging markets. For businesses operating in areas with weak network 
connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our 
low bandwidth app, and ar
e making more of them available offline.
 
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is 
to be the number one driver of growth for our clients. In Q3, we introduced 
tools to help businesses find people around the world who loo
k like their 
current customers and target the ones most likely to convert. For example, 
SA Company, an outdoor gear and apparel business started by a young man 
out of his parents' home, used international Lookalike targeting to reach 
customers in 32 countr
ies and increase sales by 37%.
 
We're focused on driving purchases online and in stores. In Q2, we launched 
Estimated Store Visits, which show advertisers how many people came to 
their store after seeing an ad. And this quarter, we made it possible for 
adve
rtisers to optimize campaigns for in
-
store visits. We also expanded 
Dynamic Ads, a proven way to drive online sales for in
-
store retail 
objectives. Businesses can use Dynamic Ads for Retail to show people the 
products available at their closest location in
 
real time and reach people 
likely to visit their stores.
 
To prove the value we're driving for our partners, we continue to invest in 
measurements. This quarter we announced new third
-
party partnerships 
with Nielsen DataLogix, Visual IQ, and MarketShare to
 
help our clients 
measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
 
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and remain 
focused on helping them make the shift to mobile. With only a small fraction 
of businesses on Facebook and Instagram a
dvertising, we have a lot of 
opportunity in front of us. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our 
partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses.
 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and 
congratulate o
ur global teams on the results of their continued focus and 
dedication.
 
Thanks, and now here's Dave.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone.
 
Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Total revenue grew 56% and 
excee
ded $7 billion for the first time. And we delivered $2.4 billion in GAAP 
net income, up 166%. We saw healthy growth and engagement in our 
community as well as broad
-
based strength in our mobile ads business.
 
Let's start with our community metrics. In Septe
mber, 1.18 billion people 
used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last 
year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.79 billion people that used 
Facebook in the month of September. Mobile continues to drive our growth, 
with 1.0
9 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in 
September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
 
Turning now to the financials, my comments today will focus on our GAAP 
financial metrics, and all of our comparisons a
re on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non
-
GAAP financial 
metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
 
Q3 total revenue was approximately $7 billion, up 56%. Q3 ad revenue was 
$6.8 billion, up 
59%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall growth this 
quarter, as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in 
others. Asia
-
Pacific and North America were our fastest growing regions, 
with ad revenue growth rates of 64% and 62% respecti
vely. Ad revenue 
grew at a rate of 50% or more in all regions in Q3. Mobile ad revenue was 
$5.7 billion, up 70% and representing approximately 84% of total ad 
revenue.
 
On prior calls, we discussed the supply and demand factors that drive our 
mobile ads bus
iness. As Sheryl noted earlier, advertiser demand remained 
strong in Q3 across all geographies, verticals, and marketer segments. We 
also benefited from growth in users, time spent, and ad loads. It is worth 
noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which i
s higher than growth rates 
in recent quarters, and was aided by our efforts to limit the impact of ad 
blockers on advertising served via web browsers.
 
Our price/volume trends were similar to those we reported last quarter. The 
average price per ad 
increased 6% in Q3, while total ad impressions 
increased 50%. The reported increase in price continues to be driven by the 
ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher priced feed 
ads. Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ad
s on 
Facebook and Instagram.
 
Payments and other fees revenue was $195 million, down 3%. Payments 
and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal 
computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
 
Q3 total expens
es were $3.9 billion, up 28%. This includes $839 million of 
share
-
based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes as well as 
$195 million of amortization of intangible assets.
 
In Q3, we hired over 1,200 people and ended the quarter with 
approximately
 
15,700 employees, up 31% compared to last year. We 
remain committed to investing aggressively in hiring, including expanding 
our technical and recruiting teams globally.
 
Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, representing a 45% margin. Our tax 
rate was 25%
. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion or $0.82 per share.
 
Q3 capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. Year to date through September, 
capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, up 76%, driven by investments in 
data centers, servers, office buildings, and network 
infrastructure. In 
addition to our new data center projects in Texas and Ireland, we recently 
broke ground on our seventh data center facility in New Mexico, which we 
anticipate will come online in late 2018.
 
We generated approximately $2.5 billion of free
 
cash flow and ended the 
quarter with $26.1 billion in cash and investments.
 
Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2016, first, some color on 
revenue. We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 
as we lap a strong fourth qu
arter in 2015. We also continue to expect that 
our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in 
the fourth quarter of last year.
 
Turning now to the 2016 expense outlook, based on our year
-
to
-
date results 
and our updated view of 
the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our 
expense guidance ranges. We now expect that full
-
year 2016 GAAP expense 
growth will be at the lower end of our prior range of 30% to 35%. We expect 
full
-
year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $70
0 million to 
$800 million and that full
-
year 2016 share
-
based compensation expenses to 
be approximately $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. Accordingly, we anticipate that 
our total non
-
GAAP expenses, which exclude those share
-
based 
compensation and amortization
 
expenses, will grow in the range of 40% to 
45%, down from our prior range of 45% to 50%.
 
We anticipate full
-
year capital expenditures to be approximately $4.5 billion, 
as we invest aggressively to support the rapid growth of the business. We 
expect that o
ur Q4 and full
-
year 2016 tax rates will be in line with the year
-
to
-
date tax rates.
 
I also wanted to provide some brief comments on 2017. First on revenue, as 
I mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect that ad load will play a less 
significant factor 
driving revenue growth after mid
-
2017. Over the past few 
years, we have averaged about 50% revenue growth in advertising. Ad load 
has been one of the three primary factors fueling that growth. With a much 
smaller contribution from this important factor goi
ng forward, we expect to 
see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
 
Secondly on expenses, though it is premature to provide specific expense 
guidance, as Mark mentioned, we anticipate 2017 will be an aggressive 
investment year. Adding top engineer
ing talent remains one of our key 
investment priorities as we continue to execute on our 3, 5, and 10
-
year 
roadmap. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology 
talent, both in the Bay Area and beyond. In addition, we expect to grow 
capital expenditures substantially, as we continue to fund the ongoing data 
center expansion effort that we have underway.
 
Finally, I wanted to share some plans on the use of cash starting in 2017. 
Beginning in January, we intend to fund withholding taxes 
due on employee 
equity awards via net share settlement rather than our current approach of 
requiring employees to sell our shares of common stock to cover taxes upon 
vesting of such awards. We expect this change will increase our cash 
outflows and correspo
ndingly result in less dilution. If we had used this 
approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately 
$1.8 billion in the year through September.
 
To wrap things up, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Our results 
reflected 
the continued growth in engagement of our community around the 
world and the strength of our mobile ads business.
 
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Your first question comes from the 
line of Brian Nowak with 
Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
 
Brian Nowak 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one, the past couple 
quarters you've given us a metric on the growth in time spent per user 
across the 
three big platforms. Any update at all on that around this quarter 
and what you're seeing?
 
And then the second one, just on the Instagram Stories 100 million DAUs, 
any help at all on what the demographics or the age of those people look 
like? And how do yo
u think about engagement of those users? Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I can take the first one, Brian, on the time spent metric. We're pleased with 
the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook 
family of apps. And that 
includes the Facebook mobile app, where we saw 
good year
-
over
-
year growth in time spent per DAU. Their video is making a 
big contribution to time spent growth, but we are not providing a specific 
stat on time spent growth on an ongoing basis.
 
Sheryl K. San
dberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
We're also not providing a specific breakdown of the DAU growth in 
Instagram Stories, but we're really excited about the engagement with the 
product and how it's growing across the board.
 
Operator
 
The next question is from Eric Sheri
dan with UBS. Your line is open.
 
Eric J. Sheridan 
-
 
UBS Securities LLC
 
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe one for Sheryl and one for Dave. 
Sheryl, on local business and small business, as you continue to see success 
there, I wondered if we could get 
increased color on what you're seeing from 
an adoption curve on business pages. What are people looking for in terms 
of measurement attribution? What's Facebook delivering for those 
advertisers? Any color there would be very, very helpful.
 
And then, Dave, 
as we try to digest some of the comments you made about 
ad load and revenue as we exit 2016, go to 2017, how should we also be 
thinking about the mix of ad units as you continue to see more e
-
commerce 
and video in the platform? And how should we be thinkin
g about the pricing 
of ad units as that mix changes over time? Thanks so much, guys.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
On local, we think this is a really big opportunity, and you see this in the 
large base of existing businesses using Facebook and Insta
gram 
increasingly. There are 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 
1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the similar, the equivalent 
for Instagram.
 
And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and 
har
d to have your own mobile site or your own even webpage. Thirty
-
five 
percent of small businesses in the United States, which is the most 
developed market in many cases, don't even have a webpage of any kind. 
And it's cheaper and easier to build a webpage t
han it is to build a mobile 
app and get distribution or downloads.
 
And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook 
business pages and increasingly the Instagram business profile as their 
mobile presence, and we think that's what's work
ing. And then we're 
working hard to build products that work, in
-
store visits, and then to use 
simplified ad products that convert them over to advertising.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Eric, it's Dave. Just really reiterating what I said last quarter 
about our 
expectations on ad load going into mid
-
2017, it's been one of the key factors 
in terms of driving growth along with time spent 

 
user growth and time 
spent growth and advertiser demand. So we continue to see good 
opportunities to grow time spent,
 
continue to see good opportunities to grow 
users, and we continue to see good opportunities to grow advertiser 
demand.
 
On that latter point, really the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing I 
think really well. We're developing a number of new ad pr
oducts as well as 
enhancing the ad products that we have out in the market today. So we're 
taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and 
making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there 
will continue to ena
ble us to drive advertiser demand. So those key factors 
will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year. So what I'm specifically 
talking about is ad load and our anticipation that it's going to be a less 
significant factor as we get into mid
-
2017.

The next question is from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is 
open.
 
Anthony DiClemente

Nomura Securities International, Inc.
 
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. For Mark, in terms of video 
and your broader media content strate
gy, just trying to think about your 
investment in Facebook Live, and then trying to frame that against 
investments in I guess non
-
live forms of video, such as maybe short form, 
prerecorded, professional content. So how do you weigh investing in live 
versus
 
let's call it on
-
demand content?
 
And maybe a related question would be, FOX Sports and Sports Illustrated 
are co
-
producing some original content for Facebook Live. I think they're 
doing a pregame show ahead of the big game tonight. So that seems like, in 
some ways, it's an entree into sports perhaps for Facebook. Could you give 
us an update on whether or not you see any advantage or any benefit in 
licensing sports content over time versus having one of the publishers do it 
on the Facebook platform? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So there was a lot in there, and I'll address most of it. The video
-
on
-
demand content is the vast majority of video that is both shared and 
consumed on Facebook, not live video, but live is growing very quickl
y. And 
part of the reason why we're investing in it is we see that video as a medium 
is not only in the future going to be about people producing content that 
looks like traditional content and then consuming it in a static rectangle 
video screen.
 
So live 
video we think represents an example of something new, which is 
video which is a medium for doing something that's really interacting with 
other people. Whether you're a public figure that is using it to hold a town 
hall or interact with a lot of people at
 
the same time, or you're hanging out 
with your friends by going live and you have 10 people who are just there 
with you chatting with you while you're doing something, going about 
throughout your day, it's not the kind of traditional video experience; it'
s 
actually a more social experience.
 
I think 360 videos in another way are another example of this kind of 
interactive video experience, and my guess will be that we will see more 
different kinds of video media as time goes on. I think Stories is another 
e
xample of this. We're seeing it with Instagram Stories and with Messenger 
and the initial test that we have with Messenger Day, where that is another 
interesting format for how you can put videos together. And I think that's 
going to be more and more.
 
But 
to put that all in context, the majority of consumption today is video on 
demand. We are very interested in making sure that the business model that 
we have works for folks who produce content as their business to make sure 
they can make money from it, so 
that their best content comes on 
Facebook. So it's going to be a lot of growth in all of these things across all 
our family of apps.

Thanks a lot. I think the first one is for Mark. When you went mobile
-
only or 
started this concept, you had to tweak the app because it wasn't necessarily 
optimized for mobile. As now you begin to move to more of a video first 
approach, what needs to 
happen to the Facebook app both from a 
consumer
-
facing and from an ad tools perspective to make sure that you're 
optimized for video? What needs to change?
 
And then I think the next question is for Dave. As the rate of growth in ad 
loads slows and also as 
you continue to enhance targeting and as more 
video advertisers come onto Facebook, would you expect that eCPMs will 
rise and offset part, if not all, of this impact of the ad loads slowing? Thanks.

So I can talk abo
ut shifting to put video first across our whole family. There 
are two broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. One are 
to the capture and sharing tools that we offer. So the example of that is the 
new camera that we're working on and all th
e creative tools around that. 
And then on the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to 
deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly.
 
So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now, it's 
that fundamentally th
e mobile networks are getting to a point where a large 
enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a 
video. If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News 
Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watc
hed it, which 
wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people 
shared. But now it loads instantly. You can take a video and upload it 
without having to take five minutes to do that, so it's a good experience.
 
So we're very focused
 
on creative tools. You can see that a little bit in the 
announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with 
Messenger and some of the additional tests on Facebook and the camera 
work that we're doing in WhatsApp. So this is across the w
hole family of 
apps. This is a big part of the product experience that we want to deliver.
 
And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive 
technically. So there aren't that many companies that can do this at the 
scale that 
we're talking about, and this has been a big advantage for us. In 
rolling out things like Live, we've had this infrastructure that we've been 
building out for a decade all around the world, and that allowed us to build a 
product like Live where someone has
 
to stream something live from their 
phone to potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the world. 
From a phone, that's a difficult scaling problem. So we've been able to build 
that up, not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and 
infrastructure here, but because we're building on this strong base.
 
That goes not only for just being able to deliver the content, but being able 
to understand what it is so we can rank it in News Feed better and show 
people the right content. But all of 
these things are going to be part of a 
cohesive experience to get behind our community. And when people are 
ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and 
consuming content, we're going to be there ready.

Mark, on ad load growth slowing and the impact on effective CPMs, I think 
when you look at our business, demand has been one of the key factors 
driving growth. So we've built up a large base of advertiser demand. We've 
got 4 million advertisers on Faceb
ook; 0.5 million advertisers on Instagram. 
We continue to innovate on the products to make them more effective and 
make this a great gateway for businesses to come onto Facebook and come 
into mobile and spend. And we expect we've got a lot of great opportu
nities 
to continue to innovate on that front. But we've also been innovating over 
the past several years. So demand has been a big factor in what's been 
driving our growth to date. On top of that, we've grown users and time 
spent, and then we've also grown
 
ad load.
 
So I do think as we look into 2017, we do expect that as you get to mid
-
2017, ad load will be a less significant factor contributing. We'll continue to 
get benefits of being able to grow our revenue with advertiser demand and 
continuing to innova
te there. But I do think that as we slow ad load growth, 
we're going to have a slowing in revenue as well. So that's our expectation, 
but obviously we're going to continue to work hard to innovate in the ad 
product space.

Okay, two questions. A product question for Mark, in trying to 

 
you're 
talking about some of these features and making the camera more of a 
central way of co
mmunicating on Facebook. How long do you think the 
iterations or the testing is going to go until, as an average user, I would 
notice that in my News Feed? Like I do see much more prevalence of live 
video, and it doesn't seem to me yet a perfect experience
. But just in terms 
of other features and putting the camera at centerpiece, do you think this is 
something that's going to be obvious to people in the next year, couple of 
months? Just what's the timing of the innovations?
 
And then real quickly, MAU growt
h seemed to accelerate in both Asia and 
rest of world. Any color on what would have caused that or any particular 
markets? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
I can take the MAU growth first, and then Mark can talk about camera. On 
the MAU front, w
e're seeing very strong overall growth in terms of the 240 
million
-
plus MAUs that we added.
 
If I was to point to 

 
there's really no single driver, but I'll point to a few 
that contributed. And it also plays into the fact that we're seeing good 
growth in p
laces like India, Mexico, Brazil, and others. First, we're improving 
our Android experiences, and we've talked about the impact that Facebook 
Lite has had on that, just making easier registration processes, just making 
Android 

 
our lightweight Android app
 
easier to use. Secondly, Mark talked 
about the internet.org efforts that we have. That's been a contributing factor 
to MAU growth. And then finally, we're seeing the introduction of low
-
priced 
data plans in markets like India and Mexico contributing. So t
here's no single 
factor, but those are all contributing factors in terms of MAU growth.
 
And then, Mark, do you want to talk about the camera?
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure. So we already rolled out the first test of the new camera in Ireland
. 
And we're a company that believes in testing things and getting feedback 
from our community before we roll it out broadly. We think we have a lot to 
learn. And the methodology of how we develop is we try to build things 
quickly. And rather than just rely
ing on our own intuition, although we do 
rely on that a lot, we will try to put it out in the market and get feedback 
and then roll it out from there. So we rolled out what we believe is a good 
experience in Ireland. They were the first part of the communi
ty to get 
access to these new features. And then from there, we'll start to roll it out 
broadly across the world, hopefully sooner rather than later.
 
Same thing on the Messenger side, as I mentioned, these products around 
my day, it's a similar video mediu
m to Instagram Stories and a similar 
camera to what we're building in the Facebook app as well. And that we 
rolled out in a few countries as well. And similarly, based on the feedback 
that we're getting, I would expect that we'll be rolling that out pretty
 
widely 
across the world soon as well.

Mark and then o
ne for Sheryl. Mark, how do you think about, whether with

some of the puts and takes there between those two?

arketers 
using Facebook more to complement TV and what it would take to shift 
dollars over in a bigger way going forward? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebook, Inc.
 
So in the main Facebook app, we're doing a number of different things. One 
is that vid
eo is naturally becoming a larger share of the content in News 
Feed because both people and pages are sharing more videos as a mix and 
people want to consume that content. So there's not really a question of 
whether that should be a separate app. This is w
hat people want News Feed 
to be increasingly, so this is what it will become.
 
There is a second experience called Video Home, which we started talking 
about earlier in the year. and we've rolled out again in a few markets, and 
those tests have gone well. S
o we're also hoping to roll that out pretty soon 
widely. And that's the new experience, which if you come to Facebook and 
you specifically want to watch some different kinds of videos or you want to 
see what videos a recent page that you follow has posted 
or the Presidential 
debate is on and you want to find a good place to go online to get that, you 
can go to Video Home and see that.
 
That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of 
Facebook is a great way for people to see it and 
get exposure to it, and we'll 
see where that goes over time. I think it's a good experience inside 
Facebook, but we also have had examples over time, like Messenger for 
example, where we started it in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill 
their pot
ential, it needed to be its own experience over time. So we'll look at 
all those options, but for now I really think that Video Home is going to be a 
great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out.

When we think abou
t video ads and what platform they run on, we really 
believe that over time the dollars will shift with eyeballs, and our goal is to 
be the best dollar and the best minute people spend measured across 
channels.
 
It's definitely true that most of our 
advertisers are advertising on TV and 
advertising with us on mobile, and they should be. And we've done studies 
that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really big complement to TV, 
particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and 
you 
can't reach.
 
I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting. And 
what we're seeing is big brand advertisers, and this is actually particularly 
strong growth. This quarter was particularly strong for brand, are really 
recognizin
g that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would 
do on TV, but make them much more targeted.
 
So for example, Nestlé Purina PetCare did an ad campaign in Germany with 
ZenithOptimedia, and they defined five distinct cat owner personality typ
es 
and created different creatives for each group. So that's a big brand thing. 
The cat food category is big and they want brand awareness. But rather than 
just run one ad, they were able to run five based on the interest base and 
personality targeting tha
t really only we can do. And the results were 
amazing. They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in 
sales. And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV, 
but an ability to target much more efficiently.

Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
 
Great, I just have one for Mark. Any update on the revenue ideas for 
Messenger that might be getting traction? I know it's still early day
s, but any 
early indications there? And based on the three phases you laid out earlier in 
the call, when can we expect Messenger to move into Phase 3? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
So I'd say we're pretty early in Phase 2. Just to reca
p the framework that we 
have here, the strategy is there are three phases for that. We build and then 
build businesses around these apps.
 
The first is build an experience and get it to scale, to build a community that 
can get to hundreds of millions or 1 b
illion people or more. The second 
phase is help people not only interact with the people they care about, but 
also the businesses and other public entities that they care about as well. 
And then the third phase is once there's good organic interaction betw
een 
people and those businesses, give those businesses tools that they can pay 
for to reach more people and amplify those interactions.
 
So I mentioned this stat earlier that we have about 33,000 bots that are live 
in Messenger, including experiences across
 
a range of verticals, from news 
to e
-
commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things, and 
we're seeing some early progress. I'd say we're still pretty early on in 
getting this to be widely rolled out. I think we're going to need many more 
t
han 33,000. And the number of people using them, I think it's still pretty 
early in terms of there are more than 1 billion people using Messenger, so 
we need to get that rolled out pretty widely. So I'm not sure that I have an 
answer for you just yet on ex
actly when we're going to move to the third 
phase.
 
The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through 
Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them 
advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is di
fferent 
from the long
-
term vision that we have here around creating interactions 
that start in Messenger. I think that that will ultimately be most of the value 
that's generated. But in the near term, what we've found is that a lot of 
businesses are creati
ng ads in News Feed that then they can follow up and 
do transactions with people in Messenger, and I think that's going to be 
pretty meaningful over the next few years.

Great, thank you. I just had a couple questions left. One, I was just

the p
ayment ecosystem and how that might evolve over time. And also, if

Thank you.

In terms of payments, we really see payments as primarily a way to enforce 
the other activities we want to see on Facebook and Instagram. So 
payments enable advertisers to pay us. We are using payments in some of 
our other products in ways that enable 
some of the interactions we want to 
see.
 
When we think about Instagram Shopping, it's very early tests, but it really 
follows the kinds of things we do in other areas of our products and services, 
like Messenger. What we see is that people in Instagram are
 
using 
Instagram to browse for products and make those connections, and so we 
then make the product investments to make those a little bit easier. 
Similarly, to some of the things we've done in Messenger, some of the things 
we've done in Marketplace, we're
 
watching for what is the organic activity 
between businesses and consumers, and then we're building products to 
enhance and enable that organic activity.

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, one for Sheryl. Sheryl, you 
guys have talked about your top verticals as being e
-
commerce, CPG, 
entertainment media, and gaming. And despite your really significant 
growth, I can think of some categories where you've got some more 
considered purchases where you're probably punching below your weight in 
terms of share, so auto, telecom, travel, financial services. I'm wondering if 
you could talk a little bit about some
 
of the unique challenges with those 
verticals and how you guys are attacking them. Thanks so much.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
You have our top verticals correct, and we see a lot of strong growth in 
those verticals. Our top verticals this time ar
e e
-
commerce, CPG, retail, and 
entertainment media. We do see growth in the other verticals as well. You're 
right that historically it took us a longer time to break into some of these, 
particularly travel and auto were things that took us longer, but we a
re 
seeing some really nice traction.
 
I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at 
Adweek, and we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but 
really use the platform. So earlier this year, they rolled out a car a
t CES on 
Facebook video rather than at a car show. And that was a big moment for 
us, I think, in the auto vertical. And we continue to work with them and lots 
of other partners.
 
Measurement is really key there. The better we can do with dealers and with 
au
to manufacturers at measuring all the way through the purchase, the 
better off we are. And I think they know that people are doing the research 
for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on 
their mobile phone, and they want us 
to be part of that.
 
Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in. We 
have rolled out different types of product ads that we think will help. So in 
Q2, we rolled out Dynamic Ads that were specifically focused on the travel 
verti
cal, and I'll share one example.
 
Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and 
Instagram to increase their online bookings. They worked with one of our 
FMPs, StitcherAds, and they created custom audiences who viewed 
specific 
itineraries by date. So they look for people that at a certain date have used 
specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads which showed the 
available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. They saw a three 
times increase in their onli
ne bookings and I think those kind of results are 
made possible by more vertical
-
specific products, and we're going to 
continue to invest there.

Hi, thanks for taking my call. Dave, could you clarify a bit on investment 
year, what that means? Does that mean expenses growing faster than 
revenues? And then I think Mark mentioned $250 million on content for 
VR. 
Anything else in there that we should be thinking about? And then maybe 
one housekeeping, ad blocking, could you quantify how much that might 
have helped desktop revenues? Thank you.
 
David M. Wehner

Facebook, Inc.
 
Justin, just on investment year, I'm
 
not giving specific commentary around 
revenue growth versus expense growth. What I wanted to provide was just 
some color around our thinking about investment going into 2017. 
Obviously, on the CapEx side, we've got a number of projects underway on 
the dat
a center front. So clearly on that front, we've got a lot of projects 
that are going to need ongoing funding going into 2017, so that we've got 
good visibility on.
 
In addition, while it's too early to give specifics, I want to give some 
directional color a
round expense growth. We've already invested in 
accelerating our recruiting efforts, so I wanted to highlight that. That's 
primarily around technology, technical recruiting, software engineering, and 
we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in 
the long
-
term growth 
of the business. And so that's our plan going into 2017.
 
On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that this 
quarter we had 18% year
-
over
-
year desktop revenue growth. If you look at 
recent quarters, it was about ha
lf of that growth rate on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis. So that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is 
largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking. So that's 
what led to the acceleration of desktop revenue growth.

Thanks. You've been tweaking the News Feed algorithm to prioritize friends

seeing there. And is it driving more engagement and more sharing of 
originals? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-

Sure. So News Feed is an ongoing work that we're always improving. What 
we basically are trying to do is work on over time 
adding more and more 
signals to the News Feed model to help us fully value what people in the 
community value about the different content that we show them. So what 
we realized was that the model that we had previously didn't fully capture 
the nuance in ho
w people preferred certain content from friends and family. 
So we ran a bunch of qualitative studies and talked to a bunch of people and 
incorporated those signals into the model, and that has had the result that 
the people in our community who gave us tha
t feedback and who we worked 
with on this, what we had expected in terms of both increasing the quality of 
the content that people see, and therefore also enabling people to share 
more with their friends and the people that they want.
 
But one thing that I 
would clarify is that I think sometimes people 

 
in your 
framing of your question, you asked if we had tweaked News Feed to do this 
or that. This is an ongoing iterative process. We're constantly learning about 
what our community wants, and we will constan
tly be trying to incorporate 
new information and signals into the models to help value all of the content 
in the system as accurately as possible. The biggest job that we have is to 
show people in the community what's going to be meaningful and important 
t
o them, and that is our goal in all of these changes.

Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Facebo
ok, Inc.
 
I did not fully understand the first question, so I'm going to talk about our AI 
work overall. In general, what we want to do is try to understand the 
content that people are sharing and that's out there for them to see as best 
as possible. So for
 
example, that means being able to read and understand 
news articles or posts that people make or messages that a person might 
send to a business so we can help that business auto
-
reply to them and get 
information back to the person really quickly, or unde
rstand the content so 
we can better understand what might be interesting to a person and show it 
in News Feed.
 
Similarly, aside from the conversational and linguistic understanding, there's 
a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understandin
g. So 
understanding photos, what's in photos, what's in videos, what people are 
doing. That allows us to not only do things around accessibility, to show 
somebody who is visually impaired to be able to read to them what might be 
in a video or a photo. But 
it also helps us rank News Feed better, so that 
way we can help understand what is in the content and show people more of 
what is going to be meaningful to them. It helps us identify content that 
might be offensive or graphic that might violate the policie
s of Facebook so 
we can flag that and review that better.
 
So that's the main thread of the AI work we're doing is trying to understand 
conversational and linguistic context and computer vision, photographic and 
video signals to understand what's going on t
here. And that will apply across 
basically every product that we build at the company. And then of course, 
there's some deeper AI research that we're doing that feeds into those 
applications as well. That can apply to things like ranking for News Feed and 
search and ads and all of our systems more broadly.

On the discoverability of pages, a couple of things that I would point out 
there. First, we continue to invest in search. So obviously, that's a good way 
for people to dis
cover interesting pages, interesting businesses around 
them, so search is one angle there.
 
And then of course, ads, we've got 60 million businesses with pages. They 
manage those pages and then they can promote those pages via our easy
-
to
-
use ad products. W
e try to make it very easy for businesses to promote 
pages, promote posts and the like. So that's an important on
-
ramp to mobile

Great, 
thanks. Just as it relates to video search, do you think that Facebook 
has the video content depth at this point for users to search for video 
content and be pleased with the experience?
 
And then second for Mark, while Facebook embarks on its video first 
s
trategy, how should we think about Facebook also evolving into a 
transactional platform with the recent introduction of the Marketplace? 
Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Facebook, Inc.
 
Sure, so search is an area that we've been working on for a while to
 
improve. I don't know what the most recent public stat is on that. So I'm not 
going to say a stat, but it's grown a lot. So we're happy with that and we 
think that reflects that people are getting value from the search experience, 
which a lot of the growt
h comes from people searching for posts and content 
in the system, not just looking up people and pages in the system. So on 
search, there's that.
 
And then of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique 
content is in a system and not just th
e ability to find it. So I think what 
people are going to search Facebook for are finding people and content that 
they know is on Facebook and that isn't in other places. And that I think is 
driving most of the volume today and I think can get us to be 

 
w
e're 
already one of the largest search engines in the world, but to be even bigger 
on that front.
 
You asked about transactions as well. And we've spent a lot of time on this 
call talking about putting video first. That has certainly been the biggest 
theme 
of the last quarter and is the biggest part of the product strategy for 
Facebook and Instagram and is a big part of the product strategy for 
Messenger and WhatsApp as well. In terms of transactions, one of the big 
things that we see happening in messaging 
long term is that it's a great 
channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do 
transactions in a private space or get support, or for businesses to reach out 
with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement 
with
 
a person. So that's something that we're very excited about building. 
And that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and 
WhatsApp over time. So we're looking forward to that.
 
Marketplace I think is going to be a great example of t
his too. What we're 
seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get 
awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions, and 
Marketplace I think is going to help people do that. We're starting with 
people being able to sell t
hings and connect to other people who want to buy 
them, just like they've been doing in for

Thanks Deborah and thanks everyone for joining today. This has been a 
good quarter f
or Facebook and a great end to the year. Our community 

growth of our business. Overall 2014 was a year of great progress for the 
Facebook community. 1.39 billion people now use Facebo
ok each month and 
890 million people daily, an increase of active and 133 million daily active 
this year. Time spent per person per day across our services continue to rise 

even includ
e WhatsApp, which joined us late last year.
 


year of big investments in our future. This year we made big bets
 
on the 
next generation of communication and computing platforms by acquiring 
WhatsApp and Oculus. We focused on serving our community better across 
all of our products, raising the quality and relevance of content to News 
Feed, improving our search and vi
deo products and improving the 
performance and efficiency of our mobile apps.
 
We continue to invest in our employees and infrastructure, grown our 
headcount by 45% this year and opening our newest data center in 
November in Altoona, Iowa. When you consider
 
the progress of our 
community and our investments, 2014 was an important year for us and a 

Facebook is focused on our mission to connect the entire world, welcoming 
billions of people t
o our community and connecting many more people to the 
Internet through Internet.org.
 
To serve the entire world, we need to build products that serve our 
community and allow people to share different types of content with 
different audiences. We need to of
fer new services and infrastructure at 
greater scale, but we need to create new tools and innovate to solve 
fundamental challenges in the places we want to connect. Doing this will 
take a lot of effort over the coming years and Facebook is going to have to
 
evolve.
 
Similar to our transition to mobile over the last couple of years, now we 
want to really focus on serving everyone in the world. Our mission has 
always been to make the world more open and connected. This is something 

 

2014 and over the last ten years has helped us to build a foundation for 

 

 
to 
execute on over the next three, five and 10 years. Over the next three 
years, our main focus is to continue to serve and grow our community by 
delivering better services for people and businesses around the world. One 
sign of our continued growth and e
ngagement is our progress on visual and 
public content. More than 2 billion photos are now shared daily across 
Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. Video grew significantly 
this year to an average of more than 3 billion video views per day on 
Faceb
ook. But we now have more than 2 billion interactions every week on 
Facebook between public figures and their fans.
 
Instagram is also growing and helping people share and consume the most 
engaging content in different communities across the world. Instagra
m 
reached 300 million monthly actives with more than 70% outside of the U.S. 
Average time spent using the app continues to be very strong compared to 

good job on engagement, especially
 
when it comes to helping people find 
and consume content they like.
 

people to share even more of the moment they care about on Facebook. 
Five years ago, most of the content shared
 
on Facebook was text and some 

five years, we want to keep developing new products and features to help 
people share the way they want.
 
When it comes to serving businesses, we con
tinue to help drive results for 
businesses of every size around the world. Last week, a Deloitte's report 
found that in 2014 Facebook created more than $225 billion of global 
economic impact and $4.5 million new jobs. This is an important reminder of 
the b

committed to serving them well. In 2014, we invested aggressively in 
improving our ad

generation of Facebook services. We expect WhatsApp and Messenger to 
connect hundreds of millions of more people and become indispen
sable 
services for the world as well as important contributors to our business. 
Messenger and WhatsApp recently achieved impressive new milestone. In 
November, Messenger reached 500 million monthly actives, and at the 
beginning of January, WhatsApp reached
 
700 million monthly actives with 
more than 30 billion messages sent each day. These numbers speaks the 
quality of both products and the size of the opportunity ahead to help billions 
of people communicate and collaborate.
 
Search at Facebook is another imp
ortant effort that we expect to create a lot 
of value over the next few years. In this quarter, we launched updates to 
Facebook search to make it easier to find content and posts on mobile and 

r community 

about our ability to deliver value that only Facebook is able to provide.
 
Working with developers is the other part of our strategy. In this quarter, we 
continue to make
 
progress with helping developers build, grow and monetize 
their apps. In October, we rolled out our audience network around the world. 
And since then, the number of apps in the network has nearly tripled and 
impressions served by the network have more tha
n quadrupled. In 2015,

to the internet through Internet.org and to develop the next generation of 
computing platforms with Oculus. Internet.org now has a lot of mo
mentum. 
We launched three basic internet services in Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, 
Kenya, and Columbia. More than a 150 million people living in these 
countries now have the option to connect to the internet using the 

 
million of them to the internet, 


our community.
 
2015 is going to be an important year for our long

months. Oculus continues to make progress towards the future of immersive 
VR experiences that are part of daily life for millions of people. This month

their support. Thanks to you. Our community is growing stronger everyday

Thanks and now here is Sheryl.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thank
s Mark and hi everyone. Q4 was strong across the board, tapping a 
great year. This is our first quarter with over $3 billion in ad revenue and 
over $2 billion in mobile ad revenue. Our Q4 ad revenue grew 53% year
-
over
-
year. Our mobile ad revenue was 69% of
 
the total ad revenue and 
double than the past year. Our growth is strong across all verticals in 
marketer segments. We also saw healthy growth around the world although 
growth rates outside the U.S. were effected by exchange rates.
 
Looking back at 2014, o
ur team has made great progress on our three main 
priorities. Capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of 
marketers using our ad products and making our ad more relevant. We 
believe that the market increasingly understands that we have the l
eading 
mobile ad products and are the only platform that delivers people based 
marketing upscale. A shift to mobile is changing the way people consume 
video. As Mark said, video grew dramatically on Facebook in 2014, especially 
around global events like th
e World Cup and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.
 
In just one year, the number of video posts per person on Facebook 
increased 75% globally and 94% in the U.S. Today, over 50% of people in 
the U.S. who come to Facebook daily watching at least one video per 
day 
and globally over 65% of Facebook video views occur on mobile. Marketers 
have followed this trend and are using video to help people discover and 
learn about their brands. In Q4, we expanded autoplay video ads 
internationally. During the holiday season
, we saw many clients telling their 
stories creatively through video.
 
2014 was also the year we began scaling Instagram ads. In Q4, we rolled 
out Instagram ads in Australia and Canada. Marketers are excited to have 
access to the 300 million people views In
stagram and the creativity it 

marketers across verticals from insurance and tax to retail and 
entertainment. For example as one of our first Instagram video advertisers, 
Banana Republic
 
developed a series of videos to promote its BR clothing 
lines. The video showed fashion sketches from the new collection and drove 

our rollout. We believe that Instagram w
ill become core to advertisers and 
mobile brand building efforts.
 
We also made progress growing a number of marketers using our ad 
products. Custom audiences, our suite of proprietary targeting product has 
become an essential tool for segment current and p
otential customers. 
Conversion tracking away from marketers to measure the impact of their 

businesses of all sizes to plan and manage their ad campaign and for small 
businesses to use
 
our targeting tools.
 
Travel company, Thomas Cook, recently used Facebook in Belgium to reach 
a broad audience and used custom audiences to send targeted messages to 

reached 30% of the
 
Belgium population in just one day and achieved a 3.85 
times of return on investment. Results like these are attracting more 
marketers of all kinds to our platform. Finally, we made great progress 
improving ad relevance and measurements. To do this, we ma
de significant 
investments in both our core measurement and targeting tools as well as ad
-
tech.
 
Earlier in 2014, we introduced ad buying capabilities based on each and 
frequency metrics which is similar to how brand marketers by TV ads and 
therefore enable
s better cross comparison. We improved our Ads Manager 
product to give better in place into ad campaign to audience an impact. In 
the fall, we re
-
launched Atlas to help marketers reach real people and 
measure results across multiple devices. Omnicom is our
 
first global client 
and this month we announced a partnership with Havas to further expand 
globally. We also invested in Audience Network, which helps marketers to 
extend their campaign off of Facebook and LiveRail which provides 
publishers the video tool
s to monetize their inventory more efficiently.
 

our core ad products as well as with newer areas like video, Instagram, and 
ad
-
tech. It is still early days in all of these efforts. T
here is a lot of hard work 
to do and we plan to invest aggressively. Our ultimate goal is to be a critical 
business partner to our clients, providing people
-
based marketing of scale to 
build their brands and move their off shelves.
 
Over the past few weeks,
 
I have had a chance to meet with many of our 
largest global clients and agency partners and talked about how we can 
drive real business results for them, making every impression and every 
dollar they spend improves their bottom line. Our clients are excit
ed by the 
opportunity to use video Instagram and ads on and off Facebook to reach 
the right people with the right message. In turn, as their ads become more 
relevant, we provide a better experience for the people who use Facebook.
 
Humming off our biggest y
ear ever I want to say a special thank you to the 
Facebook teams around the world, to our global sales engineering, product 
design and infrastructure teams, your accomplishments over this past year 
are the reason our business is in such a great place. To o
ur entire company, 
I feel lucky to work with you as we stay focused on our priorities and work 
together to help connect the world. And to our clients thank you for your 
partnership and your trust in us. Heading into 2015, we have big 
opportunities and a lo
t of work ahead.
 
Thanks and now here is Dave.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Q4 wrapped up a strong year 
for Facebook. In 2014, our revenue grew 58% to approximately $12.5 billion 
and we generated over $3.6 billion in free cash flow
. We are very pleased 
with the continuing growth of our network. In December, the number of 
people using Facebook on an average day increased by 18%, compared to 
last year to 890 million.
 
The daily number represents 64% of the 1.39 billion people who used 
Facebook during the month. Mobile remains the primary driver of our 
growth. We ended the year with 1.19 billion people using Facebook on 
mobile in the month. We also continue to see solid growth with Instagram, 
Messenger and WhatsApp recently crossing 300 
million, 500 million and 700 
million MAU respectively.
 
Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis unless otherwise noted. In addition as a reminder, our non
-
GAAP 
measures exclude stock
-
based compensation and the amo
rtization of 
intangibles. Total revenue in Q4 was $3.9 billion, up 49% or 53% on a 
constant currency basis, given how significantly exchange rates have 
continued to move, we anticipate that this currency headwind will increase in 
2015. I will give more col
or on this later in the call.
 
Ad revenue was $3.6 billion, up 53% or 58% on a constant currency basis. 
Mobile ad revenue in Q4 doubled to $2.5 billion or 69% of ad revenue 
compared to approximately $1.2 billion or 53% of ad revenue last year. 
Desktop ad re
venue was up approximately 1% despite the fact that overall 
desktop usage was down. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 335%; 
well total ad impressions declined 65%. Similar to last quarter, these price 
volume trends were primarily driven by the rede
sign of our right
-
hand 
column ads which rolled out in the third quarter.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was $257 million, up 7%. Note that 
the growth was driven by revenue from acquisitions made in the past year. 
On an organic basis, payment revenue
 
from gains, which represents the 
substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue declined 10% 
compared to last year. As previously noted, we expect this trend to continue 
as desktop usage declines.
 
Turning now to expenses; our Q4 total GAAP ex
penses were $2.7 billion, up 
87%, and non
-
GAAP expenses were $1.6 billion, up 50%. GAAP expense 
growth was driven primarily by significant stock
-
based compensation and 
amortization expenses related to the WhatsApp acquisition.
 
Non
-
GAAP expense growth was d
riven primarily by increases in headcount 
related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. On a full year basis, 
our 2014 GAAP expenses were $7.4 billion, up 47%, and our non
-
GAAP 
expenses were $5.3 billion, up 34%. We ended the year with roughly 92,
000 
employees, up 45%. Overall, we remain very pleased with our ability to 
attract and retain top tier talent.
 
GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion in Q4, representing a 29% operating 
margin, down from 44% last year; again, primarily due to expenses rela
ted 
to our recent large acquisitions. Non
-
GAAP operating income was $2.2 billion 
in Q4, representing a 58% operating margin consistent with the margin last 
year.
 
Interest and other income and expense was a net expense of $19 million in 
Q4 versus a net expe
nse of $3 million in Q4 last year. This increase in 
expense was primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the 
periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances during the period. 
In Q4, we benefited from the reinstatement of the R&D tax
 
credit. Our GAAP 
tax rate was 37% and would have been approximately 42% excluding the 
benefit of the tax credit.
 
Our Q4 non
-
GAAP tax rate was 31% and would have been approximately 
32% excluding this benefit. Q4 net income was $701 million, or $0.25 per 
sh
are, and non
-
GAAP net income was $1.5 billion, or $0.54 per share. In 
2014, we spent $1.8 billion on CapEx and generated over $3.6 billion of free 
cash flow. We ended 2014 with $11.2 billion in cash and investments and a 
net operating loss carry forward of
 
approximately $4.5 billion.
 

stages of building out many aspects of our ads business and we remain 
optimistic about our long
-
term opportunities. Looking at 2015, there are a 
co
uple of things I want to note. The first involves how the recent movements 
in exchange rates might impact our 2015 revenue. Assuming exchange rates 

 
We would expect that our total revenue in 2015 would be approximat
ely 5% 
lower than it would be under 2014 exchange rates. Note this 5% represents 
the expected reduction in 2015 total revenue, not the reduction in the year
-
over
-
year growth rate. And second, we are reporting revenue from Atlas, 
LiveRail, and the Audience 
Network on a net, not a gross, basis. So the 
growth in those products will have less of an impact on our overall reported 
revenue growth in 2015.
 

better visibility into 2015 spending. 
We expect that our full year 2015 total 
GAAP expenses will increase 55% to 70% compared to 2014. We expect that 
our 2015 total non
-
GAAP expenses will increase 50% to 65%. A simple way 
of thinking about our investments is across three categories: people, 
pr
oduct, and infrastructure.
 
On the people side, we enter 2015 with 45% more employees than we did a 
year ago and we will continue to invest in and grow the talent base 
throughout the year. In terms of product, we are investing to build great 
experiences for
 
people, marketers and developers, ranging from our existing 
products and services to newer initiatives such as ad
-
tech, Internet.org, 

initiatives which, as I noted, was a driver 
of expense growth in Q4.
 
Turning to infrastructure. We continue to build out our global infrastructure 
to enable billions of people around the world to connect, message, and share 
with each other. We will be investing in data centers, our network and 
serve
rs to grow our existing services and support newer initiatives such as 
video and our global connectivity efforts through Internet.org. We anticipate 
our 2015 CapEx will be in the neighborhood of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion.
 
We expect stock
-
based compensat
ion for 2015 to be in the range of $3 
billion to $3.3 billion approximately half of which is related to our prior 
acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect amortization expenses for 
2015 to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. And finally, w
e 
anticipate our Q1 and full year 2015 GAAP tax rates to be in the mid to high 
40s and non
-
GAAP rates to be in the mid to high 30s. In summary, Q4 caps 
off a great year for Facebook in which we executed well and also made some 
very important investments fo
r our future. In 2015, we are focused on 
continuing to execute on the business and investing in our long
-
term mission 
and success.

Heather Bellini
 
Great, thank you. I just had two quick questions. Sheryl or Mark, I was just 
wo
ndering, from a brand advertising perspective, is there a way you could 
share with us how your conversations with these advertisers have been 
trending over the past 12 months, how they've been evolving, and kind of 
how they are thinking about the video opp
ortunity? And then, Dave, I just 
wanted to follow
-
up on your question about total expense guidance, because 
in the past you've given a 5

point range, I believe, for total expenses and 
this year it's 15. Granted, you did tighten it, which we appreciate. And

largest clients. And I would say that people remain really excited about 

to do more measurement over the past year. I think there are few things 
about the Facebook platform that a
re really exciting for brand marketers. 
The first is the creativity and storytelling and certainly as you mentioned 
video is a big part of that because video is a format that marketers have 
used for a long time to building those connection to brands.
 
And t
he second is measurement. And what clients want and what they 
should want is an ability to look at their ad spend and see how effective it is, 
not just in the brand less metrics even though those are important but in 
moving products off shelves. And over t
he past year and half the 

when I sit down with clients at the beginning of this year compared to last 


been able to ad test, Facebook ads versus no Facebook ads and what 

showing very healthy, very competitive ROI. The opportunity and the 
challenge now is to [indiscernible] even for our

WhatsApp, Internet.org, et cetera. We feel good about wher


investments from a position of strength and excited about the opportunities

Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to follow
-
up on your 
comment around search, its early days, but what the company is seeing in 
terms of the way people are interacting with the new search function
ality 
inside Facebook broadly? And then maybe tying it back to advertising, what 
that might mean for closing the loop with some of your small and medium 
sized business advertisers and maybe even the places initiative long
-
term? 
Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure
. So, our view on this is that there is a lot of unique content that people 
have shared in Facebook, a lot of personal content, recommendations from 

traditional web search service or 

voyage to basically index all the content and make it available to people and 
rank it well. We started off by launching graph search which I think included 
more than a trillion different connections in the first sy
stem.
 
And the second round of the search progress that we just started rolling out 
at the end of last year was post search, which now has index more than I 
think a trillion posts, which I mean the sizes of these corpuses are bigger 
than anything in a tradi


people immediately understand how they can use this and find content that 

with just a few 
keywords.
 

really thinking about advertising in it yet on the scale that our community 
operates, a billion searches per day is actually not that big compared to 
w

keep on working on it because there is just a lot of unique value that people 
should be able to get their friends on Facebook research.

John Blackledge
 
Great, thanks. Just wondered if you could provide your view on Facebook as 
a video platform given that video views per day increased to 3 billion in 
December from 1 billion in September of 
2014 and how we should think 
about the video content mix over the next couple of years, and just same 
kind of topic, if you can give a sense of user and advertiser feedback on the 
autoplay video ads. That would be great? Thank you.
 
Dave Wehner
 
I'll talk ab
out the consumer product and then Sheryl can jump in about as. 
So what we are seeing and I alluded to little bit in my opening remarks is 
that there has been this evolution of content on Facebook over the last 10 
years, towards richer format that convey mo
re of the moment that people 
care about. So if you go back five years ago, a lot of Facebook was primarily 
capture it in a little bit of photos and also I think the primary mode that 
people are using to share is photos and they wouldn't be surprised up in 
the 
future that shifted more and more towards videos.
 

people who are sharing, and this year an increased focus on new 
opportunities around production so it is easier for people to ca
pture the 
moment that are important to them, create higher
-
quality moments and 
pictures of content out of those and increase their experiences through that. 
So there is a lot more to do here and I think the business going to be one of 
the big trends over t
he next three to five years, is the growth in video and 
richer content in our service.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
From a consumer and marketers feedback on video ads point of view, there 

v
ideo views per day, because that means consumers are using video ads 
and enjoying them on Facebook and in news feed. The way we think about 
our ads product is we want them to blend in with the consumer experience. 
And so the fact that we have this much con
sumer video on Facebook, means 

marketers.

Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. 
Your line is open.
 
Justin Post
 
Great, it looks like you did about $9 of revenue in the U.S. per MAU which 
implies over $30 run rate which is impressive. Sheryl may be the first 
question to you. How do you grow that from here is it usage, is it more 
higher ad loads, is it the mix of ads 
or is it targeting may be some thoughts 
on how you grow from there. And then Mark, if you look at other your three 
platforms WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and other things. You probably 
have in mind. Can I monetize anywhere as well as Facebook if you look
 
out 
your five year plan? Thank you.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 


have not followed consumer time and the same percentage
s. So in the U.S., 
mobile gets 25% of consumer media time, but only 10% of the ad budgets. 
And to take one comparable example, that means that for every consumer 
hours spent on print, marketers spend $1 and they spend $0.07 per hour on 
mobile, which means 
that we have an opportunity to grow. One of the most 
important ways we grow is not just bringing more marketers into Facebook, 
having them use more of our ad products, but as you mentioned better 
targeting.
 
A more relevant ad is a better ad experience for 
consumer 
-
 
for consumers, 

running an action, as our ads get more relevant and we provide higher ROI. 

the last 
year, making our ads more relevant. I think most people on this call 
would say that you seek more relevant ads than you used to a year ago, but 
I still think, you know, some of the Facebook ads still have rooms for 
improvement in terms of relevance. And so
, we see a lot of room for 
improvements there, both in the ROI we deliver and in the experience we 
can provide to consumers.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, so I will add something to that just on the side of how we think about 
value through Facebook and I will talk 
about the other apps. In terms of the 
product developments that we do here, we have four major groups inside of 
the company. This is kind of how our company is organized. We have one 
which is focused on growing the community, one which is focused on kind o
f 

focused on kind of efficiency and helping people to get the most value out of 

is our core business, which is
 
focused on helping people to see the best ads 
and basically make the most money per moment that people are spending at 
the lowest cost in most efficiency in terms of serving people.
 
And there is, I think, big upside in each of those four categories. I mea
n our 
community is growing. I mentioned in our comments upfront that time spent 
across our services is growing by 
-
 
grew by 10% year
-
over
-
year per person, 
which is pretty meaningful. Utility and efficiency are increasing and of course 
the ad business per p
erson and the efficiency of our services are both 
increasing as well.
 

we can continue visiting of that. The other opportunities, Instagram, 
Messenger, and WhatsApp, I am really exci
ted about and I do think that 



that 
cycle, we are about where Facebook was in around 2006 or 2007 where at 
that point Facebook was really just a consumer product.
 
There were no businesses in the ecosystem. And a lot of people were telling, 


was going to be the right way to build the products or build the business. So 
instead what we did was built pages, which was a way for businesses to 
interact for free in the system and start creating organic interactions 
betw
een people and business. And so we could figure out what 
-
 
the people 
are using Facebook 1 and from businesses within Facebook and we built 
more tools for pages and businesses to engages.
 
And our recent success with advertising is really just built on some
 
of those 
organic interactions between people and businesses. And what you see in 

where the interaction is still primarily people to people and businesses are 
starting to figure out i
n the case of WhatsApp much less than Messenger so 

whole cycle of figuring out how that works before it really make sense to 
start monetizing them in a big way. But yes, I mean, 
I am a big fundamental 
believer and that these are going to be very big contributors to our 
businesses over time, but we just have to do it right.

Your next question comes from line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. 
Your line is open.
 
Ben Swin
burne
 
Thank you, two questions. Sheryl, can you talk about where we are in the 
North American market versus your other regions in terms of sort of 
advertiser maturation and acceptance of the Facebook platform? The growth 
rates in North America to be really
 
impressive despite of being your biggest 
business when you look at the ARPU trends and as compared to the other 
regions that was tend to be 
-
 
seem to be moderating a bit. And then I was 
wondering, Dave, if you could talk about the pricing growth which act
ually 
accelerated from Q3 to Q4, can you give us some color there. I know there 
were changes to LiveRail, but anything else you would add about why there 
was a huge acceleration in pricing growth? Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
North America remains a really impo
rtant market for us. And as you said, 

matter how big they are for us, we represent a really tiny part of their ad 
spends and we represent an underinvestment in terms of where th
ey can 
reach their consumers. So we believe by continuing to make these 



keting spend or the time they may 
spent. We say to our clients over and over again is that we want to drive 
their business.
 

large North American spenders is around the measurement work
 

done. Two years ago, we were not able to measure all the way through to 
purchase off the shelves and now we can. Yesterday, we rolled out a product 
we call lift, which is really the next consideration of our measurement 
capabilities. That enables la
rger customers to go and set up ads with control 
test groups, and so they can AB test. This group of people saw Facebook ad, 


nline conversion 
to a sale.
 
We think the measurement out there online and digitally is not particularly 

investments in Atlas and through our investments in 
-
 
the core Facebook 
measuring 
tools. We think if we can show the ROI marketers are getting and 
we can increasingly do so, we can continue to penetrate the North American 
market.
 
Dave Wehner
 
Ben, its Dave. So also just building on what Sheryl said worth noting that 
the drop in the value
 
of international currencies impacted our results outside 

year
-
over
-
year revenue growth rate by 7% to 8% in the different 

the U.S. doing 


option of our best targeting products as Sheryl was talking about.
 
Going to your question o
n pricing growth, I just reiterate what I said in my 



tally, we just continue 
to get better targeting and that drives better engagement. And as we get 
better engagement that drives better ROI for our advertisers, which 
ultimately, I think as Sheryl commented on earlier, gets reflected in better 
pricing of our
 



factor as well.

Brian Wieser
 
Hi, thanks for taking the 
question. First, I was wondering if you could talk 
about the degree which you think premium video content is 
-
 
or is not 
necessary to opt when we capture budgets from advertisers that might 
otherwise have gone to TV, you have a couple of initiatives around
 
ABC and 
NFL. So I was curious to get your thoughts on that? And separately, I am 

-
 
or new to Atlas. Do 
you have a sense that your spending on digital media is changing or if so 
how 
-
 
alternately are th
ey just happy with campaign management tools? 
Thanks very much.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
So on video ads what really matters is that consumers are using video on 
Facebook, because that gives us an opportunity, one, to provide a great 
consumer experience, but two, t
o have ads in ad
-
tech consumer experience. 
If the other consumer video on Facebook, video ads and new feed will be 

nicely into that experience. I think it matters as much what the vid
eo 
content is and so well we are certainly exploring some premium content as 

already seeing pretty exclusive growth without that kind of premium content 
in the system in large num


figured out what the mix needs to be and right now the growth is very 
strong.
 
In terms of Atlas, we just relaunched this fall and 

get done in broad adoption. So I think its too soon for us to report that Atlas 
drives an increase in digital spend or an increase in any particular kind of 
spend but you should be believe really deeply, which is that Atlas is go
ing to 
revitalize marketing by making the measurement more accurate. If you look 
at how digital ads are being measured. They are being measured based on a 
cookie based world that assumes that people have one device, largely a PC. 
And that is not real, cons
umers have phone, they have tablet, they have 
PC's as well and the ability to understand that one person to serve an ad and 

improve the efficiency in the system as we get the battle.

out there, we sometimes encounter that, that publishers are growing a bit 
concerned about the power you guys wheel, particularly as you push into 
monetizing off the plat
form. Thanks very much.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Our audience network efforts are still pretty new. We have a goal of serving 
more relevant ads to people off Facebook which will provide greater reach 
for Facebook marketers and also a better opportunity to monetize 
for 
publishers. We are seeing some nice results as Shazam reported that using 
audience network increase the revenue from ad networks by 37%. We 
believe that working with publishers, if we can increase the value of their 
inventory by providing more relevant
 
and targeted ads. They are going to be 
really happy with that opportunity and we are in the early stages of finding 
those partners.

Th
anks a lot. First for either Mark or Sheryl on the subject of public video

the News Feed are there things in terms of actors, celebrities, public figures 
that you can do to economical
ly incentivize those creators of, let they, the 
higher

one quick one for

as you mentioned you will be shifting the accounting 
for Facebook audience network and live rail to be for revenue to be net of 

to do that an
d is there any you can help us with in terms of order of 
magnitude of that shift. Thanks.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

this is to the ecosystem or how much we are going to invest or what kind of
 
monetization we are going to offer. Video is a growing quite nicely through 
the ecosystem right now. we have made a lot of investments in public 

far the largest social platform and
 
increasingly you are seeing public figures, 
everything from news broadcaster to journalist at a public figures do a lot on 

 
Because it provides the kind of sharing people want, people come to 
Facebook to share with thei
r friends and family but they also come to 
Facebook to connect with everyone from politicians to journalist to 
celebrities they want to connect with and get news and we definitely seeing 
public content grow as a percentage of what people get. We also had s
ome 
nice wins with the Golden Globe this year other things we are doing to get 
people doing some partnership we did [indiscernible] with CNBC to show 
how we can help content creators increased their distribution and reach 
people directly on Facebook.

Thanks. Just following upon the video concept how important is it that 
Facebook post the videos versus I guess sharing clips from third
-
party 
players in the feed and what percent of that $3 billion streams daily is 
Fa
cebook embedded versus from other players and are you able to monetize 
videos from third party players today there is a way to walk around that in 
the future. Thanks.
 
Dave Wehner
 
This thought that we shared of 3 billion a day is all made on Facebook. So 
th
ere are probably other shares from other video services as well. But the 
way that there was looking our services or as if there is links to other sites, 
and the reason why I think made a video is so valuable for people using our 
service is that when someon
e uploads a video to Facebook directly we can 
optimize how it delivers right. So we can make it autoplay. We can find the 
right quality and bit rate to send down to the person based on their 
connection overtime. And optimize all kinds of different things. 
So what I 
think people are finding from public figures to everyday videos that people 
are uploading is that the best experience that you can get is by uploading 
content native to Facebook, which is, I think the big part of the growth that 
we seeing there.

growth in advertising revenues can be attributed to 
changes in organic

crack at it, Colin
. I mean, we are seeing obviously great growth in DAU, 
which is up 18%. We are seeing growth in times spent across the network 
up 10% per DAU. So you got those sort of underlying drivers of 
engagements driving growth. We are also monetizing at higher rates
 
because we are able to get better targeting into the ads and get better 

number of different factors that are coming into play. But clearly driving 
organic growth in engagemen

good success there.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

been a couple of questions so this is the fact our primary strategy for 
growing the ad 
business is increasing the quality of the content, not 
increasing the number of ads to our story that people are seeing on 
Facebook. So there are impacts like as people consume more content on 
Facebook, within the ratio of ads that organic content that wil
l showed might 
be more ads.
 
But overall, our strategy is much less to that increasing the volume of ads 
and much more about increasing the quality of the content and the quality of 
the targeting to get the right content to the right people. And this is a p
retty 
controversial strategy internally and we will ensure that is going to work out. 

very confident that this is the right path going forward as well.

investors for a considerable amount of time about Facebook first to connect 
the world, and specifically about the Internet.org which suggest you think 
this is important for the investors. Can you clar
ify why you think this most of

h maybe at least in terms of dollars. Thank you.

really mission focused company and we wake up every day and make 
decision because we want to help connect the world a

doing here. So part of that the subtext of your question is that yes, if we 
were only focused on making money we might put all of our energy on just 
increasing ads to people in the U.S. and the other most developed countries. 

s not the only thing that we care about here.
 
So I do think that over the long

term that focusing on the helping connect 
everyone will be a good business opportunity for us as well. And we may not 

happen and but I 
think these countries get more connected the economics growth the ad 
markets growth and Facebook and the other services in our community or 
the number one and number two, three, four, five services that people are 
using then over time we w
ill be compensated for some of the value that we

is to connect the world and I just thinks its really important than investors

Thanks for taking the question. Just quickly on WhatsApp, I know this focus 
will be user growth for a while, but in the future as you do turn on the 
monetization engine, just curious what are some of the primary ways that 

rom advertising

or games perhaps and 

coming from? Is there any particular areas that are stronger and curious 

 
Dave Wehner
 

 
the focus for WhatsApp is on helping to connect a lot 
more people, all right. So when John and team joined us, one of the first 
things that we agreed on and why I think it made sense for them to join is 
that now they can focus for a few years on getting t
o one billion more than 
that and continuing to scale beyond that. SMS is an incredibly global and 
universal product and I think WhatsApp just has a huge opportunity to third 
billions of people. In terms of what the business looks like, I mean at the 
end of
 

you most effectively convert that into business opportunities for customers 

structures.
 

e optimal thing will be, but the first order of 
thing to do is to helps our billions of people here, help to continue to 
increase engagement, I mean people are spending a lot of time in 
WhatsApp, sending more than 30 billion messages a day, which is really
 
crazy when you think about the volume there compared to the global SMS 
volume overall. And I think if we do that there will be a number of 
opportunities. I mean people ask me this question awhile ago about 
-
 
when 
we talked about games on Facebook as well.
 
And I always talked about our canvas business on desktop even though its 
payment is actually the same thing as our business on mobile around app 
install and engagement. What developers test for is distribution and whether 

ts or ads or whatever it is, it kind of is all 
the same. The most important thing is to help people connect, help people

Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator 
today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Fourth 
Quarter and Full Year 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator 
Instructions]. This call will be recorded. Thank you very much.
 
Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's Vice President of Investor Relations, you 
may begin.
 
Deborah Crawford

investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.
 
And now, I'd like to turn t
he call over to Mark.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Our community 
continues to grow, and our business delivered good results this quarter. 
There are now 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or 
Messenger each month and more than 2 billion people who use at least one 
of our services every day.
 
On our last call, I talked about our overall strategy as we faced some 
important opportunities and challenges. And today, I want to give you an 
update and t
alk about our priorities for 2019. For the past couple of years, 
most of our focus and energy has gone into addressing some of the biggest 
social issues around the future of the Internet, including election integrity, 
content governance, safety and securit
y, data privacy and digital well
-
being. 
And these are all complex issues but we've made real progress. In many of 
these areas, we believe we built the most advanced systems in the world 
and, in many cases, more advanced than any other company or 
government
. And in other areas, we have clear road maps now for our work 
ahead.
 
Still, there's a lot more to do, and I expect it will take strong execution 
through 2019 and beyond before we get all our systems to the level that we 
need. But we've fundamentally chang
ed how we run this company. We've 
changed how we build services to focus more on preventing harm. We've 
invested billions of dollars in security, which has affected our profitability. 
We've taken steps that reduced engagement in WhatsApp to stop 
misinforma
tion and reduced viral videos in Facebook by more than 50 million 
hours a day to improve well
-
being. We've made significant progress and 
we're going to continue this work, but we're also going to allocate more of 
our energy to building new and inspiring wa
ys to help people connect and 
build community.
 
Going into 2019, we're focused on four priorities: first, continue making 
progress on the major social issues facing the Internet and our company; 
second, build new experiences that meaningfully improve people
's lives 
today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; third, 
keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses, mostly 
small businesses, that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; then 
fourth, communicate mo
re transparently about what we're doing and the 
role our services play in the world. And I want to take a minute talk about 
each of these.
 
So first, continue making progress on the major social issues. The most 
important work here is to keep executing our 
road map to build systems that 
can proactively identify harmful content so we can act on it sooner. We just 
finished a year of very heavy investment to get these systems to a better 
place, and we've seen the results of that in recent elections, including t
he 
U.S. midterms and in our transparency reports, where we report what 
percent of violating content we identified proactively. We ended 2018 with 
more than 30,000 people working on safety and security, up from 10,000 
people a couple of years ago. And this 
work will never be finished, but I now 
believe we've built some of the most advanced systems in the world for 
dealing with these issues.
 
Now however, this raises a broader set of values questions about how to use 
these systems. One question is about who de
cides what speech is acceptable 
and what isn't. Right now, we have a deliberative process of consulting with 
experts around the world. But I've increasingly come to believe that we 
shouldn't be making so many of these decisions about content ourselves. In 
November, I wrote a note about a blueprint for a system of content 
governance and enforcement, which includes giving people the ability to 
appeal our internal content decisions to an independent body, and we're 
currently working with experts to design the 
system and we plan to start 
piloting it this half.
 
Another important issue is the future of privacy and encryption. People really 
value the privacy that encrypted messaging brings and we've built the most 
secure global messaging service in the world. As pe
ople increasingly share 
more privately, we're working on making more of our products end
-
to
-
end 
encrypted by default and making more of our products ephemeral so your 
information doesn't stick around forever. And I'll discuss this more over the 
coming quar
ters.
 
Our second priority for 2019 is that as we make progress on these social 
issues, we also need to deliver new experiences that meaningfully improve 
people's lives. Now, I'm not talking about the many day
-
to
-
day iterative 
improvements we make so that r
anking gets a bit better or that things get a 
little faster, but I'm talking about major improvements to people's lives that 
whole communities recognize and say, ""Wow, we're all doing something new 
on Facebook or on WhatsApp that we weren't doing before."" 
The last 
experience like this was Stories, which continues to grow very quickly. For 
example, Instagram just passed 500 million daily actives on Stories. But the 
reality is, we've put most of our energy into security over the past 18 
months, so that buildi
ng new experiences wasn't the priority over that 
period. So this year, I think we're going to deliver several of these new 
experiences.
 
Messaging is an area that's growing the most quickly. And this year, people 
are going to feel these apps becoming the ce
nter of their social experience in 
more ways. We're going to roll out Payments on WhatsApp in some more 
countries. Private sharing in Groups and Stories will become more central to 
the experience. We're going to onboard millions of more businesses that 
peo
ple can interact with.
 
In Facebook, the way people experience groups and communities will 
continue to deepen. We're going to get to a point soon where people feel like 
Facebook is about as communities as it 
-
 
is about communities as much as 
it's about your
 
friends and family where almost everyone is in a group that's 
meaningful to them and that community is a central part of their experience. 
On Facebook, I also expect this to be the year where Watch becomes more 
mainstream. There are now 400 million people
 
who use it every month, and 
people, on average, spend over 20 minutes on Watch daily. This means 
we're finding ways for video to grow outside of News Feed so it doesn't 
displace the social interactions that people primarily come to our services 
for.
 
In In
stagram, one of the areas I'm most excited about this year is commerce 
and shopping. There's a lot of natural activity happening here. And this year, 
I expect us to deliver some qualitatively new experiences around that. 
Longer term, I remain very focused 
on building technology that brings 
people together in new ways, including through AR and VR. I'm looking 
forward to Oculus Quest shipping this spring. The feedback there so far has 
been very positive. And I've also been positively surprised that Portal has
 
done better than I expected it to. I love using it with my own family. But we 
never shipped Facebook
-
branded hardware before and a lot of people said 
this would be a difficult time to start. So I'm pleased that so many people 
are enjoying this experience 
of being able to feel closer to the people they 
care about even when they're physically far apart.
 
Our third priority is to continue strong execution on our business. In the past 
couple of years, a lot of our business challenges have been self
-
imposed. 
The
 
reality is that we've had a number of substantive issues that we needed 
to address, and the investments we made in safety, security, privacy and 
well
-
being both increased our costs and, in some cases, reduced our 
revenues. But as I said at the time, I bel
ieve that these investments are the 
right thing to do and will make our community and our business stronger 
over the long term. And what we've seen is that the fundamentals of the 
business remain strong. More than 90 million small businesses now use our 
pr
oducts, the vast majority of them for free. And of those we surveyed, half 
tell us that they've been able to grow their businesses and hire more people 
since joining Facebook. This means they're using our services to create 
millions of jobs, and this is on
e of the most important contributions that we 
feel we can make to the world. And to put this in perspective, the U.S. 
economy added about 2.6 million jobs last year.
 
Our last priority is to get out there more and make the case for the role our 
services pla
y in the world. Right now, there's a lot of negativity about the 
impact of technology, and some of it's fair and some of it's misplaced. And 
we, in the tech industry overall, should be scrutinized heavily because we 
play a role in many people's lives. My a
pproach here is to listen to the 
critique first, to work on addressing our issues, figure out what we believe 
are the most important principles to uphold and then go engage in the 
debate. And I feel like we've come out of 2018 not only making real 
progress
 
on important issues but having a clear sense of what we believe 
are the right ways to move forward. Now, we're still going to make mistakes 
along the way, but we now have a clearer sense of the path ahead and we're 
ready to work with people to understand 
our role and move towards good 
outcomes, whether that's regulation on content or data, cooperation on 
shared threats, working openly to make sure AI best serves people, or just 
standing up for the kind of open and connected world that we all want to 
see.
 
T
he Internet is a massive force for change and we're at the center of a lot of 
the debate that brings, but our core value to people and society remains the 
same. We offer a service free to everyone to help you stay connected with 
the people you care about, 
express what you're thinking and feeling, get 
help when you need it most, support the causes and ideas you believe in, 
start and grow businesses no matter where you are, and that makes a lot of 
good possible and we're committed to building technology that 
people can 
use to create positive change.
 
As always, thank you for being on this journey with us. And now, here is 
Sheryl to talk about our business.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter and a good 
end to the year.
 
Q4 mobile ad revenue was $15.5 billion, increasing 36% 
year
-
over
-
year and contributing approximately 93% of our total ad revenue. 
Full year mobile ad revenue grew 45% compared to 2017. 2018 was a 
challenging and important year for us. As Mark said, we mad
e significant 
investments in safety and security and strengthened our defenses against 
election interference. We gave people tools to better control their 
information and set a new standard for transparency and ads. We have 
focused on making progress in th
ese important areas while continuing to 
grow our community and our business. This quarter proved that we can do 
both.
 
We know we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us. We need to continue 
to do better at anticipating the risks that come from connecting
 
so many 
people, and we need to earn back people's trust not with words alone but 
with actions. Part of building trust is helping people better understand our 
business model. Protecting people's privacy and showing them relevant ads 
are not at odds. We don
't sell your data and we don't tell advertisers who 
you are. What we do is allow advertisers to reach people interested in their 
products. The result is that people see more relevant ads and small 
businesses can reach people in ways that only big companies
 
previously 
could. This business model keeps Facebook free so people all around the 
world can use it and levels the playing field for businesses of all sizes while 
protecting people's privacy.
 
I'm excited to announce today that we have more than 7 million 
active 
advertisers across our services. From local shops to global brands, 
companies all over the world are growing and hiring because they can reach 
their customers on our platform. The opportunities we create for businesses 
drive our growth, which contin
ues to be broad
-
based across regions, 
marketer segments and verticals. During the holidays, companies used our 
ads to help people discover deals and find gifts. We saw particular strength 
among advertisers that optimized for measurable objectives, like 
con
versions or sales. For example, Bryan Anthonys an online jewelry store 
based in Austin, Texas, used our campaign budget optimization to bring in 
new customers and sales on Black Friday. The campaign was so successful 
that they tripled their holiday purchas
es and hired additional people to help 
pack and ship orders for the busy season.
 
We're also helping advertisers keep up with shifts in how people use 
technology. People are creating more Stories and sending more messages, 
which means these are 
emerging areas of opportunity for marketers. Today, 
we're also announcing that 2 million advertisers are using Stories to reach 
customers across our family of apps. We're making it easier for advertisers 
to adopt their campaigns for Stories. In Q4, we expa
nded automatic 
placements, which converts feed ads into a format that works for Stories and 
delivers ads wherever they'll get the best results. Framebridge, a start
-
up 
that provides custom picture framing, recently used automatic placements to 
run ads acro
ss Instagram Stories, Facebook and Instagram feed. They ran 
short videos to show that their frames make great holiday gifts, and 
Instagram Stories generated over 25% of their new customer sales.
 
As people increasingly use messaging apps, we're helping smal
l businesses 
make that shift, too. In Q4, we launched ads in Messenger Stories, which 
means advertisers can now easily buy Stories ads across Facebook, 
Instagram and Messenger. Beyond Stories and messaging, we have an 
opportunity to connect people and busi
nesses on new services like 
Marketplace. We're seeing good early results at Marketplace ads. In Q4, we 
worked on making ads more relevant to the products that people are looking 
for. For example, if someone is browsing furniture in Marketplace, we'll try 
t
o show them an ad for furniture or a related item. We plan to keep working 
on this to provide a better experience for people and more value to 
advertisers over time.
 
As we build new ad products, we remain focused on improving the overall 
quality of our ads
. Across all of our platforms and formats, we're investing in 
AI to make ads more relevant and effective. In Q4, we developed new AI 
ranking models to help people see ads they're more likely to be interested 
in. We're also using AI to identify and more qui
ckly review ads that might 
violate our policies, which was particularly important during the U.S. 
midterm elections. Looking ahead, we see more opportunities to use AI to 
keep people safe on Facebook and help businesses grow.
 
I want to close by saying than
k you to the businesses around the world who 
are using our tools to create jobs and growth. Last month, I went to 
Facebook's Community Boost in my hometown of Miami, which was the 50th 
stop on our tour across the U.S. in 2018, offering digital skills train
ing to 
small businesses and job seekers. I met entrepreneurs like Alex Kassab. He 
started Morelia Gourmet Paletas with friends just two years ago. He says 
that 60% of his new customers learned about their ice cream from Facebook 
and Instagram. And because 
of this growth, they've expanded to 12 
locations and hired more than 35 people. Last week, I was in Europe and 
met with SMEs from across the continent who shared similar stories of 
growing their companies, hiring people and investing in their communities. 
These stories motivate us to keep improving so more people can succeed on 
our platform.
 
I also want to thank our global team for their commitment to tackling our 
issues and making our products better every single day. As we come out of a 
challenging year a
nd continue to face challenges ahead, I believe we're in a 
position to build on the progress we've made and better serve our 
community in 2019. I am grateful to all of you for your continued hard work 
and dedication.
 
Now, here's Dave.
 
David Wehner
 
Thanks, 
Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter 
wrapping up a good year for our business. Full year 2018 revenue grew 37% 
to $56 billion, and we generated over $15 billion of free cash flow. Let's 
begin with our community metrics. Daily activ
e users on Facebook reached 
1.52 billion, up 9% compared to 2017, led by growth in India, Indonesia and 
the Philippines. This number represents approximately 66% of the 2.32 
billion monthly active users in Q4. MAUs grew 191 million or 9% compared 
to last y
ear.
 
Turning to our overall family metrics. Around 2.7 billion people worldwide 
used one of our applications in December, and on average, over 2 billion 
people were active daily. This is our best estimate of our de
-
duplicated 
audience across Facebook, Inst
agram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe 
these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that 
many people are using more than one of our services. For the time being, 
we will continue to disclose both set of numbers. But over time, we 
expect 
family metrics will play the primary role in how we talk about our company 
and we will eventually phase out Facebook
-
only community metrics.
 
Turning now to the financials. All comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis 
unless otherwise noted. Q4 tota
l revenue was $16.9 billion, up 30% or 33% 
on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant 
with Q4 '17, total revenue would have been approximately $348 million 
higher. Q4 total ad revenue was $16.6 billion, up 30% or 33% on a co
nstant 
currency basis. In terms of regional ad revenue growth, Asia Pacific was 
strongest at 34%, followed by North America at 31% and Europe at 28%. 
Rest of World ad revenue grew 24% and was impacted by ongoing currency 
weakness and macroeconomic challeng
es. In Q4, the average price per ad 
decreased 2% and the number of ad impressions served on our services 
increased 34%. Impression growth was primarily driven by ads on 
Instagram, including both feed and Stories as well as Facebook mobile News 
Feed. The ye
ar
-
over
-
year decline in average price per ad reflects an ongoing 
mix shift towards product services and geographies that monetize at lower 
rates. Payments and other fees revenue was $274 million, up 42%. Sales of 
Oculus Go and the launch of Portal contribu
ted to the revenue growth in the 
quarter.
 
Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $9.1 billion, up over $1 
billion sequentially and up 62% compared to last year. In addition to 
continued investment in infrastructure, safety and security and innovation
, 
expenses were also driven by seasonal factors, including marketing efforts, 
notably the promotion of Portal and Oculus Go. We ended the year with over 
35,500 full
-
time employees, a 42% increase.
 
Operating income was $7.8 billion, representing a 46% opera
ting margin. 
Our Q4 tax rate was 14%. Net income was $6.9 billion or $2.38 per share. 
Full year capital expenditures for 2018 were $13.9 billion, driven by 
investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure and office 
buildings. We generated $3.3
 
billion in free cash flow in Q4 and ended the 
year with approximately $41 billion in cash and investments.
 
In Q4, we bought back approximately $3.5 billion of our Class A common 
stock and completed our prior repurchase authorization. In December, our 
Boar
d of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $9 billion of 
stock.
 
Turning now to the revenue outlook. In Q1, we expect our total revenue 
growth rate to decelerate by a mid
-
single
-
digit percentage on a constant 
currency basis compared to the Q4
 
rate. We also expect that our revenue 
growth rates will continue to decelerate sequentially throughout 2019 on a 
constant currency basis.
 
Turning now to the expense outlook. On a full year basis, we continue to 
expect 2019 total expenses will grow approxi
mately 40% to 50% compared 
to 2018. Our 2019 capital expenditure outlook is unchanged at $18 billion to 
$20 billion, driven primarily by our continued large investment in building 
data centers.
 
Lastly, we expect that our 2019 tax rate will be a few percent
age points 
higher than our 2018 rate. In conclusion, we are confident in our ability to 
continue to invest effectively in the key priorities that Mark outlined in his 
opening remarks: making progress on the major social issues facing the 
Internet, building
 
new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives, 
and growing our business by supporting the many businesses that rely on 
our services.
 
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instr
uctions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian 
Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
I have two, the first one for Dave. Last quarter, you talked about an 
expected sequential deceleration in 4Q rather, and I think it came in a little 
better th
an expected. Could you just talk to sort of which forms of media, 
whether it's News Feed or Stories or Instagram, kind of came in better than 
you thought it originally would a few months ago and what drove the 
upside? And then, Mark, you talked about the I
nstagram commerce 
opportunity. Maybe just talk us through sort of 1 or 2 of the key 
-
 
what you 
think are the most important steps you have to cross throughout 2019 to 
really execute on this opportunity.
 
David Wehner
 
Sure. Thanks, Brian. I'll take the first
 
part of your question. Yes, Q4 was 
very strong on revenues, so we're pleased with that. On the demand front, 
we continued to benefit from advertisers targeting on business results. So 
direct response was especially strong during the holiday season. And th
en on 
the supply front, we benefited from strong Instagram growth, which was 
aided by both growth in impressions on Instagram feed and on Stories. But 
I'd reiterate that we expect that we will see a deceleration of revenue 
growth in Q1.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I'd
 
like to talk about 
-
 
a bit about commerce. When I think about it, just 
from the consumer side, increasing commerce on Instagram, Facebook and 
WhatsApp, I think, is one of the most exciting product opportunities that we 
have in all of these products and a 
big business opportunity as well. The big 
things that I think we want to make sure that we nail, in Instagram 
especially, are discovery. People are already doing a lot of commerce activity 
and are really interested in following brands, and I think making s
ure that, 
that works is 
-
 
and does well is a big deal. But I think there's also a very big 
opportunity in basically enabling the transactions and making it so that the 
buying experience is good and that when you buy from someone 
-
 
from a 
seller that you kn
ow that you can trust them, that you're going to have a 
good experience and in facilitating and making that go well. The work that 
we're going to do in Instagram also will go across the efforts in Marketplace 
and Facebook, the work 
-
 
the rest of work that 
we're doing in Facebook and 
all the work that we're going to be doing in WhatsApp as well. So this is a 
big area that I'm personally very excited about and focused on.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from 
Evercore.
 
Anthony DiClemente
 
Maybe, first, for Sheryl on Stories. Stories continues to grow very quickly. As 
you said, the number of advertising 
-
 
advertisers using Stories are growing 
quickly. Can you give us a little bit more on the performance of the ads? Are 
you
 
seeing improvements in conversion rates for those ads? Are the ads 
performance on Stories narrowing the gap with feed ads in terms of pricing 
or performance? And anything broadly on demand for those ad formats. And 
then one for Mark. I wonder if you could
 
speak to the possibility of stitching 
together the messaging apps, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger. It would be 
great to hear what the rationale or potential commercial benefits might be to 
-
 
or for potential integration of those properties.
 
Sheryl Sandber
g
 
I'll take the Stories question. One of the challenges that marketers have is 
keeping up where consumers are. If you think about our history, people 
made the shift to mobile before marketers did, and I think one of the 
successes we've had is we made it ea
sier for advertisers to move into a 
mobile environment. And just as we did that in mobile, now we're very 
focused on doing that in the new things that people are doing, and Stories is 
a big part of that, Messaging will be further out, but as important as w
ell. So 
I think the fact that we've already gotten 2 million advertisers to move into 
Stories is because we've gotten better at making it easier. We launched our 
automatic placements and expanded it, which converts feed ads into a 
format that works for Sto
ries and delivers the ads wherever they'll get the 
best results. So our goal is to make it as easy as possible for marketers to 
get to the format of Stories and then deliver the ads where they're going to 
get the best experience and the best ROI. Now right
 
now, one of the 
interesting things about Stories is there's a benefit to being an early 
adopter. So the pricing is really attractive. And so we think the mix shift to 
Stories is a big opportunity for us and it's going to take time to continue to 
get adver
tisers in, but we're very happy with demand to date.
 
David Wehner
 
I would just 
-
 
before we turn to Mark, I'd just layer in on the Stories front. 
When we look into 2019, we do expect to see a deceleration of revenue 
growth throughout the year. And while we 
have opportunities to grow 
impressions on Facebook and Instagram, that's less so in feed, where we 
already have healthy ad loads in 
-
 
on both surfaces and more in Stories 
where we have lower CPMs. So 
-
 
whereas in 2018, we benefited from strong 
impressions 
growth on Instagram in both feed and Stories. We'll be more 
reliant on Stories impression growth in 2019. And from a pricing perspective, 
there's 
-
 
we've got to improve our ability to grow the number of advertisers 
using Stories and improve price there, bu
t it's going to be more reliant on 
that in terms of revenue growth.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
All right. I can talk about messaging and the integration that we're thinking 
about, but first, we're really early in thinking through this. So there's a lot 
more that we n
eed to figure out before we finalize the plans. And then, of 
course, this is going to be a long
-
term project that I think will probably be to 
whatever extent we end up doing it in 
-
 
a 2020 thing or beyond. There are a 
few big reasons why I'm excited about 
this and think it'll be good for the 
user experience, which is the reason that we're doing it. I mean, part of the 
question was about a commercial benefit, but that really isn't the big focus 
here. The first reason that I'm excited about this is moving mor
e to end
-
to
-
end encryption by default in more of our products. People really like this in 
WhatsApp. I think it's the direction that we should be going in with more 
things in the future. And I think if there's an opportunity to use the work 
that we've done 
with WhatsApp there, rather than doing it in different ways 
in the different messaging experiences, to have that really just 
-
 
to have 
encryption work in a consistent way across the different things that we're 
doing. There are also a number of cases that w
e see where people tell us 
that they want to be able to message across the different services.
 
So one example is a lot of people, hundreds of millions of people, are using 
Marketplace on Facebook now, and a lot of people are using that in countries 
where W
hatsApp is the primary messaging app that they use. So we have 
these experiences today where we're building Marketplace and you go to 
message someone to buy something. And the link to basically do the 
messaging is over Messenger, but in that country, where
 
people really want 
to be using it, is WhatsApp and we need to make it so that people can 
communicate across the different networks and graphs that they have or be 
able to do that integration better in order to facilitate more transactions and 
connections 
there. Another example is there are tens of millions of people, 
maybe more, but I'll go with that, who, on Android, use Messenger as not 
only their app for Facebook messaging but also for SMS, as their SMS client. 
And going back to the encryption point fro
m before, we think that there's an 
opportunity to, when you're going to go message someone over a phone 
number network, have that primarily go over WhatsApp and be end
-
to
-
end 
encrypted rather than go over SMS where it's unencrypted and less secure. 
So I ca
n give you a few more examples like that, but I guess the way that 
I'm thinking about this is that there's a handful of cases that people are 
telling us that they want to be able to integrate and communicate more 
easily across the networks. I think moving 
more towards end
-
to
-
end 
encryption and improving security there is the right direction to go in. 
There's a lot of questions there that we need to work through. So we're 
working through this in a deliberative way. And I wouldn't expect anything 
here to laun
ch soon, but this is definitely something that we're thinking 
about and that I think will improve the user experience.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Two, if I could. One, Mark, on Facebook Watch, w
hat do you think are some 
of the things you're still trying to solve for on either the content side or the 
consumer engagement side to drive broader adoption of Watch and turning 
it into sort of the mechanism for customers that you're trying to solve for 
o
ver the medium to long term? I'd love to understand how you see the 
opportunity and the challenge that's just in front of the company. And 
second, there was a fair bit of noise in the advertising community about the 
macro environment at the end of 2018 and
 
maybe at the beginning of 2019 
with things like Brexit and the government shutdown in the U.S. Are you 
seeing anything on the macro front in your own business either exiting 2018 
or should start in this year?
 
David Wehner
 
Yes, I can...
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Tak
e that first one and then I'll...
 
David Wehner
 
Yes, I can start on the macro environment, Eric. Obviously, we delivered 
strong results in Q4. As we look out into 2019 further, that's 
-
 
the macro 
economy is certainly a potential headwind and risk to the bus
iness just given 
the sensitivity of the advertising business to a slowdown in growth. 
Obviously, we believe we've got the best advertising products out there in 
terms of being able to deliver measurable business results to clients. And so 
we think that doe
s help us in that environment, but clearly, macroeconomics 
stands out there as a risk on top of other issues that we face, leading to a 
deceleration of revenue growth in 2019.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I'll talk about Watch and video. So there, we've really had this
 
dynamic over 
the last 12 to 18 months where we've limited the amount of video that we've 
shown in order to make sure 
-
 
in News Feed, to make sure that it doesn't 
displace interactions, social interactions that people are having. And the big 
thing that unl
ocked a lot of growth in Watch is we basically were able to 
move a bunch of the video
-
watching behavior to a different tab, where 
people intentionally go to the tab because they want to watch a video and 
browse and see what's going on. And that has allowed
 
us to really increase 
the amount of video that people are watching without getting in the way of 
the core mission of what we do, which is helping people interact.
 
The two big things that we're really focused on now in Watch are, within the 
Watch tab, also
 
just making sure that the consumption isn't all just passive 
consumption and making it so that there are more two
-
way interactions 
between viewers and the creators and that we can help build community 
around that, where we've built this great feature, Wat
ch Party, that allows 
people to come together with their friends to watch different content and 
premiers. It's a new feature that allows people to basically take a video and 
stream it live for the first time when it comes out. So these are all things 
that 
make it so the video
-
watching experience isn't just about passive 
consumption but about interaction, and that's going to, I think, help really 
drive engagement as well. Then there's also the monetization side for 
creators, which is going to be really impor
tant for making it so that we have 
the content that people want to consume. And that's just a big thing that 
we're continuing to focus on. We think that the more money that creators 
can make through Watch, there will be a virtuous cycle there. And that's 
g
oing to be really important for continuing to grow this as well. But right 
now, it looks like this is going in a good direction. It's still very early. We're 
still growing quickly but from a small base, but it's one of the things that I'm 
excited about for
 
this year.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
One for Mark and one for Dave. Mark, it's been more than a year since you 
shifted to feeds for more friends and family and removed the passive videos, 
a
s you just talked about, and reported engagement numbers, obviously 
good. Are there any signs that the changes you made a year ago are now 
having a more positive impact on engagement in the core Facebook feed? 
And then, Dave, you talked 3 months ago about 
better aligning revenue and 
expenses in 2020. I was just curious if that's still your view at this point. 
What gives you the confidence you can do that? And what changes most 
from a spending perspective as you look toward 2020?
 
David Wehner
 
Yes, I can star
t on the expense front. We continue to have an outlook for 
expense growth in 2019 of 40% to 50% total expense growth. We did see 
headcount growth come down modestly in Q4 from Q3 to 42%. As we look 
out, we do expect that beyond 2018 
-
 
sorry, beyond 2019, w
e'll have 
expense growth more in line with revenue growth. But we do plan to 
continue to invest aggressively in the priority areas, including on the 
innovation side with AR/VR and AI and continuing to invest in the safety and 
security programs that we're u
ndergoing. And then CapEx, we'll see continue 
to flow in through the P&L over time. And you already saw that pick up with 
the cost of revenue growth in Q4. And so we'll expect to see more of that 
flow through over time. So I would say, we do plan to contin
ue to invest 
aggressively in the business going forward, and we are going to see, 
obviously, a margin impact from that in 2019.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
And I can talk a bit about meaningful social interactions, although I don't 
have any specific metrics to share on this. I mean, my own take of this, I 
think this has gone pretty well and has done what we had hoped, although 
we've made a number of changes. 
This is a long
-
term direction that we're 
going to continue making more ranking changes and building more products 
around, but I think that this is kind of reflected broadly in the numbers that 
you see on engagement and the growth in daily actives and how p
eople are 
engaging across the family of apps. At the time, what I basically said was, 
that even though this might decrease time spent and we expected that it 
would, is we took out especially a bunch of watching of viral videos. We 
thought that helping peop
le interact more was the unique thing that people 
come to our services for and that it would be good for the community and 
the business over the long term. And certainly, everything that we've seen 
since then suggests that, that is right.
 
Operator
 
Your nex
t question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
Great. A couple of questions. First, pretty rough press cycle in Q4. Did you 
see any impact in the U.S. and Europe on engagement or usage or people 
closing their 
accounts? It certainly doesn't seem evident in MAU numbers. 
But just anecdotally, did you see any impact or 
-
 
on that? And then maybe 
to Sheryl, if we look at trailing 12 month monetization in the U.S. ARPU, it's 
about $110. And just how do you think about
 
that long term? If you improve 
targeting, is there room to grow that significantly? Obviously, Instagram's a 
growth platform that's contributing to that there. But just how do you think 
about where ARPU is and where it could be very long term?
 
David Wehne
r
 
Justin, I can probably take both of those. In terms of our ability to continue 
to grow the advertising business, it's about working to develop the best 
products we can to enable advertisers to achieve their end business results. 
Targeting is obviously ve
ry important in that. One of the things I would point 
out is that from a pricing perspective, there are headwinds that we might 
face on targeting, given the overall privacy landscape in 2019. And so I think 
that is another factor that presents risk in our 
ability to continue to grow 
ARPU. So I would point that out as being an issue. As well, we're seeing a 
mix shift towards Stories. And that is going to be something that will 
contribute to a deceleration of our revenue growth. So that's another factor 
that'
s leading to deceleration of revenue growth in 2019. In terms of your 
first question, Justin, about the impact of the press cycle, I would just 
-
 
I'd 
probably just let the numbers stand for themselves. We saw that we are 
growing in all regions albeit we're
 
sort of bouncing around in the developed 
markets like the U.S. and Canada. In Q4, we saw better growth in Europe 
because we've come off of the GDPR 
-
 
the first two quarters of GDPR. So we 
saw a little bit of a rebound there.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
I'll talk a li
ttle bit about long
-
term growth opportunities. David is, of course, 
right that the mix shift and pricing continues to be an issue. But I think over 
the very long term, which is how you framed your question, we have a lot of 
opportunity. If you look at what
 
percentage of our ads are truly relevant to 
the people who are seeing them, I think we've done a lot better over the last 
couple of years, but we have a long way to go. And that means that for 
every ad we show, that ad can be better, better for people, sh
ow something 
they're more interested in. I also think the shift we're seeing towards people 
doing more measurable results, and this is important to understand. It's not 
just what people think of as direct response advertisers. It's some of the 
largest bran
ds in the world really going for the results that they're looking 
for. That bodes very well for our business because we think we can do that 
very efficiently. And then when we have new opportunities that open up like 
Stories, even with some pressure on pri
cing, we think that gives us more 
inventory and more opportunity and more formats, and we haven't really 
even gotten started on future things like messaging. So over the very long 
run, I think we remain very optimistic about the growth opportunities we 
hav
e.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital 
Markets.
 
Zachary Schwartzman
 
It's Zachary Schwartzman on for Mark. Mark, I have a question on data 
privacy as it relates to your 2019 goal of progressing major social issue
s. 
This is a topic that is important for the Internet ecosystem as a whole and 
not just Facebook, and it appears that regulators are struggling to come up 
with comprehensive reform that it's appropriate for all stakeholders 
involved. Facebook has invested 
a lot to improve data privacy, transparency 
and trust in the platform over the last year, but I wanted to hear your 
thoughts on the following. In your Facebook post at the end of 2018, you 
asked the question of whether we should decentralize authority thro
ugh 
encryption or other means to put more power into the people's hands and 
that you plan to discuss these topics in the public domains. As the 
accumulation of data and micro targeting increases, so can the value of 
individual's data. Do you see a future w
here individuals are compensated for 
renting their data to Facebook and other tech companies? Will that be in the 
form of crypto through decentralized blockchains or other methods like a 
traffic acquisition cost? I know we're in early days and due to scala
bility and 
consumer adoption roadblocks, this isn't possible yet, but do you believe 
these technologies are real existential risk or perhaps even a solution to the 
current data privacy trust and control issues on the Internet?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I mean, this 
is a really important question, one that we are spending a lot of 
time on, broadly thinking about. I do generally 
-
 
I mean, I believe very 
strongly in trying to decentralize and put power in individual's hands. I 
mean, that's always been the first part of 
the mission of Facebook, is giving 
people the power to share, to connect, to come together and build 
communities, but give people the power has always been the primary and 
first thing that we have focused on. And one of the ways that we're talking 
about de
centralization is through end
-
to
-
end encryption in messaging. I do 
think that there is a very broad sense, as you're saying, that 
-
 
and greater 
awareness that having data stored for long periods of time with companies 
cannot only be an asset, and that it c
an help provide better services but can 
also be a liability in that there could be breaches or the data could be used 
in ways that weren't intended.
 
And I think people broadly are starting to get that more, which is why things 
like encryption are so attrac
tive to people and why features around 
ephemerality or keeping data less permanently are becoming increasingly 
important. So when you think about the types of products that we're 
building on messaging, where encryption is going to play a huge role, 
sharing
 
with your friends, where Stories, which is ephemeral, is the main 
thing that's growing. I mean, these are really privacy
-
first products, and I 
think that, that's kind of the most important way that we're thinking about 
this whole space overall. I think th
at this is going to become increasingly 
important not just from the perspective of what does the privacy policy say 
but how is this deeply designed into the products that we're building. I 
mean, these are the products that are growing the quickest and thes
e are 
differentiating parts of why they work and why people prefer them as 
opposed to other services. In terms of regulation overall, I think that, that's 
going to be very important. We 
-
 
the basic 
-
 
the principles behind GDPR in 
Europe, I think we're very
 
important, and I think having that codified around 
the world would be a very positive step. And I mean, we're working with 
folks to enable that but I think that, that would be good for people 
everywhere to make sure that basically every person who uses an
 
Internet 
service has the same protections no matter where they live.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche 
Bank.
 
Lloyd Walmsley
 
Two if I can. First, Mark, it sounds like there's really a clear shift this year to 
m
ore aggressive core product development. You talked about a lot of areas 
across Instagram commerce, Messaging, Payments in WhatsApp and many 
more. I guess, are there any that you would point out that could be a 
material contributor to revenue over the next
 
2 to 3 years and if 
-
 
I guess, if 
there's, yes, any you would call out? And then, secondly, when you look at 
the Stories ad in adoption, is there any difference you're seeing between the 
more sophisticated advertisers and smaller advertisers either in ter
ms of 
adoption or performance? And do you see any inhibitions to long
-
term 
success among smaller advertisers with the format? Or do you think they 
can compete effectively in the creative side?
 
David Wehner
 
Lloyd, I'll take 
-
 
it's Dave. I'll take the first 
one in terms of material 
contributors to revenue. Look, I think on a lot of those fronts, it's very early. 
I'd say commerce broadly and e
-
commerce is an important vertical for our 
advertising business. So our success in building 
-
 
continuing to build good 
advertising products for our e
-
commerce clients on the advertising side will 
be a more important contributor to revenue in the foreseeable future than 
the new area. So that's what I would focus on. I think those are still very 
small and we're very early in
 
those being anything from a contribution point 
of view on revenue. And then I think you had a question on the Stories ad. I 
think Sheryl will take that.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Yes, I can take that. So at 2 million advertisers in Stories, we're obviously 
seeing b
road adoption and that means you have both. You have large 
advertisers and small advertisers. It's definitely the case that sometimes 
small advertisers or medium
-
sized advertisers can sometimes move the 
fastest. But one of the things we're most proud of, a
nd Mark talked about it 
in his remarks as well, is that we take tools that were previously only 
available to large companies and make them available to small companies. 
And one of the things we've learned over the years is that the easier we 
make it for ou
r advertisers, whether they're really big or really small, the 
more they'll adopt. So what 
-
 
with the work we've done to ""We'll take your 
pictures, we'll take your post and we'll create the story for you,"" we do 
automatic placements, I think that makes it 
easier. And I'll share one 
specific example of a medium
-
sized company. Cetaphil is a skin care brand. 
They ran video ads across IG 
-
 
Instagram Stories, Instagram feed and 
Facebook, targeted to Canadian women aged 25 to 54, and they were 
measuring all the w
ay through to sales and they saw almost a 7%, so 6.9% 
lift in store sales. So what we want to do is get marketers to use our tools, 
use the technology we have to do automatic placements, show people things 
they're interested in, so ads are a good experienc
e, but really help them ring 
the cash registers so that they know their dollars or their pound or their euro 
are well spent, and that's what we're pushing to do.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
And I'll add one thing, which I think David has said this a couple of times, 
b
ut I think it's worth emphasizing that while I'm excited about the road map 
that we have and it's going to be great over the long term, the growth of the 
business over the next year, a few quarters or the near term is going to be 
mostly based on the growth
 
of Stories and the core News Feed work. And 
Stories is 
-
 
we have a lot of work still to go there to make it 
-
 
monetize at 
the same levels as News Feed. And I'm confident that we're going to get 
there, but I want to make sure that we're giving the right ou
tlook on how we 
expect the near future to go.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.
 
Mark May
 
First, regarding Stories again. Given the size of the WhatsApp audience and 
the amount of status posts on that platform, just 
curious about your early 
learnings from testing status ads on WhatsApp and how optimistic are you 
that, that will become an interesting and meaningful opportunity going 
forward. And in terms of Stories on Facebook, from what we can gather, 
Stories consumpt
ion and impression volume on the core Facebook ad seems 
to maybe not be scaling as fast as some of it and maybe even that some of 
your comments last year suggested that, that in 
-
 
if, in fact, that's true, do 
you 
-
 
why do you think that, that is? And does 
that actually pose any sort of 
issue to your long
-
term growth plans for Stories, at least on that platform?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Yes. So WhatsApp, we don't have ads in Stories. It's not available. Ads are 
something that's more of a future thing for WhatsApp. We
 
remain very 
focused on the consumer experience there. We do have the WhatsApp 
Business app, which is helping businesses connect with consumers, and 
that's growing well but that monetization opportunity is not available.
 
David Wehner
 
Yes. And Stories on Fa
cebook, clearly, Stories is a big success on Instagram. 
From an impression growth perspective, we're pleased with what we're 
seeing there, and we're optimistic on our ability to grow Stories on Facebook 
but it's much earlier on the Facebook platform. So we
 
have to just continue 
to work to build that format on Facebook.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. And just to add quickly, I mean, Stories on Facebook is growing quickly. 
I think we're going to get to where we need to get to there. We started a 
little bit later, and s
ome of the early execution, I think, wasn't as good as it 
needed to be. But I think we're doing good work there now and it's growing 
quite quickly. So I'm confident about where we're going to be there.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ros
s Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sandler
 
I guess, a question on Messenger. Any learnings from the monetization 
efforts at Messenger? You've got inbox ads that you've done. You just 
mentioned Stories ads are starting to enter Messenger. So I guess, what are 
yo
u seeing there? And what are you most excited about as far as monetizing 
Messenger? And I guess, what might be applicable at some point in the 
future to WhatsApp? And then, Mark, you mentioned Payments in WhatsApp. 
We know that you guys have been working o
n that for a little while in the 
background, but any thoughts on how that's going to play out in terms of 
what geographic markets that might be available? And then 
-
 
and kind of 
what do you see as the future opportunity in Payments?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Our app
roach to monetization anywhere is always very cautious and we are 
very 
-
 
moving very slowly on Messenger, where we remain primarily focused 
on consumer growth and engagement. Our real focus has been on the 
organic connections between businesses and consume
rs, where this is a 
really strong channel for customer service. We now have 10 billion messages 
being sent between people and businesses every month. And of course, that 
includes automated messages as well. We continue to make progress with 
monetization. W
e're starting to roll out Stories ads, but it is very early days 
and we think it will be a long road ahead. It's also probably worth noting 
that the experiences we had to date, moving from Facebook to Instagram, 
were more similar, that the Instagram feed i
s similar to the Facebook feed in 
terms of what you can do with advertising. And so Messenger and 
messaging services, if Stories is one click different from that, that's a few 
clicks different than that. So we're going to have some real work to do.

Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Robert W. 
Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Mark, you mentioned Facebook Groups as one part of the community effort. 
And I wonder if you could expand on how you see Groups gaining a higher 
profile and h
ow that extends to other apps potentially? And then, secondly, 
listening to the descriptions of the convergence of features and usage across 
the apps, such as in Stories and messages, I wonder how we should think 
about how that could impact usage and engag
ement if people are also 
converging their own use into 1 or 2 apps instead of the broad suite if that's 
something that we should keep an eye on.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
All right. So for Groups, the main thing that we're focused on is making it so 
that connecting 
with communities of people that you're interested in is going 
to be as central to the experience as connecting with friends and family. So 
it's not just a feature. It's going to become more of an organizing principle 
for more of the activity in the app. An
d friends and family is always going to 
be really central to what we do, but we just think that there's an opportunity 
now to do more and to make it so that people can also be a part of these 
meaningful communities. Hundreds of millions of people already t
ell us that 
the groups that they're a part of on Facebook or at least a few meaningful 
ones are the most important part of their social experience. There's a lot of 
data, sociological data outside, that shows that a physical group membership 
in the world o
ff the Internet has been declining for decades. So I think that 
building groups is 
-
 
it obviously cannot replace people getting together in 
person, and a lot of the most successful groups are successful because they 
facilitate people going and doing things
 
together in person as well. But we 
think that this is a real human need and a sociological need and it's an 
important thing that people need to do. And I think it's going to be one of 
the next big areas that I'm really excited about the Facebook uptick. I
t's 
worth pointing out here that while Instagram doesn't have Groups, we also 
really focus on community and interest there, more around discovery and 
hashtags and explore, being able to really delve into your interests and 
interact with people who are inte
rested in the same things that you are 
there, even if they're not your friends. So that's going to be an increasing 
part of that experience too. I think there might have been another question 
but I 
-
 
no? All right.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from th
e line of Rich Greenfield from BTIG.
 
Richard Greenfield
 
If I think about kind of the San Francisco Valley kind of elitist community 
and even, I think, a good chunk of Wall Street, there's been this kind of 
ongoing narrative that nobody uses core Facebook b
lue anymore and really, 
time spent is all about Instagram. Your DAU numbers obviously give a good 
sense that people are touching Facebook still, core Facebook on a regular 
basis, but we don't really get any sense of engagement with Facebook 
versus your oth
er apps. Is there anything you can do to give us some color 
or sense? I mean, you've talked about Marketplace before on the call, but 
any way of getting a sense of actual usage trends and what you're seeing in 
terms of core Facebook versus Instagram versus
 
the communications apps, 
et cetera?
 
David Wehner
 
Rich, it's Dave. Look, I think the DAU trends that we're giving really do paint 
the picture broadly, which is stability in the developed markets, growth for 
Facebook blue in the developing markets. We're no
t giving an update on 
time spent. That's not our major focus. We pivoted to focus on meaningful 
social interactions and we've been pleased with the results of that effort 
broadly, but I think that DAU trends tell the story broadly.
 
Operator
 
Your last 
question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
 
John Blackledge
 
For Mark, just curious if you're happy with the progress around the safety 
and security initiatives. And going forward, is there any kind of recurring 
metric or anything you can di
sclose to show progress that you guys might 
see internally but Facebook users and other constituents maybe don't see? 
And then just a quick one on pricing on Instagram Stories. Should we expect 
to see the pricing gap close between feed and Stories over the
 
course of 
2019?
 
David Wehner
 
John, I can real quickly take the pricing question first. The reality is pricing is 
a function of supply and demand and how demand grows versus supply. So 
while I do expect that we'll bring more advertisers to Stories and we'l
l bring 
more advertising formats to Stories and that will create more demand for 
Stories, we're also growing Stories inventory quickly. So those two things 
will balance out in price. Feed from a growth perspective on an impression 
front is more constrained
 
given where we are with ad loads on Facebook and 
Instagram. So there'll be more pricing pressure there because there's 
already strong demand for feed products. So in terms of convergence, it's 
hard to say how those things will play out. We do think there'
s opportunities 
to improve the value of the Stories format that will translate into better price 
for Stories. But how it converges over time, there's a lot of different 
dynamics there.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes. And on all the content and safety and security iss
ues, there's more to 
do here but I'm proud of the work that we've done to get in front of a lot 
more of these issues. If you think about the journey that the company has 
really been on for the last couple of years, it's moving from reactively 
dealing with 
issues that our community flags. Perhaps if someone sees some 
content that's problematic, they used to tell us about it and then we'd go 
look at it to now, increasingly, we're building AI systems and we have tens 
of thousands of people who are doing more p
roactive review of content that 
could be potentially problematic. And we're prioritizing the different types of 
content that we think could create the most harm. So one of the things that 
we worked on earliest was removing terrorist propaganda. One of the 
things 
that we're proud of there is, there are now 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda 
content that we take down, our AI flags it, removes it before people see it. 
Another area that we really care about that's deeply important is self
-
harm, 
right? And that's an a
rea where the goal isn't to take down the content, but 
if we see an area where 
-
 
if we see something that a person might be 
thinking about hurting themselves, we now have thousands of people and 
technical tools that can flag this content to those people to
 
-
 
so we can 
actually go get first responders to go reach out to people.
 
And I think in the last six months or a year alone, there have been 
hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where we're we've been able to get first 
responders to people when they needed
 
help because of this approach of 
being more proactive on looking at the content. The same goes for things 
around election interference and more proactively looking for inauthentic 
behavior. And we've taken down a lot of effort by different nation states t
o 
harm or interfere in elections that way. So we're just going to go down the 
list of every basic type of bad content. And we do report this publicly, going 
back to your question. We issue a transparency report. It's our content 
enforcement report. Right n
ow, we're doing it, I think it's every six months, 
but the goal is to get that to the cadence by, I think it's the end of this year, 
we're going to be doing it quarterly and doing calls to discuss the results just 
like we do for earnings because we think t
hat this stuff is really important as 
well, at the same level there.
 
So where I come to summarize where I think we are, coming into 2019 is, 
2017 and 2018 were really 
-
 
we had a lot of hard work to do, but we also 
needed to figure out what the road map was
 
going to be going forward. And 
while we haven't solved all of the issues yet 
-
 
you never solve all of the 
issues, but we certainly have a lot more to do on our road map. The way 
that I feel starting 2019 is that we have clear road maps for what we need 
to
 
go do. And I think you're going to be able to look at these transparency 
reports as we issue them and see that we're continually making more 
progress, finding more of the content proactively, taking 
-
 
getting better at 
taking it down, getting better at no
t distributing stuff that's borderline. And 
that's just some of the most important work that we're doing. It's also the 
first priority again for this year, is making 
-
 
continuing to make progress on 
the big, substantive issues facing the Internet and our c
ompany because 
there's still a lot more to do here, and this is incredibly important. But I do 
feel like we've started to turn a corner and have a clear plan for what we 
need to do here now. So thanks for that question.

Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today.
 
We started 2016 off well. 1.65 
billion people now use Facebook every month 
and 1.09 billion people use Facebook every day. In recent weeks, we're also 
consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile 
every day.
 
We're also pleased with our business results. Total r
evenue this quarter grew 
by 52% year on year to $5.4 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 57% 
to $5.2 billion. I'll have more to say about these results in a minute, but first 
I want to talk about a proposal by our Board of Directors to reclassify 
Face
book stock.
 
At F8, I talked about our mission and how the work we're doing to connect 
the world is more important today than it's ever been. I walked through our 
10
-
year roadmap, focused on building the technology to give everyone in 
the world the power to
 
share anything with anyone. Bringing people together 
and giving everyone a voice takes a long
-
term commitment, not just over 
the next few years but over the next few decades. We're focused on the long 
term, and that's the main reason for today's proposal.
 
Facebook has always been a foundry
-
light company, so we can focus on our 
mission and build long
-
term value. This structure has served our 
shareholders well. Early on, we received some generous offers for companies 
trying to buy Facebook, and our structure
 
helped us resist that pressure. 
More recently, we navigated a challenging transition to mobile. But because 
we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user 
and product experience of our apps first and then build a strong mobile 
b
usiness over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted. 
And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on 
acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were 
good decisions for our community and our b
usiness.
 
Facebook has been built by a series of bold moves. And when I look out into 
the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us. We're 
focused not on what Facebook is, but on what it can be and on what it needs 
to be, and that means doing
 
bold things. A lot of what we're building today 
in areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented 
reality may not pay off for years, but they're important to our mission of 
connecting the world. And I'm committed to seeing thi
s mission through and 
to leading Facebook there over the long term.
 
Personally, there's another element to this. While helping to connect the 
world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more 
global challenges that I also feel a respo
nsibility to help solve to create a 
better world for my daughter and all future generations, things like: helping 
to cure all disease by the end of the century; upgrading our education 
system so it's personalized for each student; and protecting our enviro
nment 
from climate change. That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg 
Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance 
human potential and promote equality.
 
Today's board proposal will allow us to maintain and improve the 
voting 
structure that has served us well and allow me to fund the Chan Zuckerberg 
Initiative. In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 
billion worth of stock 

 
Facebook shares per year over the next three years. 
That's still my commitme
nt, and I'll update our shareholders on future plans 
beyond that. Dave will talk more about the mechanics of this proposal in his 
comments in just a few minutes.
 
But before we get there, I want also share a few more thoughts on the 
progress we've made this
 
quarter. As I said before, our roadmap has three 
horizons. Over the next three years, we're going to keep investing in our 
most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform. Today, people 
around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day 
using 
Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, and that doesn't even include 
WhatsApp yet.
 
This growth isn't happening because we came up with just one or two big 
changes. Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements 
over a long period of time
, and that progress continued in the first quarter. 
We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, 
and we improved our products to work on different mobile networks and 
devices all over the world. Sheryl will talk more about this in 
a minute, but 
now more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every 
month. We've expanded our measurement capabilities so more businesses 
can see the results they get from ads. And we've made it easier for small 
and medium businesses 
to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that 
our larger advertisers use.
 
Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around our 
products that are already being used by a lot of people. We're at the 
beginning of a golden age of online v
ideo. Video isn't just a single kind of 
content. We think it's a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new 
ways. So that's why in addition to normal Internet video, we're also focusing 
on more interactive video experiences like Live and 360 vid
eo. I'm a big 
Game of Thrones fan, and the other week HBO and our Oculus team came 
out with a 360 video of the opening sequence of the show. And it's now the 
most watched 360 video on Facebook in any 24
-
hour period, with more than 
12 million total views.
 
E
arlier this month, we opened up Live to everyone. Live is just one part of 
our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential. Friends go Live 
because it's unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go Live 
because they can reach bigger
 
audiences in some cases than they can on 
even their own shows. And if we do a good job, we think it's something that 
people will associate with Facebook, with interacting with people and not just 
watching content. But it's also a very new and small part o
f all of the videos 
that we see on Facebook today.
 
I'm also really excited about what we're building around messaging. Right 
now we have two of the top messaging apps in the world. Nine hundred 
million people use Messenger every month, and 1 billion people
 
use 
WhatsApp every month. Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send 
around 60 billion messages every day, and that's almost three times as 
many messages as SMS handled at its peak.
 
Over the past couple of weeks, we've talked about steps we're taking to 
build messaging into a platform that developers and businesses can build on. 
We have Thoughts for Messenger that let you do things like order flowers or 
get news without leaving your Messenger thread. But this is all very early, 
and we're rolling these exp
eriences out carefully and slowly over time.
 
We're also very happy with the way that Instagram is growing, with more 
than 400 million actives and more than 200,000 businesses advertising 
every month. Now we're focused on making the user experience even mor
e 
engaging. With more content on Instagram all the time, people are currently 
missing about 70% of what's in their feed. So that's why in the first quarter, 
we started rolling out Feed Ranking to help you see more of the posts that 
you care about. This is 
a long
-
term effort. But News Feed shows that ranking 
creates the best and most engaging experiences for our community.
 
Over the next 10 years, we're going to keep investing in new technology to 
help everyone connect. As part of Internet.org, we're building
 
an open 
source telco infrastructure project called TIP [Telecom Infra Project] to make 
it cheaper to operate mobile networks. Free Basics, which helps people 
access tools for education, health information, and communication for free, 
now features more tha
n 600 services, and it has brought more than 25 
million people online. That makes it one of the most successful connectivity 
initiatives in the world.
 
We're also working to help people connect and share in a more natural and 
intuitive way. Artificial intel
ligence is a long
-
term effort for us, but we're 
already using it in lots of ways. Right now, our Moments app is using face 
recognition to help you share pictures with your friends. We're using AI to 
show the most relevant content in news feeds, filter spam
 
and messaging, 
and even help blind people understand what's in their friends' photos by 
reading explanations of them aloud.
 
Finally, we're building technology in virtual and augmented reality that can 
change the way that we all experience the world. Gear 
VR started shipping 
late last year, and the response so far has been great. There are now 
hundreds of apps built specifically for Gear, and people have watched more 
than 2 million hours of video on it.
 
In Q1, we also started shipping Oculus Rift. We've got
 
a lot of great content, 
with more than 50 games and apps built for Rift. And again, this is very 
early, and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right 
away. I really want to emphasize that. Most Rift early adopters are gamers 
and develop
ers. But eventually, we believe that VR is going to be the next 
big computing platform, and we're making the investments necessary to 
lead the way there.
 
So that's our update for the quarter. As always, everything we do is focused 
on our mission to 
make the world more open and connected. And to get 
there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps 
everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone. It takes a 
long
-
term commitment and it won't happen overnight, but we
're in a strong 
position, and I'm excited about what's next. So thank you to everyone in our 
community, to all of our teams, all of our partners, and all of our 
shareholders for everything you're doing to help connect the world.
 
And now here's Sheryl.

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone.
 
We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue 
grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached 
$4.2 billion, up 75% year
 
over year, and is now approximately 82% of total 
ad revenue. Our growth was strong across all verticals, marketer segments, 
and regions, particularly North America and APAC.
 
We remain focused on driving our clients' businesses, moving their products 
off s
helves both in stores and online. A big focus for us in 2016 is helping 
our clients understand the true business impact of their ads, especially on 
digital. We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our three 
priorities: capitalizing on the shif
t to mobile; growing the number of 
marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and 
effective.
 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Consumers have shifted to mobile, 
and businesses know they need to catch up. We hear from market
ers that 
figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days. But given 
where consumers spend their time, the question now is not if they should 
market on mobile, but how.
 
One of the drivers of the consumer shift to mobile is video. People 
are 
sharing and creating nearly three times more video on Facebook than they 
were a year ago. And as of February, the time people spend watching videos 
on Instagram increased by more than 40% over the preceding six months. 
This presents a big opportunity f
or marketers.
 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently on mobile 
feed than on TV. They create ads that grab attention in the first few 
seconds, sometimes even without sound, what we now call thumb
-
stopping 
creative. For example, Ne
stlé took their TV ad for Natural Bliss coffee 
creamer and in less than a day edited it for mobile feed by creating a new 
opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound. 
They showed both the original TV ad and the mobile ad on Facebo
ok. The 
original TV ad drove a four
-
point increase in ad recall. The mobile
-
optimized 
version, however, drove an even stronger 10
-
point increase in ad recall and 
a seven
-
point increase in product awareness.
 
We want to help marketers optimize their video ad
s. For example, we know 
that on average, captioned videos increase view time by 12%, so we 
introduced Auto Captions to generate captions for video ads. In Q1 we 
introduced new ad formats like Canvas ads. Canvas ads showcase products 
by combining video imag
es and call
-
to
-
action buttons. While it's still early, 
we're pleased with the results and are seeing adoption across many 
verticals.
 
To motivate millennials to take on do
-
it
-
yourself projects, Lowe's and BBDO 
targeted 25 to 34
-
year
-
old homeowners with Canv
as ads that let them see 
bathroom designs, discover the products in each design, and tap to 
purchase. The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 
seconds interacting with them, and Lowe's saw a 6.7 times return on 
AdSense.
 
Our second priori
ty is growing the number of marketers using our ad 
products. This quarter we announced that we have over 3 million active 
advertisers on Facebook and over 200,000 on Instagram. A significant 
number of these advertisers are small and medium businesses. Thes
e 
businesses use our platforms because it's easy and affordable for them to 
connect with their consumers on mobile. We're also making it easier for 
SMBs to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our most 
sophisticated advertisers use. We're seein
g even small businesses use 
products like Lead Ads, Slideshow, and Dynamic Product Ads.
 
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. 
Last year we introduced Conversion Lift to measure how Facebook and 
Instagram campaigns driv
e business objectives like sales. We've seen clients 
across verticals from retail to auto use Conversion Lift to measure and 
improve the return on their ad investments. Chase Bank used Conversion 
Lift to measure how effectively their Super Bowl ad drove cr
edit card 
applications. They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV 
ads drove 1.5 times more conversions than TV ads alone. In Q1 we 
expanded our Lift capabilities by testing Lift API, enabling more partners to 
measure the effectiveness of m
ore of their campaigns.
 
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress 
we're making across our three priorities. Helping marketers make the shift 
to mobile will take time. We have a lot of hard work ahead, and we'll 
continue t
o invest. I want to thank our clients around the world for their 
partnership and congratulate our global team on the results of their hard 
work.
 
Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave.
 
David M. Wehner

Chief Financial Officer
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good after
noon, everyone.
 
We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and 
engagement of our community and continued momentum in our ads 
business. In Q1 we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered 
over $1.8 billion in free cash flow.
 
Le
t's begin with our community metrics. In March, 1.09 billion people used 
Facebook on an average day, up 16% compared to last year. This daily 
number represents 66% of the 1.65 billion people who visited Facebook in 
the month of March. Mobile continues to d
rive our growth. Over 1.5 billion 
people accessed Facebook for mobile devices in March, up 21% from last 
year.
 
Before diving into our quarterly financial results, I wanted to highlight that 
beginning this quarter, I will focus my prepared remarks on our GA
AP 
results, and all financial metrics are GAAP unless otherwise noted. The 
primary difference between our GAAP non
-
GAAP metrics is stock
-
based 
compensation [SBC]. Stock
-
based compensation plays an important role in 
how we compensate our employees, and ther
efore we view it as a real 
expense to the business. We will continue to provide a reconciliation of GAAP 
to non
-
GAAP financial metrics in our press release and earnings slides. All of 
our comparisons are on a year
-
over
-
year basis unless otherwise noted.
 
Q1
 
total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 52% or 58% on a constant currency 
basis. Ad revenue in Q1 was $5.2 billion, up 57% or 63% on a constant 
currency basis. This marked a slight decline from the 66% constant currency 
ad growth rate we experienced in Q4. In 
Q1 this year, we benefited from an 
additional day due to the leap year, which contributed approximately two 
percentage points to our year
-
over
-
year ad revenue growth rate.
 
North America and Asia
-
Pacific were our fastest
-
growing regions, with 
advertising re
venue growth of 64% and 62% respectively. Europe and rest 
of world grew advertising revenue more slowly, at 49% and 35% 
respectively, with the latter particularly impacted by foreign exchange 
headwinds. Setting aside currency headwinds, all regions exceede
d 50% 
constant currency ad revenue growth.
 
Mobile ad revenue was $4.2 billion, representing approximately 82% of total 
ad revenue. Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from 
Facebook's News Feed. Our mobile ads business continues to be driven by 
t
he combination of both supply
-
side and demand
-
side factors. On the supply 
side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using 
Facebook, time spent across our products, and ad loads. On the demand 
side, we believe the investments we have m
ade to improve our mobile 
advertising solutions are helping drive value for both people and marketers. 
We are seeing growth in both new customers as well as existing customers 
who are spending more with us on average compared to last year.
 
In Q1, the avera
ge price per ad increased 5%, while total ad impressions 
increased 50%. The reported increase in price is being driven by the 
continued mix shift towards mobile, which contains higher priced News Feed 
ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Fee
d ads and lower
-
priced right
-
hand column ads. The increase in impressions was driven by 
strong growth in mobile ad impressions and was offset partially by a decline 
in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the 
ongoing declines in 
PC image.
 
Total payments and other fees revenue was $181 million, down 20% 
compared to last year. This decline was mainly driven by a reduction in 
payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
 
Q1 total costs and expenses were $3.4 billion
, up 29%. We ended the 
quarter with approximately 13,600 employees, up 35% compared to last 
year. Q1 operating income was $2 billion, representing a 37% operating 
margin. Our Q1 tax rate was 27%, down from our full
-
year 2015 tax rate of 
40%. Our Q1 net inc
ome was approximately $1.5 billion, or $0.52 per
-
share.
 
In Q1, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, more than double compared to 
Q1 of last year. Server purchases and data center construction were the 
largest contributors to year
-
over
-
year growth. New b
uilds in Texas and 
Ireland along with the expansion of existing facilities will nearly double our 
current data center footprint when completed. In addition to servers and 
data centers, investments in office facilities also contributed to the year

over

growth. We ended the quarter with $20.6 billion in cash and 
investments.
 
Turning now to the outlook, first, some color on revenue. We remain focused 
on creating value for the people and marketers who use our services. We 
expect that the main drivers of ad
vertising revenue growth will continue 
throughout 2016, but we will face tougher comparables as the year 
progresses given the accelerating ad revenue growth we experienced 
throughout 2015. Payments and other fees revenues will continue to face 
headwinds th
roughout the year, given that the substantial majority of that 
revenue relates to payments from games played on personal computers. 
Even with the expected contribution from Oculus, we anticipate that our 
payments and other fees revenue for the full year 20
16 will come in lower 
than the level in 2015.
 
Next on to the expense outlook; our expense guidance remains unchanged. 
We expect that full
-
year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be 
approximately 30% to 40%. We expect full
-
year 2016 
amortization 
expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million, and full
-
year 
2016 stock
-
based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion 
to $3.3 billion.
 
If you take into account our GAAP expense guidance as well as our 
amortization an
d SBC guidance, you will see that our full
-
year 2016 total 
non
-
GAAP expense growth guidance range remains unchanged at 45% to 
55%. We anticipate full
-
year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the high end 
of the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range we gave last 
quarter, as we invest to 
support the rapid growth of the business. We expect our Q2 and full
-
year 
2016 tax rates to be similar to our Q1 rate.
 
In summary, 2016 is off to a great start for Facebook. Our results reflect 
healthy growth and engagement in our c
ommunity, strength in our ads 
business, and investments we're making to capitalize on the long
-
term 
opportunities we see ahead.
 
Before going to questions, I wanted to touch briefly on the share 
reclassification that Mark discussed at the beginning of the c
all. As we 
disclosed in the proxy statement we filed today, our Board of Directors has 
approved a proposal for the reclassification of our capital stock that would 
involve the creation of a new class of publicly listed non
-
voting Class C 
capital stock. Pen
ding stockholder approval, we intend to issue two Class C 
shares as a one
-
time stock dividend for each outstanding Class A and Class 
B share, resulting in a tripling of the pre
-
reclassification total shares 
outstanding. All stockholders would be treated eq
ually.
 
The net effect of this transaction would be to establish two publicly traded 
classes of Facebook stock, one representing the current Class A shares and 
the other representing the non
-
voting Class C shares. Since the Class C 
shares would have the sam
e economic rights as the Class A and Class B 
shares, we would expect that after the payment of the stock dividend, the 
share price of the Class A common stock would generally reflect a three
-
for
-
one stock split. This will have no effect on the voting inter
est related to 
shares that investors currently hold.
 
As Mark mentioned, this structure will allow for the preservation of the 
voting structure that has served the company well to date while allowing for 
Mark to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the 
course of his lifetime. 
Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multi
-
class 
capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to 
maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.
 
Let me talk about next steps. The recla
ssification would be conditioned on 
approval by a majority of outstanding votes held by company stockholders, 
and we anticipate a vote on the matter at our annual meeting to be held on 
June 20 this year. A record date for this dividend would be determined 
at a 
later date.
 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions.

Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line 
is open.
 
Eric J. Sheridan

UBS Securities LLC
 
Thank you so much. I w
anted to come back to your comments on the small 
and medium
-
sized business opportunity at Facebook, maybe direct a few 
points to Sheryl to get some comment. I wanted to understand what some 
of the opportunities are to continue to demonstrate to those adver
tisers 
what the potential is for both Facebook and maybe even Instagram and 
Facebook Messenger long term as platforms to grow their businesses and 
also pointing out what some of the measurement tools and operating 
challenges are to bring people onto the pl
atform. Thank you.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Thank you for the question. SMBs, or SMUs as they're called in different 
places around the world, we think are a very core competitive advantage for 
us. It's prohibitively expensive
 
for most small businesses to reach people 
digitally. Thirty
-
five percent of small businesses in the United States, which 
is often the most advanced market, don't have a web presence at all. And 
setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download 
a mobile app, 
can be even more expensive.
 
And so what's happening is that SMBs are turning to Facebook pages as 
their mobile solution. They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already 
know how to do them because almost all of them are already Faceboo
k 
users in the first place. And so the onboarding has been incredibly important 
and incredibly effective. We announced last year that we have over 50 
million small business pages active on a monthly basis. Eighty percent of 
those are active on mobile. We t
hen work on helping them use our ad 
products and upsell them to our paid ad products as well, and we announced 
this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 
on Instagram.
 
What's interesting is that what you see is SMBs are a
ble to use the pull of 
some of the biggest brands in the world. So over 2 million SMBs have posted 
a video, both paid and organic, in the last month. And that happens to be 
many times the number of SMBs that have shot or placed a TV commercial.
 
In terms of
 
measurement, your question is important because it's not just 
getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers. It's getting them 
to be able to measure our results. And so we've worked hard to build 
measurement tools into the products, so that wh
en you buy an ad, an SMB 
has a very easy interface and decide what their goals are. Are their goals 
measuring sales? Are their goals clicks to their website? Are their goals 
mobile app downloads? And then measuring all the way through from 
sharing that ad 
to the purchase.
 
I continue and we continue to be very bullish on this channel because we 
have such a broad base of usage, because that usage is so active, and 
because we're very focused on investing in simplifying our products so that 
all SMBs can use the
m.

Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Sheryl, you talked 
about video and increasing the overall video con
sumption. Can you talk 
about where you are on traction with video advertising and the adoption of 
video ad units and the impact of video in the quarter?
 
And then secondly, just breaking down the advertising by cohort, could you 
talk to points of strength o
r weakness across direct response versus branded 
advertisers in the quarter? Thanks.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Sure, I'll take the second one first. Our growth was really broad
-
based, and 
we grew across all of our marketer seg
ments this quarter. That's direct 
response, brands, SMBs, and developers.
 
Our direct response business continues to be very strong. It's very ROI
-
focused, and we continue to invest and roll out products that help people. So 
for example, Lead Ads, where peo
ple can fill out forms on a mobile device, 
take their contact info from Facebook, we've rolled that out fully this 
quarter. And that enables people to use Facebook in a very direct to 
response way, and we'll continue to invest there.
 
Video ads are really e
xciting. It's worth noting that video ads take place on 
another avenue, and receipts are not all of the revenue incrementals 
(28:55). But as consumer engagement with video has continued to grow, 
that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. M
arketers have 
always loved video because it's a really compelling way to reach people. And 
now we can reach them on mobile all day with those kind of messages.
 
Importantly, marketers have to adjust sometimes. While the 30
-
second ad 
does perform well in 
News Feed, we also see people understanding that 
some of the formats are different. Creating shorter ads, creating ads that 
can work even without sound, more personal ads has really mattered.
 
One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 H
ybrid 
with Saatchi in Los Angeles. They used a very broad video to drive brand 
awareness. They reached over 36 million people in a target demo within 
three days. Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they 
retargeted people who watched the 
video with over 500 personalized video 
ads which were optimized for Facebook and Instagram. So they were 
creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions 
like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. We saw a 14
-
point lif
t 
in ad recall, a seven
-
point lift in message association. And right now, we're 
using the Lift tool to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days 
beyond the campaign to see what happens. And we're pretty excited about 
what that shows in terms o
f how video can be used in a really broad
-
based 
way but also a more personal way.

Thanks for taking the questions. I have a cou
ple for Mark around Messenger. 
Mark, I was hoping you could talk to us about how you expect to shift user 
behavior within Messenger to get users to focus more on businesses versus 
more personal communications and how you'll make users aware of the 
capabili
ties within the platform.
 
And then just secondly, as more bots come on board here and businesses 
are engaging with Messenger, how do you envision bots and humans 
working together in terms of providing more customer service? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
Sure. So part of our playbook for building out these ecosystems at scale is 
we start with the person
-
to
-
person user base. So whether that's in 
messaging, it's people messaging their friends or groups and News Fe
ed. 
Before that, it was people posting updates and seeing what was going on 
with their friends and the people that they care about.
 
And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, so 
whether that's businesses, public figures li
ke athletes and celebrities and 
types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, 
and we did that on Facebook in News Feed group pages, and we're working 
on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger. One of those is bo
ts. 
And one of the good things about bots that we've seen is that it can 
decrease the amount of time that you have to wait before you get a reply 
back from interacting with a message.
 
So what we've seen 

 
we've done some research on this. A lot of people 
e
very day in Facebook today are already messaging pages and businesses 
directly, and the businesses respond. But what we've actually also found is 
that through some of our AI research, we can look at the responses that 
businesses give to common questions an
d can confidently provide the right 
reply a lot of the time. And when we can do that, then that decreases the 
latency. And predictably, people want to do more of that activity.
 
So that's one way that I think you're going to see bots work, between people 
wh
o are actually driving the businesses directly will need to in some way 
train or answer questions for people, but we can build artificial intelligence 
that can learn from people how to automate a lot of that and make that 
experience a lot faster for people
 
who want to interact with businesses and 
public figures. And of course then, after you start building out that segment 
of businesses and then public figures on the platform, then on top of that 
you have just a good amount of intent on these platforms to b
uild a good 
business on top of that. That's stage three.

Your next question is from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your 
line is open.
 
John Blackledge

Cowen & Co. LLC
 
Great, thank you, two questions. So Facebook just opened up Instant 
Arti
cles globally to all publishers. I'm just wondering what you see as a 
publisher's benefit in joining Instant Articles. And how we should think about 
the monetization impact in 2016?
 
And then second question, the ad revenue in APAC was much better than we 
t
hought, just any more color on the drivers there. Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg

Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
So Instant Articles is all about the quality of the consumer experience. Right 
now for links that are not Instant Articles, it
 
can be one of the slowest parts 
of the Facebook app. You're browsing through a News Feed, you tap on a 
link, if you're not on a good connection, the content isn't cached, it can take 
10 or 20 seconds in some cases for that content to load. And people in o
ur 
community, they don't know the difference about whether that content is 
coming from Facebook or a different place. They hold us accountable for 
making their experience quick, and we want to do everything we can to do 
that.
 
So Instant Articles makes it s
o that any publisher around the world now can 
deliver a really great native experience instantly with no latency in loading 
it. And we're just seeing that people like to engage with that a lot more. So 
that's where we're most excited about there.
 
Sheryl K.

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
The APAC question, it has been growing really well for several quarters now, 
and we're seeing a lot of great adoption as people learn to use the products. 
One part of the business that I think has been really 
strong and is worth 
noting is we're working with marketers in China to help with their export 
business. So Air China is a good example. They're a popular airline in China, 
but they don't really have 

 
they're not really as well
-
known overseas. And 
before w
orking with us, they really only invested in traditional media.
 
They had a goal of promoting their new flight routes, including one from 
Mumbai to Beijing, and their new aircraft. So they launched a campaign with 
us in 15 countries globally. They used reac
h and frequency and Carousel and 
video ad targeting. And for example, they would target in the U.S. age 18 
and above frequent international travelers living in cities where they had 
routes or Indian expats living in the U.S. to promote new routes to Mumbai
. 
They reached 30 million people globally, more than 95% on mobile. And 
here's the best part, they had a 73% sales lift in the United States. So our 
APAC business is robust, and I think the global nature of our business is part 
of driving that.

Goldman Sachs & Co.
 
Great, thank you. I was just wondering if you could share with us. How do 
you see Instagram's ramp impacting Facebook's ad growth in 2016, 
or if 
there's any color you could share with us about how that's been ramping? 
And also, if you can, share with us how advertisers are viewing the platform. 
Are you finding that it's typically more additive to their Facebook spending, 
or are they funding i
t with existing Facebook budgets? Thank you.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms 
out there. In the short run, some of the spend is incremental and some isn't. 
There are people who will have a social budget or a digital budget. And as 
they move to Instagram, some of that will come from Facebook. In the 
medium to long run, we believe we compare very favorably with any other 
spend we can do because we have this ver
y broad reach on both platforms 
plus the ability to target very specifically. So what you're seeing in our 
results right now are very strong growth for Facebook and very strong 
growth for Instagram. We hit 3 million advertisers for Facebook. We hit 
200,000
 
for Instagram, and often the platforms really work together.

The next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
 
Justin Post 
-
 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 
Thanks, a question for Mark. There have been some concerns about
 
traffic to 
publishers and sharing levels on Facebook. I just wondered if you could talk 
about core Facebook engagement. What's really working? Are you concerned 
at all about that? And then when you think about the ad loads, are you 
comfortable with where 
they're at, is there still a lot of room to go? And then 
maybe last one, if you were to ever leave Facebook, what would happen to 
your voting shares? Thank you.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
 
All right, let's talk abou
t engagement first. So overall sharing is up across 
Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole 
family of apps. And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing 
community, but it's actually also the case on a per
-
per
son basis as well in 
terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually.
 
Now one of the things that we see is that the way that we are sharing is 
always changing, and some of this is because of underlying technical 
transition. So on desktop, 
for example, it's easier to type, so we saw more 
text posts. On mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos. On 
desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos 
that they took from their digital camera and downloaded onto 
their 
computer; whereas on mobile, the more common behavior is to take a single 
photo or a couple and just post those. So there are all these transitions. And 
that's our job, is to make it so that we build great tools that people 

 
everyone around the worl
d can share anything that they want with 
everyone.
 
Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of 
different kinds of audiences. So Facebook gives you the ability to share with 
all of your friends and publicly if you want and
 
with groups. But we're also 
investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp because a lot of people 
want to share increasingly messages privately one on one or with very small 
groups. So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, 
an
d WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook 
Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think 
represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that 
people want to share with.
 
But ultimately,
 
I think that humans have such a deep desire to express 
themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think 
that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should 
grow over time. And it's our job to basically make 
sure that we build good 
products and get rid of all the bugs and make it so the performance is fast, 
and all the basic stuff works, that way we get there. But in general, right 
now all the high
-
level trends look pretty positive on that.
 
I think I'll kick i
t off to Dave to go through your questions about some of the 
technical pieces about the reclassification.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure. I guess, also, Justin, you had a question on ad load, so I'll do both the 
ad load and the question on 
the reclassification. So on ad load, it's definitely 
up from where we were couple of years ago. I think it's really worth 
emphasizing that what has enabled us to do that is just improving the 
quality and the relevance of the ads that we have, and that's en
abled us to 
show more of them without harming the user experience at all. So that's 
been really key. Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a 
less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain 
confident that we've got opp
ortunities to continue to grow supply through 
the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on 
our other apps such as Instagram.
 
On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to 
leave Facebook, I'd just refe
r that the new multi
-
class capital structure is 
generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership 
role at Facebook. And if you go into the proxy materials, it goes into more 
detail on how different things would play out under various 
other scenarios. 
So I would just refer you to those.

Macquarie Capital (

Mark, when you'
re thinking about acquisitions broadly, in what area do you 
think Facebook needs to buy versus build? Basically, where you need 
external help?
 
And then on VR, just a few quick questions, any update on the shipping 
delay, how many units shipped in the quart
er and expectations for the year? 
And then also on VR, understanding I know it's very, very early, but beyond 
games and entertainment, what verticals do you expect to be first to utilize 
VR and AR? Thanks.
 
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg 
-
 
Founder, Chairman & Chief
 
Executive Officer
 
So on the acquisition philosophy, I've talked about how I think the social 
ecosystem will play out on a number of these calls. The basic theory that we 
have is that there are a small number of services that are going to be 
ubiquitous uti
lities that 1 billion or 2 billion or more people are going to want 
to use. So that's core basic messaging, the core functionality around having 
your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family 
online. Those are things that we jus
t think are just going to be ubiquitous. 
So we want to build those.
 
At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good 
businesses and different other social use cases where there are people doing 
good work and building different com
panies that we feel no need to own 
those things. So I think that people come up from time to time and suggest, 
should we buy this company or that. And what we look at are what are the 
things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the m
ost 
talented people in the world to build this. And so when you think about 
something like virtual and augmented reality, that's how we thought about 
that.
 
Those are going to be important platforms over time. It's very early 
obviously. It's going to take a
 
long time to get there. And a lot of what we 
felt like we were buying there was a critical mass of the best people and the 
best technology to go do all the things that we needed to go do over the 
next 10 years to drive that home and turn that into a big p
latform.
 
You asked a question about virtual and augmented reality. What are going to 
be the big use cases? For the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming 
and video are going to be the big ones. The initial market that we look at are 
all the peo
ple who have Xboxes, PlayStations, and Wiis, the people who are 
excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room 
for a long period of time, and that's a pretty big market. Even though that's 
not all of what we hope to eventually s
erve and that's not the full potential 
of these new platforms, I think that is one case where you can obviously 
deliver better and richer experiences than you can with the current 
generation of technology.
 
Video is going really well. I shared a stat before
 
in some of my comments 
that on Gear VR alone, we are now at more than 2 million hours of video 
have been watched on the platform, so that's really exciting. And that of 
course will be bolstered by the fact that these new 360 videos can not only 
be watched
 
in VR, so in the headsets, but we're building tools so you can 
share them on News Feed and through our products elsewhere as well. So I 
think that's exciting. Over time there will be even more, but that I think 
should be enough to have some initial use. B
ut again, I do want to really 
emphasize, this is early and it's going take a long time. And I know there's a 
lot of hype around this, and we're just focused on building this to be very 
good over the long term.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Then
, Ben, you asked about shipping units. We did begin shipping units in 
the quarter. This is very small still. VR is still very early. It's not going to 
have a material impact on revenue in 2016, and I gave more color on that in 
my prepared remarks.

Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
 
Thanks a lot, first one for Sheryl, I think. I'm wondering if you could update 
us on the progress you're seeing with FAN 
[Facebook Audience Network]. 
You gave some metrics in Q4. It seemed like that advertisers were really 
adopting that platform and seeing a lot of additional reach. Maybe if you 
could, tell us how that's going.
 
And then I think a couple more; on the tax rate
, we saw it step down quite a 
bit in Q1, but you're guiding for flat sequentially. Should we think about that 
as a run rate, or are you still attempting to manage your tax rate down even 
further than where you saw it in Q1 and where you're expecting for Q2
?
 
And then on the OpEx guide, 41% non
-
GAAP growth in Q1, obviously below 
your range but you maintained the range. Why is that? Is that just purely a 
function of the comps as you head into the year, or are there some specific 
investment plans that you have?
 
Thanks.
 
David M. Wehner 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure, Mark. I can start with the detailed ones, the tax rate and the OpEx 
guide. So on the tax rate, the rate came in better than guidance in terms of 
the tax rate, but it's consistent with the long
-
term t
rend that I'd indicated. 
We do expect that that rate will be approximately the rate that will continue 
for the rest of the year. So for purposes of 2016 modeling, I would use the 
Q1 rate.
 
On the OpEx guide, Q1 came in slightly below our annual expense grow
th 
guidance, but we do expect that investments in areas like video and Oculus 
will impact the remainder of the year more substantially, so that's why we're 
maintaining the annual OpEx growth guidance that we have. And then, 
Sheryl, did you want to speak ab
out Audience Network?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg 
-
 
Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
Yes, Audience Network is important to us because we're making a strategic 
investment in ad tech, helping advertisers and publishers grow, so it's on 
and off Facebook. We think we
're uniquely placed to bring people
-
based 
marketing to scale and solve the measurement problem, and the Audience 
Network is a place we're really focused because we feel like we're delivering 
value for advertisers and publishers, so we're investing behind t
he growth 
we've seen. We've seen a growth of native ads. Eighty
-
three percent of the 
overall inventory on the platform is native, and over 50% of our publishers 
are only using native ads.
 
We have some great examples of Audience Networks really improving 
pe
ople's results. A recent one is eBay Vivanuncios, which is an online real 
estate destination working in Latin America and Mexico. When they were 
using a combination of Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network, 
they saw 57% lower cost per install with 
placement optimization and 59% 
more volume versus running on Facebook alone, which led to 6% 
incremental revenue. So compared to November a year before, the number 
of their app installs increased by 115%.
 
So what we're seeing is the results we're able to d
eliver on Facebook and 
Instagram, a lot of our marketing partners want more. And our ability to do 
that is why we're investing in the Audience Network.

we might see those investments manifest themselves in the user experience 
over the next few years?

So the bi
ggest thing that we're focused on with artificial intelligence is 
building computer services that have better perception than people, so the 
basic human senses like seeing, hearing, language, core things that we do. I 
think it's possible to get to the poin
t in the next five to 10 years where we 
have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things. 
That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking or be generally 
better, but that is useful for a number of things.
 
So for example, I ta
lked about earlier, we are building this Moments app, so 
that way you can take photos on your phone. And if you use this app, our 
face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you 
might want to share photos that you took with a fri
end in them with that 
person. So that way, all the photos that might be of you and your friends' 
camera rolls, they can share with you. Another example is just spam filtering 
and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand 
what's 
interesting to you or not and not show that.
 
One obvious thing I think over time is if you just look at the way that we 
rank News Feed, today we use some basic signals like who you're friends 
with and what pages you like as some of the most important thing
s for 
figuring out what 

 
out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content 
that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be 
the most interesting things to you. That's because today our systems can't 
actually understand wh
at the content means. We don't actually look at the 
photo and deeply understand what's in it or look at the videos and 
understand what's in it or read the links that people share and understand 
what's in them, but in the future we'll be able to, I think in
 
a five or 10
-
year 
period.
 
So all of these millions and millions of pieces content that are out there, 
whether or not you've added someone as a friend or have liked a page, we'll 
be able to know a lot better what types of things are going to be interesting
 
to you to produce a much better feed of content. So that's just a basic 
example of where having human
-
level perception broadly is going to yield 
better experiences in a lot of the things that people care about today.

The next question is from Ken
 
Sena with Evercore. Your line is open.

Hi. I have a high
-
level, longer
-
term question. For brands, we're seeing 
where promotion, transaction, and support capabilities for businesses are all 
deepening within Facebook. Therefore, 
should we be thinking about a 
longer
-
term transition from a platform that's basically all ad to something 
where more marketplace capability is offered, given that buyers and sellers 
are so known and so connected? And if so, can we think about Facebook 
star
ting to monetize maybe on a transaction basis or even through various 
customer support capabilities via the messaging tools, AI, et cetera, that 
you're beginning to offer businesses? So maybe if you could just provide a 
little bit of color on how you see t
hat evolution, that would be great. Thank 
you.

You're right that people are increasingly using Facebook to discover products 
and services, and we're testing some ways like the Marketplace to make this
 
easier. We're also testing some incremental features on pages, which enable 
businesses to drive purchases on a page or direct people directly to their 
website. These are really early, but we've had some positive feedback.
 
Our focus, however, continues to 
be on our ad products because we think we 
can take people all the way from the top of the funnel, where they can really 
get a brand awareness or product awareness, and go all the way down to 
purchase, not necessarily because the purchase is happening on Fa
cebook, 
but because we can work on the measurement systems to understand how 
the advertising, both at the top and lower down in the funnel is influencing 
those purchases.
 
We've been really excited by what we've seen in the commerce vertical of 
our ad 
products. So products like dynamic product ads, Carousel ads are 
working really well for us. This quarter we launched Canvas ads, which are 
very fast
-
loading, immersive mobile ads. They're easy to build. You can use 
the self
-
service tool. You don't have to
 
write any code. They are native 
format, so they decrease that initial drop
-
off you see when people click off to 
another site. It's very early days, but the average viewing time is over 30 
seconds, which shows how immersive that is.
 
I'll share one example 
of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook 
through ads, which is a company called Sparkle in Pink. They're a Utah
-
based SMB. They're selling girls' clothing. They did a Slideshow ad that 
included a Shop Now button, which enables you to take action
 
on their site. 
They were able to increase sales by 9% a month. And more exciting for us, 
this was six times more efficient in terms of acquisition than any other 
digital media channel. And that shows how you can use our ad products to 
go all the way from 
awareness, measuring through to a sale and show how 
important our ads can be to commerce on our platform.

Your next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is

Great, so I gues
s a question for Mark or Sheryl. So at F8, you showcased a 
bunch of new features for Messenger, including ads to promote your 
business inside of Messenger. So how should we think about the timing of 
those ad units coming on in Messenger? And can you use th
e same ad stack 
in the Facebook Power Editor that's used on core Facebook and Instagram to 
get ads up on Messenger? Can you walk us through that?
 
And then the second question on messaging, so with WhatsApp crossing 1 
billion users recently, how do you view
 
the product roadmap today on 
WhatsApp versus what you showcased recently with Messenger? Is it a year 
behind, or is it further back than that? Any color there would be helpful. 
Thanks.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg

Chief Operating Officer & Director
 
For Messenger 
and WhatsApp, our focus right now continues to be on growth 
and engagement. We are not rolling out any monetization products on 
WhatsApp right now, but we did start that process at F8 on Messenger. And 
what we're doing is following the organic activity tha
t's happening on the 
Messenger platform. Businesses and consumers are using Messenger to 
connect to each other in a more personal, more immediate way. And we 
rolled out a platform beta, which gives new opportunities to build compelling 
experiences. Bots, v
ery early but giving the opportunity for more personal 
interactions between businesses and mobile. The 10 received APIs (56:26), 
so that businesses could send immediate responses to common questions, 
including engaging images and call to action as well as 
texts.
 
In terms of the timing, this is really early. We have a lot of opportunity to 
invest in advertising across our different platforms. And so we want to make 
sure we get this right as we focus on continued engagement. You're right 
that over time, when 
we make these investments, we are going to be able to 
rely on some of the core aspects of the ads infrastructure. Certainly, our 
long base of advertisers, some of the things we understand about how ads 
perform and the functionality will be an important par
t of the product 
offerings in the future, but those are not immediate by any stretch of the 
imagination.

Thanks a lot. I have one for Sheryl and one for Mark. Sheryl, there are many 
out there who might assume that this leg of excellent growth that Facebook 
is realizing mig
ht have come at the expense of TV advertising, but the TV ad 
world seems to be quite resilient here. And you actually talked a lot in your 
prepared remarks about how marketers benefit from running digital and TV 
campaigns in parallel. So I wonder if you co
uld just comment on where your 
share gains are coming from, in your view.
 
And then, Mark, on Live video, I realize it's a small part of overall video, but 
I wonder. Do you think multiple platforms can succeed in live streaming over 
time given the size of t
he market longer term, or do you think it's more of a 
network effect business where a vast majority of the traffic and economics 
will ultimately accrue to the leader in the live streaming space? Thank you.

We think our growth has been very broad
-
based, but dollars are shifting 
from all types of media formats to where consumers are spending their time. 
We tell our clients that we want to be the best dollar and the best minute 
they spend, and we want the
m to measure value. I don't think this means 
that all of our growth comes at the expense of any one channel, but it's 
broad
-
based. And often, TV and Facebook and Instagram can work really 
well together.
 
I'll give a fun example from the Super Bowl. T
-
Mobile
 
wanted to use their 
Super Bowl campaign to increase their brand awareness and increase their 
reach. So before the game, they targeted their 30
-
second Super Bowl ad 
that featured Drake to people with NFL and celebrity interests. It performed 
so well that t
hey decided to run the 60
-
second version on Facebook and 
Instagram. That ad was so successful on Facebook and Instagram that they 
then ran the 60
-
second ad on TV instead of their 30
-
second ad. So as people 
invest, they can use these different platforms tog
ether, and we're pretty 
excited to see that progress.

And on Live video, the theme that I think is most important is just that 
there's so much that people want to express and share with t
he people 
around them that they don't have the tools to do today. And I think about 
this huge opportunity, not just in Live video, but in a lot of things that we're 
talking about.
 
One interesting example recently that I touched on earlier is between 
Messen
ger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. And SMS 
at its peak we think was around 20 billion messages a day. And just 
unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product 
a little bit and removing the small fee that 
was there has just unlocked a 
huge amount of expression. And we think that this is going to be the case in 
all different types of media and with all different audiences that a person 
would share it with.
 
So in video, there are billions and billions of vide
os that are viewed every 
day on Facebook. Live is a very small part of it. The reason why we give 
disproportionate attention to it is because we're trying to help push forward 
new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about 
inter
acting, so Live, 360 video, and there will be others in the future.
 
And so yes, to answer your question, I do think that multiple products and 
companies can succeed in building these things. I also think that there are 
going to be a lot more interactive fo
rms of video than just Live and 360 like 
we're talking about now. And I think that this extends not just to video but 
for all the different types of media and audiences that we're serving. So 
we're very excited about continuing to do our work to help unloc
k all the 
expression and connection that people want to do.

Good afternoon, my name is Mike and I will be your conference operator 
today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook First 
Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Deborah 
Crawford, 
Facebook's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's first quarter 2020 
earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark 
Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandb
erg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
 
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you 
that our remarks today will include forward
-
looking statements. Actual 
results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward
-
looking
 
statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ 
materially are set forth in today's press release and in our annual report on 
Form 10
-
K filed with the SEC. Any forward
-
looking statements that we make 
on this call are based on assumptions as o
f today and we undertake no 
obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or 
future events.
 
During this call, we may present both GAAP and non
-
GAAP financial 
measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non
-
GAAP measures is included in 
toda
y's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying 
investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. 
Finally, we hope that everyone listening today is staying safe. The vast 
majority of us at Facebook our working product
ively from home and 
everyone on this call this afternoon has dialed in remotely.
 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
All right. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Before we get started, I also 
just want to say that I know thi
s is a very hard time for a lot of people. I 
know a lot of you are calling in from New York, where this has been 
particularly tough, although, almost everyone has been affected by what's 
going on in some way. So just want to start by acknowledging that and
 
taking a moment to thank everyone working on the front lines to help all of 
us get through this.
 
There is a lot of uncertainty now about the world and what it will look like 
over the coming months. And Sheryl and Dave are going to give some more 
context o
n what that means for our business. The impact on our business 
has been significant, and I remain very concerned that this health 
emergency and therefore the economic fallout will last longer than people 
are currently anticipating. And while there are mass
ive societal costs from 
the current shelter
-
in
-
place restrictions, I worry that reopening certain 
places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal 
levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse longer
-
term health 
and eco
nomic outcomes.
 
So, with that said, I want to use this time today to discuss how we're 
responding to COVID, what we're seeing across our services, and some 
reflections on how we plan to run the company going forward. So, responses 
have been focused on thre
e areas; helping people stay connected while 
we're all apart, assisting the public health response, and working on the 
economic recovery especially for small businesses.
 
And I'll start with how we are assisting the public health response. The first 
step he
re is connecting people with authoritative health information. And we 
built a COVID
-
19 information center with authoritative information from 
health officials and governments and messages encouraging people to stay 
home that are coming from public figures 
they trust. And we put this COVID
-
19 Information Center at the top of everyone's Facebook app, and so far 
we've directed more than 2 billion people to it. Equally important is also 
limiting the spread of misinformation. We don't allow content that puts 
peo
ple at imminent risk of physical harm. So when people share hoaxes like 
that inhaling water cures COVID, which is both false and will be physically 
harmful if anyone does that, we take that down.
 
For other types of misinformation, we partner with independe
nt fact 
checkers who have marked more than 4,000 pieces of content related to 
COVID as false, which has resulted in more than 40 million warning labels 
being seen across our services, and we know that these work because 95% 
of the time when someone sees a 
warning label, they don't click through to 
view that content.
 
Now, beyond helping people broadly access high quality information, we're 
also focused on helping governments and health authorities get better data 
in a privacy protective way to inform key pol
icy decisions that they need to 
make as well. So, we partnered with Carnegie Mellon to run a widespread 
symptom survey on Facebook, and we're using their findings to produce 
daily county
-
by
-
county maps of the symptoms that people are experiencing 
across th
e country, and soon globally as well. And since people experiencing 
symptoms is a precursor to them going to the hospital or getting more 
seriously ill, this tool can help local governments and health officials plan 
how to allocate scarce resources like PP
E and ventilators as well as 
determine when it's safe to start reopening an area or when an area will 
need to have tighter shelter orders if symptoms reemerge.
 
And just this morning we announced that we were working to connect these 
symptom surveys to grou
nd truth infection rate data from large serology in 
PCR studies that are funded separately by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 
order to more accurately determine the true infection and exposure levels 
globally on a local
-
region basis as well. So, this is 
work that we're uniquely 
positioned to do, because Facebook is a global community and people use 
their authentic identities on our service, so that means that we can make 
sure that the data is meaningful. But we're very focused on doing this in 
ways that w
e know are going to be helpful to the health response and that 
protects people's privacy and human rights, which is why we've primarily 
focused on how aggregate data can help.
 
Now, outside of Facebook, Priscilla and my work at the Chan Zuckerberg 
Initiativ
e with alongside leading experts in science and health continues to 
inform my views on the best ways for us to assist in this health response 
and also what we should expect going forward with this disease.
 
All right, so next I want to discuss how we're hel
ping people stay connected 
with the people they care about, even while we can't be together during this 
period. So, this is our core mission, and I'm proud of how we've supported 
people around the world during this time. We know that people especially 
rely
 
on social apps in times of crisis and in times when we can't be together 
in person. And right now, we are experiencing both of those all around the 
world at the same time. So, we're seeing major increases in use of our 
services. For the first time ever, t
here are now more than 3 billion people 
actively using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger each month. 
That includes 2.6 billion people using Facebook alone and more than 2.3 
billion people using at least one of our services every day.
 
In many of t
he places that have been hardest hit by the virus, messaging 
volume has increased more than 50%, and voice and video calling has more 
than doubled across Messenger and WhatsApp.
 
In Italy, for example, we've seen up to 70% more time spent across our 
apps. I
nstagram and Facebook Live views doubled in one week, and we've 
also seen time in Group video calling increase by more than a 1000% over 
March. Making sure that our services are stable and reliable during this 
period is a top priority. We're monitoring usa
ge closely and adding capacity 
in our data centers where we can. The investments we've made in shared 
infrastructure that cover all of our different services over the years has 
helped us manage through this, but it has been a challenge while all our 
teams 
have been working remotely. Now I'm showing these numbers to give 
you a sense of the surge in people relying on these services that we're 
seeing. Obviously, I wish the circumstances were different. And I don't 
expect that this exact spike in usage will sus
tain over a longer period of 
time.
 
But in some areas, I think we are seeing an acceleration in pre
-
existing 
long
-
term trends like the dramatic increase in online private social 
communication that is likely to continue. And if nothing else, this usage 
shows
 
that for a lot of people around the world, these services are part of 
the social infrastructure that brings us together.
 
Now, even before COVID
-
19, our product strategy is already focused on 
building out private social platforms and enabling online commer
ce. So it's 
well aligned with what people need now. Last week, we announced a number 
of new product improvements on video presence, which has emerged as in 
especially critical part of the private social platform during this time. Our 
view is that video pre
sence includes three categories. Video calling, Video 
rooms and live video. And we plan to lead and offer the best services for 
social uses in each of those different categories. Video calling, is when you 
actually ring a person's phone or computer and it'
s by far the most used 
type of video chat. Between WhatsApp and Messenger, there are more than 
700 million daily actives participating in calls. We are doubling the size of 
WhatsApp video calls from four to eight. This is important because WhatsApp 
is the 
most popular end
-
to
-
end encrypted calling service.
 
So, if you care about privacy and encryption and you want to be able to 
reach anyone, you're probably using WhatsApp. And now you can get your 
whole family or a larger group together on calls.
 
For video ro
oms we announced a completely new product called Messenger 
Rooms. And the idea here is that you can create a room for any active event 
you want, send the link to your friends or have them discover your room on 
Facebook and then they can just drop in and ha
ng out for a bit. And this is 
different from any other video presence experience because it is 
serendipitous. You don't have to plan on an event and schedule in advance if 
you don't want. But it could be much more spontaneous and fun and I've 
really enjoye
d getting to use this as we've been building out Messenger 
Rooms internally, and I'm looking forward to getting it in more people's 
hands around the world soon.
 
Live video is also particularly important right now. People used to primarily 
live stream physi
cal events, but it's almost known as planning physical 
events right now livestreaming has become the primary venue for many 
events, whether that's the Pope's weekly mass on Facebook Live or DJs 
hosting dance parties on Instagram, every day more than 800 mi
llion daily 
actives are engaging with live streams, across workout classes, concerts and 
more. We pivoted the Facebook events team to help people create online 
events including enabling people and small businesses to charge people who 
have joined their eve
nts in order to support small businesses that rely on in
-
person services before.
 
The last area of our response that I want to discuss is how we're helping 
with the economic recovery, especially for small businesses. Sheryl, will talk 
about this more, but w
ith so many businesses forced to close their physical 
storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences and those which 
already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as 
the primary storefronts. So we're working on a
 
number of ways to deepen 
this experience, helping people buy items and services directly within our 
apps. I mean we're going to a lot more to share on this soon.
 
Overall, though, our business, depends on the success of small businesses. 
So this is a momen
t where we feel that we're well positioned to be 
champions for small businesses interests and supporters of important 
infrastructure that they're going to need in order to move online. One aspect 
of online commerce that I want to mention is the partnership
 
that we just 
announced with Jio platforms in India. The largest Facebook and WhatsApp 
communities in the world are in India, and we think that there is an 
especially important opportunity to serve small businesses and enable 
commerce there over the long
-
t
erm. By bringing together JioMart, which is 
Jio's small business initiative to connect millions of shops across India with 
WhatsApp, we think that we're going to able to create a much better 
shopping and commerce experience. And there's a lot more that we 
can do 
here, and I'm looking forward to making progress with the team at Jio.
 
Now, beyond our immediate plans to help respond to the pandemic. I also 
want to share some reflections on how we're planning to run the company 
during this period. I have always 
believed that in times of economic 
downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future, 
and I believe this for a few reasons. First, when the world changes quickly, 
people have new needs and that means that there are more new segmen
ts 
to build. Second, since many big companies will pull back on their 
investments, there are a lot of things that wouldn't otherwise get built, but 
that we can help deliver. And the third, I believe that there is a sense of 
responsibility and duty to inves
t in the economic recovery and to provide 
stability for your community and stakeholders if you have the ability to do 
so. And we're in a fortunate position to be able to do this. Along with our 
strong financial position and the important social value our s
ervices provide, 
we're planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and 
engineering roles this year, so we can continue building and making 
progress.
 
Now that said, with advertiser spending less than our business performance 
below expectations, 
we do plan to moderate some areas of our expense 
growth especially in business functions. We accepted our profit margins will 
decrease this year as we continue investing. And Dave will share more on 
our financial outlook in a few minutes. But this economic
 
pullback has 
certainly reinforced for me the importance of maintaining high margins. Our 
financial position has allowed us to continue investing in building products 
and making investments like our partnership with Jio, even when the 
underlying economic c
onditions are challenging.
 
As always, I am grateful to everyone on this journey with us and that's 
especially true during this period. As our services play in an especially 
important role right now, in helping people stay connected and assisting the 
public health response and working on the economic recovery, I really want 
to thank all of our employees who are working hard to deliver these services 
and everyone who has believed in us and supported our company over the 
years to help us get to the point
 
where we can deliver these services for 
people around the world. So, thank you.
 
And with that, here is, Sheryl to talk more about our business.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Thanks, Mark, and hi everyone. As Mark said, this is an extraordinarily 
challenging time. It's 
a public health emergency, a global economic crisis 
and a time of great anxiety and personal tragedy for so many. My heart goes 
out to everyone on this call who has lost someone they love, and to 
everyone for the many ways so many are suffering.
 
Mark talke
d about how our company has responded during this emergency 
to keep people safe and informed. How we see our responsibilities and how 
we are thinking about the future. I'm going to talk more about the impact 
we have seen in our business and what we are doi
ng to help other 
businesses survive and recover in this changing landscape. Our total ad 
revenue for Q1 was $17.4 billion, which is a 17% year
-
over
-
year increase. 
After a strong start to the quarter, we saw a significant impact on our 
business as a consequ
ence of the pandemic from the second week of March 
onwards. This impact has not been felt evenly. We've seen strong growth in 
gaming and relative stability in technology and e
-
commerce, which is one of 
our largest sectors. There are few contributing factor
s here.
 
First, as people stay at home, these sectors are seeing more use of their 
products and services. Second, advertisers in these sectors tend to optimize 
for measurable objectives and we are generating sales at lower prices due to 
the overall reductio
n in ad demand.
 
On the other hand, we've seen significant declines in travel and auto as 
these industries have been hit particularly hard. These trends are continuing 
in the first two weeks of Q2, and Dave will share more on this shortly. 
Companies of all 
types are adapting to a world where people aren't walking 
into their stores or seeing their brand on billboards. With more people 
spending time on our products and services than ever before, we are 
focused on continuing to deliver free and paid tools to he
lp businesses reach 
the right people at the right time. And on finding new ways to support those 
struggling to keep the lights on and pay their employees.
 
People are looking for businesses on Facebook and Instagram more than 
usual during this crisis. So ou
r free products are particularly important to the 
many brick
-
and
-
mortar businesses pivoting quickly online. Even in the 
United States, before the crisis, one in three companies didn't have a 
website, because they can be expensive and difficult to set up ev
en in the 
best of times. Our Facebook page or Instagram business profile is free and 
in a matter of minutes established as a digital storefront. Many are finding 
creative ways to engage their customers using our free products. From Jim's 
offering workouts 
on Facebook Live to stores and restaurants using 
WhatsApp and Messenger to reach customers with delivery options.
 
In Thailand, when Penguin Eat Shabu [ph] closed the doors of its nine 
restaurants, they started selling to go boxes. They promoted them with 
F
acebook posts and customers could order through Messenger and they got 
350 sales in one minute. A second offer led to 2,500 hot pot sales. After 
initially putting their employees on unpaid leave, these sales increased their 
revenue and helped restore emplo
yees to full pay. Marketers of all sizes 
have more limited budgets. So they need to make every dollar work as hard 
as possible. That means measuring as hard as possible. That means 
measuring the value of their advertising is more important than ever, which
 
is something our personalized ads provide. For years we have made major 
investments in systems and tools that enable businesses to easily 
understand their return on investment. In the current environment these 
investments are paying off.
 
We are also launc
hing new products to help businesses adapt to changing 
circumstances. Our teams moved quickly to make gift cards available on 
both Facebook and Instagram giving customers the option to support 
businesses by paying upfront for products and services they can
 
use later. 
We also made it possible for people to create fundraisers for local businesses 
with a few simple click. Fundraisers have been available to support non
-
profits and people since 2015, but given the overwhelming interest in 
helping small businesse
s, weather the storm, we made these tools available 
for businesses as well, something we never expected to do.
 
We also launched temporary service changes to make it easier for 
businesses to share critical information like inventory updates, shipment 
detail
s, or new ways to buy. For example, if a restaurant needs to shift to a 
delivery model, they can now add food delivery links to their Facebook page 
or Instagram business profile. Trading these products quickly in the current 
environment wasn't easy and I a
m grateful to our product and engineering 
teams who are executing so well working from home. The business resource 
hub we launched in early May is a one
-
stop shop where businesses of all 
sizes can find support in virtual training that can help them migrate
 
online. 
People can take courses on everything from how to connect with customers 
via messaging in Facebook Live, how to increase online sales.
 
We are fortunate to be in a strong financial position. We can continue to pay 
all of our employees and contracto
rs during this difficult time, which is why 
we believe we have a real responsibility to help others, especially small 
businesses around the world. In mid
-
March, we announced a $100 million 
grant program to help 30,000 small businesses across more than 30 
c
ountries we call home. Applications open this month and we are focused on 
getting cash into their hands as soon as possible. Economic crisis hit 
vulnerable communities the hardest, especially woman and women of color 
and the families who depend on them. Th
at's why, half of the grants 
available in the US are earmarked for women minority and veteran owned 
businesses. We have also worked closely with the US government Small 
Business Administration to spread the word to small businesses about how 
to apply for r
elief loans reaching 30 million accounts across Facebook and 
Instagram with this information.
 
Businesses aren't the only ones facing hardship, newsrooms are too. At a 
time when critical information is needed to keep community safe, news 
organizations are s
eeing steep declines in ad revenue. In late March, we 
announced a $100 million investment to support the news industry, with $25 
million in grant funding for local news organizations and $75 million in 
marketing spend to get money to publishers. We have a 
responsibility to 
help during this uncertain time by connecting billions of people when they 
are separated physically, getting vital health information on a 
--
 
to people on 
a dramatic scale and helping small businesses survive.
 
I want to close by saying ho
w grateful I am to our partners and teams 
around the world. During this unprecedented time we are trying to stay 
closer than ever to businesses large and small as they adapt to these 
significant challenges. I also want to thank our teams for ensuring our 
s
ervices keep running and working so hard to launch new products, so we 
can continue making a real difference in people's lives. This is such a difficult 
period for everyone and we are grateful for the important work that is being 
accomplished by so many.
 
N
ow, here's Dave.
 
David Wehner
 
Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Echoing Mark and Sheryl's 
comments, my thoughts are with everyone facing challenges during this 
difficult and unprecedented time.
 
Before turning to results, I wanted to comment briefl
y on Facebook's 
operating posture during the crisis. We took early action to ensure that all 
employee 
--
 
our employees were safe and moved to a global work from 
home stance on March 6 in the week prior to the WHO declaring COVID
-
19 a 
global pandemic. We ar
e currently operating with over 95% of our full
-
time 
employees working from home with safety being the number one priority for 
those essential workers who need to come into our data centers and other 
facilities. We have been able to support our existing em
ployees and on board 
new employees throughout this period. While we are by no means operating 
at 100% of capacity across every dimension of our operations, we have 
continued to ship new product releases, maintain service availability, review 
content and st
ay connected with our business customers.
 
Given the circumstances, we have been pleased with the dedication and 
professionalism with which the Facebook team is tackling the challenges 
presented by this crisis.
 
Now, turning to the results. The COVID
-
19 pand
emic is having a broad 
impact on our community metrics, revenue, expenses and business 
operations. Our community metrics reflected increased 
--
 
reflect increased 
engagement as people around the world of shelter
-
in
-
place. It's gratifying 
that people are usi
ng our family of apps to stay informed and connect with 
people and organizations that they care about. In March, we estimate that 
on average 2.3 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily 
basis and that approximately 3 billion people were 
active on a monthly basis. 
We have seen increased usage across all of our services, particularly in 
markets that have been most impacted by the virus, including a surge in 
video and voice calling on Messenger and WhatsApp.
 
People around the world have incr
easingly turned to Facebook as well. Daily 
active users reached 1.73 billion, up 11% compared to last year. DAUs 
represented approximately 67% of the 2.6 billion monthly active users in 
March. MAUs grew 228 million or 10% compared to last year. We expect 
t
hat we will lose some of this increased engagement when shelter
-
in
-
place 
restrictions are relaxed and life returns to a more normal cadence, which we 
all look forward to.
 
Turning now to the financials. Q1 total revenue was $17.7 billion, up 18% or 
19% on a
 
constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained 
constant with Q1 of last year, total revenue would have been $275 million 
higher. Q1 ad revenue was $17.4 billion, up 17% or 19% on a constant 
currency basis. Again, the COVID
-
19 pandemic had an
 
meaningful impact on 
our revenue. Revenue was strong from the beginning of the quarter through 
the first week of March, when we began to see a steep slowdown in our ads 
business, particularly in countries that implemented shelter
-
in
-
place 
measures to redu
ce the spread of the virus.
 
As Sheryl mentioned there was a great deal of variability by vertical. During 
the last three weeks of March, travel and auto were our weakest verticals 
and we saw relative strength in gaming technology and e
-
commerce. These 
tren
ds have continued into Q2. We've seen relatively comparable pullbacks 
amongst large and small advertisers. COVID
-
19 had an impact across the 
globe in Q1. On a regional basis ad revenue growth was strongest in Asia 
Pacific at 21%, followed by US, Canada, Eu
rope and Rest of World at 16% 
each.
 
Turning now to our price and volume metrics. In Q1, the total number of ad 
impressions served across our services increased 39% and the average price 
per ad decreased 16%. The growth of impressions was primarily driven b
y 
Facebook Mobile newsfeed, due to product optimizations we made prior to 
the pandemic as well as from increased engagement that I talked about 
earlier. The decline in average price per ad was largely attributed 
--
 
attributable to the reduction in advertis
er demand during the last three 
weeks of March. Other revenue, was $297 million, up 80% driven primarily 
by sales of Oculus products. As a reminder, we launched Quest in May 2019.
 
Turning now to expenses; Q1 total expenses were $11.8 billion, up 1% on a 
re
ported basis. Excluding the $3 billion expense we recorded in Q1 related to 
our settlement with the FTC, Q1 of last year that is, related to our 
settlement with the FTC, total expenses were up 35% year
-
over
-
year. Cost 
of revenue increased 23% driven primar
ily by depreciation related to our 
infrastructure spend. R&D grew 40% and was driven primarily by 
investments in core product as well as our innovation efforts particularly in 
AR/VR. Marketing and sales grew 38% and was driven by consumer and 
growth market
ing. Finally, excluding the FTC expense from Q1 of 2019, G&A 
grew 49%, driven partially by an increase in estimated credit losses related 
to COVID
-
19.
 
We had over 3,300 net new hires in Q1, primarily in technical functions and 
ended the quarter with over 4
8,000 full
-
time employees, up 28% compared 
to last year. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to recruit and onboard new 
employees successfully while in a work
-
from
-
home environment. Operating 
income was $5.9 billion representing a 33% operating margin and 
our tax 
rate was 16%. Net income was $4.9 billion or $1.71 per share. Capital 
expenditures were $3.7 billion driven by investments in data centers, 
servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. We had $7.3 billion of 
free cash flow in the quarter a
nd we repurchased $1.2 billion of our Class A 
common stock. We ended the quarter with $60.3 billion of cash in 
investments.
 
As I mentioned last quarter that we booked the FTC expense in 2019, we did 
not pay the $5 billion settlement amount until the 
--
 
aft
er the first quarter of 
2020 closed. In addition, this past week as Mark mentioned, we signed an 
agreement to invest approximately $5.7 billion into Jio platforms in India. 
Our strong balance sheet proved to be an important asset this quarter, 
enabling us 
to commit to a long
-
term growth priority in India even in the 
midst of a troubled global economy.
 
Turning now to the outlook. With the COVID
-
19 crisis like all companies we 
are facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty in our business outlook, 
certainly
 
in the nearly eight years I've been with Facebook. We expect our 
business performance will be impacted by issues beyond our control, 
including the duration and efficacy of shelter
-
in
-
place orders, the 
effectiveness of economic stimuli around the world and
 
the fluctuation of 
currencies relative to the US dollar. On the latter point alone, since the WHO 
declared COVID
-
19 as a pandemic, we have seen in the US dollar appreciate 
5% relative to the foreign currencies we do business in.
 
Given the 
increasing uncertainty in our business outlook, we are not 
providing specific revenue guidance for the second quarter or full year 2020, 
rather, I would like to provide a snapshot of revenue performance in the 
second quarter thus far. There is a tremendous
 
amount of macro 
uncertainty. So it's difficult to extrapolate performance based on a small 
sample of data. After initial steep decrease in ad revenue in March, we have 
seen signs of stability reflected in the first three weeks of April. Ad revenue 
has bee
n approximately flat compared to the same period a year ago, down 
from the 17% year
-
over
-
year growth in the first quarter of 2020. The April 
trends reflect weakness across all of our user geographies, as most of our 
major countries have had some sort of sh
elter
-
in
-
place guidelines in effect.
 
We are understandably cautious given that most economists are forecasting 
a global GDP contraction in Q2, which if history where a guide, would 
suggest that the potential for an even more severe advertising industry 
con
traction.
 
In terms of expenses, we are continuing to monitor the COVID
-
19 situation 
and its impact on our business and operations and we'll adjust to our plans 
accordingly. We expect to realize operational savings in certain areas such 
as travel, events an
d marketing as well as from slower headcount growth in 
our business functions. However, we plan to continue to invest in product 
development and to recruit technical talent. In addition, we have committed 
over $300 million to date in investments to help ou
r broader community 
during this crisis, which will have an impact on our financial performance this 
year. As a result, we expect total expenses in 2020 to be between $52 billion 
and $56 billion, down from the prior range of $54 billion to $59 billion.
 
Whil
e this reflects a moderate reduction in the planned growth rate of total 
expenses, our overall expense growth in the face of expected revenue 
weakness will have a negative impact on our 2020 operating margins.
 
Turning now to capital expenditures. Our signi
ficant investments in 
infrastructure over the past four years have served us well during this period 
of high user engagement. We plan to continue to grow our CapEx 
investments to enhance and expand our global infrastructure footprint over 
the long
-
term. In
 
2020, we now expect capital expenditures to be 
approximately $14 billion to $16 billion, down from our prior range of $17 
billion to $19 billion. This reduction reflects a significant decrease in our 
construction efforts related to shelter
-
in
-
place orders
. Given the strong 
engagement growth and related demands on our infrastructure, this year's 
CapEx reduction should be viewed as a deferral into 2021 rather than 
savings.
 
Turning now to tax. We expect our full year 2020 tax rate will be in the high 
teens, a
lthough we may see fluctuations in our quarterly rate depending on 
our financial results. Our thoughts are with those in the community who are 
facing health challenges during this crisis and with those healthcare workers 
on the front lines. We are also min
dful of the challenges many businesses 
are facing in this crisis, including the 140 million small businesses who use 
our platform. Our focus is first and foremost on helping our broad 
community navigate these challenges.
 
With that Mike, let's open it up fo
r questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Operator
 
We will now open the lines for a question
-
and
-
answer session. [Operator 
Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Brian Nowak
 
Thanks for taking my questions. 
Hope everyone is safe. I have two. Just the 
first one for Sheryl or Dave. I appreciate all the color on the different ad 
verticals between gaming, e
-
commerce, travel, and autos, etc. I guess I'd be 
curious to hear about sort of what happened in the decline
 
in the ad 
business you saw in March compared to the stability in April. Sort of what 
changed in those verticals? And then understanding you're not giving 
guidance, but talk to us about some of the key verticals that would be 
needed to sort of bring the bu
siness back to growth as we go throughout the 
year? And then the second question for Mark, you talked a little bit about 
SMBs. I'm curious to hear about some of the key investment areas and 
initiatives you really think you need to execute on to make the SM
B offering 
more comprehensive in '21 and beyond?
 
David Wehner
 
Okay, Brian. Do you want to take that Sheryl?
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
Why don't you go first, and I'll take the second.
 
David Wehner
 
Okay.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
You take the first, and I'll take the second.
 
D
avid Wehner
 
Yes, sure. Sorry. We're doing our coordination. So, Brian, yes, the trends 
that we saw in the end of Q1, we saw pull back, pretty broad based pull back 
especially concentrated in some of the areas that we talked about, things 
like travel and au
to, but really kind of broad
-
based, large and small 
advertisers. We saw a relative strength even then in a few categories like 
gaming, where you have always
-
on campaigns that we're able to pick up 
some supply, because the lower pricing kind of cleared at t
he levels that 
those advertisers were trying to acquire users at, so that is one of the 
benefits of the auction.
 
And then e
-
commerce, we've seen 
--
 
it was not a strong as gaming, but 
we've seen that show signs of stability as well. And all of those trends 
sort of 
continued into Q2, so I don't think there's a lot of vertical shifts, but I think 
we are seeing e
-
commerce sort of do reasonably well. What we're seeing is 
really, I think pretty straightforward. We're seeing people who are driving 
towards online c
onversion events do well because they're able to kind of bid 
in the auction and get those users and get those results that they're looking 
for, and people who are like looking for offline or more top of funnel brand, 
there we've seen more pullback instead.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 

what are we doing now to help SMBs weather the storm and come back to 
business and be able to pay their employees. And the second is the ongoing 
ad work we do. On t
he first, I think we've been really focused. We came out 
early with our $100 million grants program, and we're rolling it out very 
aggressively around the world trying to get money to people very quickly, 
and we're building specialized products we never wo
uld have thought of 
before. Fundraisers were something that we did for non
-
profits or people, 
not small businesses. So, in this very difficult time for SMBs, we're really 
focused on doing everything we can to help them survive and even thrive as 
they help 
transition online.
 
SMBs are also a major part of our business going forward. And on there, it's 
really the execution we do quarter
-
after
-
quarter to make our ads perform. 
We offer very personalized ads that can be directly targeted at small groups. 
We do th
at in a very privacy protective way and those ads are often most 
important for small businesses who can't afford to buy broad based media. 
And so all of the work we do to continue to allow targeting, all of the work 
we do to make the ads more personalized,
 
all of the work we do to make 
free tools available, which is important for all the online businesses who use 
our free tools, there are 140 million of them as well as the 8 million, who are 
our advertisers, and the funnel between those. That's the nuts and
 
bolts of 
our business. We work on it every day. We're continuing to work on it every 
day through this crisis, and we'll continue beyond that.
 
David Wehner
 
Mike, we'll go to the next question.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Doug 
Anmuth from JP Morgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth
 
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two, I think probably both for 
Mark. First, I was hoping if you could talk more about the functionality of 
WhatsApp and perhaps other platforms as you expand in India with 
the Jio 

something similar or is this strategy here unique to India? And then second, 
just given the increased engagement with communication tools and voice 
and video in particular how is t
hat translating into increased activity in the 
feed and within stories? Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure, I can speak to the first one, and David can see if there are any stats in 
particular to share on the second one. I mean for commerce on WhatsApp 
more broa
dly, we're very focused on making it, so that small businesses can 
have a presence on all of the apps, right, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, 
and Messenger and can communicate organically with people and then 
increasingly can do things that can help them dr
ive transactions. So we 
started rolling out things like catalogs in WhatsApp, we're working on 
payments to be able to complete transactions, and we've rolled out a new ad 
format, click to messaging ads, where basically a lot of small businesses and 
differe
nt businesses are finding that their message threads with people 
perform better for driving sales than their websites or other presences. They 
basically buy ads inside Facebook or Instagram that sends people to chat 
threads.
 
And then, as we build out all t
hese tools around that 
--
 
around making those 
threads more valuable, we think that those ads will only increase in value, 
which is the way we're currently thinking about that business.
 
In India with Jio; Jio has had this vision for a while, I want to be ca
reful not 
to put words in their mouth, but just from what they've basically described 
both to us and publicly about their JioMart vision is, there are millions of 
small businesses and shops across India, and they want to try to help get 
them on to a single
 
network that you'll be able to communicate with through 
WhatsApp and do payments online through WhatsApp. So, I think that that 
is a great, very large example of how we can wire up and help small 
businesses in the country where we have the largest WhatsAp
p community. 
But certainly all the products and technology that we're building to enable 
that partnership are going to be things that we want to do around the world. 
So, we're very excited about working with them to drive this vision forward 
and then exten
ding it everywhere over the coming months and years.
 
Dave, I don't know if you want to say anything about the second point. I 
think it's at a high level, I mean you may have stats that you want to share. 
But I think it's, we have seen a broad
-
based increas
e in use of the products. 
It's hard to know what is just correlated with the pandemic versus people 
are doing more video chat or messaging, so therefore they also connect 
more in other parts of the products, but I do think, overall, we believe that 
providi
ng a broad set of social tools for people is 
--
 
and just providing more 
value for people does include all of the different services which is important 
because as you know, some of the services for our business we include ads 
in and some we don't.
 
David Weh
ner
 
Yes. And the only thing I'd add there is, we talked about 39% increase in ad 
impressions and that's really driven by engagement increases on our feed 
products and stories products as well as the search that we've seen in the 
video and messaging. So it 
really wasn't limited to video and messaging, it 
was broad
-
based as Mark said, and that's creating supply on the ad 
impression side as well.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill 
Lynch.
 
Justin Post
 
Great, thanks. S
heryl maybe you could talk a little bit about the ad auction 
dynamics. Are you seeing e
-
commerce and digital replace auto and other 
categories and how efficiently is that auction working? And secondly, can 
you give us any color on percent of ads that come 
from direct response 
versus brand or maybe CPC bidding versus CPM? Thank you.
 
David Wehner
 
I can take that Justin. In terms of the ad auction dynamics, yes, I mean, we 
are seeing, when verticals doing better than the other or people fall out of 
the auction
 
we have very dynamic content, it's 
--
 
and so we're able to 
backfill that with other bids from other clients. So we're seeing a lot of 
bidding into the system from gaming and e
-
commerce as prices come down 
it's also more economic and they can get the ROIs 
that they want. So it's a 
natural way in which those 
--
 
that happens and you see a replacement effect 
there. So that's working well. Far more 
--
 
by far the majority of our revenue 
we haven't given a specific number on what is direct response. But it's real
ly 
for many years driven our business. It continues to drive our business and I 
would say if anything COVID is accentuated the importance of people who 
are bidding for online conversions.
 
And so, I think we've seen a fall
-
off in some of the more sort of br
oad
-
based 
brand advertising right now and really a focus on those things that are 
driving direct results today, which isn't really surprising given the economic 
climate.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.
 
Ross Sa
ndler
 
Just a follow
-
up to the last question. I think about four years ago, you 
mentioned that the top 100 advertisers were just under 25% of revenue and 
coming down. So I guess, how does that mix look today? And Dave, I think 
you mentioned, large and small
 
advertisers were kind of pulling back in 
March and into April at about the same rate, but any more pronounced desal 
from large versus small. Any color there? And then second question is Mark, 
you mentioned in your opening remarks that something along the 
lines of 
high margins are important to the company, especially given the economic 
environment.
 
So, how do you think about balancing levels of investment with revenue over 
the long
-
term. As you're thinking around that changed versus I think you 
mentioned th
at comment maybe two years ago, has anything changed in the 
way you're thinking about margins? Thank you.
 
David Wehner
 
Hey Ross, it's Dave. I'll take that first one. Yes, we've seen sort of a pullback 
of advertising from both large and small advertisers. A
nd I would say, given 
the uncertain economic climate, we know SMBs are getting hit hard, but our 
business is quite diversified and there is no one size fits all for SMBs. We've 
got some businesses that are obviously suffering greatly from the shelter
-
in
-
pl
ace orders and then we have SMBs, who are also digital natives and have 
online objectives and those are doing relatively better. So we've got SMBs, 
who are in gaming and e
-
commerce and the like. So, we are seeing I think a 
fairly diverse range of SMBs.
 
And
 
I would say in terms of the diversity of our business that's, that remains 
very high. We're not concentrated. But we haven't updated that specific stat 
that we gave back four years ago. We remain very diversified from an 
advertiser perspective.
 
Mark Zucke
rberg
 
And I can talk to the margins a bit. Overall, I think during a period like this 
there are a lot of new things that need to get built. And I think it's important 
that rather than slamming on the brakes now, as I think a lot of companies 
may, that it's
 
important to keep on building and keep on investing in 
building for the new need that people have and especially to make up for 
some of the stuffs that that other companies would pull
-
back on, and I think 
that's in some ways that's an opportunity, in othe
r ways, I think it's 
responsibility to keep on investing in the economic recovery. So that's in the 
near
-
term.
 
But the other reflection that I've had is that, I think if you're going to have a 
business, which is primarily advertising, which is our plan 
for the long
-
term, 
then I think you have to recognize that advertising is more volatile and 
sensitive to the macro economy, and therefore if you're going to have this 
kind of a business, I think you really want to maintain high margins. So that 
way when we
 
go through periods like this, you can make sure that we 
remain stable and healthy and able to keep on building the things that are 
important for the long term. So what I guess I'd want to just be clear on is 
that, we are willing to accept a reduction in m
argins in the near term, but we 
understand and I personally have an appreciation for the importance of 
maintaining high margins over time.
 
So, it's not that we're going to kind of take things down this year and then 
continue taking things down a lot in the
 
future. I think over the coming 
years if we invest a lot more now, I think we are going to look for ways to 
manage expenses to make sure that we can maintain high margins 
overtime.

Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from Sun
Trust.
 
Youssef Squali
 
Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Mark, can you discuss the 
performance of your gaming platform including Oculus so far. How satisfied 
are you with the traction there? And what are you doing to better position 
the company to 
take advantage of the increased engagement we're seeing 
on other platforms, continuing platforms and maybe Dave or Sheryl, can you 
speak to the trend you're seeing in markets where COVID
-
19 hit earlier say 
may be January and February, and how they are perf
orming today and any 
learnings from these markets? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So I can talk a bit about games. We have a few big areas of 
investment here. One is just in our mobile apps, massive amount of growth 
in live streaming. That's 
--
 
I talked 
about live video in my opening remarks 
and people live streaming gaming content is certainly one big category that's 
growing quickly and that we're investing a lot in. So that I think is going 
quite well. We recently had some pretty big launches of an app 
in that area, 
and we're going to keep on investing there. Then on the virtual reality side, 
this has always been a long
-
term vision. Quest has surpassed our 
expectations.
 
I wish we can make more of them faster during this period. I do think that 
it's one o
f those areas where as people can't go out into the world as much, 
the ability to have technology that allows us to be physically present or feel 
present even when we can be physically together, whether that's Quest or 
Portal or any of the software that we
're building around video presence that 
stuff is certainly seen especially large spikes in usage and it's possible that 
this brings accelerate some of the trends around adoption of things like 
virtual or augmented reality. But I'm not sure what will happen
 
there long
-
term? But in the near term, I'm quite pleased with how Quest is doing and I 
wish we could make more of them.
 
David Wehner
 
Youssef, I'll take the second part of that question. So I think it's probably 
the market that would be most instructive wo
uld be a market like China, but 
I think for us China is a bit different, because we don't have users in China. 
So the business there is China
-
based advertisers reaching people outside of 
China. So it's hard to extrapolate too much from that. We did see a p
ullback 
of revenue in China earlier in the quarter, and we have seen a recovery 
there, and a recovery 
--
 
but one thing that's hard to know is part of that is 
really kind of mixed up in the vertical 
--
 
verticals as well. China tends to for 
us index pretty h
ighly with gaming and e
-
commerce and those segments 
that are driven towards online outcomes, where we're seeing relative 
strength. So it's hard to really read too much into the experience.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan fr
om UBS.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One bigger picture one 
dovetailing all the comments around e
-
commerce. I'm curious if there's 
anything you're seeing in terms of the behavior of users on the platform that 
would make
 
you want to accelerate or change the path of product 
development to capture some of the supply and demand you might be 
seeing as people want to sell in an omnichannel world and some of the 
demand that might be there on the buyer side to connect e
-
commerce
 
broadly across Facebook's properties as an output of the current 
environment?
 
And then Dave, maybe if I could just ask one quickly, I don't think you called 
it out, but I am curious if you could identify the credit loss assumption in the 
quarter and what 
the number might have been or is that something we 
might have to wait for the 10
-
Q for? Thanks so much.
 
David Wehner
 
Mark, do you want to take the e
-
commerce or you want me to do both?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
I mean, I can talk to it briefly and then you can add t
o it if you think that 
there is more. We are seeing increases in some of the consumer behavior 
around this, but I think the bigger thing is just that for all the small 
businesses that we serve and a lot of small businesses that are out there 
that are still
 
primarily physical, there is a 
--
 
there has been a big push to get 
online and to do more selling online. And I think there are lots of 
opportunities for us to support them in building the tools that they need to 
do this. We're seeing a lot of businesses t
hat work primarily physical.
 
Now moving towards selling stuff online for the first time, and we're seeing a 
lot of businesses that already had a digital presence, now really transitioned 
to having their digital presence be primarily 
--
 
be their primary pre
sence. 
And that, I think that that trend, while there may be some short
-
term spike, 
I do think plays into a pre
-
existing long
-
term trend. And we'll certainly want 
to accelerate that aspect of our product road map to make sure that we can 
serve a lot of tho
se businesses during this period when it can help them with 
the recovery and get through this. So we're working on a lot of work 
streams there. We'll hopefully have more to share over the coming weeks.
 
David Wehner
 
Yes. Eric, on the bad debt expense that i
ncreased by $193 million. So that 
will be the number that's in the Q and the majority of that relates to 
charges. Obviously that we're taking related to the COVID
-
19 pandemic in 
our views on collectability of certain accounts in that environment.
 
Operator
 
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks. Two questions. Mark at the very beginning, you talked about the 
economic fallout possibly lasting longer than people think. Just any detail 
behind that. Is there somethin
g you're seeing in the data's that you've got 
reaction? And then following up a little bit on Eric Sheridan's question, these 
kind of events, crises can create new, I don't know paths or whatever. So 
you talked about shopping. What about WhatsApp there's a
 
surge in usage 
of WhatsApp. Is there something that's happened that makes it more 
interesting more 
--
 
for long
-
term more interesting as a monetization vehicle 
because of the surge and usage of WhatsApp. Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Yes, I can take those 
two. I think that we'll see a meaningful economic hit if 
I had to predict for the period of the health emergency. And so I think that 
as Dave said in his comments, the efficacy of the shelter
-
in
-
place orders and 
how well that's going, I think will be a big
 
determinant of how long and how 
painful the economic fallout is from this. So there is certainly a range of 
outcomes that I don't think I have any particular insight that that's not 
public or that you don't have. But I worry that this could be worse than 
at 
least some people are predicting.
 
The other question was monetization on WhatsApp. I think that there is a 
huge opportunity on WhatsApp if for no other reason than that it has 2 
billion people using it and we haven't done significant work on building ou
t 
the business yet. I mean we have some tools there, but we're still early in 
the phase of 
--
 
we've built out WhatsApp Business. There is tens of millions 
of businesses that are signed up and that are using that. So it's 
--
 
there is 
tremendous demand peopl
e want to communicate with businesses and we've 
been in the process of building out the infrastructure to do payments and 
more commerce, ad units like what I mentioned around quick to messaging 
ads are performing well.
 
So, I think all the indicators are po
sitive; but it's just a generally untapped 
opportunity so far, and one that we are that I think it's very exciting to build 
out over the coming years.
 
David Wehner
 
I think Deborah is trying to say that there is one last question.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Yes. Than
k you.
 
David Wehner
 
If we could just take one last question, please.
 
Operator
 
Your last question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
 
Colin Sebastian
 
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first, Dave, I was hoping, I 
know this is 
not a key focus right now but any updated thoughts or timeline 
on some of the targeting and measurement headline 
--
 
headwinds that you 
spoke about on the last call? And then with respect to both the ongoing 
investment priorities as well as the slower growt
h in headcount, is there any 
way you could articulate which areas are seeing that slowdown versus those 
that are getting full support? Thank you.
 
David Wehner
 
Sure, Colin, I can take both of those. Yes, I mean the targeting headwinds 
are having an impact o
n the business, but obviously that's dwarfed by the 
impact that COVID
-
19 is having right now. We continue to see the three 
factors around targeting, and this hasn't changed the regulatory pressures 
with GDPR and CPPA and similar regulations. The moves by p
latforms that 
make third
-
party targeting and measurement more difficult, and then our 
own moves on launching privacy controls. So, these are impacting the whole 
industry, and we believe we're relatively well positioned. We've got a lot of 
first
-
party signa
l. That said, I think this will have a broad impact on return 
on investment and could affect what advertisers are able to find and acquire 
customers effectively for their businesses, may not be able to grow as 
quickly as they otherwise could and that could
 
have a negative impact on 
their growth in the economy and obviously revenue for us.
 
So certainly, it's a challenging time to make it tougher for businesses to 
grow, but we're certainly 
--
 
continue to have that headwind in the longer 
term.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Great. Thank you for joining us.
 
David Wehner
 
And I'm sorry, I forgot investment priorities. We're continuing to focus on 
recruiting on the tax side. So product and engineering. So we're sort of fully 
going down that path. That's was our core product and 
innovation efforts. 
And we are slowing down headcount in business function. So some of the 
functions related to things like advertising sales is slower in those 
departments, given the overall economic climate. And then there are certain 
areas that we're ju
st finding efficiencies, there's less travel, there's less 
entertainment. And I think that may persist for quite some time. So we're 
seeing savings there and we're going to be looking at getting marketing 
efficiencies, because obviously prices are coming d
own on the marketing 
front, so that we can get the same impact for less dollars and also look for 
efficiencies on marketing spend. So those are the areas that I would call out.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Right. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time
. Stay safe 
everybody, and we look forward to speaking with you again.

way I will
 
use it on most of these calls, to talk about our vision and strategy.
 
Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. We do this by 
building services that give people the power to share whatever they want 
and stay connected to whomever they want
, no matter where they are. For 
at least the next few years, there are three pillars to our strategy. First, we 
want to build the best and most ubiquitous mobile product. Second, we want 
to build a platform so that every new app that gets created can be so
cial and 
enable people to share. And, third, we want to build a strong monetization 

companies.
 


start with mobile. I think our opportunity on mobile is the most 
misunderstood aspect of Facebook today. Most people underestimate how 
fundamentally good the trend towards mobile can be for Facebook. This is 
because there are three trends that are kind of 
compounding together. First, 
mobile will give us the opportunity to reach way more people than desktop. 
Second, people on mobile use Facebook more often. And, third, long term, I 

than 
desktop. All of these combined together make mobile a much larger 
opportunity for us than I think most people realize.
 


 
controversial. In 
the coming years, there could be billions more smartphones than desktop 
computers. We already reach more than a billion people worldwide, including 
600 million on mobile, growing quickly and up from 376 million last year. 
Facebook is the
 
most widely downloaded app on basically every smartphone 

population.
 
Second, people use our mobile app to visit Facebook more frequently. 
Somebody who uses only our desktop product has onl
y a 40% likelihood of 
using Facebook on a given day, but someone who uses mobile has a 70% 
likelihood of using Facebook on a given day. This thought is surprising to 
many people and very good news for our opportunity on mobile. Another 


mobile engagement.
 
Over the past year, a lot of people gave us feedback that our mobile apps 
were just too slow. So we took the time to rewrite them to make them 
faster. And since we released the new
 

increase in iOS News Feed loads and more than a 20% increase in iOS 

rewritten Android app yet, but we have many more updates on the way. So 
people on mobi
le are already more engaged than people on desktop, and 

well.
 
Third, as people spend more time using Facebook on mobile, the business 
question becomes how much money we can make from th
at time. I believe 


to getting there. The reason why I believe this is that on mobile, 
monetization has to 
be integrated deeply into our product. On desktop, 

-
dollar business with ads on the side, separated 

 
But on mobile, we believe ads will be more like TV 

 
high quality and 
integrated into the experi
ence rather than off to the side. Mobile is a forcing 
function for us to rethink these experiences to be in mind. Since 
monetization needs to be integrated directly to the core product experience, 

ation 
experience for their product. This is already unlocking a lot of ideas and 

-
quality monetization experiences 
in terms of better ad products for people and better results for advertisers.
 
Finally, I want to 


started trying yet. Today, after just six months of ramping up our mobile ad 

enue this quarter 


development and monetization.
 
So on mobile, we have these three forces compounding toget
her. We can 
reach more users, those users visit Facebook more often, and I think we will 

 
Next I want to talk about platform. At a high level, for our platform the last 
five to 10 years has been about 
getting everyone in the world connected and 
mapping out all the relationships between people. The next five to 10 years 
are going to be about all the apps and experiences that are now possible to 
build now that all these connections have already been mappe
d out. The 
social graph is a new sort of critical infrastructure for companies.
 
Since the majority of the people use their services are on Facebook, 
increasingly developers are building social apps. Today, eight of the top 10 
iOS apps integrate with Facebo
ok, and 40% of the top 400 apps use our 
SDKs. We believe that social apps will be the best products in every business 
category. In some categories, it may be an abrupt, disruptive, or 
revolutionary change, and in others, the change may be more subtle or ro
ll 
out more slowly over time.
 
But over the next five to 10 years, we believe that the best products in 

and Games, and in the future we expect to see this in areas like commerce 
an

these apps get built and industries get transformed, why is this good for 
Facebook? We believe that over time, the more value we provide, the more 


buying ads, running our ads through our network, using our Payments 

and profitable platform.
 
Now, I want to talk specifically about Games for 
a bit, because I think the 
story here is a little misunderstood as well. Overall, gaming on Facebook 

different stories playing out here. On the one hand, our Payments revenue 
f
rom Zynga decreased by 20% this quarter compared to last year. But the 
interesting thing is that the rest of the Games ecosystem has actually been 
growing. Our monthly Payments revenue from the rest of the ecosystem 
increased 40% over the past year since P
ayments has been adopted. This 
evolution is pretty encouraging.
 
Additionally, I want to talk about Instagram. This is really a platform success 
story. We got to know them because they built a social integration with us 
that a lot of people really liked, an
d both companies saw the opportunity to 
do even more together. When we agreed to acquire them, Instagram had 27 
million registered users. Today, they have more than 100 million. The most 

me 
spent on Instagram than on Twitter. By giving Instagram access to some of 
the tools we have internally here at Facebook, they can grow even faster 
than they would have alone.
 
Finally, I want to switch gears and talk a bit about monetization. The most 
im


about before handing it off to Sheryl to go into more detail on them.

Thanks, Mark. We made a lot of progress in our advertising business in the 
third quarter. Our total third quarter revenue was $1.26 billion, with $1.09 
billion coming from advertising. This represents a 32% year
-
over
-
year 
increase in overall revenue and a 36% increase for advertising. With a billion 
people using Facebook monthly, we have created the largest, most engaged 
community of real people in the world. Building on this extraordinary asset, 
the goal of our adver
tising business is to transform how people and 
businesses connect. Our scale and targeting capabilities make Facebook 
increasingly important for marketers 

 
brand marketers, direct marketers, 
local businesses, and developers 

 
as they move customers all th
e way 
through the marketing funnel.
 
For brand marketers like Walmart and Procter & Gamble, Facebook offers 
the ability to reach customers, build awareness, and drive positive 
association, affinity, and consideration. We help brand marketers develop 
ongoing
 
and often daily relationships with customers, in many cases for the 
first time. Facebook is starting to combine the science of CRM with the scale 
of brand marketing.
 
For direct marketers like Amazon and Capital One, working with Facebook 
can achieve high 
ROI by tapping into our incredibly accurate targeting 
capabilities. This represents a significant opportunity for us in a $55 billion 
global market. For the 12.8 million local businesses that already have 
Facebook pages, our products, including location an
d interest targeting and 
Offers, deepen customer relationships and drive sales. With tens of millions 
more local businesses around the world not yet on Facebook, we offer a 
simple path for SMBs to go digital and drive customers into their stores.
 
And for d
evelopers, we spur app downloads and installs and help them 
reengage customers to generate revenue. Facebook is uniquely positioned to 
succeed in this rapidly growing global market.
 
We believe that each of these market segments could over time become

monetization products. The result has been rapid innovation and new 
product introductions to serve each of the market segments more 
effectively. I will highli
ght four.
 
Custom Audiences, introduced in early September, helps marketers use their 
customer lists or other data to target Facebook ads in a privacy
-
protected 
way. This allows them to send the right message to the right person at the 
right time. For examp
le, an automaker can advertise to customers who are 
looking to buy new car. We frequently see a match rate of over 50% and 
sometimes as high as 95%, which we believe to be much higher than 
industry norm.
 
In September, we expanded the rollout of FBX, the Fa
cebook Exchange, 
which allows businesses to bid on specific impressions in real time. For 
example, if a customer visits a home
-
furnishing website to view a particular 
rug, the business can deliver Facebook ads to remind him that the rug is still 
available.
 
A month ago, we reintroduced Offers, which provides businesses a powerful 
new way to acquire new customers and drive loyalty. Every time someone 
claims an offer on Facebook, he or she creates a story that is shared with 
friends. Since launch, approximatel
y 100,000 pages have created an offer, 
and approximately 30% of offer claims are coming from mobile devices.
 
Finally, we launched Promoted Posts, which make it easy to turn any page 
post into an ad. This simplicity is especially valuable for local business
es. 
Since launching in Q2, we have seen promoted posts from over 300,000 
pages, over 25% of which are new advertisers to Facebook.
 
These new products enable marketers to achieve more of their objectives on 
Facebook. And more importantly, by improving the t
argeting and quality of 
our ads, we also create a better experience for our users.
 

priority is to prove the value of our products to marketers. Brand marketers 
increasingly recogniz
e that they can have impact on Facebook similar to that 
on TV. Our daily reach is more than three times larger than the total viewing 


e publicly recognize the 
high ROI Facebook delivers. We have shown that Facebook ads drive sales 
and ring cash registers. Based on studies of more than 60 campaigns, we 
learned that 70% of those campaigns showed a return on ad spend of three 
times or bette
r, and 49% showed a return of five times or better.
 

Samsung used Facebook to build awareness of their new Galaxy S3 
smartphone, reaching 105 million people and driving a 10

favorability among relevant customers. Even better, they determined that 
customers who saw the ads bought their new phone at an 85% higher rate 

million in sales attributable t
o Facebook, nearly a 13x return on advertising 
spend.
 
Our new targeting capabilities, Custom Audiences and FBX, greatly increase 
the value Facebook provides direct marketers by significantly increasing 
efficiency through better precision. MGM Resorts Inter
national has been 
testing Custom Audiences to provide offers on hotel stays to repeat guests. 

expanding their use of this product.
 
Initial results from beta partners show that FBX ads 
can achieve results 
equal to and often greater than those of other ad platforms. For example, 
MediaMath found their clients achieved 40% better performance on FBX than 
other platforms. Tell apart clients using FBX experienced a 10
-
times return 
on ad spend 
at a cost per acquisition comparable to other platforms.
 
Our other products are demonstrating similar results. Lawson, a leading 
convenience store chain in Japan, used Facebook Offers to advertise a 
discount on fried chicken. Over half a million people cla
imed the offer, 92% 
of whom did so from their mobile device, generating a 7x return on 

Promoted Posts to drive a 19% increase in both their number of guests 

 
in 
both their monthly number
 
of guests and monthly gross revenue.
 
Finally, I want to talk about our progress in mobile. Marketers want to reach 

time. We believe that no one is better positioned than we are to he
lp 
marketers capitalize on the transition to mobile. Our mobile user base is 
huge, growing, and even more engaged than our desktop users. And, 
importantly, we deliver an experience that works for ads, since a significant 
portion of time on Facebook Mobile 
is spent using News Feed.
 
In Q3, we saw marketers embrace News Feed on both mobile and desktop 
as a growing part of their advertising strategies. This is driving results, given 
that page post ads in News Feed on both mobile and desktop are more than 
eight 
times as engaging as page post ads on the right

hand side. Advertisers 
are also seeing a 10x greater ad recall per impression. We see significant 
opportunity for future revenue growth from products and mobile News Feed, 
such as paid search ads and Mobile A

Install Ads, which we launched just

started our mobile monetization efforts in March, and already in the 
third

take time to generate revenue and scale, but our results to date suggest 

rapidly launching and scaling products 

that Facebook ads can deliver, and we have become one of the largest 
mobile advertising platforms in less than eight months.

David Ebersman
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to build on Mark and 

revenue, and financial performance.
 

ith 1.007 billion people using 
Facebook, up 26% from a year ago. 584 million people accessed Facebook 
each day on average in September, up 28% from the prior year. We grew 
monthly and daily users in all geographic regions, led by Brazil, India, and 
Japan. 
Mobile continues to drive our user growth, and we ended Q3 with 604 
million monthly mobile users, up 61% versus last year. None of the user 
numbers include Instagram, which as Mark mentioned passed 100 million 
registered users and continues to grow.
 

pleased that engagement patterns remain impressively strong around 
the world in terms of visitation as well as content shared and feedback 
created, as measured by likes and comments. We still see 58% of our 
monthly users coming back to Facebook each day, e
ven with more than a 
billion people using Facebook, including later adopters, and despite a 
constantly evolving competitive environment. This speaks to the value of our 
service and the strength of our network.
 
Now turning to revenue. As Sheryl said, total 
revenue was up 32% from last 
year, and ads revenue was up 36%. If exchange rates had stayed constant, 

two quarters of 2012, our ad revenue growth with constant exchange rates 
was 38% a

positive impact from our recent investments in monetization. Ad revenue 
growth was driven by a 27% increase in the number of ads delivered and a 
7% increase in the average price per ad. The increase
 
in ads delivered is 
similar to the year
-
over
-
year rate of user growth, as the reduction in ads per 
user from engagement shifting to mobile was generally offset by product 
changes that increased ad inventory.
 
In terms of ad price changes versus last 
year, the 7% increase was driven 
primarily by the ramping up of ads in News Feed, as these ads continue to 
have higher levels of user engagement as measured by click rates and 
therefore a higher price per ad compared to ads in the right
-
hand column. In 
the
 
U.S. and Canada, where the shift to mobile continues rapidly, price per 
ad increased by 20% relative to last year. And price per ad also increased 
significantly in Asia and rest of world. Europe remains challenging, with price 
per ad down from a year ago.
 
Payments and other fees revenue in the third quarter totaled $176 million, 
up 13% from last year but down 9% compared to the second quarter, driven 
by a decline in payments from Zynga. Payments revenue from non
-
Zynga 
developers in aggregate continued to g
row from Q2 to Q3. In Q3, Zynga 
represented 43% of our Payments revenue, down from 51% in Q2 and 62% 
in Q3 last year.
 
Including its ad spend, Zynga comprised 7% of our total revenue this 
quarter, down from 10% in Q2 and 12% in Q3 last year. An additional 
r
eminder on Payments: In Q4, we plan to recognize revenue from four 
months of Payments transactions, for accounting reasons noted in our last 
10
-
Q and repeated on slide 10 of the earnings slides on our website. In 
terms of revenue per user, worldwide ARPU i
ncreased 4% versus Q3 2011. 
North America and rest of world ARPU increased by around 20% each, while 
Europe and Asia ARPU each increased by a few percent, with Europe 
negatively affected by exchange rate changes.
 
Turning now to expenses. Our Q3 GAAP expens
es were $885 million, an 
increase of 64% from last year. Excluding the effect of stock comp, our 
remaining expenses increased 57% to $737 million, driven by head count 
growth and investments in infrastructure. We ended the quarter with just 
over 4,300 empl
oyees, a quarter

quarter increase of 9%. We plan to 
continue to invest aggressively in the business in Q4, with a sharp focus on

platform as cr
itical to drive continued user growth and deepen engagement 

also investing more in monetization in order to build out and improve the 
products we offer advertisers and also to fund 
new initiatives such as Gifts. 
We had GAAP operating income of $377 million in the third quarter. 
Including the effects of stock comp, our operating income was $525 million, 
representing a 42% non
-
GAAP operating margin.
 
Our GAAP tax rate for Q3 was 116%, d
riven by the unusual amount of stock 
comp this year, a portion of which is not tax deductible. Excluding the effect 
of stock comp, our non
-
GAAP tax rate was 40%. For Q4, we expect our 
GAAP and non
-
GAAP tax rates to be similar to Q3 before our GAAP tax rate
 
returns to more typical levels in 2013.
 
The amount of cash tax we pay will be significantly different from the tax 
provision I just described due to deductions from vesting of RSUs and 

s of 
over $10 billion that will reduce our cash tax payments in 2012 and in the 
future. Driven by our tax provision in Q3, we reported a GAAP net loss of 
$59 million or $0.02 per share. Excluding stock comp and its tax effects, we 
had a non
-
GAAP net income
 
of $311 million or $0.12 per share.
 
Turning to cash metrics, we purchased $171 million of property and 
equipment in Q3 and acquired another $161 million of equipment financed 
through capital leases. For 2012, we expect to come in at the low end of the 
Cap
Ex range we provided last quarter, which was $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. 
In Q3, we also paid $300 million upon closing the Instagram acquisition, and 
we ended Q3 with $10.5 billion in cash and investments. In Q4, RSUs that 
we granted employees between 20
07 and 2010 will vest and settle for the 
first time.
 


payments will equal the value of the 120 million shares o
n the vesting dates 

disclosed, we expect to fund the tax payments from cash on hand and our 
amended term loan facility. After the withholding dates, the 120 million 
shares will no longe
r be considered outstanding for accounting purposes, 
reducing our shares that are used to calculate EPS.

Justin Post 

 
Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch
 
Great. A couple questions for you on mobile. First, can you talk about total 
engagement as you look at individual users, both on PC and mobile? Are you 
seeing that engagement grow if you add up both in minutes or likes or other 
metric
s? Can you talk about total engagement of your user base and how 

Can you say 

 
last quarter you gave us kind of how you were ending the 
quarter. Can you say if that mobile was kin
d of accelerating as the quarter 
progressed? Thank you.
 
David Ebersman
 
Sure. I can take both those questions. So first of all, in terms of engagement 
on mobile and web, we continue to see that content created is growing 
across the world, and feedback, whic
h we measure in terms of likes and 
comments, continues to grow well as well. So the engagement story on 

 
In terms of the sort of Feed revenue, at the end of the second quarter, we 
disclosed tha
t at that point we were running at about $1 million a day, and 

of the quarter, so we felt like giving you the numbers for the whole quarter 
was not representative of where we were. Th
ose numbers continued to ramp 
through the quarter. We ended the third quarter with more than $4 million a

obviously you guys have been putting
 
the pedal to the metal, and I 
think, Dave, you just kind of gave some metrics around the impact to the 
overall experience. But first question is, is there anything that makes you 
believe that the acceleration in mobile is impacting the experience? And 
sec
ond, can you talk about any sort of cannibalization from the desktop to

So I was just wondering if you can maybe give us some examples of 
instances where you guys are already seeing better

than on desktop. And, David, can you just quantify the contribution of 
Instagram in the quarter, both top and bottom line, if possible?

that really works in that format.
 
David
 
Ebersman
 
In terms of Instagram, we closed the acquisition towards the end of the third 
quarter, so the impact was next to zero, certainly zero on the top line, and 
next to zero on the bottom line. In the fourth quarter, we will have expenses 
both from the
 

and also the amortization of the intangible assets that we acquire.
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
And to add one more thought on monetization on mobile versus desktop, 
which I think is the heart of the question, i


the right
-
hand side to those that are being placed in News Feed. And 
comparatively, the ones in News Feed 

 

desktop 

 
are e
ight times more engaging, and we see 10 times the ad recall. 
And that makes sense, because News Feed is where a lot of the engagement 
on Facebook takes place, so by moving those promoted posts or page posts 

esults as well.

Next we have Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
 
Heather Bellini

Great. Thank you very much. I had a question for Mark. I guess I was 
wondering, given
 
the monetization products that you mentioned at the start 
of the call, if you could maybe rank

how would you rank those 
in terms of their ability to drive revenue in calendar 2013, and which ones 
should be watching most closely? Thank you.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

products now, right? And if you look at where we were historically, most of 
the ad inventory was in this right
-
hand column. It was a separate 
experience. And we 
had this ad team and their job was to kind of drive that 
service, and they could provide that service to every other product team. So 
the Messages team focuses on building the best Messages product, and now 
when they can run that on the side to make money.
 

responsible for the advertising experience within each of their products, so 
the News Feed team is coming up with better ad experiences than just being 
able to run kind of genera


more tailored advertising experiences. So I think there are multiple ways to 
look at it. I mean, you can look at it by market segment f
or advertisers, or 
you could look at it by consumer product; that tends to be how I look at 


lot better p
roducts for both users and advertisers.
 
Operator
 
Our next question is from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Scott Devitt 

 
Morgan Stanley
 

answered, just pass. But
, Mark, you mentioned ad network in your 
commentary, and you also discussed search as a business opportunity for 
Facebook in the middle of the quarter at an event. And so just wonder if you 
could talk a little bit more about those opportunities in terms of
 
the 
approach that you would take to build businesses such as that. And then 
secondly, David, you mentioned changes in the ad product as a driver for 
growth in ads served, and what were those changes that were made? 
Thanks.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So on plat
form, the basic approach that we have is we think that 
almost every product category is going to get transformed in some capacity, 
some abrupt, some kind of subtle transitions over time, where we think that 
at the end of this process, the winning products 
in every category are going 
to be social ones. And one question that I get frequently is just how, if we 
enable companies to build better products, how does Facebook make money 

b
uild our platform in a sustainable and profitable way.
 
But rather than focusing too early on, on trying to figure out exactly what 
the economic relationship is going to be with each of these partners, what 

companies to grow. And the 
basic idea is that there are many different ways that we make money from 
the different platform partners, right? So most of the companies that 
develop with us 

 


 
but a lot of them buy a lot 
of ads wit
h us, right, and are some of our biggest advertisers, if you look at 

and on desktop, some developers are running our ads on their sites, and 

venue share and can get some 
revenue and profit from these developers growing in engagement.
 
We obviously have the Payments system as well, so developers can 
integrate that, and we take a cut of that. And there may be other ways in 
the future that make sen
se as well that we can talk to developers about 
exploring. But the basic idea is that we are first focused on helping 
developers transform these categories, and then we believe that there are 
going to be a number of different ways of that that revenue can 
come back 
to us.
 
David Ebersman
 
So, Scott, you were asking about the comments I made that in the quarter, 
this quarter, the number of ads we showed grew at a similar rate to user 
growth after 

 

because 
of the shift to mobile, and the product changes helped to offset 
that. So one product change, for example, would be in this quarter we 
showed ads in News Feed on both mobile and personal computers, and the 
year
-

nges through the period 
of time, several of which I think had a positive impact on the number of ads 
we show per page on personal computer use.
 
Operator
 
Next we have the line of Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
 
Ross Sandler 

 
Deutsche Bank
 
Great. Just two quick questions. First for Mark on the platform, one of the 
things we all hope to see Facebook do one day is kind of monetize your 
strong distribution without touching the user experience with ads. We 
assume that you guys have
 
thought about this quite a bit, so is there any 
strategy in the works where you guys could potentially charge for API calls 

a question about the geographic revenue mix. So most 
of the ad 
acceleration happened in the U.S. Most of your other regions on a local FX 
basis decelerated a little bit. So have the new mobile ads been rolled out in 
those other regions yet, or is that a catalyst that we will see in the coming 
quarters? Thank
s.
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 

monetization. One of the reasons why we favor approaches like having 
developers buy ads or run our ads or accept payments is that we end up 
getting a portion of revenue o



 

less

ut.
 
But, again, one theme that I talked about earlier was how each product 
group now is in charge of the ads experience for that product, and what 

-
Installs, 
which is an advertising product fo
r providing distribution for developers, and 

-
first 

developers still want to spread their apps on mobile, so
 
I think it has a lot of 
potential.
 
David Ebersman
 
In terms of the geographic mix for our advertising revenue, the new 
products that are most important to us, or were most important in the third 
quarter, which is the ads in News Feed, are adopted or were a
dopted more 

just given how these things tend to play out. But if you look at ad revenue 
year over year across the world, actually Asia and rest of world grew at a 
faster rate than t
he U.S. did, and Europe grew a little bit more slowly. So 
while I do think the U.S. has grown more in terms of dollars because the

Great, thanks. I hate to ask about desktop, but I will. It looks like the

you.
 
David Ebersman
 

think that we opened up a lot of inventory on mobile in this quarter, and so 
we had
 

desktop computer into mobile feeds, because our relationships with 
advertisers 

 


 
Sh

say our clients are in different parts of that adoption curve. We have clients

if you think about Custom Audiences, 
Custom Audiences enables you, an advertiser, to segment to different parts 

those ads perform better 

is also really important, because by measuring, we not just prove the results 
we have to marketers, but we then get results, which we can then use to 
improve the ads.

On the second question, which is basically the efficacy an

people are measuring. We are seeing our products create great value and

Great, thanks. Just wanted to ask 
two questions. First, just going back to 
ads in the News Feed, can you talk about where you think you are now in 
terms of coverage and inventory levels versus where you could potentially 
be going forward? Just trying to get an understanding here for how mu
ch 
more gains there are from inventory versus advertisers, more advertisers 
coming on board and driving pricing up higher? And then secondly, can you 
talk a little bit about the early benefits that you might be seeing from the 
Facebook Ad Exchange, how muc
h inventory has been opened up here, and 
is there any chance that the Ad Exchange can help stabilize the sequential

Thanks for taking the question. Can you dimensionalize the nature of your 
advertiser base between small advertisers versus large brands that work 
with agencies? And secondarily, can you talk through the geography of the 
advertisers
, not the users, but how the breakdown diverges? And specifically 
with mobile, is much of it coming from the U.S. versus internationally? 
Thank you.

When we think about the four key marketer segments we have

that local businesses have the ability to really generate a lot of revenue and 

hard to get local businesses onli

businesses who are using our free products. We have 12.8 million have 
Facebook pages, 8 million of them use that page monthly, and over 3.5 
million post weekly.
 
But what you saw this quarter with the launch of Promoted 
Posts is a really 
big step function in converting those people who are using our free page 
product into paying customers. With over 300,000 pages using Promoted 
Posts, 25%

geography. You were asking about where the revenue 

going. As you would imagine, the revenue is going to skew more to the 
developed world in that kind of a comparison, because you h
ave large global 
companies that are trying to advertise to users throughout the world, more 
than you have people in developing markets who are trying to reach people 
in the United States, for example. So if you were to pick the U.S. as an

where on the web, Facebook is 
essentially a platform that applications run 
on, to the mobile environment, where Facebook for the most part is an 

Android from Google.
 
And how does that change the opportunity, the w
ay you look at the business 
long term? And as a related matter to that, as you look to monetize the 
Open Graph network with so many applications and websites that link into 
you, what do you see as the opportunity to begin to push the ad network 
beyond mobi
le into other websites and use your social data to actually push 
ads outside the network? And could that be a business that takes a life of its 
own above advertising on your own, by itself? Thanks.

is is why in my opening remarks I 
spent a bunch of time talking about how I think that in this counterintuitive 
way, I think a lot of folks have the question that you have of whether the 
fact that iOS or Android are these mobile platforms, is that a worse 

these three compounding factors 

 
more users, more time spent, and the

mobile than we were on desktop before. And I think some of the trends and 

case a bit more.

sharing platform. 
We never were an environment for running apps, right? Even on desktop, 
when you have these games that are very deeply connected to Facebook, 

building w
ebsites that connect with Facebook and make it so you can pull 
your friends in and then use Facebook for distribution and sharing. So what I 

that are literally inside the Facebook
 
app. But what we do see is a lot of 
success in getting developers to connect their apps to Facebook.
 
So I mentioned these stats where eight of the top 10 iOS apps are 
connected to Facebook, and 40% of the top 400 iOS apps have the Facebook 
SDK and are usi


developers as an environment for building apps. And we think that we can 
basically build an environment, or build this informatio
n platform that goes 
across iOS and Android and mobile web and every other mobile platform 

those can use Facebook. And we think that that puts us in a really strong 
position.

Mark Zuckerberg
 
Thank you, Deborah. And thanks to everyone 
listening for joining Facebook's 
first earnings call as a public company. We appreciate having the 
opportunity to speak directly to all of you and to share our perspective on 
how we're doing in fulfilling our mission of making the world more open and 
conne
cted. Hopefully, you'll come away from today's call with a clear sense 
of the investments we're making to create value over the long term by 
making Facebook even more useful for all of the people who use our services 
worldwide.
 
We ended June with 955 milli
on monthly active users, over 1/2 of whom 
used Facebook on a daily basis and over 1/2 of whom used Facebook for 
mobile devices. We saw more people using our services at the end of June 
than at the end of March across all key countries, including 3 million 
more 
people in the U.S. Growing the network of people who use Facebook and 
expanding the social experiences available to them remains the foundation 
of our efforts and the key to our future success.
 
I'm going to focus the rest of my comments today on our t
op priorities 
across our product areas for 2012, specifically mobile, platform and social 
ads.
 
Let's start with mobile. Mobile is a huge opportunity for Facebook. Our goal 
is to connect everyone in the world. And over the next 5 years, we expect 4 
billion 
to 5 billion people to have smartphones. That's more than twice as 
many people that have computers today. So building great services for these 
devices is essential for us to help people connect. We also think that people 
are inherently social, and having a
 
device with you wherever you are creates 
more opportunities for sharing and connecting.
 
We're finding that people are quickly adopting our mobile services. As of the 
end of June, 543 million people were actively using our mobile services 
every month, each
 
month. That's 67% more people than the 325 million 
who were using our mobile services just a year ago. We've also found that 
people who use our mobile services are more active Facebook users than 
people who only use our desktop services. On average, mobil
e users are 
around 20% more likely to use Facebook on any given day. So mobile not 
only gives us the potential to connect more people with our services, but it 
also gives us the ability to provide more value and a more deeply engaging 
experience.
 
We don't 
just want to have the most widely used mobile apps, though. We 
want to build the best apps and we also want to build experiences that are 
as deeply integrated as possible into every device and mobile app that 
people use. We're investing very heavily in imp
roving our mobile apps, 
primarily across iOS, Android and the mobile Web. This involves building out 
world
-
class teams with competencies in different technical stacks, making 
significant investments in improving the technical foundation of our apps and 
des
igning new products and integrating into these mobile systems as deeply 
as we can.
 
We've made some good progress from the past quarter as we released our 
Camera app, shipped new releases of Messenger, shipped 2 releases of our 
Android app, agreed to acquir
e Instagram and worked with Apple to 
integrate Facebook into their upcoming release of iOS. Going forward, you 
should expect to see a frequency of improvement to each of these mobile 
experiences.
 
Finally, we're also beginning to demonstrate that we can adv
ertise 
effectively within the mobile experience. I'll discuss social ads more in a 
minute. But at a high level, our Sponsored Stories, which we launched in 
mobile News Feed earlier this year, have grown quickly and demonstrated 
early success.
 
Now let's shi
ft to platform. We believe one of the biggest opportunities we 
have is to create the identity and social layer that all new apps and websites 
can be built on top of. We think almost every product is better when you can 
experience it with the people you car
e about. So over time, we expect 
almost all of these products should naturally become social. Since there's no 
way we could ever build all of these ourselves, we're focused on building a 
successful platform, which enables developers to build great social 
e
xperiences into their own apps by integrating with and exchanging 
information with Facebook.
 
Our platform strategy enables millions of developers to build better products 
and helps us provide a lot of value to the people who use Facebook. We've 
already see
n how social dynamics can transform industries, like gaming, and 
we believe other industries, like music, are starting to follow as well. Our 
goal is to make it easy for developers to build these social apps. We do this 
in 2 ways: first, by enabling people
 
to sign in to apps using Facebook and 
thereby bringing their real identities, friends and other information to the 
apps so that the apps can offer a more personalized experience; and second, 
by enabling people to share what they're doing in these apps to 
their friends 
back on Facebook so these apps can get accessed to our distribution and 
they can scale and grow quickly.
 
Today, you could download Spotify, log in with Facebook and immediately 
see our music player light up with songs your friends are listeni
ng to and 
recommending. We can imagine a day when you buy a new car and by 
logging into the car's computer with Facebook, you can similarly have it 
immediately light up music, addresses, restaurants, stores and other 
destinations targeted specifically for 
you based on your friends and your 
interests.
 
We believe social products like this will provide better experiences. But if 
we're right, then Facebook is in a unique place to enable these experiences 
to get built. It's worth calling out that our vision for 
platform is bigger than 
what most people perceive. We believe our platform is about bringing social 
context to apps and providing distribution for apps regardless of what 
environment they're built in, including mobile apps, websites or on our own 
Canvas on
 
our own website. When many people think about our platform, 
they think only about games that are built inside of the Facebook website 
directly and not all of the other kinds of apps that developers can build.
 
Our Open Graph platform is what we call the to
ols we've launched last year 
that enable developers to easily integrate more kinds of actions and 
experiences with Facebook. Open Graph has already been adopted by many 
of the most popular websites and mobile apps. Many of the top apps in the 
iOS and Andro
id app stores are integrated with Facebook. Apps like Spotify, 
Netflix, Pinterest, foursquare, Instagram, Airbnb, Tumblr, VeeHD, Nike+, 
SongPop and thousands more have integrated with Open Graph to provide 
better social experiences and grow their user base
s. Already people are 
sharing nearly 1 billion pieces of content each day using Open Graph.
 
These Open Graph integrations enable Facebook users to share more of the 
content they want with their friends. This helps make our service more 
engaging overall sin
ce there's more content to consume. Additionally, we 
found that our largest developers also tend to become our largest 
advertisers as they look to further boost the distribution they're getting from 
us.
 
We're still in the early days of our Open Graph effor
t, and we're continually 
working to improve how it works. A big focus for us right now is giving 
people more tools to control how they share their information using these 
integrations. We're also working on improving the distribution that these 
apps get in
 
exchange for the content they help people share. These are 
some complex problems that will take time to work out, but you should 
expect us to make steady progress towards building out this ecosystem.
 
Finally, I'd like to discuss our social ads initiatives
. The basic idea here is 
that the best type of advertising is a message from a friend. Facebook wants 
to offer advertisers the best tools to create ads that are social. We believe 
that the more our advertising include interesting content from people you 
ca
re about, the more marketers will be able to create advertising that adds 
value to people's experience on Facebook. Advertisement on Facebook today 
is already delivering a compelling ROI, even though most advertising on 
Facebook today isn't social. We beli
eve the experience can be better and 
more social. For experience 
--
 
for example, if I like a restaurant, then my 
friends might see that I like that place, and that's likely a more convincing 
ad than anything the restaurant would produce on its own. That's 
an 
example of aligning social activity in ads. One important aspect of social ads 
is that since they're based on social activity, they've been to our News Feed 
product on both mobile and desktop. This is important because mobile users 
already spend so much
 
time reading their News Feed. So these social ads in 
News Feed give us a clear path to building a strong business on mobile.
 
I mentioned earlier that we recently began to roll out our Sponsored Stories 
in both desktop and mobile News Feed. By the end of J
une, Sponsored 
Stories in News Feed was at a run rate of over $1 million per day in revenue 
and about 1/2 of that is coming from mobile. This is an encouraging start in 
our effort to generate revenue from the mobile use of Facebook. We know 
that social ads
 
perform much better than nonsocial ads, so our job over the 
next few years is to increase the percentage of ads that are social and 
engaging.
 
Overall, I hope my comments here give you a good sense of our priorities 
around mobile, platform and social ads. 
We have a lot of interesting things 
going on here. There are a lot of challenges and these are the types of 
problems that we like to work on. We're working hard to staff up across the 
company, especially in the technical groups, to make sure we make progre
ss 
against these goals.
 
We just announced we've begun recruiting engineers to work in our London 
office to help us access talent across Europe. We're pleased that the 
company and culture are centered on building great products and around our 
mission to mak
e the world more open and connected.
 
Thanks, again, for taking the time to be on the call with us today. And now 
I'd like to hand it over to Sheryl.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
Thanks, Mark. I'm going to focus today on Facebook's opportunities in the 
advertising market and the progress we've made in the past quarter. Our 
total second quarter revenue of $1.18 billion, $992 million came from 
advertising. This represents a 32% year
-
over
-
year increase overall and a 
28% increase for advertising.
 
Facebook's 
power to change the way people and businesses influence each 
other creates unique advertising opportunities. We offer marketers the 
ability to reach a mass or a targeted audience and establish real and 
ongoing relationships directly with our customers. Mar
keters have always 
known that a recommendation from a friend is one of the most powerful 
ways to sell their products. Marketing on Facebook is fundamentally different 
than other mediums because messages can be shared from friend
-
to
-
friend. 
This is word
-
of
-
mouth marketing at an unprecedented scale. In an 
increasingly crowded world, this is essential for the world's largest global 
companies, as well as the small business around the corner.
 
We believe we are very well positioned to compete for advertising doll
ars 
throughout the entire marketing funnel, from the very top where companies 
focus on generating demand, to the bottom where the focus is on fulfilling 
demand. The majority of the advertising spend that is migrated online to 
date has been for demand fulfi
llment, which happens when a customer 
already has intent to purchase. Search advertising has been the primary 
driver of this migration. Facebook is also effective at the bottom of the 
funnel, with gaming being a primary example. But we believe that Faceboo
k 
also helps marketers build brands and generate demand. This is important 
because the majority of the $600 billion global advertising market is spent 
on demand generation.
 
Over the past quarter, we have made important progress in our 
monetization efforts 
in 3 areas: first, rolling out new ad products; second, 
demonstrating their ROI of Facebook ad spend; and third, making it easier 
for businesses to advertise with us.
 
I'll start with the new products we introduced. Earlier this year, we launched 
Sponsored 
Stories in Facebook News Feed. Sponsored Stories are regular 
stores that people see in the News Feeds already, updates, likes, comments 
posted to Facebook every day that a marketer pays to highlight. For 
example, if I post a positive review of a product I 
purchased at Walmart, 
about 20% of my friends have seen the post, depending on things like when 
they check their News Feed. Using Sponsored Stories, Walmart can pay to 
boost distribution of this post so a larger percentage of my friends see it.
 
Delivering 
social messages in Facebook's News Feed is an extraordinary 
opportunity for marketers. On the Web, people spend more time using 
Facebook than any other service by far. We believe this is true in mobile 
devices as well. Moreover, Facebook users spend a larg
e percentage of their 
time on News Feed. Sponsored Stories enable marketers to interact with 
their customers where their customers are spending their time. Our early 
results are encouraging. As measured by click
-
through rates, Sponsored 
Stories in News Fee
d perform multiple times better on both desktop and 
mobile than ads in the right
-
hand column.
 
Sponsored Stories in News Feed are the cornerstone of our mobile 
monetization strategy. News Feed functions in exactly the same way 
whether you're on the desktop 
or phone. This is important because we avoid 
the dilemma faced by other industry players, where to put ads on the 
smaller screens. With News Feed, marketing is incorporated seamlessly into 
the user experience on mobile devices. We recently enabled our adve
rtisers 
to buy us exclusively in mobile News Feed. We're seeing strong interest, 
particularly from our clients, who know mobile is critical to reaching new 
customers, especially in emerging markets.
 
As always, at Facebook, the user experience is paramount.
 
We've been 
delivering and introducing Sponsored Stories in a way that maintains the 
experience users have with our service. As we continue to roll out Sponsored 
Stories in News Feed, we are carefully monitoring user engagement and 
sentiment, and we're ple
ased with the results today. We believe that 
Sponsored Stories in News Feed has the potential to be among the most 
relevant ad formats for marketers. As Mark mentioned, in the short amount 
of time since launch, by the end of Q2, we are already generating m
ore than 
$1 million a day from this product with approximately 1/2 of this generated 
in mobile.
 
In Q2, we also began testing another new ad product. The Facebook Ad 
Exchange, or FBX, allows marketers to bid in real
-
time for ad impressions on 
Facebook. Real
-
time bidding is a standard industry practice to help 
advertisers reach the right customer at the right time, and it will help us 
deliver more relevant ads to users. We're in an early
-
offer test with FBX, but 
advertiser interest is strong. eMarketer estima
tes this market to be 
approximately $2 billion in the U.S. alone.
 
The second area of progress this quarter has come from our efforts to better 
demonstrate the effectiveness of ad spend on Facebook. Today, nearly every 
one of the Global Ad Age 100 advertise
rs spends with us every quarter. But 
to date, most only allocate a small size of their budget to Facebook, even 
though their customers spend large amounts of time using our service. This 
imbalance represents a substantial opportunity for us if we can educa
te the 
market about the ROI our ads deliver.
 
We have partnered with Nielsen to demonstrate that Facebook ads are not 
just seen but remembered. Studies of over 500 ad campaigns show that on 
average, Facebook ads drive 98% that are ad recalls and 31% higher 
brand 
awareness than non
-
Facebook online ad campaigns. Independent research 
has also demonstrated that social context significantly increases both ad 
recall and brand awareness of Facebook ads. This is not surprising since 
people are more likely to remembe
r a message that comes from their friend.
 
We recognize that ad recall is important, but it's only the first step in 
delivering results for marketers. Marketers' ROI is generated when the cash 
register rings. We're making great progress measuring our abilit
y to help 
marketers generate sales. Independent analysis of more than 60 campaigns, 
45 of which were completed in the first half of this year, show that 70% of 
those campaigns delivered a return on ad spend of 3x or better. And 49% of 
those campaigns deliv
ered a return of 5x or better. I'd like to share a few 
examples.
 
Electronic Arts recently spent $2.75 million promoting Battlefield 3 on 
Facebook. They attributed $12.1 million of their sales to these ads, 
translating to a 4.4x return on their Facebook mar
keting spend.
 
Barclaycard agreed to purchase Facebook ads as part of the direct response 
strategy to promote NFL team
-
branded credit cards. They targeted the ads 
to people based on the specific teams those people like. Their Facebook ads 
generated a 40% hi
gher conversion rate than any other online ad platforms 
they used in a campaign. This made their cost per acquisition 48% lower on 
Facebook than from other online ad buys. In total, 60% of the approved 
credit card applications from the campaign came from F
acebook.
 
Wooga, an international games developer, used mobile News Feed to drive 
installs of its Diamond Dash game. They increased downloads by 26% in the 
U.S., 29% in Germany and 37% in France, all at attractive costs per app 
installed.
 
This is just the b
eginning of our important effort to educate the market 
about the ROI Facebook ads deliver. We will continue to work account
-
by
-
account and campaign
-
by
-
campaign to demonstrate the value we provide.
 
Finally, our third area of progress has been to make it eas
ier for small
-
 
and 
medium
-
sized businesses to advertise on Facebook. Local business 
advertising is considered by many to be the Holy Grail of Internet 
advertising since the market opportunity is so great. This is proving difficult, 
however, because small b
usiness owners often lack the time or ability to 
adopt new technology. Facebook is uniquely accessible to them. As they 
typically learn to use Facebook by setting up personal profiles or Timelines, 
they then discover the value our service can provide them 
as business 
owners. Many of the world's approximately 60 million business owners are 
already Facebook users. Over 11 million businesses already have pages on 
Facebook. Over 7 million of these pages are actively used each and every 
month. In addition, hundr
eds of thousands of small businesses advertise 
with us. By making it easier to create a business page and run ads, we 
believe we can increase the number of small and local businesses who use 
our tools.
 
In the last quarter, we began testing simpler ads and 
easier purchase loads. 
For example, page owners can now turn a post into an ad campaign with 
just a few clicks. We're still in the early days of building our monetization 
engine. For the rest of 2012, we plan to focus on the same priorities I have 
discusse
d, in particular the ramp
-
up of Sponsored Stories in News Feed. If 
we are successful working with advertisers to increase the amount of 
content they generate that are social and engaging enough to promote on 
News Feed, we believe we should be able to incre
ase our revenue on those 
PCs and mobile devices.
 
In 2012 and beyond, we will also continue to invest in developing new 
products, particularly in mobile, and in educating the market on the value 
we deliver. We believe the world is becoming increasingly soci
al and 
personal, and the future of marketing depends upon building where the map 
is scaled. We also invest tools for marketers to not just participate in, but to 
shape this evolution. This will close the gap between the audience we deliver 
and our share of
 
advertising budget.
 
Now I'm happy to turn it over to David, to walk you through our financial 
results for the quarter.
 
David A. Ebersman
 
Thank you, Sheryl. And good afternoon, everyone, thanks for joining us on 
the call today. I'm going to walk you throug
h our Q2 progress against our 
key financial metrics related to revenue, users and expenses.
 
As Sheryl mentioned, revenue in the second quarter was up 32% from last 
year. The strengthening of the dollar cost us a few percentage points of 
revenue growth, whi
ch would've been 36% with constant exchange rates. 
Ads revenue was up 28%, driven by an 18% increase in the number of ads 
delivered and a 9% increase in the average price per ad. The increase in ads 
delivered was primarily due to user growth and also benef
ited from the net 
effect of product changes that increased the average number of ads per 
page relative to last year. Ad impressions continued the recent trend of 
growing more slowly than users as more of our usage is on mobile devices. 
This trend is partic
ularly true in markets such as the U.S., where 
smartphone use is expanding rapidly. The overall number of ads delivered in 
the U.S. this quarter decreased 2% year
-
over
-
year despite a 10% increase 
in daily users and despite the increase in ads per page from
 
the product 
changes I mentioned earlier, as daily Web users in the U.S. declined in favor 
of mobile users. And we're seeing similar trends in other developed markets.
 
The 9% increase in price per ad was driven primarily by the United States, 
where CPMs in
creased by over 20% due in large part to the ramp
-
up of 
Sponsored Stories in News Feed on both PCs and mobile devices. Sponsored 
Stories in News Feed are displayed where the user's primary attention is and 
are stories that we believe users will find engagi
ng based on their interest 
and connections. That makes Sponsored Stories in feed more relevant, 
resulting in stronger click
-
through rates and higher prices.
 
Price per ad also increased significantly in Asia and the rest of world 
markets. These markets are 
growing more rapidly in terms of users, and 
therefore, are receiving a growing share of our ad impressions each quarter, 
so we're pleased to see continued improvement in pricing. The relatively 
faster volume growth in Asia and rest of world does have the e
ffect of 
reducing our worldwide average price per ad due to the relatively lower 
pricing in those markets.
 
In Europe, price per ad decreased a few percentage points compared to last 
year, similar to what we saw in Q1, and we believe due in large part to th
e 
overall macro environment there. Over the long term, we continue to believe 
that we have a significant opportunity to increase CPMs. There are a number 
of potential drivers including: increasing the number of Sponsored Stories 
delivered in News Feed acro
ss desktop and mobile; improvements in our ad 
products, including better targeting capabilities; increased advertising 
demand as we continue to demonstrate ROI and as our clients get better at 
creating social and engaging ads; and overall growth and develo
pment of 
online ad markets globally.
 
Payments revenue for Q2 was $192 million. For the past 3 sequential 
quarters, payments revenue has been essentially flat. We believe this trend 
is due to the fact that gaming, in general, has been growing mainly on 
mobile devices, where our payment system is generally not utilized. We're 
continuing to invest in the gaming ecosystem on facebook.com, for example, 
with our new Facebook App Center, which is designed to help people 
discover new games and other types of ap
ps as well.
 
In terms of revenue per user, ARPU increased by double
-
digit rates in North 
America, Asia and rest of world and by 8% in Europe, and worldwide ARPU 
was $1.28 in the quarter. Our higher user growth in geographies with 
relatively lower revenue wo
rks to weigh down worldwide ARPU and the 
global growth rate.
 
Staying with user metrics for a minute. We ended June with 955 million 
monthly users, up 29% from 12 months earlier. On average in June, 552 
million people accessed Facebook each day, up 32% from
 
a year ago. 
Relative to last quarter, Brazil, India and Japan were key contributors to our 
growth in daily users. 58% of our monthly users were active daily users of 
the products, which we view as a positive measure of user engagement. And 
in addition, en
gagement patterns remain steady or grew across user groups 
as measured by the percentage of people creating content or providing 
feedback, such as likes and comments, and by the amount of content and 
feedback created per person.
 
We're encouraged that growt
h in engagement have remained strong as our 
network has expanded and as we've added later adopters to the service. We 
view this strong engagement as a sign of the utility of the service in the 
network and as the foundation for everything we're trying to ac
complish.
 
A couple of points on user metrics. First, we reviewed our methodology for 
estimating users by geography, and as a result, have made small 
adjustments to the geographic distribution of users as of the March 31 
measurement date. Second, we also re
fined and improved our methodology 
for recognizing what we call duplicate or false accounts. These refinements 
resulted in an increase in our estimate of duplicate or false accounts relative 
to our earlier global estimate, primarily driven by emerging mark
ets such as 
Turkey and Indonesia. Please see Slides 18 and 19 for more detail. Since 
authentic identity is so important to the Facebook experience, we'll continue 
to try to improve our user measurement techniques with the goal of 
ensuring that every accoun
t on Facebook represents an authentic unique 
individual.
 
Turning now to expenses. In Q2, our GAAP expenses were $1.93 billion. As 
planned and described in our prospectus, the biggest expense item was 
stock
-
based compensation, including associated payroll t
ax, which totaled 
$1.3 billion in the quarter, driven by the completion of our IPO and the 
recognition of expense for RSUs granted between 2007 and 2011, which had 
a vesting condition tied to the IPO. Please take a look at Slide 9 for more 
information on t
he past and expected future flow of stock comp expense.
 
Excluding the effect of stock comp, our remaining expenses increased 60% 
to $669 million, driven by headcount growth and infrastructure. Headcount 
at the end of the quarter was just under 4,000, a yea
r
-
over
-
year increase of 
about 50%. While we will seek to remain disciplined in our spend across the 
company, hiring top talent remains a key priority, enabling us to 
aggressively pursue the opportunities in mobile, platform and monetization 
that Mark and S
heryl discussed earlier.
 
In the second half of 2012, we expect our operating expenses, excluding 
stock comp, to continue to increase significantly relative to our spend in the 
second half of last year, probably at a slightly higher growth rate than we 
obse
rved in Q2. While we ultimately believe Facebook's business model 
should support attractive operating margins, at this early stage of our 
growth, investment is a top priority as opposed to managing for a target 
margin. Therefore, you can expect us to conti
nue an aggressive pace of 
investment in R&D and infrastructure, in particular.
 
We had a GAAP operating loss of $743 million in the second quarter. 
Excluding the effect of stock comp, our operating income would've been 
$515 million, representing a 43% opera
ting margin. Our effective tax rate 
for Q2 was 79%, driven by the fact that a portion of our stock comp expense 
is not tax
-
deductible. Excluding the effect of stock comp, our tax rate 
would've been approximately 40%. We expect that over the long run, our 
t
ax rate will be similar to the rates of other U.S. technology companies that 
have a similar mix of business inside and outside the U.S. The future 
reduction in our tax rate will occur gradually over several years.
 
As described in our prospectus, the amount
 
of cash tax we pay in 2012 and 
thereafter will be significantly different from the tax provision we report on 
our P&L, due to the deductions we expect to get from vesting of RSUs and 
exercise of options. At today's stock price, we estimate we will have a 
tax 
deduction of around $13 billion that would reduce our cash taxes for several 
years.
 
Our net loss for Q2 was $157 million or $0.08 per share on a GAAP basis. 
Excluding stock comp, net income in Q2 was $295 million or $0.12 per share 
compared to $285 mil
lion or $0.12 per share in Q2 last year. We purchased 
$413 million of property and equipment in Q2 and acquired another $52 
million of equipment financed through capital leases. As noted in our 
prospectus for 2012, we expect to invest approximately $1.6 bi
llion to $1.8 
billion in capital expenditures, including equipment purchased through 
capital leases. And we ended Q2 with $10.2 billion in cash and investments 
on our balance sheet.
 
As we look to the second half of 2012, we're encouraged that the network o
f 
people using Facebook continues to grow and their engagement is strong. 
We remain focused on building out better and deeper social experiences for 
the people who use Facebook, while at the same time executing on the 
monetization strategies and initiative
s outlined today.
 
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to discuss our progress. We're 
committed to providing you with balanced and thorough disclosure, and we 
welcome your feedback today and in the future in terms of how we can 
make our communications m
ost helpful to you.

I guess, maybe 
for Sheryl. I was wondering with respect to the Facebook 
advertising exchange, based on some of the initial tests, could you just talk 
about how that may impact monetization as you roll that out? And then the 
second question is on the Yahoo! patent deal. J
ust beyond the IP, can you 
talk about or provide any details on the advertising partnership or the 
expanded distribution agreement part of it?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
Sure. Facebook Ad Exchange, our real

time being offered, which was 
advertisers getting real

ti
me on a specific ad impressions. The goal of this is 
to show people more relevant ads. This is something third parties have been 
doing across the Web for a while. For us right now, we're at very early alpha 
stage test and we don't have more information to 
share. But we're really 
encouraged by how interested our advertisers and customers are because 
this gives them an opportunity to connect to users, our users, that they're 
trying to reach to other things they do across the Web. On the Yahoo! deal, 
the Yahoo
! deal had 2 parts. The first part was a cross license of all the 
patents. And the second part was a partnership, where we worked with 
Yahoo! on tent

pole anchor events, such as the Olympics. We were really 
pleased to sign the Yahoo! deal because it really
 
extended the platform 
relationship we've had and really brought us back to what was a very good

2 questions for Mark. You talked about the engagement. Have you seen any 
trends in terms of the engagement with the younge
r cohorts, anything that 
indicates decline in engagement? And then broadly, how do you think about 
the size of the company? Facebook relative to other leaders in the 
technology space runs pretty thin. You've tried to have a pretty lean 
organization. As you
 
think about the 3 elements of the 3 broad growth areas 
for the company in the future, do you think you 
--
 
is there any change in 
your thinking about how big the company physically needs to be?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So just to take the first one first. I t
hink what we're seeing is pretty 
steady growth in engagement in all these cohorts, including the younger 
ones. So really, nothing out of line with the overall metrics there. On your 
second question about the overall size of the company, we've always been 
s
ignificantly smaller per employee compared to the number of people who 
we serve in the world. So it's really baked into the company that we have to 
build systems and software that take into account the leverage that 
employees here have. And that's actually
 
one of the reasons why a lot of 
people love working here and one of the biggest reasons why people cite for 
wanting to join the company and staying here. So it's also affected the 
strategy. I mentioned we believe that all these consumer products, and 
mayb
e even more than consumer products that people use, will become 
social over time. But we can't build all those things ourselves, so we focused 
on building this platform. Over time, it might make sense for us to build 
more of these things ourselves. But bec
ause of the scale that we're at, we 
really focus on the 3 things that I laid out today. This shift towards mobile is 
incredibly important. Building the highest quality applications and products is 
really critical. Building a platform so that the 1 million 
more developers who 
use Facebook can build these products. It's the highest leverage thing that 
we can do. And we think that social ads are just going to monetize much 
better than nonsocial ads as we increase the percent of our overall 
advertising that has
 
social context in it. So that's kind of where we are, and 
we're basically growing by trying to find as many talented engineers as we 
can for the most part. But I think for the foreseeable future, we're just going 
to be way smaller than other companies tha
t address significant or 
comparable size user bases.

One of the questions I'm curious on the mobile front is 
when you look at 
monetization, I think there's a lot of different views on how this will play out 
over the next couple of years. And I'm curious just philosophically, do you 
think that it is important to own the entire experience, i.e. integrated device, 
v
ersus being, if you will, purely an application? Or do you think it's, if you 
will, a federated view of kind of a platform feeding into many applications? 
How do you think about the different scenarios on that front and how that 
could potentially work for 
Facebook?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Well, Facebook is the most used app on basically every mobile platform, 
right? So when we think about what we want to do right now, we want to 
increase the depth of the experience in addition to just growing users. We 
thought a lo
t about this question of 
--
 
and I even talked about it in my 
opening remarks today, we want to not just have apps that people use but 
also be kind of deeply integrated into the systems as possible. We want to 
support a development ecosystem, where other ap
ps can build on top of 
Facebook. So that's why you'll see us do things like support Apple in the iOS 
integration that they wanted to do. There are a lot of things that you can 
build in other operating systems as well that aren't really taking 
--
 
that 
aren'
t really like building out a whole phone, which I think wouldn't really 
make much sense for us to do. So I think that there's a big opportunity for 
us here. The amount of time that people spend in the apps is greater. People 
come to the apps and use Facebo
ok more when they have mobile phones. 
And I think we're really much closer to the beginning here than the end in 
terms of what we can do. If you use the apps today, they're relatively basic 
compared to what I think anyone can imagine they would want from t
heir 
Facebook experience on a phone.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
I just wanted to ask 2 things. First, Sheryl, you provided some color on 
click
-
throu
gh rates on Sponsored Stories relative to the ads on the right
-
hand rail. I was hoping you could provide a little bit of color on what you're 
seeing in pricing here on a relative basis early on. And then David, perhaps if 
you could talk a little bit more a
bout the potential for margin expansion 
going forward, how you're thinking about that potentially into the back half 
of the year and '13.
 
David A. Ebersman
 
Sure. Doug, this is David. I'll start on the pricing, and then Sheryl can chime 
in. So we're very pl
eased by what we've seen in the early ramp
-
up of 
Sponsored Stories in feed in both desktop and mobile. But it's important to 
note that it's early, so we have a relatively limited amount of volume that 
we've put into the system at this point. I think the te
st over the second half 
of the year that we're excited to see happen is working with advertisers to 
increase demand for Sponsored Stories in feed creating better social content 
that we can put in feed without having a deleterious effect on the user 
experie
nce and seeing where that takes us in terms of clicks and prices and 
things along those nature. So while the early data is quite positive, it is at 
low volume, so we just have to be careful about extrapolating from it. In 
terms of margins, not a lot to add
 
to what I said earlier in the call. At this 
point in time, we are growing the business really focused on the 
opportunities that we seek to invest in and the importance that they could 
have and should have for the long
-
term business that we can build. And 
so 
we're more focused on making sure that we're positioned to capitalize on 
what we're trying to do in mobile and platform and social ads and not trying 
to optimize for a short
-
term margin target. In the long run, I think we have 
the kind of business that 
because we have such a large network and so 
much value comes from the content that it's created and distributed by the 
members of the network to have a business that works really efficiently.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
I'll just add one thing, which is while we're
 
not commenting on pricing 
specifically because it's early, it's really worth noting that higher click
-
through rates lead to higher CPMs over time even without pricing changes.

Your next question comes from the line of Herman Leung from SIG.
 
Herma
n Leung 
-
 
Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research

Wondering if we can talk about some of the penetration of some of the social 
ads that you guys have on the platform. Wondering the level of penetration 
of social ads that you have today on the 
site and the opportunity 
--
 
and I 
have a quick follow
-
up.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
So fewer than 1/2 of our ads are social, and it's an increase. We're very 
focused on increasing the percentage of our ads, which are social in nature. 
We know from a large number 
of studies in working with advertisers that the 
ads that are social have higher engagement rates from users, much higher 
ROI for advertisers. So driving that percentage up is also, is really important 
to us. It also feeds into the Sponsored Stories in News
 
Feed strategy that 
I've spent most of my remarks talking about, which is that we put things in 
News Feed that are most relevant. So the more social context the ads have 
and the more relevant they are to our users, the more we'll be able to drive 
up that p
ercentage of our ads that go into News Feed.
 
David A. Ebersman
 
And just to add, just to make sure that we're communicating this clearly, a 
very small percentage of our ads are Sponsored Stories in News Feed at this 
point. We just started with that product 
recently and we're being very 
careful in terms of the volume that we've put into News Feed because it's 
such a core part of the user experience.

Morgan S
tanley, Research Division
 
I had 2, please. Given the various testing that you always seem to be doing 
around products and monetization, you've talked a lot today about the 
success of Sponsored Stories. I was wondering if there are other areas that 
are look
ing promising to you based on recent testing. And then secondly, 
from our calculation, the DAU to MAU ratio declined moderately sequentially 
both in North America and Europe. I was wondering what you would 
attribute that to. Is it seasonality? And what are
 
you doing to drive 
engagement in those regions?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
I can take the first part. Yes, the Sponsored Stories have shown really, really 
good results. And we are also seeing good results from other ads on the site 
that have social context. So as
 
we rolled out more ways to make your ads 
social, we see increasing engagement, increasing ROI from those ads. FBX is 
early. But our initial testing showed very promising results for advertisers as 
they are able to connect what they're doing elsewhere acro
ss. It's also worth 
noting how optimistic we are around our early testing around mobile. Mobile 
for itself is an inherently social experience and for our service is inherently 
social. And what people are doing on their mobile devices is continuing their 
Ne
ws Feed and sharing. So really, the big accomplishment we've had in ads 
over the last quarter or 2 as we rolled Sponsored Stories into News Feed and 
on mobile, has been very promising for us because the results show that 
users engage with those ads and adv
ertisers get a high ROI from them.
 
David A. Ebersman
 
First, the DAU relative to MAU comparison. We remain really pleased with 
the percentage of our monthly users who come back every day. We have 
sort of assumed earlier on in our history that as we further penetrated the 
market of people in the world and got 
into late adopters that, that number 
would go down. And we've seen that just consistently go up, which I think 
speaks to the value of kind of the network effects, the more people that use 
Facebook, the more interesting it is. The number doesn't tend to mov
e 
dramatically from quarter
-
to
-
quarter. It's a slow
-
moving number. It did 
decline fractionally from Q1 to Q2 as you noted. I think that 2 things there. 
One is that we did make some changes to what we've described earlier as 
background pinging, or I think w
e called it automatic background activity in 
the prospectus, which is when phones contact our servers without there 
being a user active on the other end just to download information. We see 
that on several of the mobile services, it helps you to have more 
information 
from Facebook when you do check your phones. We try and understand 
what that looks like in terms of technically so that we don't count that as 
usage, and we sort of continually make some changes. That had some 
impact on the apples
-
to
-
apples nat
ure of the DAU comparison, June versus 
March. You asked about seasonality. I don't know that we have a great 
handle on the seasonality effects as it relates to by month. We tend to see 
things like holidays. There would be some drop in daily level as engage
ment, 
so it depends on what month, holidays and other things happen in.

One for Mark and one for David. Mark, w
ondering if you can give us an 
update on your acquisition of Instagram. I know it's early but would be 
curious to hear how the integration of that acquisition is helping your efforts 
on mobile and monetization, and if there are others out there, other 
acqu
isitions like Instagram out there that you see as potentially desirable. 
Are there other acquisitions like that one? And then David, just wondering 
on the outlook, most of the models have 2Q as the lowest quarter of the 
year in terms of your year
-
over
-
year
 
growth in revenue. Can you 
--
 
I guess, 
can you validate or confirm that? Is 2Q the lowest quarter of the year in 
terms of year
-
over
-
year growth?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So to the first one, the acquisition hasn't closed, right? So there's been 
no integratio
n or anything like that. And there will be an update when that 
happens. In terms of what else we might acquire, I mean, our strategy has 
primarily been to buy companies for talent. I mean, we have this very 
entrepreneurial culture, where we want the type o
f people inside the 
company to take risks and be the type of people who would want to build 
out whole companies on their own. So often the best way to find a lot of 
those people is to find people who are building companies, who maybe are 
working on a probl
em where they think that they'd have more leverage if 
they joined Facebook. So x of Instagram, most of the acquisitions that we've 
done fit that category, and that will continue to be the approach going 
forward.
 
David A. Ebersman
 
To your second question, I
 
mean, if you sort of start by looking backwards a 
little bit in terms of how revenue has grown to get us to where we are today, 
a couple of years ago, we had a couple of hundred million dollars in revenue, 
and obviously it's grown a lot. It's sort of a co
mbination of, I would say, 2 
things: a series of ongoing optimizations that we make every day in trying to 
make the business work better, increase advertiser demand, better ad 
formats, et cetera; and then on top of that, major changes that we make, 
like th
e introduction of payments, which really started impacting the 
business late last year, or fundamental changes to the product and how we 
advertise on it. And so when we look forward to the second half of this year, 
I think we'll continue to make the kinds 
of optimizations we're always 
making to try and drive more advertiser demand, better targeting of ads, et 
cetera. But the big priority and the big opportunity for us is what we're doing 
with Sponsored Stories in News Feed. And I think it's just difficult t
o forecast 
what that's going to look like because we're still early into it. We started 
putting Sponsored Stories in feed earlier this year but really didn't ramp that 
up substantially until really June of this year is when the numbers, we 
started putting 
more volume in. And thus far, we feel like we're in a really 
good position because as we've ramped up to where we are today, we see 
high levels of advertiser demand and good levels of user engagement. But 
the forecasting part is difficult because we're goi
ng to proceed slowly with 
this. We want to be sure. The biggest mistake I think we could make is to 
move too quickly and to find ourselves in a situation where we're having an 
impact on user engagement that we didn't anticipate or is hard for us to 
manage.
 
So I think as we continue to ramp up, we will learn from each 
change we make and see how quickly, or what kind of speed of ramp
-
up 
makes the most sense for us. But I think right now, trying to forecast that is 
difficult.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
 
Great. I just had a follow
-
up on that, David. In terms of how fast you 
--
 
how 
do you gauge how often to show Sponsored Stories? I mean, what 
type of 
feedback are you looking for from people to know that maybe you're 
showing them too many in News Feed or that you have the ability to maybe 
put the foot on the gas pedal a little bit more? I also wanted to know if these 
are rolled out globally at t
his point to everybody. And then I guess, the last 
question maybe for Mark would be 
--
 
or Sheryl, how do you see local fitting 
into the mobile experience? And where do you see advertisers in terms of 
leveraging what Facebook can offer there?
 
Sheryl K. Sand
berg
 
So for Sponsored Stories, in terms of rolling it out, what we're doing is we're 
looking at 2 things very carefully. We're looking at the social context to 
make sure it's really relevant. So the better stories we can generate, where 
people are interact
ing with things that are monetizable, the more Sponsored 
Stories we can roll out. We're also looking really clearly at user reaction. And 
the good news for us is that it's easy for us to measure user reaction 
because we can see if users are sharing, clicki
ng, liking, commenting, if 
they're engaging with those stories. And we can look at how much they're 
engaging with those stories relative to others. We've also been pretty 
careful, even when both of those metrics are high, at just limiting the 
number of Spo
nsored Stories as we roll out. We've been fairly cautious on 
only rolling out a certain amount. And we intend to be continually cautious 
as we really work on user demand, on the user perception. We have not 
rolled out Sponsored Stories in News Feed across 
all countries. There are 
certain countries that we're still working out finishes, so it's not entirely 
globally rolled out. And with apologies, I'm not sure I remember this 
--
 
local, 
yes, I knew there was a third part of the question. Yes, I mean, local is
 
huge. We've always talked about it. And I think I mentioned it in my 
remarks. Local is the Holy Grail of the Internet. Everyone is about to get 
people into local. And this is something, certainly, in my history of working 
on 
--
 
in this industry, I've spen
t a lot of time on. The problem is that local 
businesses are just not very tech
-
savvy. So if you look at local businesses in 
the United States, obviously one of the more developed markets, something 
like more than 40% of them have no Web presence at all. S
o they don't 
adopt things that are really, in our view, might be something that we would 
think they would obviously adopt. This is where I think Facebook has a huge 
competitive advantage because those same local business owners are using 
Facebook as users.
 
So while they won't adopt something for their product, 
they've set up their profiles or their timelines, and when they use the 
product, they start to see messages from other businesses. And then they 
start thinking, ""Wow, this could work for my business a
s well."" The product 
we want them to use, which is pages, is also incredibly similar to their 
timeline or profile. And so the leap the small business owner needs to make 
is just smaller here than we think it is with anyone else. And the numbers 
bear that o
ut. We have so many, as I mentioned before, 7 million small 
businesses that are using their pages on a monthly basis. Which is 
something we've done without any really targeted marketing effort to them 
at all, and then hundreds of thousands of those get up
-
sold into becoming 
advertisers. Our push, which I mentioned in my remarks, to make it easier 
for them to advertise, so the thing we rolled out last quarter, which is you 
can just pick a poster, do it on your page and make it super easy to 
advertise. I thin
k those things will make a business a really big difference in 
accelerating this even further.

Company.
 
Laura A. Martin 
-
 
Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
 
A couple for 
Mark. So Mark, we've been writing a lot about the optionality or 
the option value of the Facebook platform globally. And I guess, I'm really 
interested outside the visible revenue streams, which today are payments in 
advertising. Could you talk through how
 
you're thinking about commerce on 
this platform? And also video, because video is one of the most shared 
things, as you know. As we think about over the next 3 to 5 years other 
revenue streams, how do you think philosophically about what Facebook 
could be
come over a longer period of time in terms of revenue streams?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. Well, the basic approach that we have for now is we're building out 
this platform and other companies can build on top of that. And you can 
view our business as an adverti
sing and payments business or you could 
view it as there will be these companies that help to transform these 
industries, and we will get some portion of the value that comes from that, 
that we're helping to provide, right? So in gaming, for example, we th
ink 
that we're helping to provide a lot of the value, so we end up getting a 
relatively high percentage of the revenue that comes into those companies. 
Whereas in something like music or some of the media companies that are 
now getting built using Open Gra
ph, I think we aren't providing quite as 
much of the percentage of the value as with games, so the overall amount of 
the revenue that comes to Facebook through, whether whatever the 
breakdown of ads and payments is, I think, will be somewhat less. But a lo
t 
of people will do that stuff, too. So I think the real way to think about this is 
that over time, more and more nuanced experiences will become social. So 
gaming is such a basic thing that people want to do with their friends, so 
even with a relatively b
asic platform, people could build that ecosystem out. 
Some of the media stuff required more nuance. I think commerce will 
require a little more and so on. But as these things get built out, I think we'll 
build out the tools to both enable those products to
 
get built and to be able 
to capture some percentage of the value that we're helping to create. But I 
mean, I don't really have any more plans that I'm going to share with you 
today about our product roadmap or anything like that.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
One th
ing to think about in the commerce area or in other areas like video is 
that our view of the world is things become increasingly social. And that 
takes time. Gaming was obviously first. But people are informed when they 
purchase things by their friends, an
d the commerce companies that are 
really adopting social are seeing good responses. Fab is one of them. Fab is 
very early on in its history, but it's a truly social shopping experience. And 
they're seeing near 20% to 40% of their traffic from Facebook on a
 
daily 
basis, as well as a very good return on their investment on ads that their 
CEO has been talking about publicly. We look out at what people's shopping 
behaviors are. And so much of them really 
--
 
so much of their shopping 
behaviors really are social,
 
that we think there's a big opportunity for the 
social context that we offer to be a major part of how people discover

We hear from marketers a lot that the platform is relatively complicated still 
in terms of the ad products offered and services. How long 
--
 
or how quickly 
can marketers expect to see that simplified? And then also, in terms of the 
App Cente
r, can you give us any sense of the economics behind that 
arrangement? And is there a rev share? And if so, how does that compare to 
your standard 30% on your platform for payments? And then finally, if you 
could look back over the last few months in terms
 
of going public, is there 
anything that you would redo?
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
I'll take the first 2 and hand off the third. When you think about the 
advertising experience on Facebook, it is complicated today. And that's 
mainly because we're a completely new kind of marketing. We're not TV, 
we're not search, we are a third medium. A
nd that's presents a challenge 
because the messages that talk at consumers on other platforms need to 
really be adopted and changed to be more inclusive. The right ad on TV or 
on search is the wrong ad for Facebook. Facebook marketers need to learn 
how to 
make their ads really a two
-
way dialogue with consumers. We also 
have a measurement challenge. When you see an ad on Facebook, you don't 
go and click to a purchase right there, but you're more likely to search later 
on and buy a product or to walk into a s
tore and buy a product. So we have 
the challenge of teaching marketers how to develop social marketing, and 
then working with them so that we can tie the consumer experience of 
seeing a Facebook ad and interacting with that brand to a purchase that 
happens
 
later on. And that's why we're so focused on the market education. 
With our clients who have done a lot with us, I think they're learning a lot on 
those trajectories and seeing very positive returns. But it took a long time 
for the TV market and advertisi
ng to be truly understood. It took a long time 
for search. And I think we're still in that learning curve with a lot of our 
clients. The good news is that our results are so strong. The ROI results I 
talked about in my remarks, where we've now done 60 camp
aigns, if you 
talk to CMOs, those ROI results of getting to 3x their ad spend or 5x their ad 
spend or better are truly good, compared very favorably with anything else 
marketers do. And so our view is that if our ads work and we continue to 
make our ads wo
rk and they work for advertisers and our users, we'll be 
able to educate the market over time, how quickly that will happen will 
depend. But we feel like we're on a good part of that growth trajectory. In 
terms of the App Center, the goal behind the App Ce
nter is that we believe 
social discovery will lead to app installs. You are more likely to want to use 
an app your friends are using than you are one that you know the generic 
population represents. Right now, we are not offering paid apps, so the 
revenue 
share issue you're talking about is not something we have a product 
to deal with right now.
 
David A. Ebersman
 
And Ken, you asked about lessons learned looking backwards. Obviously, 
we're disappointed about how the stock has traded, but I think the 
importan
t thing for us is to stay focused on the fact that we're the same 
company now as we were before. We've got the same opportunity in front of 
us to build something really important and valuable over time. And if we 
stay focused on building great products, we
 
expect and we want to be 
judged based on the quality of the experiences as we build and the value we 
can create over the long term.

I had some phone problems, so I apologize if you got these already. But one 
question for Mark and one for David. David, when you're thinking about 
visibility into the back half of the year and how quickly ad revenue is 
ramping, how does that look 
versus sort of expectations that were earlier in 
the quarter pre
-
IPO? And then a similar question on the OpEx growth. Do 
you have more visibility, less visibility? How do things look now versus 
where they were just before the IPO? And then Mark, on the top
 
of the sort 
of information in the News Feed that the user did not specifically ask for, 
trending stories or trending video and certainly Sponsored Stories, beyond 
click
-
through rate, how do you think about measuring and understanding 
that user experience 
so you know not to sort of go over the edge and 
degrade the user experience?
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
Sure. So I mean, in terms of the methodology for building News Feed 
--
 
and 
at any given point, we have a lot of different tests, different algorithms 
running, and 
we measure engagement of everything downstream from News 
Feed and the whole system, right? So obviously, clicks and engagement and 
feedback in News Feed, how many people want to share, but also how many 
page views and how much time people spend on Facebook
 
overall, ad 
performance, everything, down to all of the different tweaks that we do in 
News Feed, and user sentiment as well. So I think we have pretty robust 
systems that are built out around this. And one of the things that I think is 
pretty interesting
 
is what we've seen is that we can put in good sponsored 
content and have it not degrade those metrics. So that's really what we're 
trying to do, is we're rolling some of these Sponsored Stories out more 
conservatively because we want to make sure that the
 
quality is very high. 
And we're basically continuing to run those tests to make sure that we are 
producing the best product that we can.
 
David A. Ebersman
 
So Ben, thanks for your question on the looking forward part. I think the 2 
things you asked are pre
tty different, at least from my standpoint. Trying to 
project operating expenses is, while not easy or precise, we have a fair 
amount of understanding of how things are trending and what we expect to 
spend in the second half of the year. So that's why we p
rovided a little bit 
more specifics in my opening remarks or my prepared remarks about what 
we expect in terms of operating expense growth. I think revenue growth is 
just harder to predict, and it's particularly hard to predict when you're really 
focusing 
on a new product that you're in the early stages of launching, as we 
are with Sponsored Stories in News Feed. So as I said, we're pleased with 
where we are, where we were at the end of June, where we are now. And 
that's going to make, we hope, a sizable im
pact on what kinds of 
performance we can deliver, not just in the second half of the year but over 
a longer
-
term horizon because we think this can be, fundamentally, a really 
important marketing product.

My question was on the Preferred Marketing Developer Program, where I 
think you're up to around 330 formal partners today, with a great many of 
them qualified for apps. But around
 
50 or so, and I think around 20 
--
 
50 for 
ads, 20 for insights, and I just wanted to see what your expectations are to 
see those numbers, both the total number of PMD developers growing and in 
those 2 categories, in particular.
 
Sheryl K. Sandberg
 
I think 
we're very optimistic about our platform partners. Our goal is to take 
everything people do, or at least close to everything people do, and make it 
social. And what we do is provide technology for our platform partners to do 
that. How many people go into s
pecific programs is not the thing we most 
focus on. We focus a lot on how many developers out there are using our 
tools, how many of the apps that are growing quickly, how many of the 
services people are growing quickly are using tools like Open Graph, as 
well 
as ads, so that we can build an ecosystem. Mark said in his remarks that we 
really believe that we are going to provide the identity and the social layer 
for everything that happens across Web, across mobile. Given the size of our 
graph, this engageme
nt people have with us, which even as we grow, is not 
just staying flat but in many ways increasing. We're very optimistic that if 
you were choosing to develop a service, you would choose to do it with us. 
We really consider ourselves a partnership company
. And that means that 
we want to take social companies and make them big, and big companies 
and make them social, because we think bringing what Facebook provides, 
which is your friends, makes every service better.

Thanks everyone for joining us. 2012 was a big year for us. We mad
e this 
big transition where now there are more people using Facebook on mobile 
everyday than on desktop. This was challenging for us to navigate since we 

no ads in our apps at al

foundation and a lot of momentum. Just last week, comScore put out a 
report saying that Facebook is now 23% of all time spent on apps in the U.S, 
and one of the next biggest apps is Instagram at 3%. So,
 
put together, 


three main parts of our strategy; build the best mobile products, build the 
platform and servic
es that leverage the social graph, and build a really 
strong monetization effort engine.
 
 
I am going to use our time today in the same way I will on most of these 


 
start with mobile. I think more people are starting to 
understand that mobile is a great opportunity for us. Mobile is the perfect 
device for Facebook for three reasons. It allows us to reach more people. We 
have more engagements from the people who we re

also be able to make more money for each minute people spend with us on 

Facebook. Mobile enables many new experiences, and its growing overall 
sharing across a
ll apps. This creates a very dynamic ecosystem, and one 

Facebook. Often doing a good job is just about focusing on basic issues like 
performance and stability.
 
 
In December, we released
 
a completely rewritten version of Facebook for 
Android. This is the Android version of the iOS rewrite we did earlier last 
year. Neither of these rewrites added big new features, but simply by 

xperience 
enabling people to share even more. It's a good example of how early we 
are in the market that these changes make such a big difference. Photos and 

day with more than 600
 
million photos uploaded to Facebook. Instagram has 

milestones to share with you all soon.
 
 
A lot of what we had to do last year was simply to improve our mobile 

re there. We move fast and ship new versions 
of our apps on a regular monthly cycle. You have a good version of all the 
Facebook features you know and want on your phone. So, now the next 

rst 

well, we should be able to bring even more relevant content and connections 
to more people and continue to deepen their engagement.
 
 
Next, I want to talk about platform and bui
lding new services using the 

the ecosystem outside of our company, but this quarter, I think we built the 
most interesting new service using the social graph, Graph Search. This
 
is an 
early beta product, but we're really excited about it because it's an entirely 
new kind of search. It's not Web search, its structured search over the whole 
graph of content that people have mapped out on Facebook. It's good for 
lots of things that 
you just won't use the traditional search engine for it. 
Seeing where your friends have eaten or traveled to, browsing photos and 
content your friends posted, finding new people to meet or recruit for a job, 
and many other things.
 
 
So many of these are big
 
areas where we think that there is room for much 
better products. Down the line if we do this well, this could potentially turn 
into a meaningful business for us. For now, we're going to continue working 
to refine the product and roll it out to everyone. 
Still, I think the way that 
Graph Search is different from normal web search is a good example of how 
there is going to be this market for a whole new crop of social services in 
existing markets today that were designed with the principles of real identity
 
and social connections, et cetera.
 
 
One platform development that I am really excited by is seeing how well our 
App install advertising product is doing. Developers are finding that 
Facebook is a great service for connecting with the right people who want
 
to 
use their apps and getting a lot of installs. On mobile, our platform already 
enables developers to help you bring your friend to a developer's app. We 
also want to be one of the primary ways that developers get new people to 
their apps in the first pl
ace, and with App install ads, we're off to a good 
early start in achieving that.
 
 
Now I want to talk a bit about monetization. Last year was a big year for us 
here. We started off the year with no ads at all on mobile and we ended up 
with approximately 23
% of our ads revenue coming from mobile in the 
fourth quarter. That's a pretty amazing change. One of the big drivers of this 
has been that as we rolled out our ads to News Feed, we found that it barely 
affected the level of engagement on Facebook. We thou
ght that we can 
make this work over time without a big impact if we spent a long time tuning 
the ad, but the numbers turned out even better than we thought without 
much tuning. So, this has enabled us to show people a few ads in News Feed 
each day. So that
 
means that now we have this News Feed ads business that 
we barely tuned and there's a big opportunity in front of us to make every 
ad that we're showing a lot better.
 
 
The biggest ways we're going to do this are by improving targeting and 
relevance, so we
 
can show everyone content that they care more about and 
by designing better ad products that aren't just about links and text and 
images. For targeting, I'm most excited about the work that we're doing on 
Custom Audiences, our tool that lets advertisers u
pload their customer list 
and target against that and information is already on Facebook at the same 
time. Say, my customers are in some age range and live in some state, you 
may not know which states your customer is living, but if they've shared it 
on Fa
cebook, then it's possible to create these kinds of experiences.
 
 
For new ad experiences, I'm looking forward to doing more with different 
kinds of media. As our News Feed design evolves to show richer kinds of 
stories that open up new opportunities to off
er different kinds of ads as well. 
Aside from ads, I do want to temper near
-
term expectations a little bit on 
revenue lines coming from other areas, like Gifts or Graph Search. I think 
these can be big opportunities for us long
-
term, but for the foreseeabl
e 
future, the most important thing for us is to continue building out great 
consumer experiences around these products. We're going to invest in 
these, but for the next year at least, our work around ads will have by far 
the biggest impact on our business.
 
 
Now, before I hand it off to Sheryl, there's one more thing I want to discuss. 
We're at an interesting point in our evolution where there are lots of areas 
where we need to invest in. We need to build the best mobile experiences, 
we need to build our pla
tforms, and we need to build a really strong 
monetization engine. We can easily invest our entire engineering team just 
in building out the nuts and bolts of these areas today.
 
 
But we also feel like there is an imperative to start planting seeds for 
tomor
row's businesses as well. Products like Graph Search that are in beta 
today, but will hopefully grow up to be pillars of the Facebook service and 
businesses, are things that we want to invest in aggressively and things we 
feel like it's the right thing for
 
our business over the longer term to invest in 
aggressively.
 
 
Based on this, we made the decision to continue to grow our headcount 
quickly in 2013, particularly in product development. This will likely cause 
our expenses to grow at a faster rate than we 
expect to grow our revenue 
this year. This means that we aren't operating to maximize our profits this 
year. We're doing what we think will build the best service and business over 
the long term.
 
 
Finally, I just want to take a minute to thank everyone who
 
works at 
Facebook. Last year really was an amazing year for us on many levels. We 
connected 1 billion people, we navigated the transition to becoming a mobile 
company, and we've laid the foundation for some great new products I'm 
excited to show the world
 
this year. And this is all because we have this 
unique culture filled with some of the most talented people in the world who 
are still mission
-
driven, who want to make the world a better place and who 
work so hard to make the world that place.
 
 
Thank you 
all. And thanks to everyone who's on this call for taking the time 
to be with us today. I look forward to being able to report on all the progress 
we'll make next quarter.
 
 

 
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
 
Thanks, Mark. S
o our ad business continued its positive trajectory in the 
fourth quarter. Total fourth quarter revenue was $1.585 billion with $1.329 
billion coming from ads. This represents a 41% increase for advertising 
revenue. Ad revenue from News Feed increased acro
ss both desktop and 
mobile, and in Q4, approximately 23% of our ad revenue came from mobile, 
up from approximately 14% in Q3. Our focus in the fourth quarter was to 
continue improving and scaling the products we launched in 2012. We know 
that our advertisi
ng products are delivering results for marketers and one of 
the best indicators of this came over the holiday season where more 
businesses, from big brands to small retailers used us as a core part of their 
holiday outreach.
 
 
Perhaps the biggest highlight 
in the fourth quarter was the increasing 
importance of mobile, not just to Facebook, but also to our clients. 
Marketers are realizing more and more that Facebook is one of the best 
places to reach their customers on mobile because of our unique ability to 
reach specific target audiences at scale.
 
 
Another highlight, is the traction, our Offers and Promoted Posts products, 
which are really easy to use, have given us at local businesses. As I 
described last quarter, our strategy is focused on three priorities
. One, 
building products and tools that create value for every type of marketer. 
Two, proving that value to marketers; and three, taking advantage of the 
unique opportunity we have in mobile.
 
 
Starting with the first, we build products that create value fo
r every type of 
marketer. We continue our focus on four key customer segments; brand 
marketers, direct marketers, local businesses, and developers. For brand 
marketers, we combine access to the largest community of real people in the 
world with some of the
 

with every one of the Ad Age Global 100 Advertisers. And overall revenue 
from these clients is growing through consistently with our ad revenue in 
2012, which means that significantly outpaced the estima
tes for overall ad 
spend from the industry.
 
 
In the fourth quarter, we launched a new way for advertisers to buy 
guaranteed ad impressions with the goal of helping them reach massive 
audiences on mobile. Wal
-
Mart used this target block over the important 
T
hanksgiving weekend to deliver 50 million mobile ads to their existing and 
potential customers. We think this is a very important fact in the evolution of 
mobile advertising as these numbers rivaled a scale of broader web and TV 
campaigns.
 
 
Increasingly co
mpanies use Facebook as the exclusive channel to launch 
new products. To share one example, Michael Kors has used Facebook to 
launch a line of new sneakers. Many of the sneakers sold out online and in 
new stores, and they achieved a 60 point increase in aw
areness of the new 
sneakers among the 36 million people that the campaign reached on 

target audience who are now aware of the new line of shoes.
 
 
For direct marketers, the products we
 
launched in the third quarter 
continued to bring traction in Q4 as well. Since we launched our Offers 
product at the end of September, we've seen stronger advertiser adoption 
and user engagement with nearly 42 million unique users claiming an offer. 
Cost 
per redemption compared favorably to those from email, newspaper, 
paid search, and display media based on data from the Direct Marketing 
Association. Discounts and promotions are often important tactics for direct 
marketers and we think our Offers product 
is well placed to compete for 
these media budgets.
 
 

Audiences, which lets the marketers show their ads to exactly the right 
people by coupling our rich targeting capabilities with their ow
n customer 
data or data from a third party. A large retailer for example, can send one 
set of ads to customers who typically buy foreign goods and a different set 
of ads to those who would purchase beauty products. This results in some of 
the best targetin
g available on or offline today.
 
 
To share one example, JackThreads, an online shopping site for men used 
Custom Audiences to target specific segments on its customer database and 
target them with ads for products that the company knew were most 
relevant t
o them such as sneakers. As a result, the company achieved a 
30% lower cost for acquisition than other platforms and saw a six times 
return on advertising spend.
 
 
It's important to understand that Custom Audiences is not a separate 
standalone ad product, b
ut rather a targeting capability that can be used 
with many of our ad products to drive greater accuracy and efficiency. For 
example, when Custom Audiences is used with offers, marketers can 
customize discounts for exactly the right kind of customers.
 
 
The
 
Facebook Exchange or FBX allows businesses to bid on specific ad 
impressions in real time and it continues to gain momentum and drive solid 
results for advertisers. Despite only becoming available to all marketers in 
September, by December FBX served near
ly 1 billion impressions daily and 
supported over 1,300 advertisers each day. Large and small advertisers alike 
are seeing higher click
-
through rates, lower cost per conversion, and strong 
incremental reaches in FBX.
 
 
Revenue from local businesses was part
icularly strong in the fourth quarter. 
We're pleased with the number of local business pages that advertise on 
Facebook nearly doubled since the beginning of 2012. This is due in no small 
part to our Promoted Posts product, which makes it easier for busine
sses to 
create and purchase ads directly from their Facebook page. Almost 500,000 
pages have used Promoted Posts, about 30% of these are new advertisers to 
Facebook, and more than 70% have become repeat customers.
 
 
Finally for developers, we continue to ga
in traction with our new mobile app 
install ads, since their launch in October, they are already being used by 
20% of the top 100 grossing iOS apps to accelerate growth. According to 
research conducted by comScore in December, Facebook is the top driver of
 
awareness of new mobile app downloads; and among people who learn 
about new apps on Facebook, 48% clicked directly from the Facebook apps 
to download new mobile apps.
 
 
Cie Games uses products to drive installs of its new game Car Town Streets. 
As a result
, they've broken to the top 10 games list on iOS in many 
countries while achieving a 40% lower cost per installation compared to their 
other advertising. In addition to gaming, we believe this will be a very useful 
product to help companies and industries 
like retail, travel, and financial 
services shift their businesses to mobile.
 
 
Next, I'll also step on our commitment to provide proving value 
--
 
proving 
Facebook's value to marketers. We design all of our products to deliver a 
strong return on investment.
 
Given that we are still a relatively new 
marketing platform, proving that our ads are effective remains an important 
and ongoing priority for us. We work with research companies like Nielsen, 
Aggregate Knowledge, and Datalogix to demonstrate how our ads d
rive sales 
and help inform our product development.
 
 
For example, research from Aggregate Knowledge showed that Facebook is 
an increasingly powerful tool to help marketers reach more people and drive 
sales. In the study of fourth quarter marketing campaign
s, they found that 
media plans that included Facebook reached people who would not have 
seen the campaigns otherwise. In fact, 45% of those reached were reached 
exclusively through Facebook. The study also found that Facebook had a 
68% lower cost per acqui
sition and drove 24% more new sales than other 
online channels. We also work with clients directly to integrate with their 
own measurement systems so they can better understand the ROI Facebook 
delivers.
 
 
For example, we built a deep relationship with Peps
iCo where we worked 
with its Lay's brand to drive significant sales ahead of plans and a 5x return 
on ad spend for their Do Us a Flavor campaign on Facebook. In the fourth 
quarter, we also made conversion tracking available in beta. Conversion 
tracking all
ows marketers of all sizes to more easily measure the impact of 
their Facebook advertising, whether the Facebook ad is the first ad or the 
last ad the person sees before taking an action.
 
 
Finally, I want to discuss how we're continuing to take advantage o
f the 
significant opportunity we have in mobile. As mentioned before, 
approximately 23% of our advertising revenue now comes from mobile. In 
addition, 65% of our advertisers are now using ads in News Feed which run 
on both desktop and mobile up from 50% at
 
the end of the third quarter. 
Marketers are recognizing that our News Feed is the most efficient and 
effective place to reach their customers due in large part to the fact that ads 
in News Feed see a higher click
-
through rate and ultimately a lower cost p
er 
conversion and ads on the right
-
hand side of our site.
 
 
By working with Datalogix, we have shown that as the News Feed also drives 
more than 8 times the incremental offline sales in ads on the right
-
hand 
side. Clients also recognize that because our use
rs share their real identities 
on Facebook and because they are logged in when they use Facebook on 
mobile, we have a unique ability to start advertising that people find 
relevant. This is an important competitive advantage for us relative to other 
mobile 
platforms and one we think we are very unique in.
 
 
Overall, we continue to make real progress advancing our advertising 
strategy. Our revenue and key metrics are growing nicely, and as we look 
ahead to 2013, we're very confident in the direction of our ad 
business.
 
 
Over 1 billion people are on Facebook, and we are enabling businesses to 
engage with them directly wherever they are. Our massive scale, accurate 
targeting, strength in mobile, and new advertising products are driving 
measurable results for all 
types of businesses and transforming the way 
people and businesses connect. We look forward to making even more 
progress in these areas in the year ahead.
 
 
Now, I'll hand it over to David.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We'r
e pleased with the 
progress we made in Q4 against our key financial priorities, growing 
revenue, investing aggressively in areas critical to our future performance, 
and positioning the company to maximize long
-
term financial returns.
 
 
We ended the year wit
h 1.06 billion people using Facebook, up 25% from a 
year
-
ago. In December, 618 million people accessed Facebook each day on 
average, up 28% from last year. and we grew monthly and daily users 
across all geographic regions. Mobile continues to drive our gro
wth. 680 
million people accessed Facebook from mobile devices in December, up 57% 
versus last year. And the numbers I just mentioned do not include 
Instagram, which continues to grow at an impressive rate. We ended 2012 
with strong engagement across our pr
oducts. and this engagement remains 

 
 
Turning to revenue, in Q4, revenue was up 40% year
-
over
-
year or 42% 
when adjusted for constant exchange rates. Q4 year
-
over
-
year growth 
would have been 34% if adjusted 
to exclude the additional month of 
payments transactions we recognized as planned. Ad revenue in Q4 was up 
41% or 43% when adjusted for constant exchange rates. Year
-
over
-
year 
advertising growth in Q4 was the strongest of any quarter in 2012, and we 
view t
his as a validation of our recent investments in mobile News Feed ads, 
growing our advertiser base, and launching new ad products.
 
 
In the fourth quarter, ad impressions were up 46%, and average price per 
ad was down 4% compared to last year. These trends 
were driven by 
significantly faster impression growth in developing markets such as Asia 
and Latin America, which have relatively lower pricing, and thereby brought 
down our average price overall. The faster impression growth in developing 
markets in Q4 wa
s significantly affected by product changes, primarily our 
decision to lower the market reserve price or the floor price we accept in our 
auction, which increased the number of ads shown in these markets.
 
 
We continue to see positive trends in price per ad
 
in key developed markets, 
including an 18% increase in average price in the U.S. and Canada in Q4. 
Payments and other revenue was $256 million in Q4. As planned, in Q4 we 
recognized revenue from four months of payments transactions for 
accounting reasons 
detailed in our last 10
-
Q. Adjusting for the extra month, 

of 2011.
 
 
This past quarter, payments and other revenue also included around $5 
million from sources outside of games, prim
arily user promoted posts and to 
a lesser extent from our new Gifts product.
 
 
Shifting now to expenses, in Q4, our total GAAP expenses were $1.06 billion. 
Excluding the impact of stock compensation, total expenses increased 67% 
to $849 million driven prima
rily by headcount and infrastructure. We ended 
2012 with just over 4,600 employees, a 44% increase from last year driven 
by hiring in our technical groups. We were recently ranked the number one 
place to work by Glassdoor, which we view as a testament to h
ow strong our 
culture remains through this period of significant headcount growth.
 
 
In Q4, our GAAP operating income was $523 million. Excluding stock comp, 
our non
-
GAAP operating income was $736 million representing a 46% 
operating margin. Our GAAP tax ra
te for Q4 was 87% and our non
-
GAAP tax 
rate was 41%. For 2013, we expect our non
-
GAAP tax rate to be a few 
percentage points higher than the rate in Q4. Additionally, we ended the 
year with approximately $5.8 billion in NOL tax loss carry forwards created 
by stock compensation.
 
 
GAAP net income and EPS for the fourth quarter was $64 million or $0.03 
per share. Non
-
GAAP net income and EPS was $426 million or $0.17 per 
share compared to $0.15 in Q4 last year. We ended Q4 with $9.6 billion in 
cash and investme
nts giving us great flexibility and risk protection.
 
 
Looking forward now, we believe we've built a solid foundation for continued 
growth in 2013 and beyond. In our ads business, we believe we have good 
momentum and plan to continue investing to grow adver
tiser demand and 
improve the quality, engagement, and value of our ads, particularly in News 
Feed.
 
 
In terms of 2013 expectations for payments, our games ecosystem 
continues to show healthy signs of diversification with new kinds of games 
growing engagemen
t and monetization in Q4. However, we continue to face 
an offsetting headwind from declining desktop usage in developed markets 
since our games payments revenue is essentially all from desktop 
computers.
 
 
In terms of non
-
games payments revenue, while we re
main excited about 
the long
-
term potential of commerce on Facebook, current revenue from 
user Promoted Posts and Gifts is very small, and we expect 2013 
contributions from these initiatives to remain very small given current run 
rates.
 
 
In terms of infrast
ructure, we expect CapEx spend in 2013 will be in the 
neighborhood of $1.8 billion, as we continue to invest in servers, new data 
centers, and network infrastructure to enable us to bring Facebook speedily 
and reliably to everyone around the world.
 
 
We're 
pleased that planned 2013 CapEx spend is up relatively modestly 
compared to 2012 which came in under forecast at a shade under $1.6 
billion as our investments in software and hardware efficiency are paying off 
nicely.
 
 
As Mark noted, 2013 will be a year of
 
significant investment in areas we 
believe are critical to drive long
-
term engagement and monetization, and we 
plan to continue to hire aggressively to accelerate product development and 
deliver new products for users and advertisers.
 
 
As a result of our 
hiring and investment plans, we expect that our total 
expenses, excluding stock comp, will likely grow by somewhere around 50% 
in 2013, though actual growth will depend on hiring and project decisions we 
make through the year.
 
 
We believe this level of nea
r
-
term investment is the right strategic decision 
to enable long
-
term value creation. We're excited about the potential returns 
from investing in our product. We continue to feel there's operating leverage 
inherent in our business, and we're committed to b
uilding a highly profitable 
cash generating business over the long term.
 
 
In summary, we believe we're entering 2013 in a strong position. We're 
working in very large markets that offer us great opportunities for growth. 
We have uniquely valuable assets in
 
terms of the size, identity, and 
engagement of the people who use Facebook and we have a fantastic group 
of employees who have big aspirations to build on our financial performance 
from 2012.
 
 
Now let's open the call for questions.
 
 
Question

Answer Se
ssion
 
Operator
 
 
(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Douglas 
Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
 
 
Douglas Anmuth

Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two things. First, 
can you help us 
understand the mobile trajectory through 4Q just given the 
commentary you gave about exiting 3Q at $270 million run rate and doing a 
little bit more than $300 million in the fourth quarter, did you open up more 
additional inventory in 4Q from the late 3Q l
evels, and did you see any 
notable change in pricing? And then, can you also just comment on how you 
feel about the volume of ad load in the News Feed right now on both desktop 
and mobile, and perhaps in terms of baseball innings, where you think you 
are i
n terms of penetration? Thanks.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
So I'll take the first half. So, I think the most important thing is that we 
think mobile can be a huge opportunity for us, and we're really pleased with 
the progress we made in the fourth quarter. If you co
mpare the averages, 
Q3 versus Q4 on mobile revenues 

 
if you compare the overall revenue, our 
mobile revenue doubled from Q3 to Q4, and we continue to make progress 
also in terms of the quality and the relevance of the mobile ads that we 
show. I think the 
most important thing here is that we're still really early. A 
couple of quarters ago, mobile revenues were 0% of our ads revenue and 
now we're up to 23% and believe that there's a lot more we can do and a lot 
of growth ahead of us.
 
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
 
I'll s
peak to the quality piece. So, one of the things that we measure for 
News Feed quality is the amount of feedback that we get, so likes and 
comments and things like that. And just to give a sense of the magnitude of 
these things, the ranking improvements an
d things that we did over the 
course of last year improved the amount of feedback in News Feed on the 
order of about 50%, right. So I think 

 
I don't know if it was quite exactly 
50%, but it was on that order. We measure very closely when we take into 
acco
unt advertising and spend in order to rank ads into News Feed, we're 
inherently not showing what would have organically showed up in that slots, 
so we want to make sure that we're not decreasing quality by a big amount.
 
 
So what we found was that when we d
id the test to take out the ads, we 
were inserting the ads, had about 2% reduction in the amount of likes and 
comments. So, over the period of last year, we had on the order of 50% 
increase and then a very marginal offset of 2% for putting ads in, which ju
st 
makes us feel really confident that we're continuing to very strongly net 
improve the experience of Feed and that's one of the things that I 
mentioned in my script report. I wasn't 

 
and we weren't that 

 
we're 
confident we could get this to a good plac
e over time in terms of being a 
good experience. But the amount of the improvements that we've done have 
just dwarfed the quantitative feedback hit that we 



 
to 
do going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. 
Your line is now open.

Mark, in the comments you said, you were looking at different types of 
media for ads. I was wo
ndering at a high level if you could talk about how 
that would potentially change the overall Facebook experience? And if you 
could give some real examples for how these different types of ad units 
would come into play? And then also just separately engage
ment, I was 

engagement or any change to how you measure it and any views on how 
that going through the quarter? Thanks.
 
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
 
Sure. So, one of the product design principles that we

want the organic content to be of the same basic type of formats as paid 
content, right. So historically, advertisers want really rich things like big 

of th

News Feed product that consumers use are , moving towards bigger 
pictures, richer media, and I think you will continue to see it go in that 
direction. And then, I think a lot of the suc
cess of products like Instagram is 

 

photo product, and when you have those form factors for the content that 
gives you the ability to offer those form factors for advertising as w
ell. So I 

naturally going to make it, so we can deliver much more engaging 
advertising experiences than we were traditionally able to do and when we 

nt in the system. David can speak to some 

 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
So in terms of engagement overall, everything continues to go very well. We 
passed 1 billion users, and in the fourth quarter 59% of them used Facebook 
on an 
average day in December, which is up a couple of percent from where 
we started the year. So just pretty remarkable how 
--
 
as we continue to 
grow the user base, that number continues to grow up, it really speaks to 
the value of the service and the importanc
e of mobile, which is really driving 
that.
 
 
There is another metric we track, which measures the number of people who 
have come to the site in at least six of the last seven days. So, it shows sort 
of the audience for whom Facebook is a daily experience an
d that we ended 
the year with record highs on that metric as well. So, everything continues 
to go well, and our job is to make Facebook a better, more useful product, 
so we can continue to drive new kinds of engagement in the future.

Great, thank you. I had a question for Sheryl, and then a question for Mark. 
Sheryl, I was wondering i


business in 2013? And then Mark, just kind of wondering kind of where you 
think we are in terms of the social ad revolution, and
 
when you look out over 
the next 12 months; what do you think could surprise you the most in terms 
of the revenue opportunities that are ahead of you when you look out for 
2013? Thanks.
 
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
 
So, on FBX as everyone knows, it's real
-
time bidding
 
for specific instructions. 

and ad performance, and the numbers as I said in my opening remarks are 
getting higher. We see good data from our clients and customers that it's 
driving more
 
conversions. We have data from one of our customer, one of 
our clients Triggit that FBX drives 36% more conversions than re
-
targeting 
anywhere else. Shutterfly had a 4x higher return on ad spend than other 
platforms, and we have a bunch of other examples 
like that.
 
 
I would say the importance of FBX is not just the product itself, but really 
what it represents and the other opportunities around making the ads more 
targeted. So FBX is one way of making the ads better targeted and then 
more useful to users, 
which makes some higher return from advertisers. 

really big push to make our ads higher quality, better for users, higher 

e working on 
doing that.
 
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
 


to necessarily show everyone an ad every day, because
 

we had the quality upfront and that was some of the engagement metrics 


engagement hit at 

now 

 
previously we thought we were going to have to spend 6 to 12 
months just tuning in order to be able to get into a quality level and then 

lled out, and now 
we can go straight into doing the same types of things to improve targeting 

deployed has much more leverage to those changes than if we had to kind of 
wait until
 
we hit different quality thresholds to roll it out more. So, I think 

--
 
it's not that it's going to go in a 
completely different direction, I think it's mostly the two things that we've 
talked about so far, good targe
ting and good ad formats, and I think there's 
just a lot of room to grow in both.

Thank you. I have two 
questions. Can you help us understand why ad ARPU 
in the U.S. grew 27%while it grew only 7% in Europe? Is spend on Facebook 
that sensitive to macro? And on the platform, can you help me understand 
what metric you track to evaluate the progress and adoption
 
of the Facebook 
platform outside Facebook.com? Is that the number of pages or objects 
tagged with Open Graph? And are you in a race with Google's Knowledge 
Graph to be the basis of the semantic web or can both co
-
exist? Thank you.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
Yes, Ca
rlos, I'll take the first one. So I think that when you compare the 
disclosure we make about the U.S. and Canada to Europe, one of the 
notable differences is in Europe as we continue to penetrate that market, 
we're getting into some of the lower monetizing
 
countries in Europe, so 
there's sort of an inter
-
Europe lower price dynamic going on with the ads. 
The places that are growing more rapidly are starting at a lower price point 
and bringing down the average either on a CPM basis or on an ARPU basis. 
So I d
o think there are macro things that matter in Europe as well, but I 
think that's the bigger point.
 
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
 
Yes. In terms of the point on structured data, there's Open Graph in order to 
help developers and people map out all the different connecti
ons between 
things outside the Facebook, but I mean, one of the things that we talked 
about when we rolled our Graph Search is there are more than 1 trillion 
connections between people and things in Facebook today. I mean that's the 
basis for Graph Search.
 
I think a lot of the 

 
the goal of having a utility like 
Graph Search is also to give people a reason to map out more of these 
structured connections themselves.
 
 
And you mentioned the Google comparison, I think we're just coming from a 
completely differe
nt place. Our whole product is people in structured 
connections to other people and content and things that they like, whereas 
traditional Web search is the exact opposite. It's completely unstructured. So 
I think Google and others may be trying to put in 
some of the structured 
foundations, but we just have years of having built that up, and I think that 
we're just in a completely different place on that.

Yes, thank you very much. Two questions please. First, starting with David, 
first thank you for helping quantify the increase in operating expenses next 
year. I was wondering if, maybe, you can help us with 
kind of the trajectory 
of that spend throughout the year? How long do you think this investment 
cycle is going to be? Is it mostly in 2013 or is this a multiyear cycle? Then 
maybe Mark, maybe 
--
 
can you talk just about the video opportunity for 
Facebook, v
ideo on the News Feed, so where are you in that process? Would 
that be something that organically you guys can do or would that require 
you guys to maybe acquire? Thanks.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
So Youssef, we think we've got some really big and important opportu
nities 
right in front of us now and that's driving our decision making around the 
level of investment we're making which is important to us in 2013. That will 
moderate over time, but I wouldn't want to make a firm commitment to 
exactly what it's going to l
ook like in the future because particularly the R&D 
part of its going to depend on what the opportunities are and how excited 
we are about the returns we can get from them.

Opportunity for video, not just ads 
--
.
 
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
 
I think
 
I touched on some of this earlier in terms of making it that News 
Feed is richer, just enables more opportunity for this. There already are the 
ability for pages to post videos and different content into the systems. We 
actually have a very large volume o
f this. Another thing that we have the 
ability to support is people posting links on other services, right. So, for 
video advertising, it's not necessarily critical that we host the video. I mean, 
we want to be the distribution platform for a lot of the st
uff. But I feel 
there's definitely an opportunity, and over time, we'll have more to talk 
about it.

Thanks. I had 
a different question on that regional ARPU slide which is I 

story rollout and relative ad load in the U.S. relative to Europe and Asia? And 
then secondly, it looks like the absolute addit
ions of mobile users and 
mobile
-
only users was quite strong in the quarter, it was up 25% in terms of 
mobile ads and 30% in terms of mobile
-
only ads versus the third quarter, 
and Mark mentioned a few areas, I was just wondering if there is any one or 
two t
hings that really stand out in terms of driving that acceleration. Thanks.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 

more color to offer, in terms of the mobile News Feed rollout, as you would 
expect with a ne
w advertising product, really in the end of the second 
quarter and the third quarter, it took off first in the U.S., and Europe 
followed, and I think the growth was much more notable for that product 
area in Asia and the rest of world in the fourth quarter
 
as compared to the 
third and that's just sort of the natural progression of how rollouts tend to 
go for us.
 
 
In terms of your second question about the increase in mobile users and 
mobile
-
only users, which we agree is really important and impressive. I 
do

continued penetration of smartphones in

ranking better before we do a full rollout. So, 
right now it's rolled out to the

to share beyond that.
 
 
In terms of the new experiences, I think the
 




 

right strategy for us to 

 
I mean, to build one integrated system where
, I 

for us, right? But the big thing for us is we've 1 billion people using our 
products and we need to make Facebook really good across all of the devices 

re going to keep on pushing to get kind of more 
integrated with the system, I mean, when Facebook is a product that people 
are spending almost near 20% of their time or more on phones using, it 
really should be and I think people want it to be very integra
ted into all of 


functionality that you have today, I think making it so that we can just kind

Great, yeah just one question for Davi
d on the right
-
hand rail revenue. So, 
based on our math, the overall News Feed business may have been around 
$500 million
-
ish in the fourth quarter which would imply about a 10% 
decline for right
-
hand rail revenue. Does that make sense directionally, and 
i
f so, can you just talk about how you think right
-
hand rail is likely to trend 
in 2013 and can the new ad tools like Custom Audiences help offset the 

Thanks.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
Yeah,
 
thanks for your question, Ross, I mean, for us the most important 
metric is that the overall ad revenue increased 41%. I think that the way we 
think about things, it's hard to really separate out the mobile and desktop or 
Feed and right
-
hand column as sor
t of separate and distinct businesses 
because for most of our ads, marketers would tell us what ad they want to 
show and to what audience they want us to show the ad and we choose 
where it goes. It's not true for a 100% of the ads, but it's certainly true 
in 
the majority case.
 
 
So our job is to find a place to put the ads that will create the most value for 
the user and the marketer. So, the overall ad revenue number really 
provides just a better sense of how much advertising demand there is in the 
system t
hat we're able to service, and over time, we'll continue to 
experiment with how to optimize that. In general, you can see from the user 
numbers that the growth in usage is coming from mobile, particularly in 
developed markets, the desktop usage continues t
o be flat or declining. So, 
that's obviously the macro trend that will affect what the future of the right
-
hand column revenues are.

terms of developing tools and providing more data and metrics to large

that we're seeing on Facebook desktop, i
s there an opportunity for Facebook 
to help monetize or to monetize games that are played on Facebook on the 
mobile side? Thank you.
 
 
Mark Zuckerberg
 
 
Yes, these are important. Sheryl has more details on this. So, I think she 
should probably take the first
 
one.
 
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
 
Yes. Measurement is really important for us and it's one of the challenges we 
face. I remember, through the years I've worked on this. We know when 
search happened, people weren't able to measure it, and then they figured 
out how to
 
measure search. And more a new thing, and people need to think 
about measurement differently. One of the most important things that we 
need to do in the market is help educate people that the click is not really 
the most important metric for us. In fact n
ow that we've been able to work 
with companies to look at in
-
store sales data, we find that of the people who 
saw a Facebook ad and then purchased the product in the store, 99% of 
them never clicked on an ad, so re
-
educating the market what the metrics 
are
 
that are right for us.
 
 
I would say in terms of our measurement capabilities, we're really early. We 
weren't able to tie into sales data at all until pretty late in 2012. In order to 
do those studies, we have to work very deeply with retail providers and 
each 
client. A lot of our big clients have their own departments that do this 
measurement, and we work with them individually. So we're pretty early. 
We're happy with the progress we have made. We launched conversion 
measurements just in mid
-
December, and 
now that's probably available on 
this system, but I think we have a lot of opportunity to do a lot more 
measurement a lot more rapidly.
 
 
We're particularly excited about our ability to do this on mobile. With 
customers who have 
--
 
using their data in a pri
vacy
-
protected way, we can 
now measure all the way from seeing a Facebook ad in a mobile device 
through to purchase in a store and that's a pretty exciting capability. We 
think it's pretty unique in the market.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
So, Neil, your second questi
on was about mobile gaming. It's an interesting 
question as well. What we're seeing now is really strong growth and 
adoption of our platform in games on both iOS and Android, and we want 
Facebook to be the default social infrastructure for mobile games and
 
feel 
like we're making progress in that direction and convincing developers that 
they'll get more users, more engaged users, and better monetizing users if 
the users are able to connect with their friends and bring their Facebook 
identity with them.
 
 
At t
his point, we don't have any payments integrations with these mobile 
games, but our belief is that if we can help game developers to grow users' 
engagement and monetization, it puts us in an interesting position to 
consider future financial relationships. 
And the only other thing I would add 
is that we really launched or ramped up the mobile app install ads in the 
fourth quarter and are already seeing that that's a pretty promising way for 
developers to try and get better distribution for what they've built
 
including 
games developers, and that's sort of a nice first step for us in trying to 
participate in the mobile gaming ecosystem.

Th

you seeing in those younger post

college demos, are their engagement 
trends per user still rising or are they 
starting to show signs of leveling off?

the biggest near

term opportunities where Facebook and social budge
t share 
is still low and pretty underpenetrated relative to your larger categories? 
Thanks.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
In terms of engagements, as we said, the overall engagement patterns will 

f 
reported demographics like age. I think the one thing that we can say is that 
our view is that the overall marketplace is expanding really rapidly here in 
terms of just the amount of time people, college
-
age, post
-
college are 
spending connected, sharing 
with their friends, et cetera. And we think 

-

in such a rapidly expanding market.
 
 
Sheryl Sandberg
 
 

boa
rd with the large brand spenders. If you just look at mobile, what you 
see, [Mary Meeker] (ph) just put out a report on this, mobile gets 1% of ad 
revenue and 10% of time consumed, and so right there, you see a big gap. 
Our opportunities there are to ramp 
with the large advertisers and build 
more deeply internal measurement systems so we can measure, help them 
use the Custom Audiences and other targeting we offer because right now 

ng 

do that, but a better ad experience will take advantage of the targeting we 
offer.
 
 

that we have
 
unprecedented scale and huge engagement that Mark talked 
about in his opening statement. We have a natural ad format. One of the big 
successes of 2012 was putting ads into News Feed and having them work, 
both for our clients on the marketing side, but als
o for our users

Great. I have a couple of questions. It definitely seems the 
mobile ramp kind 
of slowed as the quarter progressed, obviously good numbers versus last 
quarter. Did you make an effort to maybe pull back some of the ad loads, or 
is there still a lot of opportunity to add more inventory in the mobile News 
Feeds as we lo
ok forward. And then secondly, maybe could you just 
comment on the health of the Payments business. It looks like the U.S. was 
up quarter
-
over
-
quarter even if we back out the extra month. So, was that 
some of the other new initiatives or did the gaming bus
iness get a little bit 
better in Q4? Thank you.
 
 
David Ebersman
 
 
On the mobile side, I think that it's just really important to recognize we are 

ads we show, how we select them, 
how many we show to different users 
and under different circumstances. So, this is still very early in the process 
of us trying to learn how to optimize that business as we develop it. Our 


 
we still have a lot of opportunit
y there. In 
terms of Payments, I think that what you said is generally true. Note that 
this year as opposed to last year we do have a little bit of revenue from non
-

you want to
 
compare games

to
-
games year
-
over

year. But having said that, 
if you make the year

over

year comparison, we do as I said, we see 

 
as I 
said earlier, we see a nice diversification happening in games, and it's a very 
interesting business to try and even thi
nk about projecting going forward, 
because some of the trends are really quite positive, but you have to be

at are the impediments to future growth, so that you could call it

Second question on Gifts, I think that I really can just reiterate what Mark 
said earlier, which is that the focus for right now is trying to figure out wh
at 
the right product is. We think Gifts if done well can be a very natural and 
positive part of the Facebook experience. So, for example, when you're 
wishing someone a Happy Birthday, the ability to send a gift along with that, 
and just figuring out how th
e product needs to work, what the interfaces 
are, what the selection of products is, how the payment process works? All 
of that stuff is what we're going to have to optimize to make the product 
grow as you're asking, and we're going to try to do that and t
hat will be 
something that we work on in 2013.

Mark Zuckerberg
 
 
I don't really think I can s
ay any more about things that we're developing 
than directionally what I've already said. On iOS, I mean, there are two 
really big platforms out there today 

there are three, I mean it's Android, 
iOS, and Mobile Web. Where we basically are 
--
 
the strategie
s for each of 
those are a bit different. So Mobile Web, there's a limit to how 
--
 
to the 
depths of how deep you can get into the system, but we can go as deep as 
anyone else. So, we feel pretty good about that and we think that our Mobile 
Web experience is
 
really good and has on the same order of magnitude of 
users as our apps. So, that's actually really good.
 
 
For Android, and then I'll get to iOS last 
--
 
Android is a very kind of dynamic 
and open platform as long as Google keeps it that way. There's actua
lly 

 
I 
mean, even though our relationship with Google isn't one where the 
companies really talk, we are able to do a bunch of things because they 
have an open platform that lets us get fairly deep into the system and build 
some really great experiences, w
hich I think we will be 
--
 
which we're 
excited on about and we are working on them. I mean an example that we 
have already, that I can talk about is messenger, on Android you can build a 
messaging app that can actually do SMS on the phone, right? You can't
 
do 
that on iOS because on iOS, iOS controls the SMS on the phone. But on 
Android, you can build something that does that and our messenger app 
does that. So that's a good kind of example of what we can do on Android.
 
 
On iOS because it's a more lockdown s
ystem, the way that you can do 
deeper integrations is by working directly with Apple, right? And they've 
been a great partner for us so far and we're really excited about doing more 
there and people enjoy the integration that we have with them today to be 
able to share photos and share Web pages from anywhere across the 
experience when you're on your iPhone or iPad and we're really happy with 
it. So, I don't think that there is any meaningful numbers to share there but 
qualitatively, I think it's a really g
ood experience and I'm really happy with 
the partnership that we have with them.

Thank you. Can you maybe give us some color behind your decision to lower

then also within the 22% mobile number, is there any FBX within that? 
Thank you.

you're correct, we're doing 1 billion impressions

David Eber
sman
 
 
On the reserve price, we're always iterating and experimenting to optimize 
what we show for the user experience and for our business performance. 
The price floor has been something we've had in place. Its way below the 
average prices and the purpose 
of it has been to both support higher prices 
and limit poor quality ads. Over time, we've developed other tools that help 
us to achieve those objectives so the floor has become less important for us.
 
 
Interestingly, there is some non
-
intuitive benefits als
o that we've been sort 
of realizing, which is that small businesses as you can imagine often create 
some of the highest quality and most highly engaging ads on Facebook. It 
makes sense because your local coffee shop feels like part of the community 
you liv
e in and seeing an ad from them fits naturally into the experience that 
you want on Facebook. And small businesses are often the lowest bidders in 
our auction. So, by lowering 
 
the floor, if we can bring in more small 
businesses into our network ,get them 
comfortable advertising with us, and 
hopefully ramp them up over time that should be a good thing. As I said, for 
the changes we happened to make this quarter, the impact was really 

c
oming into play in most of the developed markets anyway.

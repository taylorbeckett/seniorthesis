Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.
 
Interviewing us today will be Doug Mitchelson from UBS and Scott 
Devitt 
from Stifel Nicolaus. We will be making forward
-
looking statements, actual 
results may vary. Doug, I think you have the first question, so over to Doug.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Thanks so much. Actually, first question for 
you, David, and then one for 
Reed. David, could you just talk a little bit about the net add results in the 
quarter versus expectations, and any dynamics underline the second quarter 
guidance that you want investors to know about?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think
 

not spending too much time understanding any particular quarter. We were 
with under 100,000 in the U.S. under a couple of 100,000 in the 
international versus our expectation. We had a par
ticularly back
-
weighted 
first quarter, which were 
-
 

the sort of net adds guidance versus actuals as well, and we have a pretty 
strong guide for Q1.
 
So I think looking at our Q4, which is one of our strongest
 
quarters ever and 
a pretty strong Q2 guide, we sort of look across that like we put in the letter 


i
n the U.S. as well.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I mean, is there anything you would highlight in the second quarter in terms 
of an easy comparison. Last year, you talked about price increase buzz in 
the press, having a negative impact on U.S. dynamics, the content sla
te, 
anything you highlight driving the result?
 
David Wells
 
Well, the obvious one to talk about in total, talk about in more detail is the 
content slate. We talked in our dissent 
-
 
in the January letter about House of 
Cards pushing into the second quarter. 



explains some of it on the margin.
 
But I think the background tre
nd is just a very strong adoption of Internet 
streaming. So again, if you look across 12 months trend, we still got a lot of 

to growing in the U.S. And quarter
-
to
-

see some fluctuations 
and some of that is explained by the content slate.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And Reed, upfront I want to turn to you at a high
-
level. I think you 
mentioned in the letter about to cross the 100 million subscribers mark, 



talk a little bit about what you meant by using that word in particular, and 
what are the challenges and opportunities as you loo
k out over the next 
decade and target that next 100 million subscribers?
 
Reed Hastings
 

-
 


look at YouTube ha
ving a billion active users and a billion hours every day. 

-
billion numbers. We see that the 

ad supported.
 

those companies. But we definitely see 

doing, which is make fantastic content, get people really excited about that 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
G
reat. Thanks.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And just continuing on the roll of content, I was wondering if you can talk a 
little bit more about the way that content releases do impact seasonality of 
the business, and as well new releases of new shows, say a Dave 

s show relative to say Season 5 of the House of Cards and the 
different impacts on gross and net subs? Thanks.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

shows that have a big audience that are very popular tend 
to have more 


most acclaimed shows like House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, B
loodline, Master of None.
 

pleased to have such a big breakout on 13 Reasons why we just came on 
the last day of the quarter as well as Santa Clarita Diet, A Series of 
Unfortunate Even
ts, Iron Fist, first season shows, and then something like 


looking for David 
-
 
a third special from David next 
year.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And since then you can think of that content is making a little trickier to do 
the quarterly forecasting. But for the first
-

million net adds, which is what we were last year. So again, it moves itself
 


trying to do better and better shows that are more and more popular.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then as it 
relates to the international business, you noted some markets 
that are doing extremely well outside the U.S. and other markets that are 
still progressing. Can you talk about particularly in some of the larger 

ted where the largest 
sources of friction are increasing the subscriber base in those markets?
 
David Wells
 

friction. I mean, we were pretty careful about not talking about spe
cifics by 
market for competitive reasons. But we have said that, we experience a 

markets come out of the gate really fast. We some 
-
 

have grown slowly and that reall
y caught up and seen a great acceleration.
 
So I would say, each market is different. Each one seems to have a different 
word
-
of
-


e these shows 

global word
-
of
-
mouth and the network effect of that that great scale, I 
mean, growing to 100 million and beyond. Global subscribers is really going 
to benefit us in 
having these shows that travel across multiple markets.
 


continuing to improve the product, continuing to improv
e the continent in 
that market with our global originals being the largest part of that. And then 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, Scott, as you might remember, first, couple of years in Brazil, we were 
struggli
ng with number of the aspects in particular getting the right content, 

that and of course, not every market is the same as Brazil, we have to learn 




we still got a bunch of work to do, particularly around gettin
g enough of the 
right content that people want to view that we get our viewing hours higher 
and higher.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And just a follow on to the international topic. There have been several 

-
U.S. originals. And I was intere
sted in 


launching originals, the benefit in terms of the halo effect of the other 
markets actually latching o

the subscribers in those markets as well?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, I could tell you about, we launched this past quarter Ingobernable, 
which is a Spanish language original Starring Kate del Castillo, that had a 
h
uge impact on us throughout Latin America, but also outside of Latin 
America and throughout the Spanish speaking world. And our ability to get 
in learn the production infrastructure, learn the 
-
 
get to know the talent, 

s one of those things that gets a nice 
accelerator as Netflix becomes better and better known around the world 
that the top talent in those markets want their shows on Netflix.
 

for
tune with finding the great town and the great shows locally, and it has 
been having a lot of impact outside of the country of origin.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thank you.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The international arena is a pretty rich topic, but I want to move back to the 
U.
S. But first, Reed, you mentioned consumption. I think investors would 
love to have an update on consumption both in the U.S. and overseas. What 
is the hours per day on average? Is it still growing for both cohorts year
-
to
-

share at this point in time?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, viewing is very large and growing, but nowhere near as big as YouTube. 

some of the new shows like Ted was talking about, our movie out o
f Korea 


 
Doug Mitchelson
 
So I also wanted to hit on the U.S. And so even though a lot of the growth 
comes from international W
hen you think about the U.S., a lot of investors 
are worried about the maturity and whether that sends a signal that you 
could ultimately have some issues with penetrations overseas. And I think, 
Reed, it starts with you and the vision for 60 million, 90 m
illion subs, is that 
still the vision? Ted is part of that. What you have to do to execute on 
getting those subscribers that lead us looking for? And for David, on that 
topic, is there anything you see in the trends? I know you want us to not to 
dig into g


majority wall coming anytime soon for the U.S.?Thanks.
 
Reed Hastings
 
U.S. market is continuing to grow very nicely.
 

mean of course, every incremental 10 million is a little harder than the last 
10 million, but our content keeps getting better, so those forces offset each 
other. When you look at the last five years, everyone is worried ever
y 


about the near
-

budget, more shows, more ma
rketing and so all of that feels very good.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And component of that obviously is the international appeal of our global 
regional shows. But also finding those sweet spot local regional shows that 
offer some connectivity with the consumers. And f
or some cases it will be 
the thing that introduces them to Netflix programming and they fall in love 
with the broader slate of content.
 
David Wells
 

from Reed. I mean, if we can get
, my God, if we can get penetration levels 

hundreds and millions of global subscribers with the U.S. beyond 50%. So 

to say that 


are starting to get there.
 
So I think we punch through that sort of concern and anxiety. No



starting to have sometime in multiple markets that are somewhat new to us 
as Reed described in Asia.
 
R
eed Hastings
 
A couple of years ago, Doug, there was a bunch of fear about the 30 million 
sub wall, with AOL had hit that and HBO would hit that. And the thing is 

anything 

United States and then eventually hopefully most people around the world. 

-
 

services better and better.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Th
e one follow
-
up to all that is, Ted, are you specifically targeting perhaps 

looking on?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

of 
taste. So you have to have programming that really appeals to a broad 
demographic. So obviously a show like 13 Reasons why appeals much 
younger Grace and Frankie, which had a really successful third season 
launch obviously appeals to an older demographic. 
But the key is just people 
love television, people love to be entertained and the definition of what that 

having a lot of that that increases our chances of having a deep connection 
with consumers.
 



somebody and it becomes t
heir favorite show, or the reason they have 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Sticking to the U.S. and speaking of genres and different types of content, 
you talk a little bit about Dave C
happelle. Why the sudden increase in 

out of that type of content?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

back in our early original c
ontent days and the red envelope entertainment, 

documentaries and foreign language films, always had good luck with it just 
on a very small scale. And the format lends itself really well to 


lot of creative freedom and the fan base for these folks is very big.
 
So Dave Chappelle his return to standup comedy was a big event in the 
culture. And you could dre
w series level and movie level of viewing on some 
of these standup comedy specials if you pick them right and invest in them 


 
far.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then family and kids content, Ted, you mentioned a little bit and talk 
more about that in terms of the interest in extending deeper there. And then 
on that topic as well faith
-
based programming, conservative programming, 
Hollywood do

opportunity there to serve a very big market?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

-
 


 
So the faith
-
based market 


the really exciting thing is when you get something that can be viewed by 
both
.
 

where you have these co
-
viewing opportunities that are so rare on TV these 

-
 

hey watch with their kids.
 
Scott Devitt
 

interest in renewing that content specifically, or content like that? And 

-
 

s available 
in the next few years as well? Thanks.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

Pay 1 output deal from a studio, because Disney has really centered their 
brand on a couple of really importan
t tempos that perform very well on 
Netflix and obviously perform well around the world.
 

Disney as a company producing our Marvel series as well as being their Pay 
1 partner and
 
hundred 
-
 
several hundred hours of their catalog all the time. 


 
Reed Hastings
 
And while the Marvel series is global, the Disney Pay 1 is just U.S
. and 

 
Scott Devitt
 
Great. Thank you.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

number of important executives depart Netflix Chief Product Officer, Neil 
Hunt; Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz; VP, Global Television, Sean Carey; 
seems like an unusual number of d

other companies executives. Any comment you want to make around this 
dynamic?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It is unusual. I mean, the last time we had an officer leave Netflix was 2012. 

h on the Chief Talent Officer 

over for Neil Hunt. Greg has been a long
-
term Netflix veteran really knows 
the organization and excited about taking it forward and that transition will
 
happen in about three months from now.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And so no particular signal that investors should take from this. It just 
happened to line up this way?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Thank you. Ted, you mentioned last quarter that it
 
would be a second
-
half 
weighted content slate this year. Can you give us more of a sense of why 
you feel this way obviously 2Q looks pretty big with both House of Cards and 
Orange is the New Black. Is the second
-
half going to be even bigger?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

-
half of the year, 
including some of our more aggressive moves into the movie business. 
Bright actually will be in the fourth quarter, which is our big Will Smith film 
that we think will kind of give
 
consumers and everyone who watches this 


available to you day in day out on Netflix and that they look and feel 
like 
movies of that scale.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 


 
Ted Sarandos
 

our 
productions would be impacted if it happens. We may be impacted a 


production. But some of our productions woul
d be held up in the event of a 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And the last thing I did want to follow
-

away with not giving us an update on the usage trends. You guys willi
ng to 
make any comment on whether usage is still growing and in the U.S. and 
overseas, and what level is that?
 
Reed Hastings
 

given specific numbers.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Okay. I missed th
at nuance again. So, Ted, are you want to?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I did tell you 
-
 
we did tell you that our subscribers have spent about a 0.5 
billion hours watching Adam Sandler movies since Ridiculous 6 launched.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

nd I think that Ted for you, is the 
originals as a percentage of spend and as a percentage of hours is fairly 
consistent. Is there an inconsistency there? Anything strategically that 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
No, pretty consistent int
o the investment and the hours of spent watching. 



e not driving 

trying to find the great things for people to watch that move our business 
and grow the subscriber base.
 
Scott Devitt
 

Doug get an answer on the 
viewing question. I think there was a disclosure in January 250 million hours 
of movie and TV in a single day in January, and the last prior disclosure to 
that was 125 million, which seemed to be like a run rate. And just wonderin
g 
if that 250 million was an outlier, or if that is more of a run rate currently?
 
Reed Hastings
 




country by country basis is how median viewing at different lifetime slices is, 
and we continue to see good things in that, continue to see that grow as we 
have more content.
 
David W
ells
 

PR milestones in terms of announcing it, and some of that growth is by 

individual user within that te
rritory than we are in terms of the big 
aggregate number, as Reed said.
 
Reed Hastings
 
If we can help you out, I remember that, YouTube announced there were 1 


ng way to go to catch up to YouTube.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thanks. And then downloading is also a fairly new phenomenon within 

accounts? Also, any changes from a technology architecture stan
dpoint that 
have needed to be done to produce that?
 
Reed Hastings
 


and more well
-
off markets, wher
e networks are strong and relatively 



loading the 
need for it will go down and down, because basically you want to be able to 

couple of narrow scenarios like an airplane.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And has the reencoding that was 
discussed at Mobile World Congress, is that 
now complete?
 
Reed Hastings
 

-
 
there is no complete when you get to encoding, just keep 

work, so that you can get an inc
redible picture quality on a very modest data 
plan on a phone.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thank you.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

gone after a David Russell drama series with Robert De Niro producing the 
next s
eries for Matt, these are sort of big tickets, big prices, very talented 
producers, actors and directors. Reed, when you look at the competitive 
landscape, anything at all that that makes you nervous, or that you feel like 
you have to accommodate, Ted, the
 
fight for talent in Hollywood, any issues 
with Amazon ramping its originals and David on the cost side, could this 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Like at one level, Amazon is an amazing company and doing so many 
diff

addition to all of Amazon doing a Washington Post and Blue Origin Rocket. 
So, I will say, we do think about all of that and their tremendous track 



because the market is just so vast.
 
Think about it when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to 
it, you stay up late at night. Yo

-
 





trunk.
 


both time and spending for people. And so Amazon can do great work and it 
would be
 

not a zero sum game. And again, HBO success, despite our tremendous 
success is a good way to illustrate that.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I would just add there are 500 cable channels, nearly every 
one of them 


-
 

buyers for their programming and a great opportunity for consumers to have 
a lot more opportunity
 

 
David Wells
 

those shows. So even if the show were lowering cost, we would have more 




switching to growing global operating margin.
 

 
growing the content. So I think, 

competing with the quality of the show and trying to push and improve the 
cinematic quality of that show, which is driving 
-
 
has more of an influence on 
t
he cost of that than the individual competition within the market.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Absolutely. And Ted, to follow
-
up with your aspect of this, how is your 
relationship with Hollywood versus a year ago? How would you describe it? 
Does this dynamic come 

from Hollywood we always talk about? The media companies ultimately 
looking at Netflix as a competitor competing on online video platform versus 
them supplying you with content and making a lot of money 
off? But have 
you seen a change in that dynamic at with any of the studios?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, this is probably the most dynamic time of change in the television 
-
 
in 
the history of the television industry and how everybody navigates, it feels 
really impor
tant obviously. But we are on top of being a competitor for 
projects and a competitor for attention, where an enormous customer of all 
the studios who would license us their content, sell us their content, who 
produce content 
-
 
original content for us.
 
So 
I think, the content evolution of the relationship is finding a balance 
between being a great supplier and a competitor. And the networks and the 
studios have navigated those waters since the beginning of television.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
They have, but Hollywoo
d goes for fits and starts and cycles. And right now, 



f change taking place and 
a lot of folks on Hollywood trying to figure out how exactly to wrestle with. 
But I guess, to your point, as you said, things are fine right now.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

e and 
continue today.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Well, Ted, I think you would also say that one of the fundamental changes is 
the globalization of TV. So I think that, that is playing through Hollywood, 

 
of Hollywood 

applicable to a double the audience globally say?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Correct and who do you compete with today when in the U.S., with 
-
 
incredible success with our Spanish langu
age original Ingobernable and also 
with our Portuguese language original from Brazil 3%. So the pool of people 
who are competing for the attention of viewers and ultimately the attention 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Great. Thanks.
 
Sco
tt Devitt
 
Speaking of studios, it seems like your initiatives with Netflix studio 
produced original content seem to be quite unique relative to others, or 
some recent media attention, Ted, I think you were quoted as suggesting 
spending several billion doll
ars in terms of allowing talent to be home when 
they actually create content.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Could you speak a little bit more about that, how you think that 
differentiates yourselves relative to competitors?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

-
 
think about it as an extension of our talent
-
friendly 
commitments, but also in terms of our commitment to quality. And what we 
have found in our own business is that, if we create a great working 
environment for employee, they do the best work of their liv
es. And I think 
in the case of production, a lot of that comes off in the performance, which 
comes off in the screen. So where we want to invest in our talent the way 
we invest in our talent inside of Netflix and create the best shows on 
television. One wa
y of doing that is not having people travel all around to 
chase a tax credit. And one 
-
 
in that article that I had referred to this, it was 
suggesting that perhaps the state of California could be more effective in 
building 
-
 
investing n infrastructure ver
sus and setting individual 

to have 
-
 

-
 
come work in your state.
 
Scott Devitt
 


technology into the studio to create content in different ways. Can you 
expand on that a bit?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

re 
giving the people the right 
-
 

producing for Netflix 
-
 
the Netflix studio that you have the most state
-
of
-
the
-
art tools at your disposal to create content and not get stuck in old 

 
innovate on things that matter to consumers, 
but also things that matter to creators.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Does 
-
 

current infrastructure that you have in place does allow you to do live and 
near
-
live productions?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It would 
-
 

-
 


-
 
our desire is to continue to 
double down on our consumer proposition of on demand. I think 
it is that 
kind of freedom that the consumer receives from Netflix of watching what 
they want whenever they want is part of the value proposition. And live is 
back to the kind of the old paradigm of appointment television.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thank you.
 
Doug Mitc
helson
 
Can we shift to sort of on that Amazon topic and the international topic 
combined. I guess, Ted, for you. Amazon is building out local content pretty 


ve, I think for the last couple of years really espouse this 

drive subscriptions globally. But you also believe on the studio here in the 
United States to pursue that more aggressively
, does it make sense for you 
to more aggressively build out local studios overseas? And what capacity 
does the company have to even do that at this point?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

the Unite
d States. Today 
-
 



programming, complemented with
 
a growing number of local language 


 
Reed Hastings
 
And, Ted, maybe you could just talk a little as an example
 
in those of 
Terrace House, Death Note and Secret Games to illustrate that.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, the different 
-
 
the various versions of it obviously would be something 
like producing 
-
 
something that would be more on the quality level that 


producing coming up called Sacred Games.
 

in the unscripted mode as more consistent with the things you see every day 
on televi


reimagining that storyline for the world with more of a Western spin. So 
those 
-
 
the different takes on content from aro
und the world opens up the 

it.
 
David Wells
 


-
 

re seeing is the 

-
and
-
a
-
half years. And 


f

 
Ted Sarandos
 


Ingobernable was our second major series for Mexico, w


domestically and internationally.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And do you think 20% local, 80% sort of Hollywood U.S. content is the ratio 
that still looks good to you 
today, or do you think that 20% is rising as the 
international markets?
 
Ted Sarandos
 


seeing a reversal
 
of it in any territory.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The second topic I want to discuss was mobile, and I think, Neil Hunt before 


 

thinking about in terms of customizing content for mobile, or even 
operationally, any more details on mobile that any of the three of you are 
going to share?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, at first, Neil is still with us for the next couple of months. Se
cond is, 

think of there were movies originally were very widescreen. When they 
showed on televisions that were 4:3 Technology developed pan and scan to 
be able to make that pictur
e look a little better on a 4:3 screen.
 



ure.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
What we do know too is that the next 100 million subscribers are going to be 
far more likely to be watching content on mobile than the first 100 million, 

out.
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 


million subscribers if it 
took 10 years to get the first 100?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, to more than 10 million how you count the streaming shorter than the 

 
Scott Devitt
 
And then, Reed for you, if you were to like in your current global dominance 
in global stre
aming to any army in the history of the globe, what would that 
be today?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I got the invitation to go visit Albania. So I may 
-
 
you may see some 
summer photographs from me with members of the Albanian army. But 

nd that Jeff Bewkes has been a great 
partner for us. So we do get him and he deserves that. But he really has 
been a great partner, and we think they will continue to be under AT&T for 
that matter. Again that comes back to the non
-
zero sum nature of 
entert
ainment. And the more we can all do great content, the better many 

us just to figure out how to provide the best entertainment possible. Thank 
you, everyone.

4/22/20,Netflix,"Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q4, 2019 Earnings interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today, our 
CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted 
Sarandos; and Chief Product 
Officer, Greg Peters.
 
Our interviewer this quarter is Mike Morris, Guggenheim. As a reminder, 
we'll be making forward
-
looking statements and actual results may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike now for his first question.

Great. Thank you, Spencer and good afternoon. Before we dive into some of 
the details we provided in this quarters letter. I'd love to have Reed provide 
some strategic thoughts as we head into the New Yea
r, the new decade. 
Perhaps we can start with just what were the most important strategic 
accomplishments in your mind of 2019? And as you look forward what do 
you hope to accomplish this year?
 
ReedHastings
 
We've had the same strategy basically for 20 years
 
which has pleased our 
members and they helped us grow. Ad we've done that in a variety of ways. 
Of course, initially just with DVD
-
by
-
mail then the combination. And if you 
look at what we've done in expanding film and making that a really strong 
aspect of
 
Netflix. We've had a lot of continuous progress. But the same 
strategy we've always done how do we learn? How to please our members? 
Whether that's on the product side, marketing side or content side. And the 
next decade we anticipate the same. How do we 
use the great resources 
that we have to do even better?
 
MikeMorris
 
Now let's talk a little bit about some of the key specifics from the letter 
today. The first, of course, is the guidance on your member growth for the 
coming quarter. You have a very strong
 
fourth quarter compared to your 
guide. The first quarter is lighter than it was in the prior year. You talked 
about some of the potential for timing between the first and second quarter. 
I think the key question on investors' minds is how to think about t
he full 
year. 2019 looked very similar to 2018 with the strong fourth quarter. How 
should we think about the coming year in that regard?
 
SpencerNeumann
 
You want me to take this one?
 
ReedHastings
 
Sure.
 
SpencerNeumann
 
I'll take this one, Mike. So and first, 
I just say, Mike, our opportunity, we 
view our opportunity are long
-
term opportunity, is big and unchanged. So 
we should be clear about that. We're not providing full
-
year guidance but 
when you think about Q1, again it's comping off of the all
-
time biggest
 
quarter we've ever had in Q1 of last year. We guided to 7 million paid net 
adds in 2020. So when you look at that Q1, 2020 number of 7 million that's 
still big growth. That's
--
 
we've only had four quarters in our history where 
we've grown more than 7 mill
ion in paid net adds. And the number 
specifically it reflects, first, there's primarily a US story there and that we've 
--
 
we have seen and we talked about in the letter. Some elevated churn in 
the US from combination of pricing and competition.
 
We've 
--
 
w
e can roll that through into Q1 including a full quarter of 
competition in Q1 versus a partial quarter in Q4. We also anticipate that 
competition rolling out globally throughout the year. So we're trying to be 
prudent of thinking about that impact througho
ut the business. And then we 
talked about as well as when we think about the seasonality, the arc 
between Q1 and Q2, the first half of the year, we think it's likely to be more 
balanced because of the timing of the price it changes. We took that rolled 
thr
ough Q2 of 2019. So we think that our seasonality is going to look more 
like 2018 and 2019 when you think about the first half of the year.
 
MikeMorris
 
Okay. When we talk about competition, you've mentioned churn a couple of 
times with respect to the potent
ial impact. Can you talk about competition 
on both gross adds and engagement as well? Especially on engagement. I 
know it's early but clearly the Disney Plus product is a 
--
 
has a very heavy 
kids and family focus to it. Have you seen any specific engagemen
t change 
on your content in that genre?
 
ReedHastings
 
Sure. Well, I'll jump and others can, we actually alluded to this in the letter, 
Mike. The great thing is, first off, we're growing in Q4 including in the US 
even with some of those noise from competitiv
e launches. And ultimately 
what drives our business is increasing member satisfaction and viewing. And 
what you also see in the US what we saw across the board is that our 
viewing, our per membership viewing grew not just globally but in the US 
through Q4 
and continues. So that bodes well for our long
-
term opportunity 
as long as we keep getting better.
 
SpencerNeumann
 
And, Mike, thinking with the Disney product, Disney Plus has a lot of great 
catalog product and one big new show Mandalorian. And it primarily
 
is going 
to take away from linear TV and takes away a little bit from us. But again 
most of the growth in the future is coming out of linear TV.
 
ReedHastings
 
It draws down by a variety people because they were so broadly distributed 
prior to the launch.
 
M
ikeMorris
 
Okay. And I guess the last thing on this particular topic is the behavior 
outside the US as compared to the inside. Clearly within the US, a more 
mature market and that's where the products were primarily focused in the 
fourth quarter, their 
launches. We do have some more expanded 
international rollout particularly Disney talked about or announced a broader 
European rollout at the end of the first quarter. Any thoughts specific to 
that? Is that factored in? Is it one of many things? What's you
r thought 
there?
 
ReedHastings
 
It's one of many. I mean, Disney is going to be a global service quite 
quickly. And there are many other global services. Remember that we 
compete a lot for time with YouTube. And it's not dollars because that's ad 
supported. 
But we compete very broadly for viewing and as Spence 
mentioned our viewing on a per member basis is up. And that's because our 
content is getting better. Our service is getting better. And that's all coming 
out of linear TV.
 
SpencerNeumann
 
And I would say
 
that they're 
--
their brands are definitely global brands. But 
they're no 
--
with the exception of China, they're not more popular than they 
are in the US anywhere else in the world.
 
MikeMorris
 
Okay. And so, Greg, a question on pricing. When we spoke last q
uarter, you 
felt that these competitive launches would not have an impact on your 
prices.
 
So I guess the first question is now that you have this quarter under your 
belt. Any update on that point in particular?
 
GregPeters
 
Yes. I think it's useful to start 
with just noticing that our revenue in the 
United States is up 23% year
-
over
-
year in Q4. So we're still seeing a pretty 
significant growth there. And we're not seeing anything that fundamentally 
contradicts our core model or suggests that it's changed in a
 
material way. 
And that model is if we do a good job of judiciously investing, the money 
that our members give us every month and great stories and better product 
experiences creating more value for them then we occasionally earn the 
ability to come back t
o them and ask them for a little bit more money to 
keep that virtuous cycle of improvements going. And everything we're 
seeing continues to support that core models intact. So that's our job.
 
MikeMorris
 
Okay, great. And you go down that path a little bit f
urther historically you 
have done some sizable price increases at least on a percentage basis on a 
somewhat spread out timeframe. How do you think about possibly doing 
perhaps a single annual price increase in a more mature market at a more 
modest rate? I 
hate to say this but maybe somewhat more similar what 
people have experienced with their cable bill or something to that effect.
 
GregPeters
 
We don't have a fixed model that our PR, we're coming in and saying this is 
the right approach. So I think our job i
s to actually listen to our members. 
Give it 
--
 
if the signals that they're giving us in terms of the engagement 
that we're seeing that we gain from growth that you heard we're going after. 
And we'll really use that as a mechanism to guide us towards when 
if we 
earned that opportunity to come back and ask for more. So we're not really 
coming in with just a fixed model that we're going to shift to or anything like 
that.
 
SpencerNeumann
 
And if we're 
--
 
we're putting hits on the board. And we can see that in th
e 
terms of watching an engagement and subscriber growth and growth and 
the zeitgeist to run our projects then the more 
--
the more you can do that 
the more frequently you can go back. So we have to 
--
we're in this great 
model of where we have to prove ourse
lves to our members literally every 
month. So it's really 
--
 
it does hold us to a very high bar and keeps us 
coming back and doing more and topping ourselves if we need to.
 
MikeMorris
 
One last question on this is around premium plan subscribers versus your
 
standard plan subscribers which largest, you've mentioned in the past 
clearly the largest group. On what has been the trend with respect to your 
subscribers moving to the premium plan? And is there a way to further 
incentivize them to almost have a self o
pted price increase but also clearly 
getting an improved product as well?
 
GregPeters
 
I think we're 
--
again constantly evaluating the right balance of what's 
--
 
what features, what prices at those various different tiers. But we haven't 
seen a significant s
hift in that. And we see a healthy take rate across all of 
our plan options which are a really good sign. I think that we're providing a 
range of options at a range of price points that allow consumers in the 
markets that we serve to sort of selecting into
 
the right model. Again, we 
want to be innovative about that. And we'll look for ways to create more 
value across all of our tiers. But right now that blend is pretty healthy, we 
think.
 
SpencerNeumann
 
And, Mike, I would just add that in terms of plan mix, 
you have over the 
years seen a slight migration towards the higher price point plans. That is 
something that we have seen but it's quite gradual. So there's no sort of big 
jump in any sort of given quarter, but quite a gradual increase in that which 
I thin
k maps to the growth in smart TVs and high
-
definition TVs.
 
MikeMorris
 
Okay. I'd like to switch to a few questions on content and content strategy. 
So, Ted, the ramp in feature
-
film product in particular both development 
release big step forward for you in 
2019. As you looks into 2020 what are 
you most excited about either from a content perspective or an overall 
thematic perspective. There's a healthy amount of information on some key 
titles [Indiscernible] but would appreciate you highlighting the things t
hat 
are most important to you.
 
TedSarandos
 
Well, looking forward to next year, we get the opportunity to do some things 
that we know have worked and come back with some sequels. And they are 
super popular. YA genres, we've got these rom
-
coms; To all the Bo
ys I've 
Loved Before and Kissing Booth coming back with sequels in Q1 and Q2. We 
have a big ticket action films with Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron and 
Chris Hemsworth more like the things you've seen in Q4 and trying to 
program our movies like we do ou
r series for every taste, every mood, every 
region of the world.
 
So it's not trying to make one
-
size
-
fits
-
all program. That's what we have so 
much of it, just what we all 
--
 
we want to hold it all to a very high 
entertainment bar. So you're going to see us
 
working across all genres like 
we did in Q4 and still continuing to kind of press up the production quality 
and the production investment in these films.
 
ReedHastings
 
And those are all coming out in Q1 and Q2 of this year and some in Q3, Q4.
 
TedSarandos
 
Yes.
 
ReedHastings
 
Just got a tremendous slate this year.
 
TedSarandos
 
Yes and I think the one thing we have been putting out in the letter, it's 
exciting that we end up with being the most nominated studio at the Oscars 
this year with our films.
 
But the most exciting thing is those films are all 
incredibly popular with our members as well.
 
MikeMorris
 
So that leads into another question which is as you have sort of shifted and 
increased this focus on film, Ted, and particularly you've highlighted 
a 
couple of reasons for that and benefits to the members. Those have included 
some comparison with respect to the value proposition, right and compare to 
a film.
 
TedSarandos
 
You know what a movie ticket costs so sure.
 
MikeMorris
 
Exactly. I think we've also
 
talked about the ability for film content to travel. 
There's sort of a perhaps a broader global base of interest. Anything else 
that you would highlight or remind us up for why this shift in investment or 
maybe not shift but expansion is important? And al
so now we have another 
year under our belt with a pretty robust slate, so have things been 
progressing as you would have expected given those objectives?
 
TedSarandos
 
Yes. I would say, look, when I look back at Q4 I look back say, I'm glad we 
decided to do 
this about a year and a half ago. That's about the time it takes 
to secure the deals that obviously do the production and go get through post 
and get everything delivered at the level of quality that we were able to. And 
so now we have all of that kind of 
ramp up behind us. And while the steady 
flow of projects like you see in Q4. Similarly with the feature animation. 
When I see where we're at today with access to programming and all those 
other issues, we've been ramping up our feature innovation for almos
t three 
years. And it really hit the ground their first project with Klaus in Q4. There 
was a complete audience pleaser and an Oscar nominee for Best Animated 
Feature. And that will keep a steady drumbeat going there as well.
 
In Q2, we have an animated fea
ture called the Willoughby's and in Q4 we 
have Over The Moon, which is from Glen Keane, we did Little Mermaid and 
Beauty and the Beast. So these are big theatrical scale animated features 
and big scale feature films that would be competitive with anything 
you 
would see in the box office. And I think people really do value them. And to 
your point they do travel much more predictably than TV series do.
 
MikeMorris
 
One of the things you just mentioned and clearly has been very widely 
reported and seen is the cr
itical acclaim that you've achieved and you've had 
growth in Golden Globes, now at this point, Oscar nominations. My question 
is around the business benefit of that and the cost of achieving it as well. 
Maybe it's a somewhat open
-
ended question but how muc
h is it costing you 
at this point to have those films in a place that they can be considered for 
that? And what does the timeframe for the benefit to, the business look like 
for that?
 
TedSarandos
 
What you've seen the expansion this last year within the con
fines of our 
existing content budget. So we're growing, it's how we're choosing to bring 
the incremental spending to the table in terms of the bigger breadth and 
scale of films, but not taking it away from our growth in series which is also 
growing and in 
particular in our local language series which we've reported 
before where we're growing by a 130 seasons of local language series 
around the world as well.
 
So to me, I look at it as the growth 
--
the benefit to the business is the 
growth that you're saying.
 
ReedHastings
 
And I would just add to that. Sorry 
-
 
you'll see that if we further our 
reputation for doing well for content, sorry for talent by being one of the 
best in the world at winning awards for our talent then the business benefit 
is that we will w
in deals that we wouldn't have otherwise won for incredibly 
entertaining content. So think of all of our awards work as a really smart 
way to make us the best home for talent in the world.
 
TedSarandos
 
I think it's also worth noting that there's a consumer 
component this too. I 
mean some of our members around the world use the awards piece as a sign 
of what they want watch so that when we present those, that information to 
them we actually see them respond to that. So there is an immediate benefit 
there as w
ell.
 
SpencerNeumann
 
And just one point one more time there is typically there seems to be a big 
gap between critical acclaim and award winning and popular. And we are 
really trying to do and we have in the past quarter achieved both of. 
Meaning we are brin
ging popular film to the market at such a quality that's 
also being recognized by the critics and by the awards groups.
 
ReedHastings
 
Sorry, Mike. I just want chime in just to that point, it is working already, and 
the model is working in terms of seeing the return to our business. I mean 
that programming at that level of diversity and quality across such a broad 
member base ultimately i
s driving member satisfaction. It's growing our 
member base, it's growing our revenues if you seen roughly 30% growth 
this year. We are growing our profits. Both our profit and margin and up to 
$2.6 billion of operating profit this year. We are delivering 
on our cash flow 
objectives including on a path to improve our cash flow profile next year as 
you saw in the letter, material improvement from negative $3.3 billion this 
year to roughly negative $2.5 billion next year on that path to cash flow 
positive ove
r the coming years. So you are seeing it play out in the business 
model already.
 
MikeMorris
 
To that point, Spencer, my next question for you is really around your cash 
investment. On content in a coming year, can you share a specific in terms 
of the growth
 
that you are anticipating there? And also can you just help us 
with the modeling side which is the amortization of that content relationship 
between that amortization and the cash investment?
 
SpencerNeumann
 
Yes, sure. So we'll continue to increase our con
tent investment across the 
board next year. Because as I just said, we are seeing a great return on that 
in terms of our business model. Our content amort is just a little under $10 
billion this past year in 2019. I think you should expect to see with our 
specific guidance, a similar level of growth and that kind of grew I say 
roughly in that 20% range this past year. And you should assume we will 
continue to invest at those types of levels this year. The conversion or the 
relationship between our cash spen
t and our amortization, that ratio was 
about 1.6 meaning 1.6x the cash investment relative to our amortization of 
about $15 billion of cash investment this past year in 2019. And you should 
see that ratio continue to come down a little bit.
 
Again, without 
a specific number but we are scaling into the business. So 
we've moved the long way in this business model transition from what was 
once an all licensed content business to now the well over 50% of our cash 
spent is on originals, the future of our business
 
is mostly originals. And 
we've very much transition there. So that puts less sort of pressure on our 
working capital, so that's playing out in the numbers as well. So similar 
growth rate and amortization, but it's getting closer in terms of our cash 
versu
s amort and you're seeing that in terms of the improvement in the cash 
flow trajectory next year.
 
ReedHastings
 
And, Mike, I am sure you realized it but it is a huge milestone in our growth 
of last year being peak negative free cash flow. And so we're on th
e glide 
path slowly towards positive free cash flow. We're excited about that but 
that's not coming from shrinking back our content spending. That's coming 
from the increase in revenue and operating income.
 
MikeMorris
 
All right, great. So let's pull it bac
k a little bit and talk about some of the 
--
couple of additional content issues or topics, if you will. Friends, a big title I 
believe one of your more popular titles came off the service at the end of 
2019. I realize we're only three weeks in but you do s
ee the data real
-
time. 
Has this content being moved off the platform impacted your consumer 
engagement, your member engagement at all?
 
TedSarandos
 
Nothing that we've seen or can measure.
 
MikeMorris
 
Okay. So let's also talk about viewership then. A couple t
hings. I had a 
question here and then you gave us an entire page of viewership metrics [in 
form of letter]
 
TedSarandos
 
Mime that is why I should probably put a little more color on that simple 
answer. Just to say, we've had over the years incredible popula
r product 
come on and off the service and expires. And typically what happen is our 
members through our incredible personalization, deep library and broad 
library are able to find their next favorite show. And that does will happen 
with Friends. With Frien
ds fans and some of them will find it elsewhere and 
some of them will find, some their next favorite show.
 
ReedHastings
 
Like, Mike, it was about years 10 ago we dropped, we had to drop all the 
Disney content, not phased out like we are but all the ones, we
 
added to the 
Starz deal. And we were all worried about the big impact and instead people 
came back the magic of the personalized service and they were able to find 
other things to watch and viewing growth just kept rising.
 
TedSarandos
 
Yes. And we've seen 
that phenomenon over and over again even in, when 
one that may be been even more dramatic than that was the all, the 
Nickelodeon content when they came up and was completely displaced by 
other kids watching overnight. I should say equally good content just
 
people 
had the ability to find something new.
 
MikeMorris
 
Sure, understood. And so within that what I was coming to is the viewership 
metrics that you provided in the letter for a number of your programs. I'd be 
curious if you wanted to highlight something
 
that stood out to you. But I'll 
tell you something that stood out to me is the information you provided 
about The Crown. Okay, so in particular season 3 saw growth and early 
season viewing and yet it's still I think by the metric 21 million households 
thr
ough the first four weeks of season 3 compared to 73 million households 
worldwide for the series overall. And I guess what strikes me is that they're 
--
 
your members have enough content that even though that was important 
to 73 million and 21 million was a
 
big step up, they're still a 52 million yet to 
watch it. So 
--
 
TedSarandos
 
Correct. But I have mentioned with that first 28 days doesn't capture also 
are things like brand
-
new viewers to season 1 that just started in the ramp 
up to season 3. The show has 
been incredibly adorable in the UK, in the US 
and around the world.
 
MikeMorris
 
How does that compare to other key shows, right? I understand that every 
show doesn't behave like The Crown, but is that viewership pattern 
something that somewhat similar for a
 
show like, let's say, Stranger Things 
that has three seasons and
--
 
TedSarandos
 
It's so unique. Sometimes the show can enter the zeitgeist in such a loud 
way like Stranger Things season 3 around the 4th of July phenomenon, 
everything that happened that a l
ot of that viewing
--
 
a lot of that viewing 
pops like that. Something similar we saw with a huge launch for Witcher, 
Witcher was kind of pent
-
up demand for known IP, but man people, the 
show delivered for people, who delivered viewing hours for us. And peop
le 
loved it right out of the gate. Other shows come out and they pop and 
they're dependable and they build and people are going to watch it as soon 
as they finish what they're watching right now.
 
So it's very different from show to show. I see you can 
see that in that list of 
how those shows will perform. And sometimes that it's a really great 
indicator of its full
-
year performance. And sometimes its new shows will 
continue to build on their positive word
-
of
-
mouth and become even bigger 
over time.
 
MikeM
orris
 
I'd like to ask a couple questions about product and distribution. So, Greg, 
I'd like to come back to the topic of pricing. We spoke a little bit about the 
US, but you have expanded your mobile
-
only plans I believe during the 
quarter. Can you talk ab
out where that is now? I think it's India, Indonesia, I 
believe Malaysia but maybe the balance between what has become a more 
permanent part of your offering? What's still being tested and how we should 
think about that mix going forward?
 
GregPeters
 
Yes an
d you've got the three countries correct. And we've seen in the 
performance across those three countries is that because we've added this 
price at a lower price point, this year at a lower price point. We've been able 
to add incremental subscribers which a
re great. We've seen increase in 
retention not only at that noble plan but in other plans as well. And net 
that's a revenue positive action for us. And so we're super excited about 
that. We think that that's a pretty good indicator that there might be othe
r 
countries around the world where that kind of offering will work as well.
 
So we're going to continue to test both that in different countries and see 
how that goes. We're also 
--
we've got a bunch of different other approaches 
that we're going to try out 
and we'll really try and be active and innovative 
in that area to try and improve the accessibility of the service for more and 
more people around the world, but in a way which we think is long
-
term 
revenue optimizing as well.
 
MikeMorris
 
Can you expand on 
that as well in terms of expanding that availability?
 
GregPeters
 
I mean really I'd say that anticipate that we'll do more testing of the mobile 
plan in more territories. That's probably the one to talk about at this point 
then we'll sort of see what else w
orks through our testing as we go.
 
MikeMorris
 
Okay. Great. And then over the weekend, I believe it came out on Sunday, 
expand it I think you were referred to as you can strengthen partnership 
with Sky. What 
--
how did that become a stronger partnership?
 
Gre
gPeters
 
Yes. I think what we are seeing is there's more and more opportunity that 
we're finding through whether it's mobile operators, pay TV operators, ISPS 
to reach out to a customer segment that while we're probably growing with 
them in general. We can 
actually accelerate that growth. And so it starts by 
just at being available on set top box or the device that they're using to 
watch TV, and we can put Netflix there and make it easy to see the service 
and potentially sign up there. But increasingly now w
ith bundles we've 
removed yet another point of friction. So that that's just a part of their 
offering and they can just, we can do a call to action like right in front of 
them like it standard things, it's launching right now, watch and that's a very 
effec
tive way to introduce people to the service.
 
But also we're finding that with co marketing programs and other things that 
we're getting more sophisticated that we can actually do more effective job 
at reaching out to more of those members to be around the 
world.
 
MikeMorris
 
You brought up the topic of bundling. Two kinds of questions with respect to 
bundling or different pricing packages. The first is a question of the need for 
consumers for this re
-
aggregation of these multiple services. And if that is 
the 
case perhaps a third party would like to or should be taking some 
portion of the payment for adding value. I guess my question is your 
position on the need for some sort of aggregation of these multiple services.
 
My second question is around annual pricing
 
versus monthly pricing and 
perhaps a discount for consumers who choose to take an annual plan. Either 
of those 
--
how do either of those factored into your thoughts here?
 
GregPeters
 
Yes. I think we'll see sort of what the right solution is for consumers as
 
we 
shift to this online streaming world. I anticipate that there are our models 
that make sense where they'll bundle multiple content services together and 
make it more sort of easier for consumers to access that. And that might be 
the effect that we're s
eeing but really most of the bundles that we have are 
either connecting to an existing pay TV sort of legacy pay TV service or 
they're connecting to things like your mobile plan or your internet plan. So I 
think there are multiple different opportunities t
o find the right mix where 
we're able to introduce Netflix as part of a set of offerings that just make it 
simple for people to sign up and it's logical and it's intuitive for them to go 
do so.
 
TedSarandos
 
And the likeliness that we have your favorite show
 
your favorite movie raises 
the chances that you're going to figure out how to get to us as well.
 
GregPeters
 
That's right and then you also you mentioned I think an annual, a question 
on annual.
 
MikeMorris
 
That's right.
 
GregPeters
 
Yes. So I think it's an i
nteresting model and certainly we see some. There's 
on legacy plans are sort of some
--
 
since that there's certain countries 
around the world where that's a more common standard, right. So we want 
to experiment with that and test that out and understand if 
that's a more 
effective way for our members to access us. So we'll go do that and we'll 
sort of hear from them if that's something that's more effective or not. We 
don't know yet.
 
MikeMorris
 
Okay. I'd like to revisit the topic of advertising as a 
source of revenue or a 
means for your members to pay you for access to the service. Remind us we 
talk about a lot every quarter the topic comes up again. So remind us why 
advertising is not a right option given that you do have a focus on providing 
your me
mbers with them. Some optionality in terms of their way to enjoy 
the service.
 
ReedHastings
 
Yes. Mike, I think we addressed this last quarter in the letter. But I go over 
it again which is Google and Facebook and Amazon are tremendously 
powerful at online a
dvertising. Because they're integrating so much data 
from so many sources. There's a business cost to that but they makes the 
advertising more targeted and effective. And so I think those three are going 
to get most of the online advertising business. And 
then to grow $5 billion or 
$10 billion advertising business you have to rip that away from other 
advertisers. In this case, say or other providers, Amazon, Google and 
Facebook which is quite challenging.
 
So don't think of that as in a long term, there's no
t easy money there. And 
instead we think if we don't have exposure to that, the positive side is we're 
a much simpler place. We're not integrating everybody's data. We're not 
controversial that way. We've got a much simpler business model, which is 
just fo
cused on streaming and customer pleasure. So we think with our 
model that we'll actually get to a larger revenue, a larger profits, larger 
market cap because we don't have the exposure to something that were 
strategically disadvantaged at which is online a
dvertising against those big 
three, which over the next 10
-
years are just going to integrate incredible 
amounts of data about everybody. And we won't and we're not trying to 
have access to. So that's why we're really pretty confident that the best 
business
 
model is this way is certainly in the long term.
 
MikeMorris
 
I do think that last point is something we do hear people lose sight of 
sometimes which is you are not aggregating an immense amount of data 
about your viewers. You have viewership habits but bey
ond that I think 
correct me if I'm wrong, you don't collect a significant amount of personal 
data that would be used to target advertising. Is that accurate?
 
ReedHastings
 
We don't collect anything. We're really focused on just making our members 
happy. And
 
we're not tied up with all that controversy around advertising. 
And again, if you wanted to succeed in online advertising, you can't just 
have a little data. To keep up with those giants, you've got to spend very 
heavily on that and track locations and al
l kinds of other things that we're 
not interested in doing. We want to be the safe respite where you can 
explore; you can get stimulated, have fun, enjoy, relax and have none of the 
controversy around exploiting users with advertising.
 
MikeMorris
 
Now one o
f the biggest changes that you guys have made in a while with 
respect to what you share with us is the geographic breakdown that you're 
providing now with respect to your actuals. So maybe just briefly can you 
remind us the reason that you made this change
. We have had some 
questions whether it was somewhat suggested or required of you. So why 
did you make the change and then I do have a couple of specific questions 
about the markets, if I could.
 
ReedHastings
 
Spencer, you want to handle that?
 
SpencerNeumann
 
Sure. So to answer a question like, no, this was not a required change. This 
was a change that we made and as we talked about it was to, we always 
evolved our view of our business as our business changes. And with our 
launch of rest of the world in 2019 w
ere basically a fully global company ex 
China. So we have increasingly been looking at the business internally along 
these four regions. So we want to map our external reporting and align it 
with how we look at it internally. So it was not a requirement bu
t our choice.
 
ReedHastings
 
So we work hard internally to not be US and international. There's no such 
thing as international. There's a bunch of nuance of every market around the 
world. And part of our development from and originally just domestic 
company 
is to lose those kinds of distinctions. And instead think of it as four 
equal regions. And we're growing all of them. And we're sophisticated about 
all of them. And that's why we look at it, in that four regions way internally, 
which is of course drives th
e external reporting.
 
TedSarandos
 
It's been a great internal discipline for everybody to think about the business 
more in that way for sure.
 
MikeMorris
 
Well that's a great segue into some questions specifically about the nuances 
in these regions. Perhaps w
e can start with Latin America, which was your 
first broad international launch in 2011. And so what we noticed then and of 
course this quarter, you had record member growth in each of the regions, 
but it does look like Latin America is perhaps closer to b
eing mature with 
respect to its growth trajectory. At the same time, we would look at the data 
and say, it's still the penetration level of broadband households is still very 
low in that region. Can you characterize for us where you think we are in the 
lif
ecycle of member growth in that region?
 
ReedHastings
 
Spence, you want to take that?
 
SpencerNeumann
 
Yes. Sure. I would say across the board we're still early days right. So even 
with the roughly 167 million members across the globe and big membership 
in Lat
in America, you can see what we're or still roughly kind of in that 30% 
penetration. We think is pay TV households you've seen around the world 
whether it's pay TV or broadband households, we don't see why we can't get 
into all of those households over tim
e.
 
So, yes, we're a bit more mature in Latin America than perhaps we are in 
APAC and some specific countries. But we're continuing to grow. It happens 
to be a region where similar to the US our price increases were a bit more 
significant than in other part
s of the world.
 
So I think that may have been a bit of a headwind as well. We had foreign 
exchange working against us more meaningfully in Latin America. But I'd 
say in general very long runway. We continued 
--
continue to see both global 
content and local 
content working really well in that region. So we will, I 
think you'll see continued healthy growth on the horizon.
 
MikeMorris
 
And you just, Spence, you just mentioned APAC. And there are a couple of 
questions here. One is because this region has both 
Australia, New Zealand, 
so larger English
-
speaking markets and a large emerging market population. 
The first question is can you share at all the sort of balance of subscriptions 
in that market between those two? And I would think there's still a relativel
y 
high ASP there, which would imply some mix of higher price markets. But 
first the mix there and then also should we expect that ASP to come down 
based on what you're seeing now with respect to adoption of the lower price 
mobile plans.
 
SpencerNeumann
 
I'd 
say in terms of the mix and others can jump in as well, but we don't 
break it down specifically by country. I think the take away should be though 
that we're seeing healthy growth in all of these markets, so across Japan, 
Korea, India. I mean all of these 
markets were increasing that content 
market fit. We're getting much smarter about the markets in both say the 
content we offer as well as the pricing and packaging and bundling and 
distribution to our members and payment methods for our members.
 
So I think
 
we're getting better literally every quarter every year and that's 
playing out in terms of very healthy growth across those markets. And then 
with respect to pricing, certainly that pricing is different in every country 
around the world. But we don't 
--
 
w
e're not managing to ARPU. We're 
managing to revenue maximization as we talked about earlier. So we're not 
going to provide a long
-
term focus. Obviously, as we have lower priced 
mobile offers that are going to bring down a blended ARPU in a country or in 
a
 
market, but if we're doing that in a revenue accretive way, we think that's 
great for a long
-
term business. We're growing subscribers and we're growing 
revenue.
 
TedSarandos
 
Again, our local content and our regional content in Japan and Korea by way 
of exa
mple becoming much more sophisticated about what is super 
impactful in those countries. Plays pan regionally and occasionally plays 
globally. So those investments are paying off in the form of things like the 
Naked Director, which was a big, big hit for us
 
in Japan and Kingdom which 
was the second season coming up at Korea that's been a big global hit for 
us. And as you think about the exciting things that happen in the content 
space, movie like Parasite coming out of Korea, that's done $140 million 
globall
y, $100 million in Korea and about $40 million outside. And the 
expansion of people finding stories from around the world is going to only 
make the opportunity bigger and bigger.
 
MikeMorris
 
Might be a time for one or two more questions. Okay. Let me hit 
on EMEA 
and then I'll get a wrap
-
up question. I think in that European, Middle East 
and Africa market, it's somewhat similar in terms of some mature markets 
and some emerging markets and opportunities there. So as you think about 
that market growth opportu
nity is the answer similar to the same as the 
question on Asia. And I think the question is a little bit rooted in, we do have 
some specific mobile only lower priced plans in Asia that we've been focused 
on. But should we think about that EMEA market as pe
rhaps following a 
similar pattern.
 
ReedHastings
 
Greg, do you want to take that pricing. I would say in terms of the 
opportunity we see a huge opportunity in EMEA. It's a multiple of the 
number of addressable, their pay TV or broadband households as you see
 
for 
example in the UK or US and Canada region. We're less than 20% 
penetrated in the market. You've seen it's driving more than 50% of our 
paid member editions in recent quarters or roughly 50%. So we're low 
penetrated and we're growing in a very healthy 
clip in that market. I'll turn 
to, Greg, though in terms of pricing strategy.
 
GregPeters
 
Yes and their pricing and plans approach, again that region much like APAC 
has both, it's very affluent, very mature markets as well as less affluent 
markets. And so I
 
anticipate that what we'll find is that we'll have a mix of 
plans and approaches that will spread across that region that again will be 
different price points. But it'll be looking to sort of maximize revenue 
through that mix across the entire region.
 
Mik
eMorris
 
Great. So I'd like to conclude again as we did last time with a little bit of a 5 
for 1 question last quarter. We talked about each of your 
--
 
something each 
of you was excited about in the coming quarter. This time, I'd like to ask you 
repress ana
lyst reports et cetera about your company. I'd love to hear your 
take on what you think is most misunderstood about the company or at least 
well appreciated about the company. So last, as with last quarter I'll start 
with Spencer and go from there.
 
Spencer
Neumann
 
Sure. I honestly don't think that there's that much that's misunderstood. 
We're a single product company. And I think pretty straightforward I think 
for most investors understand. I think I'd like to think about one thing that I 
personally think th
ere's probably a bit of an over focus on the streaming 
wars sort of notion. And I know it's exciting for folks to talk about The Clash 
of the Titans and all that kind of stuff. But I think really the big thing that's 
going on is this transition from linear
 
entertainment to streaming on
-
demand 
entertainment, which is really, really big and very similar to that transition 
the industry went through from broadcast to cable.
 
And there what you saw was a lot of those new cable networks didn't really 
take much sha
re from each other, but really grew together as broadcasting 
sort of became smaller over time. I think that's what's the really the big 
thing that is happening that's probably less well understood.
 
MikeMorris
 
Thanks Spencer. What about you, Spence?
 
Spencer
Wang
 
I think you're going to pick up me because I got the order wrong last 
quarter. So, okay. I'll say, I think was most misunderstood is the business 
model and what you see in our cash flow generally. And folks thinking that 
we are losing money, if you wi
ll, when we 
--
what we've shown is that we are 
increasing our profitability both growing and growing our profit margins. And 
what you've seen over the last few years is forward investment as we've 
been going through a really kind of pretty significant trans
ition of our 
business model from licensed content where you pay basically ratably for 
content you receive over the time and it's on the network to original content 
not just licensed originals, but self
-
produced originals where oftentimes 
we're investing ma
ny years before that content is on the service.
 
And we've moved as they say, well, along the curve there were the bulk of 
our cash spend is now on original content. So as we've gotten bigger, as 
we've moved towards originals, it just 
--
it fundamentally cha
nges that cash 
flow profile over time. And we're a very profitable business and one that will 
ultimately over the years become meaningfully self
-
funding.
 
MikeMorris
 
Thanks Spencer. Greg? How about you?
 
GregPeters
 
Yes. Spence actually took mine. It's my fav
orite sort of gap between 
external and internal worldviews. So I'm very excited to be turning the 
corner on the free cash flow issue. So that we could sort of put that behind 
us and really focus on growing the business ahead.
 
MikeMorris
 
Great and Ted?
 
TedSarandos
 
In terms of misunderstood, I think I did use this notion you hear every once 
in a while to where there is so much stuff on Netflix everything gets lost. 
And I think that's the opposite is true, which you'll see in those numbers 
that we release 
you in the letter. The
--
 
our ability to launch new brands, to 
sustain brands over multiple seasons or multiple sequels and at a very high 
volume from all over the world has been unparalleled. And the idea that we 
can create brands out of thin air over and 
over again sometimes multiple 
times in a week like this past week is something that I'm super proud of.
 
And I think it gets lost on people because they think all this content is for 
them. It isn't. It's just meant to be your favorite show and your favorite
s 
movie and that's going to be something for everybody.
 
ReedHastings
 
And for me, it's really that we keep doing these amazing numbers. Doing 
[88] in Q4, it is just amazing. So happy with that and with Witcher 
performance ending the year on a high note of a
 
massive new franchise that 
will develop season after season. So if you think about the next couple of 
years, it's really the rate of improvement that's the big thing. How much 
we're learning and we're doing so many shows. Our learning is higher. Doing 
so 
many product tests. Our learning is higher and the quality of our service 
two or three years from now will be so much higher than it is today. That's 
the thing that's not well understood. Everyone focuses on how's the current 
service look as opposed to how
 
good we're going to be in three years.

1/22/20,Netflix,"Welcome to the Netflix Q4 2015 earnings call. I am David Wells, CFO. I am 
joined on my right by Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief 
Content Officer.
 
Interviewing us today will be Peter Kafka from Re/code; and Ben Swinburne 
from 
Morgan Stanley.
 
Just a reminder a cautionary statement that we will be making forward
-
looking statements and actual results may vary.
 
Over to the first interview question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Ben Swinburne
 

the team, can you reflect on the fourth 
quarter results for us that we are all going through right now, in particular, 
talk about the international strength, you mentioned you were pleased with 
the October 
-
 
September
-
October launches, so can we infer that
 
the 
outperformance versus your expectations may be came from those areas or 
any color you can give us on the international strength to start us off?
 
Reed Hastings
 

Ben, predicting th
ese markets. And then we launched in Japan in early 
September and Spain, Portugal and Italy in mid
-


outperformance, it was pretty broad based, many different contributors
 
around the world to that.
 
Now what we are seeing basically is that this on
-
demand Internet TV, watch 

world.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And just taking that question over to U.S. for you also may 
be for David, a 
little bit later this quarter then your guidance or budget, talk to us a little bit 
of the churn connects dynamic and anything you would want to add around 
credit card chipsets or any other issues you want to bring up around Q4 
performance 
in the U.S.?
 
David Wells
 

an hours of it, but so we did anticipate that net additions would be lighter 
year
-
on
-
year. I would say the credit card was a background issue in Q3, it 
c

next 50 million or a little harder than the first 50 million in terms of growth 

continuing to improve 

numbers when you grow steady at 5 million, 6 million net additions a year 
on a larger number then that percentage growth is smaller year
-
over
-
year 

 
our guide for Q1 as 
well.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Hey guys, last quarter you said credit card issues were bad rate issue, this 
quarter you said they are background issue, how long do you anticipate this 
is going to be a problem for you additionally, any sense of why 
you are the 

 
David Wells
 

-
 

one. I think because we are recurring merchant anywhere from five to ten 
basis points
, 15 basis points is sensitive to us, we have optimized, we spend 
a lot of time optimizing our recurring billing systems in our approach and so 

on the larger things and not the
 
small things. And we anticipate that the ENV 

globally these issues where there is mass reissues of things and disruptions 
in the recurring systems that we have.
 
Peter Kafka
 
So this 
be fall into the small thing category but last quarter you added IOS 
signups, any impact surprising one way or another from that?
 
Reed Hastings
 

up on IOS but they had to do it in the 
mobile web Safari Browser and now 

really nice positive and a particular in new markets as we expand around the 

omers in 
terms of using the Apple payment mechanism versus entering their 
international credit card information is helpful. So think of it has one more in 
our long list of great payment options that we have.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Reed, I want to come back to the o
utlook in the Q1 guidance in particular, 
starting with international, you mentioned in the letter, the 2016 markets 
are you are playing the long game here, but the guidance is obviously 
impressive and well above the expectation. So is some of 
-
 
are the 201
6 
launch is a big contributor to what you are expecting in Q1 and sort of for 
the year internationally or just continue momentum building on the existing 
markets, any color you can share there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, a lot of both. I mean honestly our global g
uides for over 6 million net 
additions will be a record for Netflix and so we are super excited about that. 


a
round the world for us. And you kind of expect Jessica Jones to carry 

is that you know these more unusual content titles have also had great draw 
around the world.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Let me 

the next 50 million, so what are you doing as a management team maybe 


 
what is there, some generous 

guys need to make to go after that, what are you doing to maybe go after 
that other opportunity in the U.S. market.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, David is 

stick with the next 5 million. And when we can clearly see the next 5 million, 

And so the big driver is getting p
eople excited about whatever title we have 

Smart TV or integrated into the MVPD set
-
top or the Apple TV those are the 
things that make it easy to fulfill that desire. But the unde
rlying desire is for 
these new titles which is why we are so excited about the year coming and 
the content the Ted teams put together, so maybe he can talk about some 
of the big hallmarks we have in the next few months.
 
David Wells
 
Yeah, I mean just upcomi
ng in this quarter, you are going to see, so then we 
as 
-
 
we were pleasantly surprised by how excited the world is overfull our 
house. So this upcoming, you ask about different kinds of programming for 
the next 50 million or 5 million depending on your lev
el of aggression that 
getting more and more mainstream and some ways with the programming. 
But as a function of breath, as a function of doing more for all taste, so 
opening that up to include multi
-
camera sitcoms like The Ranch, like Fuller 
House, we have
 
also really single
-
camera sitcom with Arnett called Flaked 


run the whole year.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
That bein
g pleasantly surprised that shows that are not necessarily all in 
English are being embraced by U.S. audience just one of those things that 

watch subtitles.
 
David Wells
 
The continui
ng success of Narcos in the U.S. where this primarily Spanish 
language show is being watched enormously mainstream numbers in the 
U.S.
 
Peter Kafka
 
I guess for Reed and Ted, since last quarter, several of your suppliers most 
specifically time wonder in Fox 
have been every more explosive about their 
desire to pull back on the amount of content they sell to you, is that cause 
you to accelerate your original programming or you ordering on that same 
trajectory?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

e original programming. I mentioned 

programming this year alone. So it is a function of as our budget continues 
to grow, as our subscriber base grows, we are licensing programming and 
we a
re creating programming. As a percentage of our spent, original 
spending is growing, but as an absolute there are licensing dollar are 
continuing to grow as well. And Fox is an important vendor for us just like 

t source of revenue for them.
 
Peter Kafka
 
I mean if that rhetoric was less intense if they went out they are saying look 

spending?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

-
 
the positives ev
er come for original spending have been 
tremendous in terms of our international growth, in terms of really 
distinguishing and differentiating Netflix from an explosion of our services.
 
Peter Kafka
 
And then when you think about the Marvel relationship, do 
you see 
expanding that one or is that kind of sort of stay steady where it is right 
now?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

-
 
five different series going in, we just announced yesterday that we are going
 
to a second season of Jessica Jones. So when you look at those five series 

commitment and we are all the way along the way, you are going to be 
introducing new characters who ha
ve the potential to spinoff and grow that 

for Disney.
 
David Wells
 
And for us.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And for us, absolutely.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Just Ted sticking with you on content, why the 
call out of family 
programming emphasis in the letter, any comment around sort of what you 
are doing maybe differently there and now you have a quarter behind you 
with some of your movies in the market, what you learn, how does that 
change your appetite ar
ound film?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well what the reason we call that out is to acknowledge if there is a large 
volume of specifically if kids programming coming out when normally people 

sophisticat
ed dramas and adult comedies more so than our kids 
programming, but quietly but I am asking a very big selection of original 

number one outlet for kids programming on television which ar
e really proud 

-
 
we are also looking to 
grow categories like Fuller House which are programming that are watch 
together, parents watching 
-
 

tolerate but the

why we call that out specifically.
 
And on the movie side, it was a great for a swing I think with Ridiculous Six 
and Beasts of No Nation. Beasts of No Nation is in the discussion about the 

other category, the viewing were thrilled with around the world and have 
been continued to be throughout and thus we expand a new territories both 
Ridiculous Six and Beasts of No N
ation are watched in huge numbers in our 


 
Ben Swinburne
 
And just shifting over to the hours date, Reed that you gave in Las Vegas 
and then some in th
e letter, this comes up kind of every quarter, people try 
to understand the penetration growth curve in these international markets. 
So if you look at the European markets where you gave the subscriber 
number last fall, I think penetration grows relatively
 
light so far sort of 
nearly versus say the UK which was much stronger, what do you guys doing 
with you can David as you think about trying to accelerate the growth in 
some of these markets that have been tougher out of the gate and what are 
the characteri
stics that we as investors and analyst should out in these 
markets understand the dynamics that drive these growth rates overtime?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 
true that it always well. We saw the same 


France, Germany, is this building momentum as we do more
 
and more local 

will really uplift the way that our French members think about say non
-

natural building cycl
e. And I think the way you should model that is pretty 
consistent growth in all of the territories. The variation is pretty modest. 
Again if you time adjusted you know from whenever we launch.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And just on your time spent number, I think we ca
lculated in the fourth 
quarter anyway about a 12% increase per average sub year
-
over
-
year which 
is impressive given you added a lot of new international markets, anything 
you can tell us about sort of the highest and versus the lowest and whether 
all marke
ts are still growing, it would appear that the U.S. is still growing 
which is you know impressive, maybe you could talk about that a little bit?
 
Reed Hastings
 

of the performance a


the per membership basis as a service which was in the idea. Think about 
smart phone usage now compared to ten years ago, of 
course the number of 

scratch the surface, you know Netflix is a tiny percentage of all video 
viewing today, so we are tremendous potential growth ahead of us if we can 
continue to e
xecute, we can continue to produce great shows to have this 
global launch with no snaffles, so not a hard execution but the market 
potential is really quiet large.
 
David Wells
 

you are
 


content but also the breath of generous that we are covering in our original 
shows and our original movies.
 
Peter K
afka
 

Philippines, Saudi Arabia is particularly important markets for you, anything 
else you want sort of emphasis in terms of the 130 plus counties you rolled 
out a couple week ago?
 
Reed H
astings
 
With also a number of countries that have language match, so Philippines a 
lot of people speak English, we have English language content. We have 

a good match for Saudi
 
Arabia. And then in much of the world Russia, 


make the service more relevant. So we look at it in sort 
of two categories 

growth but more substantial growth in those obviously where we have 
language match. And then beyond language, we have work to do on 
payments in terms of in each country
 
there are often local payments or 
different traditions around payments that will start to work on.
 


 
David We
lls
 

launch.
 
Peter Kafka
 
And what are you thinking about as you move into markets where mobile 
internet sort of the dominant way the people get online, traditionally people 
are watching on 
a connected TV, what happens when they are used to 
watching or consuming things on a phone?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah, same thing, you just watch Netflix on the phone just like you watch 
YouTube on the phone. A lot of that phone viewing is on Wi
-
Fi because of 
the
 
data charges. And then what you do on the sailor networks is try to have 


video services like YouTube.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
David, I want to come back and maybe talk a little bit on the numbers, can 

understand the relationship between content, cash to the P&L versus cash as 
we move through this yea
r maybe into 2017?
 
David Wells
 

about a billion dollars of cash mostly on our branded or originals content, 
that ration of cash to P&L is about 1.3 to 1.4 and that continues to hold
. So 
you see that it will run up in a peak in certain quarters if we take delivery of 
a lot of original content and then runs back down. But I think the 1.3 to 1.4 
range of cash to P&L expense will continue to hold. And so far our 
expectations of use of ca
sh have been about as expected. You see in the 

maybe a little more this year, but we upsized our debt last year about a year 

t later this year 
maybe early next year before we would need to do any more on the capital 
side.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And on the U.S. margins, and I realize how you allocate cost between the 
U.S. international markets may change overtime, but you got a lot 
more 
operating leverage last year then perhaps we all thought heading into the 
year, you maintain this 20
-
20 guidance of 40% contribution margin, is that 
just being conservative or do you expect maybe some change in 
amortization rate to slow the margin exp
ansion down, what color can you 
give us about the pace of U.S. margins?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well not the ladder, I would say there are couple of points on this. One is 
that you know to the extent that we launched Western World then it was a 
little early then 
maybe 24 months ago that we would have been fully global 
or near fully global. I would say the U.S. P&L did receive a little bit of relief 

 
The second point is, we continue to add content and add
 
an efficient level, I 
mean we look at the hours views and what is generated by the content 
versus the cost and we continue to see new additions even in the U.S. and 
markets that are have been in place for four to five years now, we continue 
to see viewers
hip and Ted talked a little bit about engaging new audiences, 

 
So I think 
-
 
you know for the foreseeable future, we think we can grow both 
margin and grow the content spend even in markets in the U.S.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Back to in

guidance on when you might go into China, but when and if you do, do you 
imagine that you are going to have to restrict or alter the catalog based on 
censorship or other issues of the Chinese mark
et?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah, the standards at least today they are fluid that the government uses 
restrict like Game of Thrones reportedly as you know had 10 or 15 minutes 
from many episodes cut from it and so there are issues conforming to those 
local standard


field with all other services.
 
Peter Kafka
 
And same territory, would you have to enter with JV or some way you c
ould 
enter China without doing a JV?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There is all different flavors, if you look at how Disney lie for iTunes or 

the relationships. But again as I mentioned a few days
 
ago, we have a very 
long term look and this could be a many years or discussions or it could 
happen faster than that, where you know going to take our time. And that 
clearest example is really the iPhone which took many years for Apple to get 
approval for
 

view is for looking out for the business a decade from now, we should just 
be very patient and continue to build those relationships and listen and 

time and effort right now is 
going in, how do we build the Japanese market, how do we build the 
Philippines market, how do we build the Saudi Arabian market, markets that 
are open to us and available right now.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
I want to ask about content spe
nding maybe for David and Ted to comment 
on you know we presume a relation between subscriber growth and content 
spend is not linear going forward. So as you guys think about growing the 
U.S. business, how should we think about the pace of growth in conten
t 
spending? And Ted is the 50
-
50 original acquired ratio still your long term 
expectation or have the relationships with the vertical integrated media 
companies maybe later that at all?
 
David Wells
 

say Ben, you know it 
is true that once you get to $4 billion of spend, the rate of growth is going to 
slow down, so that is definitely true on the U.S. side. But back to my earlier 
comment, we still think that there is great content to be added to the U.S.
 
service that is efficient that will continue to increase the competitiveness and 
attractiveness of the offering in the U.S., so we are going to continue to add 

 
And in time, it not
 
true yet, but in time, we will be adding more of our 


grow originals quickly but you are seeing a lot of th
at added to the U.S. 

transition to you about finding content that works across markets, you know 
there will be blurring in the lines between what is really U.S. content and 
what is 
international content and vice versa.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah, I mean I think the order this is going to be doing something that 


o far, I guess that 
would not goes primarily Spanish language sure working in countries they 
speak every different language and making it as Reed pointed out, in many 
parts of the world these kind of true detective documentaries are incredibly 
popular in P

be grow global generous. Where you asked about our suppliers and the 
confutation is probably overstated, but there is a lot of letter going around 
right now about how quickly and how aggressiv

still a very competitive business. And then I think what happens is that 
people sell their programming to the highest bidder and if we are that 
bidder, we get the programming and if someone else is, they will get the 
programmi

 

original spend and not just driving it up, not fear are being cutoff on either 
end.
 
Peter Kafka
 
And Ted just on that foot
 
point, what should you glean from your 

of an output, you could correct me like output deals, and then on the same 
side, the CW renewal has not happen, I think that deal sort of s
till out there. 
Is that an example where you can get some independent studio but not with 
a vertical integrated one?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
No, the DreamWorks is not an output in the traditional sense meaning that 
we agree to a certain levels of programming but we w
ork together and what 
that programming is going to be and developing those shows along with 

into more territories and expanded the number of years of programming 
that will come th



the press, so you are seeing some of
 

just in the process of negotiation.
 
You should also keep in mind that no matter what happens in the CW deal is 


g to wake up one day without the programming. 

great relationship with CBS and Warner Brothers on that deal and we like to 
continue it.
 
Ben Swinburne
 

 
Warner should spinout HBO but if they 
ignore your advice, is that changer view of the way HBO would be 
-
 
would 
act as a global competitor for you they have ability do things outside of Time 

 
Reed Hastings
 
You 

time. You might have seen the recent news that they are now are offering, 
HBO now direct to consumer in multiple new nations, they started just in the 
Nordics then some countries in Latin Ame
rica, now in Spain. So they will be 
a formidable global competitor overtime again independent of their 
ownership.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And then speaking of competitors, Ted want to offer a theory of why your 
competitors at NBC and Fox and other networks spend a l
ot of time talking 
about you last week at the products association?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It might just be putting up a shining object to deflect, they talk about Netflix 

you why, it w
as 
-
 
NBC was a particular puzzle both mostly because they 
used as an example to show that produce for us to try to illustrate how what 

surprised everybody at NBC.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I thin

 
Ben Swinburne
 
Is the talent to anyone else ask for numbers or they happy now or customer 
reduction they are going to tell?
 
Reed Hastings
 
And we follow the coverage from the DCA most of them o
ffered up that they 
are very happy with the relationship and not to be under that kind of weekly 

happy not to focus on it.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Coming back to David on some of the financial
s, David, I think you said at 
CES or your presentation out in Las Vegas about 120 million loss a quarter 

be thinking about the year. And then on raising more capital, you menti
oned 
in the letter you are looking at lower your cost of capital which we presume 
would have been the case, what are you referring to specifically there some 
of the gyrations in the high yield market causing you to think about raising 
capital definitely ha
ve in the past?
 
David Wells
 
So on the first question, you heard me right in terms of 120 million. Looking 
ahead I would say there is two things that might alter that not materially but 
plus or minus 10
-
20 million that would be foreign exchange, I mean we 
c

headwinds of foreign exchange, if that continues that might challenge that 
120 million upward a little again 10
-
20 million. And then the other thing is 
just carving out a little bit o
f room for us. Like I said we are 14 days you 

were in early days of setting our level of compelling and competitiveness in 
our service offering. This year is about investment, you


trying to build multiyear businesses in many of these markets. So if we see 
opportunities, I think there is a little bit of room for us to pursue those later 
in the
 
year to pour some additional content marking whatever the right 
mixture of investment is.
 

too much but it could be 10
-
20 million within that.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And then you shoul
d assume that that instruments are similar to the ones 

 
David Wells
 
Yeah, sorry Ben on your last question, nothing is changed there, other than 
our confidence that will continue to drive some meaning
ful profit in the 

-

financial metrics in terms of credit worthiness. We think that will become a 

yields market
s. You know today, their bonds have traded pretty well.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And just follow
-
up David on your global breakeven point, I think operating 

international losses, you just ga
ve us plus some U.S. margin expansion, I 
think operating income overall should grow a bit of the 15 basis, I need to 
know am I thinking about things the wrong way, just I want to know that?
 
David Wells
 
No, I think you are doing the right math, but I think 
you are 
-
 
that question 

true and in terms of the math, but in general I would say this year is about 

s
ure operating grows, the operating income growth is sort of an outcome of 
you know focused on international expansion but also committed to 
consolidated breakeven.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Understood.
 
Peter Kafka
 
You guys said you are releasing people from grandfathe
ring this spring on 
this price hikes, David or anyone else, are you thinking about ways you 

keeping churn as low as possible?
 
David Wells
 

him know that the certain date, the 
price change takes effect, so nothing dramatic, pretty straight forward 
simple stuff.
 
Peter Kafka
 

Amazon is doing with its bundle and Starz and Hu
lu, anymore thought about 
attaching yourself to any other over the top service in some sort of bundle?
 
Reed Hastings
 


ch and 
learn and detect you know our people on Hulu taking a lot of show time 
where is it pretty much on the market.
 
Peter Kafka
 
But you are seeing it right now?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Peter Kafka
 
Thanks.
 
Ben Swinburne
 

 
more about the 2016 launches. Can you guys talk about how 
the go
-
to
-
market strategy is it for these markets versus international 
markets maybe at a high level operationally when you are thinking about 

rent about what you are 

 
Reed Hastings
 
So extremely similar to how we launched Latin America where there is a 
couple of countries that we focused on directly and there is still some 

ited you know four or five years later, but 
we have a lot of members. So the Internets are beautiful thing because of its 

 
Ben Swinburne
 
And anything you are doing on the payment side, sinc
e you brought up Latin 

but what can you do proactively in some of these markets to help smooth 
that for the consumer?
 
David Wells
 

-
 
you know w



gift cards and prepaid cards that might open up you know to the market to 
those peo


took in Latin America which is just to look at our next best opportunities to 
open up additional pockets of t

-

of the world. Our partners are another element of this right, so Reed 
mentioned IOS will be looking to draft off of large partners in t
he group in 
terms of IOS, Android and other options you know and there is a lot of 
evolutions going on in the payments world. But I got miscoded at city by 

to have in five to te
n years of borderless currency like that coin. I think 
those people that are so excited about it are interested in breaking down 
those barriers and in using the power of the Internet and the Internet age 
you know to reduce the friction of payments that are
 
existing today in some 

But in the near term expect us to continue to just knockdown the best 
opportunities in terms of adding local payment methods, credit, debit cards, 
drafti
ng off partners as well.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Are you guys, you are participating with TMO and their Binge On program, 
are you going to Verizon on I think they are calling it FreeBee I think they 
announced today?
 
David Wells
 

ils of FreeBee. But generally the 
great thing what TMO was doing is making a limited video consumption of 
possibility with freedom from oaring about the data caps. And the Quit 

qua
lity on their four or five inch screen, which when you look at the DVD 

-

we are seeing viewing going and 
I think TMO was seeing somewhat positive 
benefits from that, so we help those kind of programs expand.
 
Peter Kafka
 
So Reed, can you explain why you are comfortable and in participating in 

ained 
about a Comcast in the past with their data caps?
 
Reed Hastings
 

turn it on or turn it off, that would a big difference and then they are not 

 
an open program, many of our 

no charge program where they are really focused on trying to get the 
customers some optionality of limited to DVD quality and then you get 
unlimited vie
wing which you know their customers are choosing.
 
Peter Kafka
 

of program and from this kind of studio, this kind service?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 
Peter Kafka

With the 750, $8 price point in these international markets for the 

you reserve the right to sort of go down market overtim
e as well?
 
David Wells
 



 
a shorthand as iPhone owner, so that they pay $800 for an iPhone, they are 
comfortable with entertainment in English, and so for them you know $8
-
$10 is a sweet spot price. Certainly in future years you know as we do more 
and more and trying to expand it 
to the mass market, you know we can look 
at additional pricing option, but we feel good about our pricing and the value 
for these global originals right now.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And just on these internal markets, you know there is a lot of press 
coverage on the
 
BTN situation and proxies and maybe you can walk us 

from prior periods and could you envision situation where that might impact 
your net adds because you have a million of customer
s in an international 
market that suddenly have 
-
 
went from having a fake U.S. accounts or 
having an access?

and other proxy workarounds and then why go ahead and do it all, just 
purely did to play kit content providers?
 
R
eed Hastings
 
You can call a play kit or you can call catering to their desires which you 
know they have the gentlemen desires that we license content in Canada 


or Canada, so we are trying to pay for it all by shifting to 
global licenses and we are working with our content providers on that, but 

will be some people effected that are using it 
today which is what we wanted 

now with this enhanced blacklist and some other techniques.
 
David Wells
 
And remember all of our originals are fully global, they go live in every 
co
untry at the same time around the world. Increasingly we are spending 



w around the world, so people will be able 
to watch that movie on Netflix wherever they are.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
In the past you said piracy is a major competitor in any concern that the 
VPN and proxy workarounds will push some of your users back to piracy?
 
Reed
 
Hastings
 

contributor to overall global piracy. Overall global piracy is a big problem 

and also to have th
e other services like HBO and Amazon be great carats. 
And so we can work together on this antipiracy agenda.
 
David Wells
 
And I think dual filter hacking in piracy are maybe just in cousins are best, I 
mean I think dual filter hacking is people hacking to p
ay versus piracy where 
people are hacking not to pay.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Thanks.
 
Peter Kafka
 
I am curious that you guys could talk about where you are investing on the 
technology side, I think your long term letter talked about over 700 million 
in 
tacking development in 2016, there is some comments in the letter about 
complexity based in coding. And what about to hear beyond the general 
areas you are spending money is what are you doing them to reduce the 

stream and enjoy Netflix, you 
know particularly thinking about the 2016 in the mobile first markets?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You know I think the whole industry is working on these advanced version of 
H265 to be able to do very high quality in coding with small bit 
rates. And so 
YouTube has made great progress on that, we made great progress. So I 
think you know again people have been working on efficient video encoding 

seeing good progress the
re, we are seeing a lot of progress on our 
algorithms and being able to rank videos for each person even that are 
being able to promote to the right person the right content, hopefully you 
are seeing some of that in your own experience where this is this J

that is the billboard at the top of the page or more often you know very 
appropriate and something you are just dying to watch.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
What are the minimum speed you think someone is going to need in a 
market like India on fixed line or on m
obile to actually stream Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 


able to do DVD quality.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Thank you.
 
Pet
er Kafka
 

you and success surprise you, can you talk a bit about sort of why you had 
more modest expectations for that, the surprise of that success has gone, 
how do you sort of rethin
k sort of your modeling?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well it surprised me because I know so little about these things. When I met 
with the filmmakers and you know heard about the Murderer, sequence was 
interesting, but I thought it would be a specialty thing. I would sa
y Ted and 
his team had that surprise, they always believed in this content.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah, it had a 
-
 
there is something very special about of it from the 
beginning. When it came to us it was seven years into making already and 
this is came to us over 
three years ago and recognize then even before 
making original docs that they had something really special on their hands. 
The surprises that you see it perform at the levels of script and series, even 
our best documentary series have done very, very well 
but not performed in 
such mainstream numbers.
 
Peter Kafka
 

how it evaluates for more shows or you sort of or this is happy success and 
you are happy to move along with?
 
Ted Sarandos
 


-
 

which is a very different show and the next documentary series are probably 


 
Peter Kafka
 
Ted, some of your competitors 
-
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Including 
-
 
in fact it starts in a couple of weeks or just or this week, I am 
sorry Chelsea Handler and Chelsea Does will be our next documentary 
series.
 
Reed Hastings
 
We should take
 
one more question and then let everyone go.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Real quickly, Ted 
-
 
I guess for Ted. Your competitors report that you are in 
many cases overspending despite significant amount for original 
programming and as well as repeats, do you think that gap 
is going to 

fall in line with those spending?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

the truth of it is the only 

words have shock in outspending for a series is because we get shock in our 
viewing on that series that Dave expected that David said earlier, the 
efficiency of the content spend has been great meaning that we
 
are 
spending a lot on great shows and they get a lot of yielding relating to 


and overspending is relative, 




 
Reed Hastings
 
Out of respect for one of our long time qu
estioners and your colleague Rich 
Greenfield, who had a question about Charter and was a good, if Charter 

think it would be a tremendous positive for the OTT industry because 
Charte
r has agreed to a multiyear strong net neutrality policy something no 
one else has publically agreed to and that would cover not only the Charter 
footprint but the Time Warner cable footprint. And that means that we, Hulu, 
Amazon and others can compete on 
an open basis. And so it would be a 
huge step forward for U.S. policy in terms of OTT.

Spencer Wang, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate 
Development. Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, David Wells; 
Chief Content Officer, Ted 
Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. 
Our interviewer this quarter is Doug Mitchelson from UBS.
 
Before we begin, we will be making forward
-
looking statement and actual 
results may vary. With that, let me kick it over to Doug for his first quest
ion.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

for each of you and then we will start rotating by topic. Reed for you to 
start, it was another strong third quarter. Do you 
feel like we are hitting 
some sort of inflection point with streaming video? You have your digital 
peers, whom perhaps competitors pivoting into Hollywood video. We have a 
slew of SVOD services that we will be launching over the next couple of 
quarters. Yo
u have the traditional media companies thinking about diving 
into direct
-
to
-
consumer themselves. Do you see a real sort of inflection point 
in the marketplace?
 
Reed Hastings
 

it'
s pretty much steady growth. And we've seen new competitors increase 
streaming around the world, new devices, new formats, just been a 
continuous evolution. You know we started streaming 10 years ago. Now we 

d say, overall, more of the 
same and continued great success for streaming.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Ted, takeaways for you from the third quarter, what surprised you? What 
was better? What was worse than expected?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, Doug, I was pleasantly surprise
d and relieved in our kind of continuing 
expansion of our original programming verticals, including releasing an adult 
animated comedy in with Big Mouth, big feature film like Meyerowitz. It's 
being getting very well received critically and being watched b
y in big 
numbers all around the world. David Fincher's new series Mindhunter and an 
Italian original Suburra that we shot in Rome all Italian for our Italian and 
European customers, but also for our Netflix users around the world. So, just 
kind of a contin
uing breadth of things that are working well for our 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Greg for you to set the table, any learnings from your time in Asia, 
specifically the Japan launch and how that's informing your strategy as you 
get starte
d in the early days here as global product manager?
 
Greg Peters
 
Sure. I spent a lot of time there obviously trying to grow the service, 
producing and launching new content, and that experience allows me to 
bring those lessons back to the work that we do in
 
products. So, I'm looking 
forward to putting more investment and how we support content. How do we 
invest in technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the team 
that the work that Ted's team is doing. producing great content and scale. 
Also
 
to change the product experience that we have to do a better job at 
promoting content that has little built in awareness, so we can sell those 
new original series and films more effectively. But then also to continue to 
evolve the product experience that 
we have today to be effective at meeting 
the needs of the next 100 million, 200 million members, so it can be as 
compelling as it is for the 100 million members we have today.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I think we will talk through some of that as we get deeper into 
the Q&A. And 
Spencer, when combining the last question between Ted and you, on 
Millarworld, first company acquisition ever, can you discuss the strategy and 
how we should measure ROI on that field?
 
Spencer Wang
 
Sure, Doug. With respect to Millarworld a cou
ple of things to highlight for 
you. The first is I think you can tell from our track record we 
--
 
this is the 


e remain 

but rather looking opportunistically at intellectual property and other content 
assets that can help enhance our content library and also accelerate our 
growth. So overall,
 
I think you should expect us to be selective, but 
opportunistic as it pertains to M&A.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I would say Mark and Millarworld had incredible concentration of 
original projects that we were already kind of circling on the TV side and on 
the fea
ture side. And so we just we were 
--
 
to had us look deeper into the 
track record of original content creation and the roles they played in creating 
really iconic films 
--
 
that we think we can continue to build on, so we are 
excited about it.
 
Doug Mitchelso
n
 
Do you see a series of other acquisitions that have similar characteristics?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Obviously we're looking at a lot of things, so 
--
 
when there can be these kind 

one to 
explore that.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And 
--
 
so I wanted to switch to the third quarter a little bit more and I think 
David this one might be for you, but perhaps Ted as well, it was a relatively 
content like quarter not that a lot of content was released, but whe
n you 
compare it to the third quarter of last year it looked a little bit lighter in 
terms of important original exclusives. Yet the results were very strong 
again. I know, in the second quarter you talked about some uncertainty as 
to how much was driven b
y content versus just growth in the overall 
streaming marketplace. So it seems the third quarter the answer is really 
--
 
it's the streaming marketplace. Am I reading that right?
 
David Wells
 

quarter
-
after
-
quarter that 
the base force that really is the strongest force is the continued adoption of 
Internet TV and entertainment and that tends to drive the lion share of our 
net additions. When we try to explain the quarter
-
to
-
quarter perturbations
 
or some of the lumpiness in our net additions, we tend to use explanations 
that sort of focus on the incremental, which could be content slate or 
particular title that had some notable strength. But I think, in general, it is 
the continued adoption of Int
ernet entertainment that is driving our growth 
and it's really helped more and more by the increasing strength of our 
content slate, notably our global originals are helping drive that. And you 
saw that show up in the second quarter with all of the growth 
that we saw 
on the international line over and above what we thought we might do, but 
that was continued momentum carry forward from the second quarter as 
well.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
It's interesting, because I think we've been wondering, for a while in the last
 

titles that we're surprised that perhaps pulled forward growth, whereas 

carryover from strengths in previous quarter
s, and as you said it might level 
out from year
-
to
-
year. So do you think we are hitting that critical mass of 
content? And if so, how do you forecast the fourth quarter? It's a strong 
content slate year
-
to
-
year in our view and Ted might follow up with that
 
just 
to see if you agrees or disagrees? Do you no longer sort of use new big 
original content like Stranger Things to as a driver of your forecast?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think it's 
--
 
you are pointing out that it is hard, right. As we continue 
to grow the l
arge background force again is the adoption of Internet 
entertainment, but when we try to explain quarter
-
to
-
quarter changes, it 
becomes a little bit harder and it's hard even for our own team to ascribe 
certain incremental growth and we do the best that w
e can. But it is of note 
that this year in particular will be sort of the flattest growth that we seen 

content releases, number of releases paired with a seasonal pattern paired 
with ve
ry strong adoption globally and growing global adoption of Internet 
entertainment, and you get to a little bit of a hard pattern to discern. But we 
are just pleased that this year's growth if you back away from the quarters 
and you look at just the four qu
arters, this year we're growing nearly to 22 
million global net additions off 
--
 
up from 19 million and that was up from 
prior
-
year. So, in general, the background trend is just increasing growth 
and increasing adoption. And then Ted over to you for the co
ntent 
comments.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I mean, I think it might be just a reflection of the steady drumbeat of high
-
quality content that people are watching, that are not necessarily all 
concentrated in the same pockets. There are three different films that 
released
 
this quarter that if viewing was buying a movie ticket would be 
sizable successes in Death Note, Naked, and To The Bone. So 
--
 
and 
probably very little audience crossover between them. And so that's kind of 
the benefit I think of the steady output of grea
t new original programming 
coming nearly every day on Netflix.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And then David last question in this wire questioning. When you think about 
the fourth quarter guidance, can you just discuss for investors what swing 
factors you do see in ther
e? Obviously, there might be price increase churn, 
you do have some big content like Stranger Things too coming, though. 
What were the factors that were driving the guidance for the fourth quarter?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. I mean, so one primary factor is just th
e pricings we had 
--
 
again, we 
had un
-
grandfathering last year. We got price this year, we have great 
content coming with Stranger Things too, Crown too and more that Ted will 
talk about, but some big strong content releases. And we have just the sort 
of p
erturbations that we seen. Last year was the largest quarter we ever 
had, so we are comping off the largest Q4 we've ever had. And this is our 

next 90 days.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
So why
 

discuss the pricing strategy broadly and then I will have some follow
-
ups.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, prices are relative to value. We're continuing to increase the content 
offering and we're seeing 
that reflected in viewing around the world. So we 
try to maintain that feeling that consumers have that were a great value in 
terms of the amount of the content we have relative to the prices. And of 

 
in the euro 

value
-
oriented in standard F, super
-
premium is great stuff in the 4K. And I 
definitely I was watching Mindhunter last night on my Dolby Vision 4K TV, 
and if you haven't 
tried it yet you really got to try this HDR TV, it is just 
unbelievable how beautiful the picture looks.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
David, anything on your end in terms of why now anything that this 
suggests in terms of the piece of content spend, particularly on the
 
cash 

far a lot of the price increases have been really hitting the big and perhaps 
more mature markets or at least the more developed countries. Is that 
right? Is that the strateg
y to take up price in developed countries because 
the emerging markets are revenue driven through self growth?
 
David Wells
 


vestors have 
sort of criticized us in the past for being underpriced and I think for us we 
want to make sure that we do this commensurate with value like Reed said. 
And as we take up the content library value as we're doing more global 
originals that peopl
e have exclusively and only on Netflix, there's a great 
association of that value and we think that we can grow that that value and 

going to take the spending up next year [techn
ical difficulty] member growth 
and partially from the opportunity.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

correlation between our intent to grow content and to grow content 
spending, and the price increa
ses. I mean, this has been planned for a long 


over time and we're taking the content up with that as well.
 
David W
ells
 
I think 
--
 

next quarter we are going to release new seasons of established great shows 
like Stranger Things and the Crown, but this 
--
 
and most recently might 
--
 
we released new Seas
on 1, the brand new shows like Atypical, like Big 
Mouth, like Mindhunter that Reed had mentioned already, and like Ozark 
that I think are 
--
 
its a steady drumbeat again of the next show you can live 
without and the new season of that show that we have to k
eep going and 
keep building on.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And just to make sure we address that in terms of taking up price in 
developed markets versus undeveloped markets, is that right or we just 
really seen the price increases in the developed market so far and i
t's sort of 
more of a global strategy?
 
David Wells
 

price earlier in the year in Brazil, in other parts of Latin America. So I don't 
think you can cleanly sort of divide it. It is tru
e that we may not chose to 


--
 
chose to launch global with sort of an all at once and a global library and 
we're specifically increasing the engagement in the library quality in many of 
those markets, if not all. But we may chose in those markets that 
--
 
to make 
the decision that we haven't grown value fast enough, and to be honest 
lower track with pricing in t
hose markets.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The last question on the price increase is taking the higher tier of $2 and a 
question I get asked a lot is whether password sharing is an issue. How high 
is it on the priority list for the company? Is the reflection of the 
higher tiers 
went up $2, or the middle tiers going up a $1 and the lower tier 0, is that 
you're making password sharing more expensive?
 
David Wells
 
Greg, you want to take that?
 
Greg Peters
 
Sure. I think 
--
 
with regard to the priority, password sharing isn'
t a huge 
issue for us right now. So it's not a huge priority to go try and take 
significant measures to try and stem it, we think that a broader spread in 
pricing better reflects the value that we're delivering in the higher tiers, the 
4K, the HDR, the awe
someness that Reed mentioned in Mindhunter, and so 

that value.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

start asking you abo
ut all the competitors trying to win over shows that you 
might want. Just any update on your content slate how the development 

quarter, but do you see a strong first half '18 comi
ng?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, definitely. And we're really excited, we will wrap up this year with our 
biggest original film project Bright, which is Will Smith starring with Joel 
Edgerton and directed by David Ayer's. And it's a big budget event movie 
that I thin
k people will start seeing the potential for this original movie 
initiative that it can be done on the big 
--
 
on the enormous scale that we 

ramping up our local language original prod
uction, so you're seeing new 
series in local languages just recently in Italy, upcoming in Germany with 

And they could 
--
 
those shows are continuing to travel outside, which is 
really
 
exciting for us that those shows we can put more production scale 
behind them, because they're being watched in markets much larger than 
just a country of origin. That on top of our kind of steady drumbeat of new 
original series that is yes you are correc

competitive marketplace, but we've been really happy with our results in 
that competitive marketplace.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Any concerns around access to content, particularly, with Hollywood? Of 
course, the big new sense you reporte
d last is Disney going direct
-
to
-
consumer and going back on the Pay 1 window with you here in the United 
States and Canada, but also having the Disney channel content in there I 
think Bog Iger said he's going in hot in terms of his OTT launch in a couple 
o
f years on that Disney service. Any concerns that not only the Disney 
content going away could have an impact on Netflix and its valued 
subscribers, but also that other traditional media companies might follow 
suit?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
So I think everyone is goin
g to have their own strategies and it's exciting 
that everyone is trying to make over
-
the
-
top television better and better. I 
think that is good for all of us and we just have to focus on creating content 
that our members can't live without and get excited
 
about it every month. 
So that's really the 
--
 
and not get too distracted by the competitive 
landscape around us and whether or not one of our partners decide to 

make based on t
heir own business. And we're thrilled that more people are 
doing it, because I think it's great for the 
--
 
for innovation. I think it's great 
for consumers to have a lot of choice, and that we just have to be the best 
choice out there. I think that's not d
ifferent. The environment isn't a lot 
different than it is in the television world where Fox produces for ABC and 
NBC produces for Fox. And 
--
 
so I think that those choices being made on a 
case
-
by
-

ve 
long
-
term agreements with all these players that shows that we have our 
run off series. So if somebody chooses not to renew a deal here and there, 
the series that are successful on Netflix right out as long as they exist in that 
second window. By an int
eresting way of example something like Walking 
Dead that the deal with AMC expired two years ago and Walking Dead 
continues to be a successful show in Netflix and will as long as the show is 
being produced.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And just to quantify, Doug, what Te
d was saying, our commitments at the 
end of the quarter were $17 billion over the next years, so that helps sort of 
put another sort of level of quantification for you on that, and we also have 
the benefit of our growing library of produced content, of whi
ch the net book 
value at the end of the quarter was about $2.5 billion.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And just one more thing to add would be we are 
--
 
included in all these 
transitions are we are coproducing content with CBS all access by way of 
example with the Star Trek
 
series, the Star Trek: Discovery. So it's a rapidly 
changing environment for sure.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And, Doug, Disney is a great brand with great content, but internationally 
we have it only in the Netherlands, Australia, and Canada and you saw how 
big our i
nternational growth was in most of the world without the Disney 
content. So, although it's got an enormously significant brand in terms of its 
significance relative to growth, you can see that we've done very well in 
international without it.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I think that it's an interesting dynamic because increasingly the license 
content seems to be going to either Hulu or you have a Disney situation with 
OTT, so I think 
investors are struggling with Netflix as you look farther and 
farther down the road, that major U.S media companies might be licensing 
less and less to Netflix, but you have a strategy of more and more original 
content. And I'm curious how do you sort of d
erive the confidence that your 
ramping original exclusives on Netflix will offset any loss of licensing content 
in the future?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

I said we have these long
-
term agr
eements and those deals kind of run out 
as we're ramping up. And that has been pretty 
--
 
a pretty smooth transition 
to date. I think that the 
--
 
in those partnerships, where there's still a lot of 

evaluating is 
something like Riverdale where having Riverdale on Netflix in the second 
window meant an enormous audience growth for it in Season 2. In fact, 
400% audience increase on CW from Season 1 to Season 2, and the only 
thing different from that in T
his Is Us is Riverdale was on Netflix. So I think 
people have to look at that and look at those trade
-
offs in value and to see 
when does the partnership become too competitive and make those 
decisions when the threat of the competition outweighs the value 
of the 
partnership.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And, Ted, how big was the increase in This Is Us season and season given 
that it was on Hulu for back season?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

but not 
--
 
nowhere 
near 400%.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I think Jeff Bezos has said that he's looking for the next Game of Thrones. 
Any sense that perhaps Amazon is shifting programming strategy and that 
would have any impact on Netflix at all?
 
Reed Hastings
 
So as Richard Plepler look

 
Doug Mitchelson
 

going on at Amazon, it is an interesting sort of lesson that you can't just 

me success 

investors, but I would be interested if you could sort of discuss what you're 
doing and how its sustainable in terms of continuing to create high
-
quality 
content when oth
ers are struggling?
 
Spencer Wang
 
I think it's an extension of our employee and corporate culture around 
freedom of responsibility. It attracts the best and brightest. And I think 

fro
m their friends, they've seen it from their peers, that they have been able 
to come into the best work of their lives. And that is a bit 
--
 
seems to be 
quite repeatable. So we keep building on that by giving the resources for a 
content creator to come and 
have a great professional experience. And that 
is something that we keep betting on where I think other people want to try 
to replicate the heavy handedness of the network model that we've avoided 
so successfully.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
For Reed and Ted, Wall Str
eet Journal reported, I believe, last week that the 
Board of Weinstein was considering selling the company or shutting down its 
business. Does the situation at Weinstein impact Netflix at all and if the 
company was put up for sale given the sort of the mas
sive intellectual 
property and the studio that that resides there, would Netflix be interested?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Particularly interested in acquisition?
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Yes.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

s 
with the Weinstein Company is pretty arms distance and we have a second 
window, the alpha deal on their films, of course theatrical and some second 
window television agreements with them. So it's not material in either way.
 
Reed Hastings
 
It will be extre
mely unlikely for us to be a better for the firm.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Thank you. Let me switch over to Greg. So, Greg, on the product side, can 
you give us what should consumers of Netflix expect in terms of changes 
over the next 
--
 
the short to midterm now th

 
Greg Peters
 
Tons of changes. I think one 
--
 
the ones that I'm most excited about is there 
is a tremendous opportunity I think to morph the product experience to be 
more and more effective at explaining to our members, what's great about 
one
 
of the original shows that Ted's team is making and making that 
connection with this new novel IP, I think there is a huge opportunity to use 
also to new forms of assets, video in surprising ways to make those 
connections.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And what would y
ou say your priority list is right now?
 
Greg Peters
 
Priority list is supporting Ted and his team and making great content at 
increasing scale, changing that consumer experience to do a better job at 
promoting those new series. Its making better use of the 
marketing that we 
do too, so we can actually provide technical support to our marketing team 
to really provide the right message in the right channel, at the right time for 
the right consumers that are targeting and programmatic there as well. Also 
better 
leveraging our partners both for new acquisition and engaging our 
members, and finally making sure again that the product continues to be 
really, really effective at evolving to respond to the new needs of the 
consumers, the next 100 million, 200 million m
embers that we will have, to 
make sure we keep an eye to that shifting global set of use cases and 
requirements.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And, Greg, just add something about Proximus and T
-
Mobile.
 
Greg Peters
 

about is the work that we 
are doing on bundling, we started in Europe with Proximus with SFR/Altice 
and we just launched in the United States T
-
Mobile here and we're very, 
very excited about leveraging our partners to find efficient ways for our 
members to
 
basically care, our new members to be I should say to find out 
about our service and sign up and pay very, very effectively.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And I think to some extend you're touching on mobile access and when 
investors think about addressing Asia, they i
mmediately think to mobile. 
Does the company at this point sort of jump 
--
 
Reed, David, if you have any 
comments? Think about mobile as part of the addressable market as part of 
the TAM or is a focus still broadband and Pay
-
TV households?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I th

--
 
where we are in the cycle, of 
both learning and addressing that market and Reed and David differently, 
but we for sure think that's part of the great global opportunity in terms of 
Internet delivered entertainment
.
 
Reed Hastings
 
David, Wells can tell you that I'm often complaining when we see internal 
metrics would number of broadband households, so it's the Tam. So I think 

will get the ben
efit of the Internet over the next 20 years, and we hope that 
all of them will get to enjoy Netflix also.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And so then, Greg, back to you. How are you making the service work better 
on mobile? Any specifics around how much room there is on e
ncoding and all 
the fun engineering things like that?
 
Greg Peters
 

user acquisition perspectives, the new members but also from a member 
engagement perspective. So, for those members w
ho don't have a smart TV 
at home or maybe want to watch something while there on the go, we want 
to make that a great experience. So as you mentioned, one of the things 
that we are working very hard on is making sure that the encodes that we're 
using are s
uperefficient, so that we can provide a really, really high quality 
video experience with lesser and lesser bits. And to give you an example one 
data point as to how low we've gotten this. You take something like anime, 
which is superefficient from a codin
g perspective. We can now provide an 
amazing quality 
--
 
video quality experience on mobile for anime titles at 150 
kilobits per second, which is practically unheard of previously. So we're 
super excited about pushing those numbers down and making that mobi
le 
experience is great as we can.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Since we brought up T
-
Mobile there's a lot of investor questions about the 
new distribution deal here in the United States with T
-
Mobile. If you could 
walk through the deal at all, again a bit of a jump at 
all, again a bit of jump 
all, but I think perhaps David and Spencer more on your court, and how are 
you going to measure ROI and the benefits of that relationship?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. So I can jump in and David can fill out, but to sort of pull it back a 
l
ittle bit, Doug, our partnerships ultimately what we're trying to do is making 
Netflix easier for customers to sign up for and to access and to enjoy. So the 
T
-
Mobile partnership is an extension of that. Beyond that the economic 
arrangements we generally d

BD partnerships. There are marketing components and marketing benefits 
that we share. To the extend from a financial reporting perspective, those 
marketing costs are in our marketing expense line. To the ext
ent that there 
is a billing relationship and the partner builds on our behalf. Those can 
processing costs are in our cost of revenues alongside our other payment 
processing expenses. And, Spencer, if I've forgotten the download of film 


front?
 
Spencer Wang
 
It's getting better, Reed. So we are partnering with airlines and we just 
recently announced at the Apex conference at the end of September that we 
will be leveraging all the great 
work that Greg's team has done where there 
is more efficient encodes and in early 2018 we will be opening those up to 
Airlines that partner with us. So that we can help them more efficiently use 
bandwidth in
-
flight and in that case we hope that airlines wi
ll begin to 
somewhat support and promote in
-
flight streaming which we think is a 
benefit for our mutual customers. It will hopefully delight passengers as they 
fly an experience on Netflix. And we think it's good for our brand and 
generally more engagement
 
is good from attention from Netflix.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
So what does the company have to do in the markets where it's still early
-
stage were Netflix penetration is still low beyond just localization and I 
would be curious if David in 2018 you add sort of a p
ercentage of the 
addressable market that might be localized just to give investors some help 
on that end. What is Netflix have to do? Is it local programming from Ted, is 
it Greg continue to work on encoding and more efficient bit rates? Is it just 
waiting
 
for the markets to develop?
 
David Wells
 
We are certainly not waiting for anything, Doug. We are aggressively moving 
on all those fronts of better streaming on the tech side, more relevant 
content. But, again, if you have been an investor in Netflix for a 
number 
years, you remember our launch in Latin America and how we built out state 
focused on Mexico and Brazil and we're doing the same thing in Asia. So we 

which content, how to ge
t that developed, we're working on. But again the 
partnership model we've got that in every nation around the world, so I 
think we are making really good progress. It just going to take some time to 
iterate on the content as we did in Latin America five ye
ars ago.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Before I leave the product discussion, I did want to get in one more with 
Greg on AWS. Are you whetted to that platform? I think Google and 
Microsoft are trying to make strides?
 
Greg Peters
 
I would just say that AWS has been a grea
t partner for us and we really 
have enjoyed using their infrastructure.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The 
--
 
thank you for the enlightenment. David, switching over to you, just 
on some of the key financial metrics, again just to reaffirm our earlier 
discussion any 
change to the outlook across margins, 40% by in the not
-
too
-
distant future, free cash flow, anything that you would like to update?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think, one thing that of note is that 40% U.S contribution margin was 
our useful target, say a year to t
wo years ago as we grew out U.S 
profitability and landed international losses. You fast
-
forward to that and we 
sort of approach that target three years early, we were able to turn 
international profitable which will stay profitable on a consolidated basis 
going forward. So we switch to global operating margin and we really are 
optimizing the business around global operating margin. So you'll see us 
shift some spending back and forth notably marketing. I think I've indicated 
in the past that U.S marketing ha
s gone up on an absolute basis. As we see 
the benefits and we test around some of the more benefits of promoting our 
original content, I think you'll see that increase again in '18, and so we really 
are focused around growing operating margin. We're 7% thi
s year, well on 
track and guiding to be on track for that, and continued growth forward and 
we will specify that in January. But we are able to grow from 4% to 7% this 
past year to give you some indication of that growth.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Do you have a sens
e as of now what the 2018 working capital burden might 
be for building out your original content slate? I think you got about $3 
billion or so a year of revenue growth, Ted likes to spend an incremental 
billion at least in terms of amortization hitting the
 
income statement it 
seems each year, and that gives investors $2 billion to play with and you 
obviously have other OpEx, but the big plot that 
--
 
the big 
--
 
the number 
that we have trouble calculating, of course is that working capital burden. Do 
you know
 
at this point what the 
--
 
do you have a line of sight on that?
 
David Wells
 
Yes, I mean, we obviously have a much better idea given that we're three 
months away or two months away, 2.5 from next year. I would say without 
sort of backing us into a corner of
 
giving you a specific number for next 
year, we are going to spend $7 billion to $8 billion on a P&L basis on 
content. And in the past the markup or the working capital ratio markup on 
content cash to P&L has been somewhere in that 1.4 to 1.5 range. This y
ear 
it will be about 1.5. We really do enjoy the benefits of owned productions, 
and you are seeing us move more and more of our mix, our content mix to 
owned productions. So I think that 1.5 becomes around 1.55 again on 
average. So there is a lot of lumpin
ess in these numbers as things to shift 
around from quarter
-
to
-
quarter, but we know it's going to be higher and the 
$7 billion to $8 billion in content spend with a little bit of a markup in the 
ratio, the offset there is operating profit growth, but you g
uys run your 
models and I think that's giving you enough direction in terms of getting 
towards directionally where working capital and free cash flow goes next 
year.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The 
--
 
and the two dynamics you had in place is approaching about 50% 
orig
inal content by 2020 and to the extent the company grows faster than 
expected the content spending might also increase or those still in play?
 
David Wells
 
They are and I will just say to socialize that 50% or provide a little bit more 
context around it is 
becoming increasingly sort of 
--
 
to a Netflix subscriber 
when they see a Netflix brand on the piece of content that feels like an 
original. To us, we have sort of different sub classifications whether we own 
it and made it or we licensed it. At the end of 
the day to the consumer 
what's important is that it's exclusive and only on Netflix. But I would say 
that 50% number that we've talked about in the past that could be higher in 
the future you know as we accelerate more and more content development 
and as w

you have something different.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 

 
naturally makes me wonder what you're going to spend it on? Any update on 
sort of two categories. One, international. How that's doing in terms of 

percentage of budget are we talking a
bout now or in a few years, then 
similarly for movies?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, I'd say on the international originals, we enjoy a lot of production 
efficiencies in producing outside of the United States. So we can produce in 
higher volume and bring kind of high
er and higher production standards to 


and original anime projects in various states of production these 
days, so 
just kind of give you some sense of the scale and in the series work that 
we're doing is in the case of Italy is not a 
--
 
just a Suburra, it's not just a 

like Narcos, l
ike the House of Cards, like a big Global Original, just happens 
to be in Italian. So we're producing at larger and larger scale outside the 
United States, inside the United States, and the movie side we are going to 
-
-
 
we 
--
 
this past quarter we released 
8 original films. We plan on about 80 
coming up next year and they range anywhere from the million
-
dollar 
Sundance hit, all the way up to something on a much larger scale, like we 
are seeing on Bright, at the end of this year and Irishman that's a in 
produ
ction right now with Martin Scorsese that should be in early '19.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And that leads me to wonder about cost of content because you are scaling 
up the number of hours, the number of titles, at the same time we keep 
hearing about inflation certa
inly for the best content in Hollywood. Any sort 
of comments on the Shonda Rhimes deals specifically but more broadly is 
content cost inflation something that could become an issue for Netflix at 
some point?
 
David Wells
 


to a lot of professional sports where it gets very competitive for the handful 
of those superstar
s, but overall player personnel costs are pretty 
predictable. And I think this case it's been those big unicorn shows, the price 
of any one of them might go up in a more competitive market, but general 
content costs are quite predictable. So and we're like
 
and the thing about 
Shonda Rhimes as you mentioned earlier is creating a place where she 
wants to create, where she knows that she could spread her wings a little 
wider, where she can get outside of the network box a little bit, had a lot 
more to do with 
her attractiveness to Netflix than we just had to outbid ABC. 
And I so I 
--
 
as we continue to attract world
-
class talent like that, that will 
also attract more world class talents like that.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Doug, [technical difficulty] I would say from a
n investment perspective, 
hopefully what gives investors confidence is in terms of our ability to 
manage content cost inflation is if you look at the long
-
term trend in our 

we made 

profit improvement and the margin improvement over the years.
 
David Wells
 

the last three years or at least the s
peculation of it, so what Spencer said.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The 
--
 
one thing I find interesting sort of switching over to sports rights for a 
moment, was a question for Reed. So, I think I sort of know what the 
answer is going to be upfront, but I still wanted
 
to position the question. So 
I want it 
--
 
I was hoping you would engage on it and that is that you just 
had Facebook bid $0.5 billion for multiyear digital rights for the IPL in India. 
Obviously, Amazon is on the air right now with Thursday Night Football
 
here 
in the United States. I think this in anticipation by investors that there will 
be more and more bidding by video platforms on sports rights. And of course 
we all know that Netflix has indicated in the past that its sort of not right for 
you, but it 
reminds me a little bit of when you were switching from DVDs to 
streaming that you really sort of waited back not obviously so much in the 
weeds, but for the marketplace to evolve to the point where it was the right 

 
to understand just what the trigger 
points are for Netflix as it looks longer term at sports content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I have to see over the next 10 years, Doug, what those trigger points 
might be hypothetically at some point in the 
near
-
term. We have so much 
going on in the global expansion of movies, unscripted, series, 
documentaries, we're just running a 100 miles an hour doing our thing 
around the world. And so nothing to really talk about that's interesting in the 
near
-
term.
 
Doug
 
Mitchelson
 
The other question that we end up asking a lot, but we still want to do it, 
Amazon is likely to launch some sort of ad product in the first half of next 

-
roll or post
-
roll or banners or sponsorships or 
what hav

given that you have emerging markets that perhaps require a lower price 
points than the developed world. Any updated thoughts on pursuing 
advertising at some point?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You k
now often the right strategy for a challenger brand which is Amazon in 
the case of streaming video is to try many things, because they're not sure, 
just copying Netflix is not going to typically get someone very far. The 
leaders role is to really as the fa
mous phrases to keep the main thing the 
main thing. And so our focus is not expanding in new ads at all. Our focus is 
on doing even better content, getting better partnerships, better mobile 
streaming. We just have to have the discipline to keep doing what
 
we're 
doing at many times the scale, and if we do that things will work out really 
well for our global customer base and thus for our investors. And Doug, I 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The 
--
well, it was interesting because I h
ad two that I was going to go with, 

And one was, I was curious, I think the investors are really focusing on 
competition and access to content these days as the market really evolves
. 
And so one was, I was sort of curious if you would wrap up with the 
sustainable competitive advantages for Netflix. And I think, separately I was 
going to ask a regulation question Reed and that is that when you look at 
sort of content overseas and local
 
quotas when you think about what some 
of your peers are going through around scale issues, is there anything on 
the regulatory side regarding those two specific issues that Netflix is focused 
on right now?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Doug, very good about staying
 
in character. We've all got our Stranger 
Things sweaters on because we're celebrating both the amazing content 
that's coming in 10 days or so, and also targets a great promotional 

di
splays and amazing materials out at target. And Ted, do you want to tell 
us a little bit about Stranger Things?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, October 27 we will be releasing the new Season of Stranger Things, 
that gives you 
--
 
answers the question how are you spendin
g your 
Halloween. And if you 
--
 
you too can get one of these ugly sweaters from 
Target for your next Christmas ugly sweater party, but it really celebrates 
the spirit of the show in a great way and we are 
--
 
we can't wait for this 
show to come out, which i
s not only an enormous hit in the United States, 
but it is equally international across with our membership base. So we are 
thrilled for Stranger Things coming this month.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And, Greg, what are we doing on product to support Stranger Things?
 
Greg Peters
 
We are doing an amazing job of taking over big parts to the site to basically 
connect our members with this great show and show off how incredible 
content it is. And Doug to answer your question on scale, I'm sure others are 
figuring things out
. What we're continuing to do is work with Amazon as well 
as investing in open connect and being able to handle all of the growth that 
we anticipate. And we've had a pretty good track record of that for the last 

ticularly.

something a little different and have one interviewer just for a little bit more 
continuity. Then I think Doug will have our first question being our only 
interviewer.
 
Before we get started, we will be making forward
-
looking statements, so 
actual results m
ay vary.
 
Doug, over to you for our first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Thanks so much, David. I wanted to start simply by asking if there is 
anything notable in the quarter? For you, Reed, you talked about Netflix 
being a 

share with us from the past three months?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I mean anything notable beyond 5 million net adds in Q2; all
-
time record for 
Q2s, up sequentially from Q1,do you mean notable beyond tha
t. I think 

quality of the service are paying off.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

this quarter, and one of first things th


update you can give us on thoughts around how content influenced the 
quarter?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I think it was the combination of a lot of great things. 13 Rea
sons Why, 
started right at the end of the quarter, rolled into some of our biggest 
content brands; new seasons of House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black; 
ending the quarter with Okja. So just I think it was the combination of a lot 
of different things, ki
nd of a reinforcement that as long as we are 
programming to a wide variety of tastes and keep the quality level high that 
we can turn some success off of that.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And I think congratulations on all the Emmy nominations to the company 
and to yo
u specifically, Ted [indiscernible].
 
Ted Sarandos
 



hat attaches to that 
stuff too, but 91 nominations is an all
-

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Continuing on the letter a little bit, David, for you. You note that our 3Q 
guidance assumes much of your Q2 momentum will continue. You say
 

cognizant of the lessons in the prior quarters where you forecasted 
lumpiness in net adds. So should we take this to mean that the third quarter 

 
David Wells
 
Well, I think back to your earlier questio
n about what lessons into the last 
90 days have held for us and one of them is our business is a little bit tough 
to predict given the success of content and the popularity of content. We still 
think the major driver is adoption of Internet television. But
 
on top of that 


an effect like they did in the second quarter. So I think you can take that 
line to mea
n that our forward guidance assumes continued good trends and 


was pulled forward by a great content slate. In
 
this case, in the second 
quarter we had a really strong content slate.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And continuing on with you, David, at some point ahead of expectations 
when you talked in the letter about margins being on track for full year 7%, 
would that suggest t
hat with subs, and therefore likely the revenue coming 

margin target?
 
David Wells
 
Yes. So we had a 9% margin in the first quarter and we had a lot of content 
come on in this quarter, so
 
we got it down to 5%. So on the first six months, 


business sort of any over forecasted growth that we have 
on the top line.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And David, one more for you. You call un
-
grandfathering impact in the 
fourth quarter, I think you had some price increase sort of 

 
perhaps that 
was back in Q2, and I am un
-
grandfathering again in 4Q, is there any sizing 
yo
u can give investors around the pricing strategy issues that impacted, 
specifically specifically 3Q, but the year as well if you're 
--
??
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think last year what we found was because of the PR and the news 
around the price change in the 

or un
-
grandfathering until the third and fourth quarter, we had a real 

quarter we saw effects on both acquisition or retention. We do know
 
that the 


impact on the business from last year.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

based on the results you just 
reported, you did well anywhere, but particularly it looks like Europe is really 
getting critical mass, and every country in Europe is different. So I thought 

ularly I 
think Germany is sort of a tough market for the U.S. companies, consumers 


a competitive dy
namic. Based it looks 

 
based on our tracking, you are 
actually surpassing Amazon, at least with app downloads if not subs, is that 
--
 
are you at the point where you are taking the leadership in Germany 

 


right that has caused that market to be able to develop?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Doug, Amazon is super successful around the world if you look at U.S. with 

wouldn



service better and better. In particular,
 




s Brazil or 
Argentina or Japan, Singapore, or Germany, Internet TV is really catching on 
for us, for YouTube, for others.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

years ago, and I think when you launched, yo
u grew parallel to Latin 


those parallels still hold, and can we look forward to the Europe where there 
is 
fits and starts in terms of progress? but if you really hit the point where 
you reach escape velocity, do you think those markets to be strong markets 
going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think all throughout the West; so Latin America, North America, and 





market by market. But Asia is very unique and very large. So we see a huge 
opportunity for us over the next couple of years, all of us spending more 
time there and investing more.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Reed, continuing along that 
line because Asia is so diverse and and you think 

do you prioritize your investments in Asia?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We look at market size, we look at growth of Internet, kind of all the 
factors 


this quarter with Okja. And maybe, Ted, you want to describe a little bit on 
that.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes,
 
Okja is directed by Bong Joon
-
Ho who is the most celebrated director in 
Korea and is a huge star and an attraction in and of himself, but also the 
movie itself is one of the most ambitious productions in history of Korea. His 
films tend to travel around t
he world pretty well. It made a ton of noise at 
the Cannes Film Festival. It was the most talked about film at the festival. 
So it helped in attracting new subscribers also, but it also brings a brand 

th paying for. And I think 
we saw some of that benefit throughout Europe and in pockets of Asia where 
we saw big sign
-

learned about Netflix for the first time when Okja was coming out in Korea. 
So relativ

a great introduction to Netflix for a lot of the world.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And so in carrying that forward that Reed just mentioned, more local content 
particularly in 
--
?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes,
 
and even more so Doug, think about local content for global audiences. 
So the idea 

 


millions all around the world.
 
Doug Mitc
helson
 

target overseas, the size of the team and is there capacity growth, is there 
growth in percentage of budget being allocated to 
--
?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, as Reed mentioned, mat
ching the program into local taste is really the 

into Europe. And as we look to Asia, we have to get better and better 
matching those tastes. And those tastes are not as easily ali
gned with 



outside of the 
U.S. as we continue to grow for local audiences in Asia and 
throughout the rest of Europe.
 
Reed Hastings
 


teams



prioritize? Generally, when we see 
success, we try to add on to that until we 

some markets, we may up the content budget in those markets.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
It all makes sense. Reed, over to you, since I think we a
re on Asia, if you 


efforts that you have underway, and if you could talk about the 
--
?
 
Reed Hastings
 

markets like the U.S. and Europe and then throughout Latin America, and 
now and Asia. And all of the Netflix service works extremely well on mobile.

Doug Mitchelson
 
Can you hear me now?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Barely. You may need to shout.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
So for Reed or David, as you consider emerging markets again broadly, is 
there a capacity to mass market the product without having the need 
to 
lower price point?
 
Reed Hastings
 



cou

oriented elites. And 
then as we grow into that, we can think about expanding beyond that.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Ted, back over to you. At the beginning of the year, you talked about having 
a strong second half co
ntent slate. Do you feel that the content slate is 
settling now to where you thought, and and there is a strong second half 
--
?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Is there any way you can see what the 
--
?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
in terms of our 
content releases. Starting as early as next week, we have a great show 

then in August, we have the release of Death Note, a great new film that 

el at Comic
-
Con this next. And also in August, The 

Defenders; Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Iron Fist for an 
incredible season that people are really excited about. And of cour
se 
throughout the year, we have things that will lead up to Bright at the end of 
the year which is a huge film with Will Smith that will be only available on 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Ted, what do you think Reed 
means when he says he wants you to be able 
to cancel more shows?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Look, I think I mentioned before that in this universe we look at a lot of 


gh. So when we have a good hit rate and even 
with the recent cancelations, 93% of our shows have been renewed. So you 
want to be introspective and look at that and say, are we being adventurous 

ou think of 
things 

 
when you have a very high hit ratio, you definitely want to keep 
second guessing yourself even though you do.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
David, when we think about potential for more and more original shows 
being produced, therefore, likely 
more and more cancelations over time, any 
impact on the financials that we should think about? And separately and 


 
out 
consistent with the amortization schedule that you have in place?
 
Ted Sarandos
 




network television about two
-
thirds 

 
about a third of the content gets cut in 


ause we can more efficiently build 
it and not a 100% of the time. So we want to launch shows. We love when 


t 
for future fans of new shows.
 
David Wells
 
Doug, just to take the sort of accounting oriented part of that question, I 

Every quarter, we look at the trends. Many of these shows, even
 

not picked up for a renewal, they may have a story arc that completes the 
narrative. And so, it really is for us is about the sort of continuity of viewing 
over the life of the show. So even if some of that viewing is concentrated as 
our amorti
zation methodology reflects upfront in the sort of first release, the 
first month of release of that content on the site, it may have sort of steady 


ally concentrated, then yes sure we would have to 
reflect that. But many of the non renewals get wrapped up. Bloodline is an 


ll see us try to 
wrap the narratives on these.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And I have some questions on content. I wanted to set it up Reed with a 

HBO, and that implies Netflix is a TV network. 
I think even the letter this 
quarter, it talked about that, TV network [indiscernible] At the same time, 
you've expanded to the unscripted movies, original TV, and is Netflix instead 
more of a Comcast
-
type version of Internet TV or should we think about it
 
as 
an Internet
-
TV network?
 
Reed Hastings
 

content desires and needs across the board, as you mentioned unscripted, 
but also kids and films. This year, the Emmy is just as an example
. We have 
five different series nominated for Best Comedy or Drama. We also have two 
documentary series nominated for Best Documentary Series, two 
documentary films nominated for Best Documentary Films. We won 10 
daytime Emmys for our kids programming. So 
we are doing across the board 
programming, not programming for one niche which networks tend to do.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And then for Reed, just a question on content spending, how do you decide 
how much you allow [indiscernible] 

 
how do we measure sort of agg
regate 
value the customers want any one piece of content becoming less and less 
important as you grow your body of original content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, every piece of content that we do is important, and we try to have that 
content flourish around the wor
ld, but in terms of the overall investment 



mall player 

long way to go to have more and more content to please more and more 
members and continue to grow. And what you see us doing as we grow is 
also improving our margins, so 

opposed to spending every dollar in the content. But we are growing the 
content budget significantly also because of the opportunity that we see.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Ted, back to you in terms of strategy for how you

When you think about the fact that Netflix now can self produce titles, you 
can license exclusive originals from Hollywood Studios, you can license third
-
party 

 
you can license reruns, where do you see the race will turn at this 
poi
nt in time, and how do you see others responding to your strategy of self 
producing a few shows?
 
Ted Sarandos
 


re 
really important in terms of being able to control our destiny, when we can 
make shows available, and what formats to make them available. And 


creen and make better shows when we 
produce it ourselves. So a show like Stranger Things, when it becomes a big 

brands as we continue to invest in them. But at the same time we want t
o 
lean on putting the best programming possible on the air. So not being 
dogmatic about which shows we pick depending on their business model but 
being really careful about picking shows that are great regardless of their 

do a lot more of self producing whenever 
we can.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

asking this every quarter forever. But any issues on 

 
with your positive 
content for access to the best shows with mo
re and more players, obviously 


well and the Emmys are sort of proof of the quality of content. But on the 
m
argin, do you cost
-
wise, more than you would like, some projects go to 
others that you prefer you have yourself?
 
Ted Sarandos
 


o bid up the cost of the 


So we expect the content cost to go up on the top premium things, but I 
think,
 

 
Reed Hastings
 
And that of course brings in new capacity like you saw Headlines Today that 
Liberty Global and TPG were forming a new television studio to produce 
shows for all this new market. So as th


 
Doug Mitchelson
 
In the letter, it talks pretty exclusively about expanding distribution 

-
per
-
view provi
der, 
bundling in Netflix service and I guess two questions there. Reed, for you 
first. What about the reverse? Do you see Netflix as a platform that can 
bundle other video services and sell that on profit and make a margin. And 
second as part of that, any 
specifics behind the point made in the letter that 
you expect to really expand these efforts?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There are several companies who are selling networks on top of their 

b


proposals for including Netflix and some services and beginning to learn the 
bundling part of the business.
 


that.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

mid
-
single digit being a good 
aspirational point to consider. And when you 
look at the tiers that you have, it seems like the base tier is relatively high in 
place to the middle tier and the upper tier. I wanted to deal with that into 
--
 
are there other ways to differentiate those tier
s to create more value and 
have that be an even bigger part of ASP growth in the future?
 
David Wells
 

repeat that first part.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
So for ASPs, I think in the past you hav
e said that mid
-
single digit growth 

potential.
 
David Wells
 

answer.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And when we thin
k about the tiers that you currently have in place, the 


value to the higher
-
priced tiers to have tierin
g up be an increasing part of 
that ASP growth?
 
David Wells
 

taking the upper tier with just the differentiation of concurrent streams and 

 
we need to add more value. 
We have the flexibility to add more value in terms of that tier differentiation. 

differentiating those tiers on price point a little more in terms of mid
dle and 

in terms of what you outlined. We are lapping the un
-
grandfathering of last 
year, so you are seeing sort of revenue on a year
-
over
-
year basis or ASP on 
a year
-
over
-
year bas
is start to reflect that lapping of a large pool of un
-
grandfathers coming on.

Reed, and you mentioned that the median time spent has been

combination of the user interface, the algorithms, or the personalization and 

see even higher engagement with members now compared to last
 
year and 
the prior years.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
David, I wanted to circle back on churn. You talked about the un
-

understand how churn has evolved over time? And do you see meaningful 
opp
ortunities to improve churn from here and what specifically those 
opportunities might be?
 
David Wells
 
Well, we generally talk about net additions just because of fluidity of 

made 
comments in the past that generally year
-
over

year, churn has 
improved as we improve the service, as we add more content, as 
subscribers age up. But more and more as our word of mouth and as we 
penetrate close to 50% in the U.S. today, those lines are fair
ly indistinct in 
terms of user rejoin or not and somebody may have been a member of the 
service 12, 14, 18 months ago. So I would say in answering the spirit of the 
question, we continue to improve the quality of the service with more 
content, with a bette
r interface, all the things that Reed just talked about in 
terms of driving value to the middle and upper tier to have people chose and 

outside the U.S. as we age, we usually 

 
the pa
ttern there is to improve the 
quality of the library, we better match the taste and that includes both 
Western content for that local audience and a little bit of local content as 
well that Ted talked about earlier, so we expect to improve churn outside th
e 
U.S. as we get better and better in these markets.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

this letter have talked about a 7% margin target this year and modest 
expansion thereafter, care to help invest
ors out at all in terms of 
understanding what that pace of margin expansion might be relatively to 
investment opportunities that you have?
 
David Wells
 

towards October. But we want to
 
balance both growth of the business and 

returns on that content given the growth that we experienced this last 
quarter with sort of a disciplined growth of profit. We also know that you 


with sort of consistent and deliberate growth after that is the right guidance 
for our investors.
 
R
eed Hastings
 
Doug, if you remember last year, we were at 4%. So you might be able to 
apply something there.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Thank you, Reed. I appreciate that. What would be helpful as well sort of 
reading the details a little bit out of David is can 
you frame a margin 
progression in terms of where the leverage comes in the cost structure? Is it 
content side, the marketing side, G&A, tech and dev? Where should we see 
the most leverage in the cost structure over time?
 
David Wells
 
Well, to
-

lly just been about as we expand globally and people 
watch a lot of the same content, Ted talked about the cost pressures in 
terms of as more people pile in at the top end of the market on the unit cost 

ster than that. So 


continue forward for the foreseeable future. We are leveraging marketing. 

 
more on an absolute basis on marketing as we become more 

leveraging there. And G&A and tech and dev has kind of run a little bit in line 
with revenue as we expand internationally and as
 
we become more of a full
-
fledged studio and a bigger, and at
-

terms of adding people, but I do anticipate the ability to leverage some of 
that down the road.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
The cash flow burn is certainly an intere
sting comment, and you mentioned 
it last quarter in the letter, you mentioned it this quarter in the letter. I think 
similar to margins, investors are trying to read between the lines, 
understand how free cash flow burn might progress over the next few yea
rs. 
First, I think 

 
actually for you, Reed, why the comfort level with this level of 
negative free cash flow. And David, any sense you can give investors as to 
carry forward at these elevated levels, does it get better but take a while to 
get to breakeven
, any help would be appreicated?
 
Reed Hastings
 

capital upfront, and then you get a payout over many years. And seeing the 
positive returns on that for the business as a whole is wh
at makes us 
comfortable that we should continue to invest and integrate to basically self 
develop many more properties as Ted can find the appropriate ones. And 

market cap is incr


what makes us very excited. And the irony is the faster that we grow and 
the faster we grow, the owned originals, the mor
e drawn on free cash flow 
that will be. So in some senses that negative free cash flow will be an 
indicator of enormous success.
 
David Wells
 
And then to annotate your second part of your question, like Reed said, this 
is a success scenario in a sense of as
 




t 
verticals. And as we scale faster, as we grow faster globally, that has 
implications. That said, we gave you an indication of around 2 billion this 

think about that as a 10% to 
15%. When you put that in line and compare 
that with our subscriber growth on the top line and you kind of get some 


ws perform 
over time, but if we have a bigger prize and if we see a bigger prize with the 

side.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

, one 
question I get a lot is investments in new movies. I think part of it is, with 

versus one time for film and some could be very expensive as well and with 
the [indiscernible] a
pproach. I think in the letter you talked about you 
believe Internet TV can reinvigorate the film business. So one, talk on your 
film strategy at this point; and two, any thoughts behind the statement in 
the letter would be helpful?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, look




. Some of them work out great. Some of 


bring films to our members when they want them, which is when the world 
is 


our films will be able to attract subscribers and retain subscribers the way 


 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Another question I get I think is just so noticeable is the investment you 

there something behind that strategy in terms of forming also
 
relationships 
with comedians that also might be actors in TV shows, movies, or is it simply 
ROI, so you keep investing more?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

have to pay to get the superstar talent att
ached to them because it gets a 
big audience. They can watch like movies and just think about it that the 
main cost of them is the talent themselves versus the cost of production. 

Ch



with great talent like Aziz A
nsari, like we do with Chelsea across the entire 
platform whenever we can.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

hours a week of viewing on the Netflix platform. Is that 1.1 billion or 1.2 
billion?
 
Ree
d Hastings
 

 
Doug Mitchelson
 
All right. I think I want to wrap up with a couple of questions, first 

on net neutrality. But more 
broadly if you look at the regulatory 
environment globally, particularly in Europe, there appears to be an 
environment that is a challenge for American companies and certainly 

given th
ese challenges?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, first on net neutrality, the recent effort that we participated in 
generated over 3 million additional comments to the FCC demanding that 
the net neutrality rules stay in place bringing the total to over 8 million 
commen
ts. So certainly we, other companies, the public have weighed in 

big investments in local content, local productions, working well with local 
content companies. And so, I think it wi
ll be a really different dynamic or we 
hope so with Netflix than maybe with other firms, because just of the 

other content, Spanish, this quarter and share it around the world and that
 
creates big new markets. So think of us much more as trying to curate some 

being a disruptive tech company.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 

out the shift from linear 
TV to on
-

and you talk about how much video time and how many Internet TV services 

wil
l have to continue to be the leader in this category. So this final question 
is, Reed, how does Netflix sustain and expand its leadership position? 

executing every day?
 
Reed Hastings
 
More watching, less sleep.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And what are you doing and what is Netflix specifically doing to make sure 
that Netflix needs that more watching, less sleep charge?
 
Reed Hastings

4/17/19,Netflix,"Welcome to the Netflix Q3 2015 earnings call. I am David Wells, CFO. 
Joining me today from the company is Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted 
Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.
 
Interviewing us today will be Peter Kafka of Re/code; and Mark Mahaney of 
RBC.
 
Now, today we will be making forward
-
looking statements, so actual results 
may vary.
 
I think I am turning it over to you Mark for our first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks, David. First question has to do with 
domestic streaming market for 
Netflix. Sub numbers for the second September quarter in a row came in 
light, you talked about involuntary churn. Could you give a little bit more 
color around the source of that sub add weakness? Is this a temporary 
problem a
nd then just delay concerns that it could be due to greater 
increased competitive pressure or due to pushback against some of the 
recently disclosed price increases?
 
David Wells
 
Sure, I could take this one Mark. I would say that in terms of additions they 
were pretty strong through the quarter in terms of flat year
-
over
-
year. In 
net additions they were down year
-
over
-
year, and that we explained and 
attributed to our involuntary churn or payments
-
related churn. We think 
partially that was due to the transiti
on to the chip cards, which is still 
ongoing. And we've reflected that trend going forward into Q4 in our 
guidance.
 
We don't think though that it really affects our addressable market size of 60 
million to 90 million. I would say last year we had a little 
bit of concern at 
the same time, when we over
-
forecasted Q3 and we ended up in Q4 
delivering up to 6 million subscribers for that year. We've done about 5 
million to 6 million for the last four years.
 
So I would say our thesis on the addressable market isn
't really changed, 
isn't changed. And in terms of the involuntary churn, we've been improving 
that. It's better year
-
on
-
year, but it has impacted at our levels even on a 
small basis, 10 basis points, 20 basis points.
 
Reed Hastings
 
So next Q3, Mark, you cou
ld be sure that we're definitely going to have low 
guidance in July. So we think it's just the summer part.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And then, Reed, you've added 6 million net subs for the last four years in 
the U.S., at some point you can't sustain that, your level. 
As you look 
forward to next year and what kind of keeps you in that 5 million to 6 million 
range, so just address issues like your confidence that the marketplace will 
accept the price increases. Is it that we should expect a greater amount of 
original con
tent coming up to help keep that sub add level that 5 million to 6 
million. Just address how the consistency of that growth going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
When we look at the last couple of years, where we've been 
--
 
last four 
years, we've been about 6 milli
on net adds in the U.S., and then accelerating 
number of new members internationally. But restricting the comments to the 
U.S., it's fundamentally that internet TV is better than linear TV. The 
consumers can watch when they want, on what type of device the
y want, 
and the content has just got better and better.
 
So the fundamental confidence about the large scale is because on
-
demand 
is a better experience than linear, and the entire market is going to move 
from linear to on
-
demand internet television over th
e next 10 to 20 years. In 
terms of the specific, when we look at the shows that we have coming out 
next year, that gives us a lot of confidence. We have the Disney pay
-
one 
deal coming in the U.S. in the third quarter. Third, fourth quarter next year?
 
Theod
ore Sarandos
 
Fourth of next year.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Fourth quarter next year. And so we got just a tremendous content coming 
in. I am sure there is a lot of competitors, but there always have been. I 
mean we've competed against cable and satellite, and we've c
ompeted 
against YouTube and all kinds of pay
-
per
-
view and DVD. So there is a lot of 
ways to consume entertainment. And despite all of those, Netflix keeps 
growing, because we keep improving. So that's why we feel good about next 
year, both domestic and esp
ecially international.
 
David Wells
 
And then just a narrow point, Mark, on the pricing. I mean, we changed the 
price in the U.S. last Q2. Q3 came in less than expected, but then we 
delivered in Q4, and then substantially Q1, Q2 of this year with a higher 
pr
ice. So I don't think you can ascribe that to a price for the U.S. in terms of 
growth.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Hey, guys, I want to ask an international question. But first, can you just go 
back and explain a little more about the involuntary churn and what it was 
wit
h the credit cards that caused people to be unable to pay? I've got the 
same account number, what happens when my card type changes, it 
prevents me from paying. And what didn't you see that happened in Q3?
 
David Wells
 
Peter, this is David. It's not consist
ently the case that people don't have the 
same account number and some issuers are going to replace that number 
when they issue that. And for us as a recurring merchant, where we really 
want to reduce the friction of renewal and reduce the friction of havi
ng any 
sort of interaction where we have to update your payment method and 
present an opportunity not to do that, it just means that there is more noise 
introduced into that. And we think it's a contributor.
 
Like I said, it's likely 
multifactor. There may be other things going on here, 
but certainly the transition to the chip cards is not helping, and that has to 
be a factor in it. And we're only partially the way through, so the U.S. 
issuers are going to continue that in Q4. They wer
e supposed to be done in 
October, and they're not. They're about a
-
third of the way through. So we'll 
continue to see that in the U.S., as we go along.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And gross additions were above forecast, right?
 
David Wells
 
Correct.
 
Reed Hastings
 
That's 
why we're attributing it to the misforecast, which is quite modest, 
because this is the most accurate forecast we've ever had on an overall 
basis to this slight change, relative to our forecast in the involuntary churn.
 
Peter Kafka
 
And you said the interna
tional numbers came in where you expected, but 
you didn't provide any color on sort of which territories are doing better or 
worse than others. Are there surprises by territory that something do 
particularly well or particularly underperform?
 
Reed Hastings
 
They're all doing really well, but some are bigger than others. But for 
competitive reasons, we don't give per country color. So we are continuing 
to learn in every market and improving every market. Every market is 
growing. But some are doing better than
 
others, which you would expect, 
and that's up to us to manage to get the total portfolio to be as fast growing 
as they are.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
It's Mark again. So Reed let me ask you one question and then Ted a 
question to you. Reed, I know in the last earnings
 
call, I think, you 
cautioned people not to get too robust in the Japan launch. And then also 
argued there or made the comment that Brazil was like a rocket ship. So at 
least could you just update maybe a little commentary on those two 
markets? Our survey 
work indicated that Brazil was in fact a rocket ship, is 
that continuing? And then Japan, should we continue to be mellow in terms 
of modest in terms of the ramp up there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's clearly, clearly undisciplined, my no commentary on countries. So
 
if I 
said it was a rocket ship that has continued. Brazil what we're seeing is this 
with a tough economy, a value
-
based product like Netflix, that's very 
inexpensive is really appreciated. And so even though there's tight economic 
times currently, that ha
s not held back our growth. And we were definitely 
pleased with the content and with the offering that we had. And maybe Ted 
you can talk a little bit about the Japanese content offering.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. I'd say, even back to Brazil, I mean one of t
he great upsides, and this 
was our Global Original series Narcos. The star of Narcos and the Director 
and Creator of Narcos are both Brazilian superstars. So Brazil has received 
Narcos particularly well as it's been well
-
received around the world.
 
In Japan
, I think what's been really great too is the local acceptance of our 
Global Originals. So we're seeing them perform as a percentage of watching, 
about the same, as they are in other territories, which again defies 
conventional wisdom that Japan is primari
ly a local territory.
 
And we hedged a little bit too and had some local Netflix original content in 
Japan, including a show called Terrace House is doing particularly well too. 
So I think it's been a great success in being able to make shows for the 
globe 
and extend to places as diverse as Brazil and Japan.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Narcos is really just such an incredible story, because it's two
-
thirds in 
Spanish, and that was a huge success for us around the world, including 
France and Norway. And so it really sp
eaks a lot to our ability to connect the 
world to do amazing shows around the world that are great stories for 
everyone.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And great stories travel.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Ted on the original content launches, as you're thinking about next year, can 
you help us think about whether the original content launches as a whole are 
going to be as impactful, less impactful or more or so than what we're 
seeing in 2015?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, I can tell you that I would say as impactful. I don't know if that'd
 
be 
more or less. But certainly as we continue to expand into second, third and 
four seasons of our original shows, what you see there is the franchise value 
grows dramatically. So as this initiative is aging, the desire to see the new 
seasons builds up mo
re and more excitement.
 
And we're not waiting for next year for that, we have an amazing launch 
scheduled for Q4. In the Marvel Defender series, we're bringing out the 
second show, Jessica Jones in Q4 as an example, which I think is going to 
spark a lot mo
re interest in the entire Daredevil run, and the next one is 
coming up after that.
 
Reed Hastings
 
When we talked about the $5 billion content budget for next year, you said 
for sure, it was going to have more impact.
 
Peter Kafka
 
On license content, there's a lot of chatter about some of the studios, 
networks pulling back for stuff they're licensing to you folks. You guys 
addressed that in your shareholder letter. You said some content providers 
may choose to license to you, some m
ay not. Have you seen evidence that 
people are actively steering content away from Netflix in particular?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
The media business is absolutely influx. As Reed said, you've had this 
growing move away from linear and towards on
-
demand, both wat
ching and 
spending. So the future of how the networks and studios deal with Netflix, 
and Hulu, and Amazon Prime Instant Video, is certainly going to determine 
their future.
 
So there is a lot of caution. And you see how volatile the market can be just 
with 
a turn of a phrase last quarter. So I think what's happening is, is that 
you're hearing a lot of chatter, but you see in our earnings letter, we 
detailed some major global television deals we've signed across the board 
with our suppliers.
 
You should keep i
n mind that those particular deals are big rocks to move 
with our suppliers. Buying and selling global television is a brand new 
behavior to the industry. So whatever you're seeing is more chatter, but 
roughly business as usual. But of course, some caution
, caution that's been 
around since we've been licensing streaming content.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Peter, the caution it's SVOD wide. So when you think about new content on 
Hulu, I mean Hulu is even more of our cord
-
cutter's dream than Netflix is, 
because it's got t
he network shows day after. So you really want to read it. 
A lot of the concern is about SVOD generally, which is to be understood.
 
Peter Kafka
 
But Hulu is owned by three of the major networks, James Murdoch at Fox 
said he'll be working with you differentl
y. A show like Empire, the biggest 
show last year is going to Hulu and not to Netflix. Are you seeing any of the 
Hulu studios in particular steer content away from you and towards Hulu?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Remember we're buying show by show. So what happens 
is happening on 
the show level not the supplier level. As Reed said it's particularly puzzling 
that considering that it's much more disruptive to give commercial free 
options the day after broadcast and it is the year after broadcast.
 
David Wells
 
It doesn'
t address the strategic issue that is supposedly causing the anger 
with a backlash or the choice not 
--
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
For accelerating cord cutting in that case.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And the thing to tease out here is, let's say, the Empire creators, they get
 
paid based upon how the show monetizes. So the studio is under an 
obligation to monetize that as fully as they can. So Hulu can outbid us, as 
they did on Empire, and that's fair game. But they can't win it at half the 
bid, because then the participants do
n't get paid the right amount.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And I think participants are well in tune with that as well.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
It's Mark. Let me ask two questions. One on the Epix deal and one on some 
of the background to the price increase you just announced.
 
On the Epix 
deal maybe, Ted, could you comment on this. So the decision to not renew 
it, could you just kind of explain that? Was that due to the economics that 
you thought were going to be part of the deal really didn't come through for 
you? The cost per
 
viewing hour is too high? Was it that there's a broader 
movement at Netflix away from feature films? Were there too many 
restrictions on a renewal? Just kind of explain to us why that deal didn't get 
renewed?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
So some of our core initiati
ves around our content are around exclusivity, 
and accelerating windows and giving consumer access to content earlier and 
earlier, so the pay TV window has been particularly out of step with 
consumer desire to watch content when they wanted. And exclusivit
y, 
obviously, when we entered into our agreement with Epix, we were kind of 
de facto exclusive, and since then they dramatically expanded their cable 
distribution, which is great for them.
 
They did a deal with Amazon. They were about to do a deal with Hulu
 
when 
our deal was coming up for renewal. So what we said was that if we were 
going to do a non
-
exclusive deal for Epix, that would put the content on 
Netflix several months after pay television and they are completely non
-
exclusive. It wasn't a very strat
egic investment and therefore it would be 
very small relative to what we had been paying. And so we agreed that were 
--
 
our strategic initiative and theirs were diverging, and we just went our 
separate ways.
 
We do a great deal of business with Lions Gate. 
We're continuing to expand 
our business Paramount and MGM around the world, so this isn't a studio 
problem, it's just really was the Epix product was less and less in tune with 
what we're doing at Netflix around exclusivity and windows acceleration.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And while the movies on Epix are quite good, we found that there is more 
awareness on the original side and what we're hoping for over this next two 
year as we launch, so really incredible movies that are highly original and 
premier on Netfli
x as well as in the movie theater simultaneously that we 
can do better putting the money into those kind of spectacles that we create 
more consumer desire and awareness through that vehicle than through this 
additional pay
-
one licensing.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And I think that some of the economics match the success of original 
program, original series programming, which is for the cost of production. 
You have full exclusivity and global rights in perpetuity versus a very narrow 
window a year after it's released
 
in the theater in one territory. So a $1 
billion of output spending versus a $1 billion in for original spending and 
they turn out to the right strategy.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And then, a follow
-
up question on the price increase. So this is the second 
dollar price
 
increase, I think, in about a 15 month, 18 month timeframe. 
How do you think about pricing going forwards? Is this now the Netflix norm 
about once a year $1 price increase? I think long
-
term you believe you've 
got a lot of ARPU power. Is there any change 
in thinking about whether 
that's due to tiering as opposed to just straight up price increases?
 
Reed Hastings
 
So Mark, Netflix is $7.99 for our standard 
-
def offering. It was $7.99 last 
year, it was $7.99 two years ago, three years ago, so yes it is due to the 
tiering. And what we're trying to do is spread out the tiers, so that now 
we've got the $7.99 standard
-
de
f, but $9.99 high
-
definition, and $11.99 
ultra
-
high definition. So think of it is related to putting in a good tiering 
mechanism as opposed to anything else, and really Netflix is highly 
available. And standard
-
def is DVD quality, its not bad quality at al
l. So that 
$7.99 for DVD quality, unlimited streaming video, it's an incredible value.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
So a follow
-
up on that, does that mean that we should expect those three 
price points to stay the same for the next three to five years. Do you have 
the tie
ring that you want right now?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're not making any prognostications about the future on the pricing, but it 
is related to the value. And the more that we have incredible value, the 
more that we have amazing originals, then over time we're goi
ng to be able 
to ask consumers for more to be able to invest more. And that's been the 
rhythm we've been on as we did the tearing and introduced that, if you look 
at how much broader and bigger our content is now than two years ago, I 
think we fairly deliv
ered on that promise.
 
David Hyman
 
And I think, it's worth saying that consumers have acknowledged that I 
think, that with the combination of grandfathering and the content additions 
that we've been able to make in the terms of the reactions, I think people
 
are acknowledging that there is real value being delivered through the 
service.
 
Peter Kafka
 
On the original content side, for a couple of years you guys have been 
making your own shows and you've never acknowledged that any show was 
less than successful. 
You never had to take a write
-
down. As you start 
spending more on original content and as you make bigger individual bets on 
things like movies, at what point do you think you will be able to tell or 
investor should be able to expect to hear from your perf
ormance of 
individual shows, movies or any other kind of content that 
--
 
?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
So Peter, you should keep in mind, that as our slate of original programming 
grows, the diversity, the size, the scope, the scale of those shows is 
different. So w
hen we say a show is successful, it's because relative to the 
investment it's successful, relative to how else we would have spent that 
money on licensing something else, does this creation, did it attract the 
audience that it was built for.
 
So the range o
f budgets is very broad. The range of audiences we expect to 
bring to it are very broad. So that's why we've been right in so far in terms 
of predicting the size of the audience for these shows. Not that they don't all 
reach 30 million subscribers.
 
Peter K
afka
 
You haven't made any mistakes in your projections and your original content 
to date for the last two years.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, we've not had content write
-
down, so to your point. So basically we're 
saying is that we're investing according to the 
size of the show. And when 
we've been wrong, there's been more upside than we had forecasted. So we 
had got into our original programming, very conservative in terms of our 
modeling, relative to licensing, and have found that it's been much more 
impactful.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Peter, probably the best way to externally tell, is do we take on additional 
seasons of a show. So some shows have been so successful that we're 
moving on to season fours. One show had a lot of growth, it was great for 
what it was. The seaso
n three was the final season. And so you can say, 
well, therefore that was less successful, and that's true.
 
But so far, we haven't had any show that's performed so weakly in season 
one that we haven't taken it to season two. I'm sure there will be such a 
show eventually, but that's probably the best indicator that you or an 
investor could use, and it didn't really work for us. Yes, we didn't do more of 
it.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And in that case you'd say it was relative to an eight season show, it was 
less suc
cessful, but in its own economics were was quite successful.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. Go ahead.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Recently Amazon just moved to block the sales of Apple and Google 
streaming devices with their competitive products. Given your dependence 
on Amazon's AWS, are you rethinking that relationship? Can you rethink that 
relationship?
 
Reed Hastings
 
AWS has been 
a great supplier to us. They demonstrated again and again 
strong market leadership, strong attentiveness to our account. We could not 
be happier with AWS. And they've always kept that separate from Amazon 
retail. So with Amazon retail, we've had up and dow
n issues for a couple of 
years, we couldn't buy ads on IMDB, things like that, and that never spilled 
over to AWS.
 
Now, we have a really good relationship with Amazon retail also. But the 
important point to your question is they manage those separately, an
d we're 
very committed to AWS and are comfortable with that commitment.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Let me switchback over to international markets. I think the overall sub 
numbers came in higher than expected and the guidance was a little bit 
higher than the Street at l
east expected. But the mix of free subs was a little 
bit higher than I think most people had expected. Do you have a decent 
read as to whether those free subs are converting like you've seen in other 
markets, any particular reason that there is extra risk 
here, because those 
subs may not convert as well?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, you should see those consistent.
 
David Wells
 
Yes, there is no change in trend there, Mark.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And then in a fourth quarter, I think your international revenue forecast 
implies li
ke a trailing off in ARPU or pretty sharp sequential drop in ARPU, is 
there a particular reason behind that? Are you at specific price points in 
some of the newer markets that you're launching?
 
David Wells
 
No. It's the strong dollar, Mark. So there is a bi
t of a headwind there 
because of the strong dollar.
 
Peter Kafka
 
On the content side, HBO one of your big competitor is moving into news. A 
lot of that supposedly aimed at millennials, theoretically your customers as 
well. Is that something you guys would c
ontemplate at all? And then some 
more question for sports. You guys have repeatedly said you're not 
interested in sports. Are you willing to serve conceded that maybe you would 
be a little interested at some point down the road?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, loo
k on the news side, I think we definitely are being more 
adventurous in terms of the genres that we're going into. We're getting 
ready to launch Chelsea Handler's talk show early next year, that's our first 
move into talk. Kind of aimed at the same kind of
 
thing, we have a weekly 
talk show, where most of our things have been very long shelf
-
like movies 
and television series. So I think it's a very kind of similar migration or 
certainly exploration. And in sports, I think we're in the same place. There is 
a 
lot of irrational bidders for sports. We're not anxious to become another 
one.
 
Peter Kafka
 
So to translate that sounds like you're saying you're not likely to move into 
sports, but news you're already interested in and may increase that 
appetite.
 
Theodore 
Sarandos
 
Yes, we're interested in being able to improve the viewing experience 
whatever kind of content people are watching. So I think in sports, sports 
on
-
demand is not as exciting as sports live, where I think everything else 
that we're doing that kind 
of freeze the viewers from the linear schedule in 
ways that they enjoy and more enjoy the programming, then we could bring 
some value to that.
 
David Wells
 
So Ted you're leaving the lead there for innovation, right. You're giving 
yourself a little bit room 
for innovating.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes, exactly.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, let's be clear on that room. What's the likelihood that we compete 
directly with VICE in the next two years?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Probably high.
 
Reed Hastings
 
There you go.
 
Peter Kafka
 
All, Amazon, Roku, Google, I'm missing somebody, Apple, all introduced new 
streaming boxes in last few weeks. Are you seeing more usages and more 
growth from sort of dumb TVs with smart boxes or you're seeing more usage 
and growth from connect TVs that hav
e the stuff baked in?
 
Reed Hastings
 
They're both growing. They compete with each other. So those categories 
are growing. It's only really the game consoles that are not growing as fast 
for secular reasons, the early on. They were the only high
-
connected de
vices 
attached to the TV. And now, they are facing competition in share from 
smart TVs and from these attached devices.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
David, a balance sheet question for you. I think in the letter, you talk about 
looking to raise additional capital next yea
r. Do you think the next year will 
be the last year in which you'll need to do that, as you think about the plans 
for the next three to five years? And then any additional color on what kind 
of capital or how you would raise that capital next year?
 
David W
ells
 
Well, it's largely unknown, right. I mean you're asking me three or four 
years out. But I would say, given our plans to expand content and given the 
fact that we're on pace to use about $1 billion this year and no indications 
that that would shrink ne
xt year, we wanted to give some headway or some 
inside into the fact that we may be back in the market next year.
 
We've done that on a regular sort of cadence of about once a year. So there 
is no change from that. But there is still some uncertainty in ter
ms of the 
pipeline, how much we would need exactly next year. But I would say, safe 
indications are that we will be back in the market in the next 12 to 18 
months.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And then a success scenario, where Ted is able to invest the originals as well
 
in the future as he has in the past. We would hope to be back, because we 
want to be funding these incredible creative productions around the world. 
So in a success scenario, we would do a bunch more over the next five, 10 
years.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And in terms
 
of contribution margins maybe again David for you, I think you 
reiterated your goal of getting to 40% contribution margins in U.S. by 2020. 
Are those European countries and some of that in Canada, some of that 
earlier countries that you launched in. Could
 
you just talk about what the 
contribution margin has been like in those markets? Has it been similar to 
what you did in the U.S. over the last three years?
 
David Wells
 
Well, similar to the comment of Reed, we don't give a specific, Mark, in 
commentary for
 
competitive reasons. But we have said and I'll reiterate that 
there is nothing structural that means we can't get equal or better margins 
outside the U.S. that we've seen in the U.S. And we gave you a data point 
on Canada that that had reached U.S. margin
. About 18 months ago, we 
gave you a point on that. So there is no reason that we couldn't do better. 
Largely it's determined competitively within that country or that region in 
terms of how well we do on the profit side.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Recently you guys agre
ed to sell subscriptions to Apple phone users via iOS 
in app purchases. For years you didn't do that. Are you paying the same 
30% tax that everyone else pays, when someone gets an app subscription 
through Apple? And then why make that change now after year
s of not 
doing that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's a great opportunity to expand. So historically, we've only been on the 
Apple TV and that on the iPhone. And we don't comment specifically on the 
business terms. So I can't directly answer your question. But we're rea
lly 
excited about the potential, especially as we go global over the next year
-
and
-
a
-
half to be able to serve all of the iPhone customers around the world. 
So some higher motivation on our side to get access to that incredible 
iPhone customer base around t
he world.
 
Peter Kafka
 
If that does generate a lot of new subscriptions, will we see the impact of 
that on you financials? Will those come in significantly lower monthly 
revenue numbers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, the revenue is the same. You would see an 
increase in COGS to deal 
with the fees to Apple. That's where it would show up. But it's essentially the 
gross revenue the 7.99 or 9.99 that shows for us.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Curious what you guys think of new streaming offerings from Verizon and 
Comcast both, wha
t you think of them as actual content? And what you 
think of the notion and broadband providers that you need to work with, 
now competing with subscription or streaming services?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're really big and everybody has got to get into streaming. I
t's been our 
main message for several years, that what is known as channels is going to 
become apps. And that all of these providers need to have great apps on a 
phone, on a tablet, on a TV, so it's completely consistent with all of that.
 
And what we see i
s if we have great content, then consumers watch our 
service and enjoy it and tell their friends about it. And it kind of doesn't 
matter that there is also a great sports game on or there is also a shows on 
Verizon or on Comcast. So part of the reason that
 
we may seem a little blasé 
is that it really hasn't affected us. What has affected us is when we have 
great show like Narcos that just takes the world by storm. So that's what 
we're focused on, how do we have more incredible shows.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Do you thin
k that the products of Verizon and Comcast just launched are 
great products?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's early in the market. They are great companies. They will work on that. 
But I'm not going to critique them. They're all, they are in, they are trying, 
and 
that's a great thing. Of course, you seen Sony Vue, you've seen the Dish 
sling product. So people are really innovative, which is great for consumers. 
And not every product, when it first comes out is great, and they'll continue 
to work on them.
 
David Well
s
 
And there are certainly better iterations than their prior versions. So they 
are getting better.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Our first streaming offering was pretty ugly.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Ted, we got a couple of series of emails about whether Star Wars is going to 
be 
available, all the films on the Netflix next year, what's the answer?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
They're all subject to negotiations. It's up to Disney, how they want to 
manage access to those assets before, during or after the release of Star 
Wars 7. So it's certa
inly an ongoing discussion.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And assuming Star Wars launches theatrically this year, then it would not 
come to Netflix as part of the [multiple speakers].
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
No, it would be the last title on the Starz, in the Disney output goin
g to 
Starz.
 
Reed Hastings
 
So it wouldn't come to Netflix.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes, correct.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And then there was a new user interface launched on the site about four 
months ago, and hoped that that would be kind of improved user retention 
satisfaction levels four months in, any takeaways?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Super happy with it, and we're generating new improvements already, 
improvements there, improvements on mobile, improvements on the TV. So 
thinking a product group is just an amazing learning
 
organization. It's 
always pushing the balance and its steady improvement on all of those 
fronts, Mark. And it's the aggregate of that, which has us at so many 
viewing hours and so much customer satisfaction that we've been working at 
all of these improvem
ents over the last seven years on streaming.
 
David Wells
 
And that's been very flattered in terms of being imitated across the world.
 
Peter Kafka
 
You guys changed your amortization schedule for your license content, just 
like you had for originals, you said
 
it's because you're seeing more viewing 
in the first month. What does that mean are people 
--
 
does that mean 
people are less interested in the stuff than you thought overtime or they're 
more interested than you thought. Originally what does that tell us a
bout 
viewing behavior?
 
David Wells
 
Presumably, Peter you're referring to that amortization change or the 
change in accounting estimate. And no, it doesn't. You can't conclude that 
nor should you conclude that from the change. What we're saying is there is 
more viewing in the first month not necessarily less viewing over the 
lifetime, it just moved up a little bit. And it could be that we view that at so 
much good content over the last few years that it's become 
--
 
you have to 
make a good choice, right. You'
ve got 20 good choices, you're choosing.
 
So it could be that the merchandising system is concentrating a little bit of 
that when something comes in. Regardless, we try to be accurate in our 
accounting, and we follow the trends regularly on a quarterly basi
s. And this 
past quarter, we noted some content that was trending up, so we 
accelerated the amortization on that. We wanted to be upfront, even though 
it's relatively small based, if you look at it in comparison to the overall U.S. 
content spend it's relat
ively small.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Peter, let me give you a little example, it will help on this one. Suppose we 
pay $1 million dollars for a title for a four year license, and we think it's 
going to go 1 million hours of viewing. But the title is just incredibly 
popular, 
and instead it does 10 million hours. But many of those hours are in the first 
month as supposed to spread over the four years. Well, then we would 
accelerate the amortization of that million dollars, even though the whole 
thing is doing much bett
er than we ever thought. Its relative proportion 
overtime is more upfront. So that's why we would front load that million 
dollars.
 
Peter Kafka
 
And generally what's happening, are these things over performing or is there 
a mix where they sometimes are perfo
rming less well than you thought?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's not about the total performance that gets us to change the amortization, 
it's the relative performance overtime. And so if it performs a lot in the 
beginning, relative to how it does at the end. That's w
hat gets us to 
accelerate.
 
So your earlier question about write
-
downs is what's missing. You're not 
quite getting that, let's see, if a title under performed our estimate, but was 
very back
-
loaded, then the right accounting would be to shift it out further
 
as oppose to pull it up. And so you're thinking of it in a write
-
up and write
-
down sense, and that's not actually how it works. The schedule is based 
upon how it does overtime relative to the license period. Did that example 
help?
 
Peter Kafka
 
No, no, but 
in both cases you're saying look, we have these things for so 
long that it always worked out. That is why I was asking about the write
-
down part. You've never once reached a point where you missed entirely and 
you found something that no one wants over any
 
more time.
 
David Wells
 
Let me take that, Peter, because I think there has been a couple of 
questions on that. We certainly license things that perform less well than we 
expected sometimes, right. There is a portfolio of content that we're 
licensing. We do
n't always get it right. But in the case if something that 
doesn't perform as well as we expected, we're not a producer that has 
ultimate revenues like a production studio that has to write that down based 
on a lower expectation of revenue.
 
We have somethi
ng available on our service in broadcaster accounting. And 
in broadcasters, if we're deriving revenue over the life of that license period 
over the service, it doesn't result in a write
-
down. It just maybe an 
opportunity cost that we can license something 
better down the road.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, and a good recent real world example is Longmire. We just released 
the original fourth season of Longmire. So season one, two, and three, which 
we've licensed for several years on Netflix, they were at the kind
 
of tail end 
of their life, actually exploded when Longmire season four launched.
 
So it's very unique to the behavior, like nothing actually performs like 
everything else. So we are trying to do is make sure the amort matches the 
viewing patterns.
 
David We
lls
 
And it's a good lead in to remind everyone that these are dynamic, right. 
That's why we look at it every quarter, because things change. We see when 
something gets released like Longmire or we release the third season, then 
the first season of that par
ticular title may see a bump. So it's something 
that we're constantly looking at.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And where it's ambiguous, we would tend to want to amortize it more 
quickly. That's advantages to us.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Right.
 
Reed Hastings
 
But it has to be 
justified by the actual viewing patterns.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
On global rights deals, Ted, just a big picture, as you see yourself, is the 
company able to negotiate more and more of these content deals on a global 
rights basis?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes, it's definit
ely been the drive of myself and my team all year, trying to 
move the sellers into a more of a global mode. Remember, they are mostly 
situated as regional sellers of content, sometimes the rights are fragmented 
in their ownership. But in the cases of the d
eals we did this past quarter, 
they were controlled by one entity and typically solved by multiple regions 
and we corralled the deals into the corporate offices, and were able to 
license the world on those titles. Titles that we think will have great globa
l 
appeal.
 
So I think the growth, the opportunities, the challenges of Netflix are all 
global, so that its having a lot of regional discussions around the world isn't 
that efficient. And it turns out that tastes are rather global too. So it's 
actually reall
y well lined up.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And then Ted or Reed, when you think about the mix in international 
markets of local versus global content, any general change in your thinking 
on what the optimum mix is, and you find it that you're constantly toggling 
with d
epending on the market that you're in?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
It's interesting, like you said every time we launch in a new market, we 
know more in that first 24 hours of viewing, than we did from a year of 
research. And in terms of the move, I think, we went i
n expecting Japan to 
be much more local than it turned out to be. It's more local than other 
territories, but not as local as conventional wisdom would have had.
 
And it actually moves with a global desire for some of these large shows, so 
that the local ta
stes are usually determined by what you have access to. And 
if we're growing the access to great content around the world, people are 
moving or migrating to that kind of viewing. So that's why we're able to do 
local language originals, our own global origi
nals and then licensed content, 
not just from Hollywood to the world, but from the world to the rest of the 
world.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Another international question. Can you guys give us any update on China, 
either in terms of what you're thinking about in terms 
of timing or what your 
approach is going to be to a really regulated market there when you do 
show up?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We can tell you, well, we're still learning a lot. So nothing really specific our 
helpful, except that we're still in early stages.
 
Peter K
afka
 
And lot of you guys mentioned getting in new Pay TV Window for a specific 
movie, The Big Short. Are you negotiating those deals now on one
-
off deals 
for individual movies or you're doing these for whole slates?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
There were conversatio
ns directly with producers. So a lot of times, well, if 
you can get to the rights before they get fragmented, that's when you could 
do those deals. So they tend to be more curated title
-
by
-
title in that way.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Reed, I think I'll just ask one las
t question directly to you. When you think 
about the biggest challenges that you think Netflix faces over the next 
several years, three to five years, what do you think they are? What do you 
focus most of your time on?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I would say the b
iggest challenge is, our being the service that people 
want, really feeling out more movies and more TV shows. We're working so 
hard to have these great original productions, and if we could have 10 more 
Oranges and 5 more Narcos, I know I'm putting a lot 
of pressure, that would 
be really transformative.
 
Especially, I'll bring up the Narcos, we've got an example, because it was 
filmed in Bogota, Columbia. The main company doing it, it was a French 
company. So it's a very international production; Brazilian 
cast. And we have 
an incredible production Marseille, which I'll give a little plug for, that's in 
filming now. And I think it will be a really great crossover around the world 
kind of crime, drama, family, politics.
 
And the more we do these around the 
world, obviously, that's great in a 
local market in terms of establishing our bona fides and reputation with 
customers. But it's also great, because there is something new, something 
fresh. And as long as we're continuing to push the bounds on things, like
 
original movies or international productions, then the consumers are really 
embracing.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
David, help us think through and it's I guess one of same things I am 
sensing very strongly is just increasing appetite enthusiasm for original 
content. Fr
om a P&L perspective, that $5 billion next year in content spend, 
theoretically if that was 25% original content versus 15% or 10%, the 
impact of that on margins, as you mix shift more and more towards original 
content, is that accretive to margins?
 
David 
Wells
 
Well, the good news for me as a forecaster is it does take Ted a little bit of 
time to actually produce these shows. So anyway, we get a little bit of lead 
time in terms of some visibility into the production. So our targets at 40% 
U.S. margin alread
y encapsulate this shift towards originals overtime.
 
I think we made some earlier comments about a long
-
term shift that could 
be upwards of 50% of originals, and we still anticipate being able to meet 
our margin targets and also shift towards originals. It
's going to bring more 
amortization in, but we think we can do both.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And I'll use the word expansion. So think of it as our license content is 
growing, but our original content is growing faster. There is a mix shift, but I 
don't want that to
 
get misunderstood as a reduction in license spending.
 
David Wells
 
We are still spending on licensed content.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And remember, between original films, original cartoons, animated shows for 
kids, our original scripted series, we're releasing 
more original titles in Q4 
than we released in entire second year of original programming. So it is 
accelerating rather quickly and you're seeing it.
 
Peter Kafka
 
Reed, you said for a while now, the future of TV is apps, and now Tim Cook 
is saying the same 
thing, it's now the conventional wisdom. Do you think 
individual viewers or consumers want to pick and choose their own apps, 
their own shows, serving in a la carte world or do you think there's a role for 
someone who sort of bundle all the stuff back toge
ther.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, that will be a really interesting question over the next couple of years. 
We're going to work really hard to expand our movies and TV shows so 
quickly in such a compelling way, that lots of the viewing for movies and TV 
shows is t
hrough Netflix, which is sort of what makes us want to focus so 
much on that area.
 
But I could imagine future bundles emerging. Once there is a whole bunch of 
apps, and as you go through this industry change now, next probably three, 
five, 10 years, where 
there is a lot of discrete offerings, everybody is 
improving their brand value.
 
And then you get to a maturing phase of the market, and then there is some 
consolidation, which could be acquisitions, it could be other things or it could 
be bundles. But the 
next couple years, when you have this new phase of the 
market, I think everyone is just racing to make a great app like Netflix, like 
HBO Now, those things.
 
We should hit your last question here, because we're running out of time.
 
Peter Kafka
 
This will 
be it. It's a small one. You're seeing some folks sort of rebundle 
already, right. Hulu is showing Showtime together. Would you be 
comfortable having Netflix bundle with another service?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't see a lot of take rate from our consumer side 
on the Hulu 
Showtime. We think we're better focused on just establishing the Netflix 
brand. Again, at this phase in the market, we think the real key is focus.
 
At some future time the bundling may be appropriate. Of course, we'll keep 
an eye and watch the 
Hulu Showtime take rate to see, to confirm that there 
is very little traction of that. So we'll be open minded. But our instinct is 
focused on making Netflix the passion brand in this space.
 
End of Q&A
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And before we sign off, we should re
mind everybody that Friday, tomorrow, 
is the premier of Beasts of No Nation on Netflix and in selected theaters 
around the country.

Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted 
Sarandos; and Chief Product 
Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this 
quarter is Mike Morris from Guggenheim. As a reminder, we'll be making 
forward
-
looking statements, and actual results may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for his first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer 
Session
 
Operator
 
Mike Morris
 
Thank you, Spencer. Good afternoon. Let's start by talking about both 
member trends and the outlook that you just provided for members in the 
fourth quarter. Starting with the third quarter, can you speak a bit about 
some of th
e key drivers that 
-
 
your results came in relatively in line with 
your guidance. Talk about the gross add dynamic and the churn dynamic 
there relative to what you are expecting coming into the quarter, please.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Relatively in line. It was the m
ost accurate member forecast we had in 
years. Spencer, over to you.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Spencer or Spence. I'll take it. We got a lot of Spencers on the call. I'd first 
say, Michael, it was a really strong quarter. I mean not just around 
subscribers but around
 
overall business performance that was record 
revenues for Q3, record operating profit and nearly $1 billion of operating 
profit and record paid net adds for the quarter. We delivered on the 
subscriber front slightly ahead of where we expected outside of t
he U.S. In 
the U.S., we were a little bit short.
 
To your question, what drove that, we're talking very small numbers here, 
but we did see some elevated churn in the quarter that 
--
 
we had seen some 
elevated churn following our price increases in the U.S., 
and that ticked up 
and sustained through the quarter longer than it had in the past.
 
But these are really small changes, we're talking about like 0.1 of a 
percentage point in churn. And that's why, at the same time, these price 
increases are hugely revenue
 
positive for us, as you saw in the quarter, and 
so we take the bulk of that revenue and reinvest it back into the service, 
into great content, into great product experience for our members to 
continue to deliver on that value proposition and continue to g
row our 
business.
 
Mike Morris
 
Okay. I want to come back to the topic of churn. But before we do, I just 
want to ask about the fourth quarter outlook. On the last call, we spoke 
about potentially seeing a record year of net subscriber or net member 
addition
s in 2019. The guide does not imply that at this point.
 
So can you talk a bit about perhaps what changed? And I think the big 
question in investors' minds is will 2018 represent a peak year for member 
adds or can you get back to growing on top of that leve
l again.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Sure. I'll take that one again, too. So in terms of our guide for the year, yes, 
it is down a bit from our previous forecast. And really, what we're just trying 
to do there is to be prudent about the 
-
 
there's a number of moving pa
rts in 
Q4 and variables that are just difficult to forecast.
 
And whether it's, first, just the ability to be precise about a forecast around 
our content slate that has so much new IP in Q4 and big film 
-
 
a big film IP 
that we 
-
 
we've never had a quarter wi
th so many big films launching in a 
quarter. Combine that with some of that elevated churn that we saw in Q3 
and the potential for that to continue into Q4.
 
And then lastly, there is obviously a few new competitors launching in the 
near term, and we try to
 
factor that in as well. Inevitably, there is probably 
going to be some curiosity and some trial of those competitive service 
offerings. So when we put all that together, again, we adjusted our forecast 
slightly. It's still nearly 27 million paid net adds 
for the year, a tremendously 
strong year.
 
And furthermore, it is 
-
 
our long
-
term outlook is unchanged in terms of the 
long
-
term opportunity for the business. We're just trying to be prudent 
about our Q4 forecast.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Mike, in the prior year, in t
he U.S., we did 5 million net adds. And this year, 
if we're on forecast, it will be about 2.6 million. So the gap's almost entirely 
in the U.S. That's really on the back of the price increase. There is a little 
more sensitivity. We're starting to see the 
-
 
a little touch of that. What we 
have to do is just really focus on the service quality, make us must
-
have. I 
mean we're incredibly low priced compared to cable. We're winning more 
and more viewings. And we think we have a lot of room there.
 
But this year,
 
that's what's hit us. And we'll just stay focused on just 
providing amazing value to our members in the U.S. And I think that gives 
us a real shot at continuing to grow net 
--
 
long
-
term net adds on an annual 
basis. But we're going to be a little cautious 
on that guidance and feel our 
way through here.
 
Mike Morris
 
Yes. And on that elevated churn, just to kind of wrap on this, what type of 
subscribers are you seeing churn more often? Does it tend to be really that 
hit driven nature around a particular progra
mming? Does it happen to be 
sort of the last subscriber in is less sticky? What are you seeing there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Mike, at 0.1%, it's 1 in 1,000 people, so you really can't tell the margin. 
Think of it much more big picture, which is it's always a questi
on of how 
much value do we have, how do the consumers feel it. In moving up ASP in 
the U.S. from about $12 to about $13, we see a little bit of it. And then what 
we have to do is just give it a pause and really focus on the value.
 
If you think about it, we
 
haven't had many big movies in the past, and 
movies are very valuable, people are used to paying for a lot of that. And 
the slate that Ted and his team have this quarter and for next year is way 
better than any movie slate we've ever had. There's some gre
at room for 
optimism there, too. So we just have to focus on the members, and I think it 
will shake out very well.
 
Mike Morris
 
Okay. Thank you. And so let's talk about competition. Spence brought the 
topic up, so I'm not introducing it. I know it's 
been a hot topic. But Reed, 
you spoke in the U.K. a couple of weeks ago. You made a comment saying it 
would be a whole new world starting in November. I think a lot of people 
-
 
a 
lot of investors just read the quote, they didn't necessarily see the intervi
ew 
for context.
 
And so I'd love it if you could provide some context given that, that is a bit 
different from your comments from a couple of quarters ago where you felt 
that perhaps these new services wouldn't necessarily be material to the 
outlook.
 
Reed H
astings
 
From when we began in streaming, Hulu and YouTube and Amazon Prime 
back in 2007, 2008, we're all in the market. All 4 of us have been competing 
heavily, including with linear TV for the last 12 years. So fundamentally, 
there's not a big change here
. It is interesting that we see both Apple and 
Disney launching basically in the same week after 12 years of not being in 
the market. And I was being a little playful with a whole new world in the 
sense of the drama of it coming. But fundamentally, it's mo
re of the same, 
and Disney is going to be a great competitor. Apple is just beginning, but 
they'll probably have some great shows, too.
 
But again, all of us are competing with linear TV. We're all relatively small to 
linear TV. So just like in the letter w
e put about the multiple cable networks 
over the last 30 years not really competing with each other fundamentally 
but competing with broadcast, I think it's the same kind of dynamic here.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I think I got the subtlety of the brave 
-
 
the whol
e new world Aladdin 
reference. Everyone else took it pretty literal.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Ted, why don't you talk a little about the movie slate and how it's 
different? If there's a whole new world, it's really about our movie slate 
more than anything else.
 
T
heodore Sarandos
 
100%. I think we've got 
-
 
just in the fourth quarter alone, we're talking 
about films that are 
-
 
that range from a massive scale action film from 
Michael Bay with 6 Underground to Oscar hopefuls like The Irishman, 
Marriage Story and The Tw
o Popes, Eddie Murphy's return in Dolemite.
 
So these are big, theatrically ambitious
-
type films that you'll be able to 
watch on Netflix, included in your subscription. It really is a fundamental 
change in the economics of how people enjoy films. So we're r
eally excited 
about it. And it's our first time we've seen the scale and this volume of films 
in one quarter, so we're really excited about it.
 
Mike Morris
 
Before we dig into some content questions a bit more, do you want to talk 
about pricing a little bit
 
and the pricing power in the U.S. market? So 
perhaps for Greg or for Spence, two things.
 
Number one, do you think that the lower price point for some of these new 
services will negatively impact your ability to raise your price in the future? 
And maybe mo
re broadly, can you talk about equilibrium price for this 
service? We would love for you to give us a price point. I know that's 
unlikely. But as you just think about 
--
 
you could be a great value with a 
number of different price points, but how do you thi
nk about where that sort 
of shakes out?
 
Gregory Peters
 
I think the pricing of our competitors we don't feel as a real significant factor 
in determining where 
--
 
what we can change for our service. Again, the 
services and the content are highly differentiat
ed, so one is not something 
you're going to choose to do just for us.
 
But I would say our job and then what we think our pricing for a long
-
term 
perspective is continue to take the revenue that we have that our 
subscribers give us every month, judiciously 
and smartly invest it into 
increasing variety and diversity of content where we really want to be best
-
in
-
class across every single genre.
 
And if we do that and we're successful in making those investments smartly, 
we'll be able to continue to deliver more
 
value to our members. And that 
really will enable us to, from time to time, ask for more revenues so that we 
can continue that virtuous cycle going.
 
Mike Morris
 
And so I don't know if you can speak any more about it, but is there a place 
where whether it'
s relative to a pay
-
TV subscription in a certain market or 
relative to other streaming services that you think set some sort of bound 
around where pricing could ultimately go to?
 
Gregory Peters
 
I think you can look at a couple of external ones in terms of 
pay
-
TV 
packages that might be relevant, but we don't really look at it that way. 
We're looking at it more sort of incrementally and let our subscribers sort of 
tell us, as we add more value along, where that right price should be. It's a 
-
 
we're really mor
e focused on listening to subscribers and sort of walking that 
path with them.
 
Mike Morris
 
Okay. And one other question on pricing for you, Greg. A couple of different 
dynamics especially outside the U.S. where you have different price points. 
You tested a
 
mobile
-
only plan, a lower price plan in India.
 
Could you talk a little bit about perhaps the variety of tests and pricing 
points that you have in the marketplace right now and any differentiation 
you can give us between more mature markets that 
--
 
with so
me stable 
pricing test, anything like that so we can get a view going forward?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Sure. Just to talk a little bit about where we are in India, I mean again, we 
think about revenue as a guiding principle for us. We do these different tests 
and try to figure out what is the right set of plans that have the right 
benefits, the right features that are delivered at the right price for the 
subscribers in any given market.
 
And I think what we're exploring is, as we are operating in markets that 
ha
ve very, very different conditions, very different levels of affluence and 
other forms of entertainment competition, et cetera, what is the right 
structure for us.
 
And so we've been very, very happy with the mobile plan. It's actually 
performing better tha
n we tested. We'll look at testing that in other markets, 
too, because we think there are other markets which have similar conditions 
that make it likely that, that's going to be successful for us there as well.
 
But I also think we're going to look at othe
r plan structures, other feature 
value benefits where we might see different market conditions that will work 
there. And I won't get into sort of leaning into those, we'll see them as we 
roll out, and we'll respond to them based on what our consumers in th
ose 
markets, our members to be in those markets are telling us is working or 
not.
 
Mike Morris
 
Okay. I want to come back to competition but this time talk about 
competition for content. Ted, you teed up a bit some of the things you're 
enthusiastic about goi
ng forward. Reed, you did make the comment again in 
the U.K. that someday The Crown would look like a bargain. Perhaps another 
sound
-
bite that was picked up but perhaps you can provide some context 
around that.
 
Maybe generally, how do you think about the i
nvestment that you want to 
make in programming from a very high level? Is it an overall budget? Is it a 
cost per subscriber to a certain level? How do you think about that?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I would say the exciting thing about this moment in entertainment
 
history is 
that the scope and scale and ambition of television is beginning to rival that 
of feature film, which is an incredible win for consumers. And so when Reed 
was talking about The Crown, he was talking about relative to the joy and 
the hours of wa
tching,
 
The Crown will just look like a bargain and that 
--
 
these things on big scope 
and scale. And our 
--
 
we're pretty uniquely positioned with a $15 billion 
content budget to be able to deliver on those scope and scale at the same 
time for film and tele
vision.
 
So that incredible 
-
 
that slate that I just rattled off to you, it's happening at 
the same time that we have returning seasons of End of the expletiveing 
[ph] World, The Crown, Lost in Space, You, all incredibly popular shows. 
Casa de las Flores fr
om Mexico, Baby from Italy, all back for returning 
seasons.
 
Breaking brand
-
new series like The Witcher, Daybreak, all at the same time 
being able to deliver on what we think is an incredible value proposition for 
the viewers. So you were asking earlier abo
ut price, it's really price relative 
to value. And if you're spending more and more time watching TV shows and 
films on Netflix, you are realizing an incredible value. And I think that's 
really how the consumer experiences it.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Ted, as much as
 
you can ballpark it, a show 5 years ago producing that 
same show today, sort of 50% more expensive, 30%?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
It's a really hard one because the range is huge, and sometimes the big 
breakthrough is not the one that turned out to be that came 
into it that 
competitively. But on a very competitive show, there's probably been 30% 
price escalation from this time last year.
 
Reed Hastings
 
In 1 year.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
In 1 year.
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, that's a lot. But definitely, content pricing is rising
. But when 
--
 
we are 
fortunate to have the largest membership, one of the biggest revenues and 
the biggest content budgets, and so that's what's in there. We're able to still 
be very competitive sort of in shows.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And as you pointed out, i
t's an elite few shows that are that competitive that 
would see that kind of escalation. Just in any environment where you've 
injected a few new buyers, you're going to catch that dynamic on a highly 
competitive show.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
The only thing I'd add
 
also, just to reinforce, we look at a lot of things. We 
don't chase everything, and we also lose on opportunities, right? So we're 
exercising discipline every 
-
 
all the way with every single title, we're 
assessing every title individually. And where 
--
 
on
e is, as Ted said, with the 
size of content budget, we'll take big swings and we can make some 
mistakes because we don't have any kind of single title content 
concentration.
 
But we are, because of that discipline, we're continuing to march towards 
increasi
ng profit margins, improving our cash flow trajectory over time. So 
this is with discipline and business discipline while we are going after these 
big swings.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And Mike, at the risk of hitting too hard the diversification point, just sort of 
mathematically, investors can do the math on what $100 million sort of 
project relative to a $15 billion cash content budget or $10 billion P&L 
budget means. It's incredibly diverse, right, so we don't have any sort of 
concentration risk. So I'd point that
 
out.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. Considering our math, Spencer, but the idea that the rumored $100 
million that House of Cards invest going into the way, that would seem 
earth
-
shattering less than 7 years ago. Today, it represents about 1% of our 
content budge
t.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And today, that would be a bargain.
 
Mike Morris
 
So if I look at this dynamic then, continue to increase the investment in 
content, at the same time, growing your subscribers. Where are we in terms 
of achieving scale on that investment if w
e look at that content spend per 
subscriber?
 
Do you expect the competition to continue to drive that up? Or are we 
getting to a point of equilibrium where you're starting to see the benefit of 
that global penetration that you have?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I woul
dn't try to take a stab at predicting whether we're at equilibrium when 
there's so much fluidity in the market today. But I think what you're seeing 
now, there's an absolute cap, of course, so 
--
 
but anyone can pay for any 
given project, and it will get su
per competitive for a lot of them. So I'd say 
that we're investing forward and trying to win those moments of joy for our 
members, and that's what's driving us.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Mike, there's about 2 billion active users of Facebook, 2 billion active 
user
s of YouTube. We're obviously a fraction of that. And those numbers are 
continuing to grow. There are 6 billion active mobile phones in the world, 
and that's got to equilibrium. So equilibrium is so far away from where we 
are today. It's not something that
 
we think a lot about, we think about how 
do we grow.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. Definitely in terms of member growth. I thought you were talking about 
content spend.
 
Mike Morris
 
Sure. So let's talk about creating franchises. I have a question about that. I 
th
ink there is a lot of enthusiasm, as you know, for the Disney+ product 
coming out. And I think it rides a little bit on the success of the streaming 
marketplace but also this concept that they have this tremendous content 
library and IP library that they'v
e built over many years.
 
So Reed and Ted, as you think about that, I know you've made an 
investment in children's content over the course of the last quarter. Talk a 
little bit about franchises, the importance of franchises and whether building 
franchises 
is something that is your ambition.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I think established IP has a leg up with consumers. They know what they're 
getting into. There's a prebuilt
-
in excitement. It makes the marketing a little 
easier. But in general, don't forget the 
power of brand creation. And what is 
the value of a franchise? It's really the value of brand creation and can you 
scale off of it. In this past quarter, we made a movie called Tall Girl, a 
hugely unknown cast, who, in 7 days, grew their social media follo
wing into 
the millions on Netflix and had over 40 million people watch it.
 
That's the ability to create a brand almost out of thin air, which, I think, is 
every bit as valuable as drafting off a bunch of other franchises waiting for 
them to burn out. That 
being said, we're very excited about the opportunity 
to do it ourselves. We see the value of franchises like Stranger Things and 
Black Mirror.
 
And so we're continuing to work to do that as well. But I 
--
 
think about it as 
not like franchises are better tha
n non
-
franchises. Great stories are what 
matter, and the way that they reach consumers really makes a difference.
 
Mike Morris
 
You had a couple of original programs, original pieces of content in markets 
outside the U.S., global pieces but focused in market
s, Sacred Games in 
India, Casa De Papel in Spain, I'm thinking about it in particular. We saw 
Google search activity, let's say, multiples or at least doubling what their 
prior levels were.
 
So I'm curious, your thought about how that piece of content does 
drive that 
enthusiasm on local market. I think what that ties to really is, I think, the 
way we try to think about what the growth opportunity is. So I'd love to hear 
why you think you get that big step
-
up. And maybe in terms of Ted and 
Greg together, how 
you work together to try to make that happen.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Sure. You saw in the letter our investment in local language original series 
and film is continuing to grow at more than 100 seasons of new local 
language original shows, and they make a huge 
impact in the market. Casa 
de las Flores, which will be back for a second season in Mexico, has been a 
tremendous success.
 
What's been great, too, is a lot of these titles that are hugely impactful in 
the country where they're produced also tend to travel 
throughout the 
region, sometimes around the world. Not 
--
 
so the Casa De Papel, the 
success of that show, was basically in almost every non
-
English
-
speaking 
territory. It was a phenomenal success.
 
We're going to see that coming up with a new show called Th
e Wave from 
Germany where the stories can be very pan
-
regional. But the way that they 
travel and the way they make a big splash around the world is to be super 
authentically local and really satisfying for the viewers, starting in the home 
country and then
 
expanding around the world.
 
And we've been 
--
 
we're on our fourth year of producing local language 
originals at scale, and we're excited about continuing to expand it. And they 
can 
--
 
the nice part is, is I think people will enjoy a global film or a 
global 
series every so often, love to see themselves on
-
screen, and that we're able 
to deliver on both of those propositions for our members around the world.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Just to add to that, I think it's super fun and exciting to be able to take one 
of
 
these really authentic local stories and connect it effectively with a broad 
regional or global audience. In many cases, we feel like we'd have never 
actually watched a show in that language or from that country before.
 
And the key to doing that, first of
 
all, is obviously being available in all those 
countries in an easy
-
to
-
access way, but then it's connecting that show, 
having it be localized, in language with subtitles or dubbing, whatever is 
appropriate for that market, and then also explaining to user
s, to members 
why they're going to want to watch this amazing heist series from Spain and 
why that's going to be a totally compelling watch for them based on the 
other kind of content that they're enjoying.
 
Mike Morris
 
And I think it's important to underst
and how broad your production is 
outside the U.S. So can you share any statistics on how many countries 
you're actually producing first
-
party production of content and what that sort 
of investment looks like in terms of building a moat there? And in additi
on, 
you just strike a partnership with Mediaset during the quarter, one specific 
partnership you could perhaps detail and how that can benefit you.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, we've entered into most of those markets with joint 
--
 
in joint venture 
or in coprod
uction arrangements at the beginning and then take over many 
productions in those countries as we get scale in those countries. And we 
also continue to have great coproduction relationships with folks like 
Mediaset, even though our own studio is producing 
local Italian content as 
well.
 
So it's 
--
 
I'd say we've released original local language content in 17 
countries to date, we're going to grow it to 30, and that's just going to keep 
growing around the world.
 
Mike Morris
 
One other content question, you did 
make a high
-
profile commitment to 
rights for Seinfeld, which is a little bit 
--
 
I don't want to say counter but 
certainly different from the focus of allocating resources incrementally to 
originals. Can you talk about how big of a commitment is that for yo
u maybe 
at least on a relative basis? And why is that the right decision?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, we've seen 
-
 
in the past, we've had a lot of questions about the value 
of volumes of catalog programming, meaning just having hours and hours of 
content that 
people don't watch. But we have seen there's a few titles in the 
history of television, Seinfeld being one of them, that continue to be 
incredibly relevant 30 years after it came out on television and get watched 
every night. It's kind of a comfort view co
medy that travels around the 
world.
 
And Seinfeld is one of these very elite shows that came available in that time 
frame. So we have Friends till the end of the year, then we'll have Office for 
another year after that, and then Seinfeld will roll out to th
e world in 2021 
on Netflix.
 
And we're incredibly enthusiastic about those shows. But they're very, very 
unique in the vast catalog of television ever created that people are still 
watching 30 years after it was produced.
 
Mike Morris
 
I want to ask you some 
questions about windowing and sort of creating 
community among your viewers. One of the questions that we get is really 
about dropping an entire season at once versus having it spread out over a 
week at a time. You've addressed this question before, but I'
d like to hear 
your more 
--
 
your current thoughts.
 
And I think the question is really beyond just why not do it every week but 
why do it, let's say, all an entire season at once, maybe you could split a 
season into pieces or the timing of a series. For exa
mple, we were asked 
why Stranger Things couldn't have been before the end of the second 
quarter instead of just after the start of the third quarter.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
So I'll give you a quick just personal anecdote. I'm a big fan of Succession 
on HBO, and
 
I watch it every Sunday night when it comes out just like 
everyone else. And if I like that show a little bit less, I would probably burn 
out on it because I get aggravated every week waiting for the next episode. 
That's how much I like it. So you're tryi
ng to finely 
--
 
fine
-
tune the 
proposition to the customer, great storytelling, how and when they want to 
watch it.
 
And what we have seen in comparison 
--
 
because we have about 35 shows 
around the world that we release week
-
over
-
week because it's premiering
 
in 
that territory of Netflix, and we don't want to 
--
 
and we want to deliver on it 
as soon as it 
--
 
as close to the broadcast window as we can.
 
So what we 
-
 
and what we've seen is, in markets where we released it all at 
once versus 1 a week that we actual
ly get more viewing and cumulatively 
more social media buzz, more tweets, more activity on social media around 
these shows for the all
-
at
-
once model. So people are coming to it at 
different times. They're loving it more. It's in a more concentrated 
experie
nce, for sure.
 
All of that being said, we are doing things like producing 
--
 
like you saw with 
The Ranch where we are producing 10
-
episode seasons with smaller gaps 
between seasons, so coming out 6 months apart rather than a year apart.
 
You're seeing we're
 
testing an interesting release pattern with Rhythm + 
Flow, a music competition show, that 
-
 
and basically, what we're trying to do 
is match not just the program exactly that you want to watch but how do 
you want to watch it. And for a lot of people, it ma
y not be all at once, but 
it's hardly ever 1 a week.
 
Mike Morris
 
Right. Do you see more opportunities for that? Whether it's unscripted or the 
type of program, it's not live per se but it does lend itself to a little more 
pent
-
up excitement, do you see mor
e opportunities to put resources behind 
that or is it opportunistic?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
It's opportunistic. We're trying a lot of different things. We're trying 
-
 
basically, what we're trying to do is make your favorite show, whatever that 
is. And for some 
people, it's going to be a music competition show. For other 
people, it will be Green Eggs and Ham.
 
So we really are trying to make your favorite show, whatever it is, and be 
best
-
in
-
class at all of those things. And there might be something unique 
about the release rhythms of competition shows and more topical talk shows 
that lend themselves better to f
requency release.
 
Mike Morris
 
You spoke two quarters ago, you updated it a little bit last quarter, the topic 
of providing some more data or information both for producers, talent as 
well as for individuals.
 
My first question is, can we have an update on w
here we are in that, what 
you have provided and especially from a consumer perspective as well? I 
think the goal was to help create some more of that buzz, create more 
conversations, how is that playing out at this point?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
One of the thing
s you saw, we've launched in the U.K. and we're looking to 
expand presentation of the top 10, so that people can come to Netflix and 
see the top 10 most popular things in different categories. Once again, I 
think that one way that people choose content is 
by popularity. It's not the 
only way, and it's not the only way we want people to. But if they want to 
use that as a tool to guide their decision
-
making, we want to help them do 
that.
 
So publishing that top 10 that refreshes every 24 hours is one way that 
we're helping out on the consumer side. Our producers, we share viewing 
data with every week on the lead of the launch week and the end of the 
month. So they are 
-
 
we're incredibly transparent with our producers around 
the world, and we're going to be incr
easingly doing things like we did in our 
earnings letter and give you viewer stats on a lot of our projects as we go. 
Greg, would you add anything about the top 10?
 
Gregory Peters
 
No, I think it's 
-
 
you covered it well. And just to make it clear, I mean th
at 
top 10, that's a list that's available in the product. So to Ted's point, those 
members who really think that popularity is an important signal for them on 
what to watch, we'll have that available to them.
 
Mike Morris
 
Great. Greg, I'd like to ask you a 
couple of questions on the technology, the 
product side. First, maybe an update on partnerships. We talked about it a 
bit on the last call. I'd love to expand, in the U.S., the pay
-
TV partnerships 
seem to be a big part of the focus.
 
Can you talk about whet
her that's become a bigger part of the subscriber 
acquisition product? Is it steady state? Help us understand where we are in 
that process.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. It's important, I think, to ground it in the partner
-
based acquisition 
component when you think 
about all the devices that we operate on and just 
being able to find and sign up new license, that's a healthy chunk of our 
acquisition. But then when you get to the bundles, which I think often people 
think about partners equals bundles, that's relatively
 
small, but it's a nice 
incremental acquisition channel for us.
 
And so we'll seek to grow that. We think there's a bunch of opportunities 
both in the United States with existing partners and expanding the number 
of bundles and sort of the bundle availabili
ty. We'll also seek to expand that 
globally because we think there's a tremendous number of opportunities 
globally to add those kind of partners and make it easier for members to 
sign up.
 
We did a couple this quarter, whether it's Canal+ and Sky Italia wit
h sort of 
new partners for our bundles, but we've also done things like take KDDI, a 
mobile operator in Japan, and be able just to expand our presence across 
their offering, which makes again an easier place more attractive for more 
members to sign up.
 
So 
it's still small, a relatively small fraction of our acquisition, but it's a nice, 
good, incremental way to access a member base, member to be based. It's 
less technology for less early adopter, and we can just make it super simple 
for them to sign up.
 
Mik
e Morris
 
Okay. Another topic that we haven't talked about in a little while is that of 
password sharing or stealing or whatever you want to call it. As we get to a 
more mature growth trajectory in the U.S., does that come back into being 
something that's i
mportant for you to address? And how do you address it 
without alienating a certain portion of your user base? How do you strike a 
balance there?
 
Gregory Peters
 
I think we continue to monitor it, so we're looking at the situation. We'll see, 
again, those c
onsumer
-
friendly ways to push on the edges of that. But I 
think we've got no big plans to announce at this point in time in terms of 
doing something differently there.
 
Mike Morris
 
Okay. And so Spence, I'd like to ask a couple of questions on the financial 
side, the first around the margins and contribution margin. In the past, 
you've spoken to a 40% domestic contribution margin target. Is that 
something that you still view as achievable?
 
And maybe within that context when we talk about competition, do we ne
ed 
to spend more, say, on the marketing side than you previously anticipated 
as you achieve what you want to achieve on the subscriber side?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Well, first, on margins, I guess 
--
 
so the good news is we did deliver over 
40% contribution margin
 
in the U.S. this quarter. It happens to be at the 
last quarter that we're looking at the business in that way as we talked 
about it in terms of changing the way we'll be reporting going forward. And 
we noted in the letter that we'll start reporting our re
venues and our 
subscribers on a regional basis and then global operating margin.
 
That's really because, as we move to a world where we're both licensing and 
producing more and more original programming on a global basis, segment 
margin is not really the wa
y we think about the business. Increasingly, we 
think about managing to a global margin.
 
We are breaking out that regional reporting on the revenue subscriber level 
because at that level, we are directly driving our business at a regional level. 
As we talk
ed about this quarter, 90% of our growth is outside the U.S. And 
so we think about it in more than just U.S. versus international.
 
Frankly, we 
--
 
in terms of our continuing to grow our margins, again, we 
look at it on a global basis. We're driving, we 
think, scale and efficiencies 
and margin growth across the board.
 
Our content investment, while it's growing, it's growing slower than our 
revenue growth. And marketing, we'll market as we think appropriate and 
needed to grow our business. We have a very l
arge increase in our 
marketing spend last year.
 
So this year, you're seeing spend at similar levels to last year, and that's 
because we learned a lot. We learned a lot along the way. We'll continue to 
test and learn. So we find new and different ways to re
ach our members 
every day.
 
And so we'll continue to turn the knobs there, but we're very conscious 
about continuing to drive up our operating margins on that global basis, the 
300 basis point increase this year to 13%, and we talked about in the letter 
com
mitting to 16% next year. So we'll continue to do that by driving 
efficiencies in the business while doing the requisite marketing to reach our 
members.
 
Mike Morris
 
And maybe we'll piggyback off some of those fundamental trends you just 
mentioned and talk 
about free cash flow as well. A little bit of a different 
dynamic with the investment on the cash side, but you talk about progress 
toward turning free cash flow positive.
 
Can you give us insight on some of the levers there, how to think about 
--
 
and you r
eferenced the coming year, so maybe just highlight that for us and 
then really a progression of to 2020 levels, what is your expectation.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes, sure. Again, we're committed to, starting in 2020, improve our negative 
free cash flow profile. W
e talked about this year that we're expecting roughly 
negative $3.5 billion of negative free cash flow. Again, that is investment in 
future content to be delivered on our service. So we are profitable. We're 
increasingly profitable.
 
So that's why we see in
 
2020, as we continue to grow our profit margins, 
continue to scale our business at what you've seen this year, which is nearly 
30% revenue growth and then increasing margins, that ultimately translates 
into more cash flow that can be converted into conten
t investment and 
improving that profile. So 
--
 
and we've also been transitioning from licensed 
second
-
run content into original programming, so that created some of that 
working capital pressure.
 
But now the bulk of our content investment is original progr
amming, so 
we've made it a long way up that curve. So the combination of our scale and 
our business model transition is well along, and that's why you're going to 
start to see that free cash flow improvement next year.
 
And then beyond that, we're not going
 
to give specific projections. We'll 
continue to scale gradually towards self
-
funding while we continue to go 
after our strategic priorities.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Mike, we have time for one or two last questions, please.
 
Mike Morris
 
Sure. Well, I'll take the oppor
tunity to finish with a question for each of you, 
so maybe get a little bit of a 5 answer bonus here. But I'm curious what 
each of you, if you wouldn't mind sharing, are most looking forward to as we 
get through the next quarter and you come to your next e
arnings interview, 
what's the one thing that you're most excited about being able to talk about 
as we look out there.
 
Maybe I'll start with you, Spencer, and we'll 
-
 
for convenience, we'll work 
backward alphabetically by last name, so you guys can figure t
hat out. 
Spencer, go ahead.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Great. I guess for me, maybe fewer questions from investors on 
competition, but I think that's pretty unlikely. So I'll say, what I'm, I guess, 
really excited about in the coming quarter is actually 6 Underground, a
 
new 
original film from Ted's team. I'm a big action film junkie, so super excited 
about that.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
I guess I come next. So I'm super excited about The Irishman actually, can't 
wait to see that film. And also, frankly, it will be nice to have so
me of these 
competitive launches in the rearview mirror so that we can continue to look 
forward and all the things that we're excited about in terms of this huge 
global opportunity.
 
Mike Morris
 
Great. I'll go to Ted next.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Look, what I'm m
ost excited about, we've got to be able to 
--
 
we have to do 
exactly what we're doing right now, which is we have to continue to make 
your favorite show, and we need to continue to deliver it to you seamlessly. 
And none of that changes in the upcoming.
 
And 
I think when I look at the quarter ahead, these guys already mentioned 
Irishman and 6 Underground, but I also think there are some incredible 
things between there with things like Marriage Story, like The Two Popes 
from Fernando Meirelles and Laundromat fr
om Steven Soderbergh.
 
These are the most iconic directors of our time making their next film at 
Netflix. We have a building full of animators who have made the best 
animation for over the last decade making their next projects at Netflix. And 
I'm really ex
cited to be able to come in and update you on those 2 over the 
next quarters.
 
Gregory Peters
 
And I'm pretty consistent with that. I think the opportunity to be able to 
expose our members to the kind of films that we are producing right now 
that are 
being released on Netflix in such a compelling way is going to be 
super exciting, and it's super fun to sort of look back on that and see how 
that goes.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I look forward to blowing away the numbers. Accuracy is good when we 
have it, only accura
cy [without] accuracy. But it's super fun to blow away 
the numbers. So fingers crossed, we'll see every quarter. It's a 
-
 
the forecast 
is a 50

10/17/18,Netflix,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2019 Earnings Interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted 
Sarandos; and Chief Product 
Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this 
quarter is Mike Morris from Guggenheim.
 
As a reminder we'll be making forward
-
looking statements and actual results 
may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for his first question.

Michael Morris
 
Thank you, Spencer. Good afternoon. Let's jump right into the results and 
the member variance from guidance in particular. What changed during the 
quarter versus the outlook that you provided that made such a significant 
impact t
his quarter? And you didn't mention the content being perhaps a 
factor. I think that's really something we haven't focused on in the past in 
terms of driving the cyclicality, so maybe if could you talk about those 
things.
 
Reed Hastings
 
When we're forecasti
ng, Mike, in the beginning of the quarter, we make our 
best estimate. And as you can see over the past 3 years, sometimes we're 
forecast high, sometimes we forecast low. This is one where we forecasted 
high. There was no one thing.
 
And if I think about thr
ee years ago, we were also light, and we never really 
were confident of the explanation. Then, we were $2 billion in quarterly 
revenue. Now, we're going $5 billion. And so it's easy to over
-
interpret the 
quarter membership adds, which are a bit noisy. So f
or the most part, we're 
just executing forward and trying to do the best forecast we can. Do you 
want to add anything to that, Spence?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes. Thanks, Reed. Maybe I'd just add the fact that when we think about 
those paid net add forecasted, it
's really about the marginal growth, Mike. 
On a subscriber base, it's over 150 million members, so we're talking about 
plus or minus 1%, 2%, 3% in growth rates on subscribers on an annual 
basis that are growing over 20%. So if we look at the trailing 12 mo
nths, we 
grew our member base by over 27 million members. If you take that forward 
to where we think we'll be at the end of Q3, we think we'll be, on a trailing 
12
-
month basis, over 28 million members. So we're really playing for the 
sustained increase in 
growth in our membership over time, and there'll be 
some quarter
-
by
-
quarter choppiness along the way based on things like 
seasonality and content slate and so forth.
 
Michael Morris
 
Can you provide a little more detail perhaps on the gross add versus the 
ch
urn dynamic in the quarter, including 
--
 
there's the pricing dynamic I want 
to get to as well, but maybe if we just back up and look at gross adds versus 
churn and how that resulted in the net.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes. Sure. I mean generally when we looked at 
the 
--
 
the slowdown in 
subscriber growth was across all of our regions. So you talk about our kind 
of top of funnel or gross adds, we saw that slowdown across the board, 
which indicates to us some level of seasonality and kind of the overall, as we 
say, th
e kind of timing of the content slate. And also, frankly, maybe a little 
bit more pull forward of our subscriber growth from Q2 to Q1 because we 
had such a strong Q1 with 9.7 million paid net adds. But we also did see in 
regions where we increased prices, 
we did see some elevated churn rates 
and lower retentions. So it was a combination of those 2 things. We think 
the primary story was around seasonality and timing and nature of our 
content slate, but pricing played a factor.
 
Now, the good news in all of th
at, as you saw, Mike, I think in the letter is 
that in the first couple of weeks of Q3, that growth has reaccelerated again. 
We're seeing both that top of funnel growth in acquisitions. We're also 
seeing improvement in those churn rates and retention back 
down towards 
those pre
-
price change levels. So overall, encouraged with the trends.
 
And with regard to that pricing piece too, it's worth kind of reminding 
ourselves it's all 
--
 
that's all very revenue
-
accretive. So while there may be 
some short
-
term slowd
own in subscriber growth because of pricing, that 
increased revenue is very good for our business and ultimately for our 
members because we reinvest the bulk of that back into great content and 
great product experience for our members.
 
Michael Morris
 
Can w
e talk a little bit about that pricing cycle and where we are right now? 
So 2 things, I guess, specifically in the U.S. by June, the entire membership 
base seen a price increase such that there wouldn't be a lagging impact in 
the September quarter. And the
n internationally, obviously it's much 
broader. Can you highlight any particular markets, anything you can help us 
size the portion of your member base that is processing through those 
pricing increases?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Greg, do you want to take that or do
 
you want me to take it?
 
Gregory Peters
 
I'm happy to do that. So I mean in the U.S. situation, we're through all 
those notifications. Obviously in the international perspective, we've got 
different markets in different places. But I would say just in terms
 
of helping 
you size that, I mean we've built obviously that into our forecast for our Q3, 
so those effects we've already tried to account for and categorize in that 
forecast.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. Great. And then, Spence, one other question with respect to
 
the 
[letter in] [ph] the outlook. It's the second consecutive quarter you've come 
ahead in operating income relative to your guide. You're maintaining the 
same full year guidance. I know that you've referenced the marketing, but 
help us there with, again,
 
maybe why the timing. From your perspective, 
forecasting hasn't been as clear given that it feels that you would know 
when certain marketing was coming through.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Well, it's marketing we have 
--
 
and Ted should chime in, too 
--
 
but we have 
so
me discretion as to when we choose to support titles. And so we're really 
-
-
 
when you look at the back half content slate that we have, we're very 
excited about 
--
 
with Stranger Things 3 already launching, but then shows 
like Casa de Papel and Crown and bi
g movies in the fourth quarter and 
money 
--
 
sorry, I already mentioned Money Heist, sorry. But there's just 
--
 
there's a lot of content to support, so I think it was just really discretion of 
the team to move some and shift some of that marketing spend int
o later 
--
 
to the latter half of the year.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. So with some of these pressing topics covered a bit, Reed, usually 
we'll start with an overview question. And so I guess, we're halfway through 
the year now, this dynamic perhaps aside, any change to your view of the 
business strategically overall? A
nd I guess embedded in that is touching on 
that question of your confidence about the growth outlook going forward, 
and why an investor shouldn't look at this quarter and say perhaps the 
business is approaching maturity more quickly than we anticipated.
 
Re
ed Hastings
 
Yes. I mean if you look over the past 12 years that we've been streaming, in 
the beginning, there was Hulu and Amazon and YouTube and Netflix and 
we've all been growing at tremendous rates over the last 12 years. And now 
it's really catching on
 
in a big way around the world and we're having a lot of 
new competitors enter over the next year. And I think our position is 
excellent. We're building amazing capacity for content. Our products have 
never been in better shape. Our rate of investment is e
xtremely high. So if 
investors believe in Internet television, which I think is an easy one to get 
there, then our position in that market is very strong. And all of the key 
things are coming our way in terms of, again, stronger content and a 
stronger serv
ice.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And Mike, if I could just add on your topic of maturation, I would just also 
point out that revenue growth did accelerate by 400 basis points in Q2 
versus Q1. If you look at our guidance as well for Q3, I think you'll see that 
trend conti
nue as well. So financially, I think that's actually a sign that 
things are picking up or continuing to grow very steadily.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. Thank you for that.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I'd also just add too, on a similar or in the same vein, is on a show
-
by
-
show 
or film
-
by
-
film basis, we're also seeing 
--
 
hitting new heights in terms of 
viewer penetration and audience reach as well.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. Okay. Great. Let's expand the discussion a little bit. Greg, over the 
past year plus, we've talked about s
ome of the partnerships that Netflix has 
struck with the traditional video and wireless providers. I understand each 
can be different. There can be different accounting treatments. But perhaps 
can you give us an overview right now where we are on partnersh
ips? 
Perhaps domestically in particular, how they're impacting the business? Did 
they have any impact during the quarter? Of course. But just in general, 
what do we look like in terms of those impacting and where we might go 
from here?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Sure.
 
So yes, there's a long history of these partnerships starting back with 
sort of the simple device integrations back to the Xbox and Sony 
PlayStation, but the latest incarnation as we sort of added more capability to 
each partnership from just the simple d
evice integrations and being able to 
access the experience, this sort of payment integration and things like that 
is this bundling that we are doing with pay
-
TV operators, with mobile 
operators. And to characterize where we are, we're still fairly early in
 
that 
process, I would say, from a global perspective. But the bundles that we are 
doing are nice incremental accelerants to our acquisition, especially into a 
user population that may not be as tech
-
forward as the folks that sign up 
with us directly. They
 
may not have a Smart TV connected to the Internet at 
home, they may not have an adapter product like a Roku or an Amazon Fire 
TV, but they do have a set
-
top box from their pay
-
TV operator, and if we 
can put the Netflix application in a nice seamless integ
ration into that set
-
top box. If we can then include the actual subscription to Netflix as part of 
their pay
-
TV offering as a bundle, then it makes it super simple for those 
folks to be able to get the same kind of experience that our subscribers who 
sign 
up with us directly do and get the same benefits.
 
So we're going to continue to expand those. We've got tons of opportunity, 
I'd say, globally around the world to add more and more partnerships, so 
we're still fairly early stages there. But I also 
--
 
our p
erspective is that we 
anticipate that, that bundle acquisition channel is a nice supplemental 
incremental component, but a minority component of our overall subscriber 
acquisition process.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. Let's turn a little internationally as well, T
ed. Prior to the results 
today, data that we had seen indicated some strength in particular markets 
that seems content
-
driven strength in France and Germany in particular in 
Europe; Japan, South Korea in Asia. Curious if you could characterize any 
particul
ar markets that 
--
 
I realize you mentioned the relative weakness. 
The guide was across the board. But any particular markets seeing more of a 
tailwind right now, particularly a content
-
driven tailwind?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, one that we're going to be loo
king for starting this week is going to be 
La Casa de Papel that Spencer just mentioned. This is our largest non
-
English show, [indiscernible] throughout the world at a very high level. We 
also have Elite and Chicas del Cable from Spain that are enormously
 
popular 
shows, and new seasons coming in the quarter. And Sacred Games from 
India, which was a big driver for us in its first season, dropping a new 
season this quarter as well. And in the past 3 months with the release out of 
Germany of How to Sell Drugs
 
Online, The Rain season 2 from Denmark and 
Quicksand from Sweden, what's been amazing is they've been deeply 
relevant in the home country, traveled the region very, very well and it 
found global audiences. So the 3 shows I just mentioned from Germany, 
Den
mark and Sweden have 12 to 15 million global watchers. So we're 
seeing some real locally, regionally and globally relevant content coming 
from all over the world.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. And you mentioned India. It's a topic we like to dab a bit more into 
be
cause of the size of the market, of course. So I guess for Ted and for Greg 
also, in this market in particular, as we approach the second season of 
Sacred Games, a bit of a milestone, where are we on the content offering? I 
think you've referenced some oth
er markets where you can start with an 
original, it gets some traction, but you really need a certain amount of bulk 
to offer there. So where are we in the content offering in India? I also know 
you mentioned or I have seen reference that you have five oth
er shows, 
particularly series or projects that we have a green light.
 
And then, Greg, perhaps tied in with the question about product pricing, you 
made a reference in the letter to some new pricing. Can you talk a little bit 
more about both the product and
 
pricing in India in particular?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. Before we get into pricing, the only thing I would like to add is that our 
--
 
we announced five new originals for India. The one we're also really 
excited about later on this year is Baahubali, which 
is our first step into a 
really large
-
scale Indian original film. It's based on a film that was hugely 
popular a year ago, and this is a series prequel/sequel model that we think 
is going to be incredibly popular in India. And we've been seeing steady 
--
 
n
ice steady increases in engagement with our Indian viewers that we think 
we can keep building on. Growth in that country is a marathon. So we're in it 
for the long haul and we're seeing nice steady progress.
 
Gregory Peters
 
So as we're expanding that conten
t offering and seeing that engagement 
grow, we think that there's an opportunity then to be able to broaden the 
access to the service and so more people can enjoy that increasingly 
relevant content offering. So that's clearly the motivator behind adding th
is 
mobile tier offering, which we think 
--
 
it's going to be a lower price point. In 
a market where the typical pay
-
TV package is under $5, we think we need to 
have a lower price offering to improve the accessibility, but also one that 
complements the exist
ing tiering structure that we have. So that's the 
primary motivator for that move, so we can broaden the audience that can 
love that content, enjoy that content that Ted's team is making. And that's 
great because like when we launched Sacred Games season 2
, when you 
have a bigger audience for it, that means we can create more social buzz 
and more excitement about that show. So we're doing that. We're also 
working on the partnerships we have in the market because we think there's 
specific opportunities to im
prove accessibility via those partnerships as well.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. And Reed, broader question. How do you view your potential 
subscriber base globally? I think a lot of us use the sort of broadband 
--
 
connected broadband marketplace, but how do you 
see it? I would imagine 
you see it as larger than that. And historically, you've given us the 60 million 
to 90 million member outlook for the U.S. Would you be willing to put some 
parameters on what you think the global opportunity could be? Or why 
wouldn'
t you?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we do wonder, in the fullness of time, can we be as big as YouTube? 
YouTube is 7x larger than us roughly in viewing hours, and a phenomenal 
service. Of course, it's free. So the real question is can we produce enough 
content that people are willing to pay for? If you look at benchmarks, it's 
about 700 million households that pay for television outside of China, so that 
would be kind of the equivalent of the U.S., 100 million, so that's one 
established market.
 
Now, do w
e have enough content in each of those countries? Most of that is 
local content that gets consumed. But the Internet is capable of some very 
large customer bases, as you I'm sure well know. So we'll just take it year
-
by
-
year and try to have our net adds co
ntinue to grow. We still think our net 
adds this year will be larger than last year. We'll keep pushing on that. And 
what we want to do is just grow the net adds every year and then the future 
takes care of itself.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. I want to talk abou
t a couple of broader strategic topics here. Reed, 
in the past, you've clearly stated that you view your competition for 
consumers' time pretty broadly, sleep, video games, et cetera. The financial 
press though loves this concept of streaming wars between 
Netflix and a 
number of existing and new platforms. So do you think that streaming wars 
is a fairer characterization of what the future holds for Netflix and for video 
entertainment?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. I mean high level, it is. Certainly, all of Ted's worl
d is very competitive. 
It's never been a better world for talent. They get to bid themselves off 
between us, Disney, Amazon, et cetera. So there's a real battle for who will 
pay for content around the world, but it's not a zero
-
sum competition. I 
think eve
rybody gets that people will subscribe to multiple shows. Add wage 
--
 
most Netflix employees are HBO subscribers. We love the content they do 
and that spurs us on to want to be even better. So it's a great competition 
that helps grow the industry. And the 
advantage of having something catchy 
like the streaming wars is it draws more attention. And because of that, 
people, consumers shift more quickly from linear TV to the streaming TV.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. Greg, over the past 12 months, you've spent 
--
 
the 
company spent 
approximately $1.5 billion on technology. I mean a couple of specific 
questions. First, can you help us understand sort of the scalable part of that 
spend versus the incremental part of that spend? And maybe to the extent 
you can quantify, Gr
eg, to the extent you can perhaps talk about the types 
of things that would fit into 1 of those two buckets, that would be great.
 
And I think also a question that we get is really how your technology spend 
can be a competitive advantage in this competition
 
for subscribers. So is 
there anything you can point to from the consumer perspective where you 
really feel like it's, whether we see it or we just enjoy it, that separates the 
Netflix platform from the competition there?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. There's a lot 
there, so let me try and take it piecewise. I would say the 
majority of that spend we would say is a fixed cost investment which returns 
increasing benefits at scale. So as we grow our business, we get higher 
leverage off that fixed cost investment. There 
is a small portion of that, that 
I would say is sort of incremental to how we scale that 
--
 
you can think of 
that as either on the deliveries cost side. We seek to invest on the content 
delivery side to make that more efficient, so that's a fixed cost, but
 
then we 
obviously have certain elements of that cost which just scales as we grow 
the business as we deliver more streams, right?
 
But a couple of examples on this so you can see the benefits from a 
consumer perspective, just to pick a few. So one is when 
we think about sort 
of our encode efficiency. And this is how we actually take the moving 
pictures that our creators produce and then reduce them into a digital form 
so that we can actually deliver them to a variety of different clients, a 
variety of diffe
rent devices around the world in a wide, wide range of 
network conditions back to like gigabit
-
plus, constantly reliable all the way to 
super flaky networks that we see in markets, let's say, in a mobile 
environment. And so we try and make that encoding pr
ocess so good that 
pretty much we are maximizing the capability that we have, the connection 
that we have to any given consumer in that wide range of environments at 
any point in time. So obviously, that's the consumer benefit is realizing just 
a good qual
ity picture experience and more engagement, more compelling 
immersiveness in the content. So that would be an example on that kind of 
fixed cost return.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Greg, about how many AV tests do you guys have running currently?
 
Gregory Peters
 
So l
et's say, in a year, we'll run, let's say, 400 is a good benchmark. And 
these are situations where we're 
--
 
we have a theory, a hypothesis of how 
do we present a better experience which is more compelling to our users 
which gives them a better experience, 
more engagement. And we'll test it 
out and then based on how the users actually use the service, we'll 
determine if that hypothesis was correct or not. And obviously, the ones that 
work, that are a better experience will roll out largely to our whole unive
rse 
typically of users around the world.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. A place you didn't quite mention was the user interface itself. We do 
get questions about discovery and particularly with all the content that's 
being invested in. There's a survey that I just 
read about from Nielsen. 2/3 
of streaming users know what they want to watch when they go to the 
service, but another 1/3 look and they spend 8 to 10 minutes, according to 
the survey, looking for something to watch. So that's my question for you. 
Does that
 
seem right based on anything you've seen? But also, is that a 
good thing or a bad thing? And where is the interface, from your 
perspective, to making that great?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Sure. I mean we obviously track those numbers. We have our own metrics 
that we
 
use around how our members engage with the service, how much 
time they spend in the discovery process, et cetera. So we have our own 
view on that. And I think the Nielsen numbers are 
--
 
they're a good sound
-
bite, but don't reflect the typical experience. 
And I would say generally, I 
think we're doing a pretty good job as evidenced by sort of our growth and 
engagement and general growth in subscribers.
 
Now, having said that, we're bringing a tremendous number of titles to the 
service and many titles which p
eople don't know. They haven't heard of it 
before. So we have an opportunity to continually improve and get better and 
better in how we present the right titles to the right audience and in a way 
which is meaningful to them, which explains to them why a sh
ow is relevant 
to them and gets them excited about watching that. And so a lot of those 
400, call it, AV tests that we run in a year are around trying to figure out 
how do we do a better job at that. And we have a healthy road map of good 
ideas about how t
o make that better and better, and we're excited about 
that. We think that, that is a competitive advantage. If we do a good job 
there, we can deliver a better service experience that unlocks the value of 
our content library in a more effective way.
 
Michae
l Morris
 
Great. Great. Okay. So I want to talk about some key content
-
related items. 
And I think we know the well
-
publicized topics that I want to get to. But 
first, Ted, can we just talk about your current strategic point of view on 
investing? And I'm thi
nking about allocation of resources across a couple of 
vectors, global versus local market
-
focused content, films versus series, and 
I think Netflix
-
branded versus licensed. Just if you could tell a sort of from a 
high level where you stand on how you're s
plitting your resources there.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, one of those three that cut across all of them is the original branded 
content versus license, which is producing the kind of programming that is 
globally relevant and globally important. And I think w
e've seen shows like 
Stranger Things right now that plays almost completely globally, performing 
off the charts in every country in the world. We saw similarly last quarter 
with Umbrella Academy, a show that is incredibly a global show. So there's 
plenty o
f content that is global and there's a lot of content that's very, very 
specifically local, and we're balancing constantly between those 2. And every 
once in a while, you get something out of like La Casa de Papel from Spain 
that also becomes a global phen
omenon that has nothing to do with what 
we've seen for 
--
 
since the beginning of film and television, that almost all 
content that travels the world is in English from America, and we're seeing 
those dynamics change pretty rapidly. But at the same time, it
's a very large 
audience and about most of the English
-
speaking content travels. So we're 
constantly doing those trade
-
offs between the 2.
 
The overarching strategy that we're continuing to drive toward is, over 6 
years ago, we got into original programming
, betting that the license 
program would be more and more difficult to come by and that maybe the 
sources of original 
--
 
of license 
--
 
of content to license for will be under 
different levels of strain. That has paid off, we think. We think it's been very 
important to the business to continue pushing down that road, so the more 
international, more global, more original film. We also have a large 
investment coming up in animation that will serve us to see some of the 
fruits from early next year. So we think 
we're betting in all the areas of 
content that our consumers love.
 
Michael Morris
 
And just a follow
-
up. Film has been something where, clearly, we've seen 
more volume and more focus, at least on a relative basis. Can you talk 
about why film is incrementall
y important for the platform overall relative to 
the series? And is it fair to say that more effort is going there? Because it 
certainly feels like it from our perspective.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I would say more effort than in the past couple of years and 
I'd say more 
successful effort in the last 
--
 
than in the last couple of years. So that's what 
I've been most excited about. When you see a film like Murder Mystery hit 
an audience as large as it has, you'd start thinking, well, we really aren't 
benchmarki
ng against our ability to license Pay 1 movies. We're 
benchmarking against the consumer perception of what movie they want to 
see on Friday night. So that competition is for very large
-
scale films, for very 
intimate indie films and everything in between. A
nd I think the team has 
done an incredible job this year in punching those films out into the 
zeitgeist, becoming the most talkable moments like Bird Box, like Murder 
Mystery. We think in Q4, with Irishman and 6 Underground, that these are 
the kind of film
s that people just think about when they want to watch a 
movie and they're not 
--
 
not when they want to watch a pay
-
TV movie.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. So you mentioned this, Ted, and I'm happy to ask you and open it up 
more broadly, but really a big question 
about the high
-
profile content 
coming off the service over the course of the next year or so. I think the first 
question is about impact, and you addressed it a bit in the letter, but when 
-
-
 
we have The Office, we have Friends, we have the Disney
-
branded 
content 
in particular coming off the platform. So again, you addressed it a bit. I'd 
love to hear any expansion on it. One is just how much of the viewing 
consumption does this make up? Either person
-
by
-
person, I think there'd be 
differences between the am
ount of viewing and the number of members that 
are viewing it for one day. There's also a domestic and international 
dynamic. And then also just the sort of historical precedent. You have had 
content like Family Guy, X
-
Files, things like that, that has com
e off. What 
--
 
help us with the precedent to how we should think about this.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Since we started streaming 12 years ago, the consistent dynamic is that 
content comes and goes. The licenses come on, they expire, they get 
competitive, they go somewhere else, that's been true. This is the kind of 
second round with the Pay 1 Disney films. Remember back in the day, we 
used to license them through Starz and had them on Netflix and it was a big 
swing off, along with films from S
ony at the same time.
 
So we've seen the entire output from Fox. We've seen the entire 
Nickelodeon kids output come and go on the site. And we grow through that 
by, we believe, by making these early investments in original programming 
and getting our consum
er and our members much more attuned to the 
expectation that we're going to create their next favorite show, not that 
we're going to be the place where you can get anything every time. And we 
think there's more value in that proposition than there would be
 
in the kind 
of low price aggregator.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Mike, the only thing I might add to that is just, as Ted said, we've been 
planning for this for a long time, but when you look at our 
--
 
we don't have 
any overconcentration in any single studio or any s
ingle show. We talked 
about it in the letter. Any single show, even the most viewed shows are 
single
-
digit 
--
 
low single
-
digit percentages of viewing. And there is going to 
be 
--
 
as content rolls off the service and when and if it rolls off the service, 
it
's going to be over time. If you look out 3, 4, 5 years from now, that 
second run license content, there's still a very meaningful portion of what's 
on the service today that will still be on the service 4 or 5 years from today. 
So we're just going to cont
inue to focus on our strategy of developing more 
and more original programming. And obviously, as Ted said, if there's a 
second round license programming that's available, then that's still part of 
the business.
 
Michael Morris
 
Understood. Before, we talked
 
about that allocation of budget there. The 
international versus domestic dynamic for some of that specific high
-
profile 
content that's coming off, is the consumption of it and the availability of it 
consistent on a global basis? Or is this primarily a dom
estic phenomenon? 
How should we think about that?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
It's primarily domestic now. Like it's 
--
 
by way of example, we just recently 
added Big Bang Theory to a lot of our international territory. We never had it 
available to our 
--
 
in the U.S.
 
So I think it's international 
--
 
it's more of a 
domestic
-
driven initiative today that 
--
 
and success, we believe, it will be an 
international one, too.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. And then, of course, you're spending money on this content. So it's 
not like it's 
just leaving 
--
 
you have resources being freed up, if you will.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Absolutely.
 
Michael Morris
 
When we talk about though the availability of product, if there's one thing to 
take a sort of iconic piece of content off the shelf and not have to
 
have it 
recreated. When we think about redeploying that money and expanding your 
budget even further for originals, are there constraints on whether it be 
talent, any types of resources available? Or do you think that there's ample 
opportunity to go out a
nd redeploy that?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
We definitely think there's ample opportunity, particularly across film and 
television. Like we said, a couple of years ago, we were not investing in 
animation at all. And today, we're investing very aggressively. I also
 
think 
that the emergence of the next global storyteller being from anywhere in the 
world certainly opens up that opportunity, and we are becoming much more 
seasoned producers all over the world to do that.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. Great. Now, you are investin
g more on your own capabilities, of 
course. And Greg, I think that one thing that we don't talk about much is the 
technology side of the studio and production. Is there an opportunity for 
Netflix as a technology company in addition to being a media company
 
to 
take advantage of some opportunities to be a more efficient studio, a better 
studio in terms of what you're working with Ted on?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. So if you think about the number of titles that we are producing and the 
strength that we have in techn
ology and analytics, we do think that there is 
an opportunity back to the discussion we just had around making a fixed 
cost investment, either in terms of efficiency benefits or outcome benefits, 
just the quality of the dollars that get to the screen that 
impact the user 
across the range of titles that we are producing. Now, I would say it's early 
days here. So we're trying now replacing a bunch of bets and we'll see sort 
of how those bets play out.
 
But just to give you a sense of 
--
 
make it a little bit le
ss abstract and more 
concrete, when you think about after show or a movie has been made, you 
make a trailer to promote that. We use this on
-
service. We use this off
-
service, right? And typically, the first step in that process is someone goes 
through and t
hey look at all of the scenes in that show, for example, and 
they inventory like who are the characters, what's happening there, and that 
sort of provides us index so that they can actually take that material and 
then from that, use that index to assemble,
 
in the creative process, what's a 
compelling trailer. Well, we can increasingly use automation, use a 
technology investment to basically do that indexing process so that our 
trailer creators can really focus their time and energy on the creative 
process, 
taking the result of that automated process and putting together 
something which is super compelling, tells a story of what the show is in an 
authentic way and makes it more attractive to users. That's just one 
example of the kind of investments that we ar
e making that we think have 
that kind of returning leverage against scale.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And I would just add that being an efficient producer is a very good thing to 
do obviously, but being an efficient distributor and being an efficient 
marketer is P
&L
-
changing. So that's a way to think about. We're working in 
all 3 of those things at the same time.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. I want to move a little bit to the reporting and the granular reporting 
of data that you referenced on the last call. One of the 
places we're seeing it 
more clearly is in the U.K. with the top 10 list. So my 2 questions are, #1, 
can you share any results from that U.K. top 10 list, #1? And #2, what can 
we, as consumers or members, expect going forward? And then I have one 
follow
-
up 
with respect to what it means for the talent, of course.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, the one thing we are 
--
 
we said this in the last call as well. We think 
we are being much more transparent with the creators and increasingly with 
the public in terms of what'
s being viewed on Netflix, mostly because I think 
people use a lot of different inputs to figure out what they want to see, and 
popularity is definitely one of them. And we're trying to figure out how to 
balance off popularity against some all the other pe
rsonalization tools to get 
people that opportunity that if they want to see what everyone else is 
watching in their country, in their city, in their town, that we can present 
that to them in a way that helps them make better choices. But in general, I 
thin
k we're still testing the best application of that and it's still very much in 
active testing mode.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. I'd just want to comment. I think we feel like there's a great way to 
actually enable that personalization, but enable popularity signal
ing for the 
users that want it. It's just basically looking at the folks that use that 
popularity as a factor in the decision
-
making they take about on what to 
watch next and making sure that those popularity signals are available and 
very present for thos
e users. And for users who don't seem to want that, 
then we can sort of make those less present.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. And there 
--
 
as an example of a very granular piece of data that we 
shared recently was in the first 4 days of Stranger Things 3, more t
han 18 
million people watched the entire season. And why share that number? 
Because the very next follow
-
on to that was, wow, I'm one of those 18 
million. I want to tell my friends about it. Or oh my God, I want to be one of 
those 18 million. Or are you on
e of those 18 million? So it creates a lot of 
excitement in the fan base when you can give them some data to chew on.
 
Michael Morris
 
So from a public perspective or from a member perspective, should we 
expect more consistency in that type of data? Or is it
 
going to be a one
-
off 
on selected items that you feel are valuable?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. I think we'll be increasingly transparent with producers and then, over 
time, more and more. I really like that it's important for us to help condition 
the market t
o understand what the viewing data is so it's not being 
compared apples
-
to
-
oranges against things that are not similar. And right 
now, if we start publishing tomorrow, we'd be the only streaming service 
doing it.
 
Michael Morris
 
Right. Right. So the value o
f this data to your content partners, content 
creators, as you create more of these large
-
budget films, you have actors or 
other talent that historically perhaps were compensated on box office 
performance. How are you approaching that when you want to make
 
these 
big
-
budget films and you want to incentivize talent? And maybe the flip side 
to that is perhaps you have a little protection if a film doesn't do as well. In 
the traditional model, is there a way that this data starts giving you both the 
incentive a
nd the protection?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. I think 
--
 
and what we're trying to do is it's a very new model, 
particularly for box office
-
friendly talent who want to make their next big 
film in Netflix. So we have to figure out a model that, in success, how w
ould 
they be compensated? The fact that it's guaranteed, there's some discount 
applied for that. And in fact, if it's paid out over a quicker period, there will 
be discounts applied for that. But ultimately, we want the economics to be 
pretty neutral or at
 
least are similar to what they would be if they had a big 
hit film in the theaters. And that's what we negotiate film
-
by
-
film, talent 
with 
--
 
actor
-
by
-
actor.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. I'll open this up to anyone, Reed perhaps. Looking at the product 
placement
 
or rather product partnerships for Stranger Things, certainly very 
high profile, a lot of buzz, very broad. In the letter, you referenced it as 
being more about building the product itself versus monetizing. Does it 
become a monetizeable part of the busin
ess at some point? Or put 
differently, expand a bit on the benefit of doing that and how that might be 
broadened to other properties.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we're monetizing it today in more membership growth. The focus is get 
more people excited about Strang
er Things. So they join Netflix. They tell 
their friends about it. So this year, we'll add about $5 billion of incremental 
subscription revenue, which is almost all of gross margin, and that's faster 
than any entertainment company has grown in the history 
of the world. So 
what we want to do is keep that engine going, keep that subscriber engine 
going and not get distracted with alternative revenue sources which just 
don't add up when you're growing $5 billion a year. So the core focus is 
create all these me
rchandising opportunities, tie
-
ins, touch points so that 
you feel the Stranger Things energy so that more people join. So together, 
as we do monetize all that, it's just we're monetizing it through our giant 
engine rather than through little sidecar vehicl
es.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Mike, I think we have one more...
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
You should think about 
--
 
particularly in the case of Stranger Things 3, you 
should think about all those product partnerships as a character in the film 
--
 
in the show. Remember, the sho
w is set in 1985 and it's set in the heart of 
-
-
 
when the big summer blockbuster movies were jammed with product 
placement, and there was really a creative choice when they talked about 
pitching that season out more than 
--
 
almost two years ago.
 
Spencer Wa
ng
 
Mike, we have time for one last question, please.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. Great. Usually, we like to do a big picture, but this is one very specific 
financial question that we get a lot, and it's really about the margin potential 
of the business over time.
 
I think it ties together a lot of these different 
things that we just talked about. But Spencer, we've had the chance to hear 
your opinion a bit. I'd love to hear you expand on it. Because Netflix is a 
single revenue stream product, you are very clear in 
the letter that 
advertising is not part of your future despite what we read in the press. Can 
Netflix ever achieve the type of margins that we've seen historically out of 
cable networks, be it an HBO, which is a unique single revenue model 
whether 
--
 
or an
other network that was a dual revenue stream? Or are we 
inherently going to be sub
-
historical average margins for Netflix on a global 
basis?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
I mean, you take it or you, Reed? I can take it.
 
Reed Hastings
 
You got to do it.
 
Spencer 
Neumann
 
Okay. Well, look, yes, I think, yes, we've demonstrated over the last few 
years that we're focused on building a very healthy long
-
term business 
model and growing those margins roughly 300 basis points for the last few 
years to a target of 13% this
 
year. When we go for 
--
 
when I look forward in 
terms of the margin potential and scale the business, first, Reed talked 
about it a bit earlier, our aspiration, for a business that's already at 150 
million paying members, is to be a multiple of our current
 
size. So that is a 
network with a relative scale for a premium entertainment network that 
really hasn't been seen before for those comparables that you mentioned in 
terms of those historical margins, so that works in our favor.
 
And we also think about the
 
revenue per any individual subscriber, and 
whether that's advantaged with a dual revenue stream or a single revenue 
stream. And our calculus now for building a global network is that we're best 
served to focus on that single revenue stream, winning those 
moments of 
truth with a great member experience and then continuing to price 
occasionally against that in a great value proposition when we start with 
great content, create experience and then offer it at a reasonable price. We 
think we can do that in a wa
y that obviously continues to scale margins in a 
very healthy way.
 
We're not going to provide specific guidance. But when you look at those 
comparables, there are some things that work in our favor and some things 
that don't. So scale is in our favor. We t
hink the subscription model is a 
terrific model for us. So certainly, we believe that there's going to be more 
margin accretion over time. And again, I'm going to kind of leave it at that, 
but you can assume that we have a long way to go.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And Mike, well, we don't want to end on something that dry. I could say two 
things really quickly. One would be that 
--
 
to congratulate HBO on an 
incredible record
-
breaking year at the 
--
 
for Emmy nominations. They 
continue to be the gold standard that we
 
chase, and we're really thrilled for 
them. And also to the end of this month, in July 26, we're going to wrap up 
our seventh season, our seventh and final season of Orange is the New 
Black. And I wanted to thank Jenji Kohan for her incredible vision that 
helped really drive this whole idea of Internet television to new heights. And 
the show wraps up in a really incredible and emotional high and we hope the 
fans love it.

7/17/18,Netflix,"Hi. Welcome to the Q2 2015 Netflix Earnings Interview. I am David Wells, 
CFO. Joining me today on the company site is Reed Hastings, our CEO; and 
Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us today is Mark 
Mahaney from RBC. And sitting 
(00:29) in for Michael Nathanson, who 
couldn't make today, is Rich Greenfield, veteran interviewer. So we welcome 
him back.
 
Just a reminder that we will be making forward
-
looking statements; actual 
results may vary.
 
I think it's over to Mark with our first
 
question.
 
Question

and

Answer Session

Great. Thanks, David. This was an upside quarter. Let me go through 

 
we'll 
go through some of those factors. I'd like to ask you about them. You did 
900,000 net adds in 
the U.S. You had guided for 600,000 net adds. That's 
an usual level of upside. What drove it and how sustainable was it?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
We think it's content. It's the building momentum of our original content. It's 
hard to isolat
e it specifically to that. But given that we've grown at about 
600,000 subscribers for the past two years and this year we were up to 
900,000 subscribers in Q2, which seasonally is usually a weak quarter for us 
relative to Q1 and Q3 and Q4, we just had a r
eally strong slate; and I think 
it showed through in our results, both U.S. and international.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And then, Reed, as a follow up, you've long talked about 60 million to 90 
million potential subs in the U.S. market. Lo
oking at these results and 
looking what's implied in the guidance for next quarter, it looks you're on 
track to add more subs this year in the U.S. than last year. Do you feel 
better about the upper end of that range, any comment, any updated 
thinking on t
hat long
-
term range?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
No, Mark. We've been tracking at 5 million to 6 million net adds for several 
years now; and our hope is that we could just keep that going, 5 million to 6 
million net
 
adds every year for a number of years. And then we'll be solidly 
in that range, (02:03).

Reed, when you look at the price that you offer, the actual Netflix price of 
$9, when you think about the fact that the average subscrib
er is now using 
Netflix over two hours a day, it just seems like that price point doesn't really 
fit with the amount of usage. How do you think about the elasticity of your 
price point now? Do you either start raising price more often or do you 
simply let 
people increase their price and they take you through the 4K plan 
or they need four subscriptions per account, like how fast can we get pricing 
up now?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, Rich, our entry level plan in
 
the U.S. is actually $7.99 for our standard
-
def one
-
stream plan. So it is incredibly affordable, and that's part of what's 
propelling our growth. We also want to motivate people to be able to move 
up to the two
-
stream and the high
-
def and also the ultra
-
h
igh def plan as 
you referred to.
 
Over the last year, we've raised ASP about 5%. We'd like to keep that 
moving. So we're going to continue to have incentives for people to move up 
in the plans as suits their usage pattern, but we want to take it very slow. 
Things are going well. There's no reason to be disruptive. We're not planning 
anything in the U.S. this quarter. It's really focused on going very steady, 
very slow; and over the next decade, I think, we'll be able to have more and 
more content and add mor
e value and then to be able to price that 
appropriately.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
But are there other ways that you can increase price or tier pricing beyond 
4K and number of subscriptions per household? Are there other choices that 
you've thought abo
ut or even tested anywhere globally to drive price or 
ARPU?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
I'm sure there are other ways to do it, and the way that we've chosen is 
working very well for us. So then we tend to focus on 
the core, getting more 
content, more streaming, better usability and the structure on the price 
tiering is unlikely to change.
 
Mark S. Mahaney

A question for Ted. Going into this year, the company has been saying for a 
while this 
is going to be a big original content year, it's showing through in 
the sub numbers. Does it set up this issue where every other year you've 
got this tough comp in terms of new content? How do you think about 

 
how 
do you follow this act, how robust will t
he new content be next year? Does 
each year have to (04:28) up higher and higher in order that you don't go 
down with the subs and the stock and go up with the subs and the stock, 
how do you make it more 

 
how do you steady it out?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
C
hief Content Officer
 
Well, we have two things that are working for us. The one, we're launching 
new shows that have become great brands on their own, but also as these 
shows grow into their second and third and fourth seasons, they're actually 
more attract
ive on their own. So we're adding more breadth of content, 
more original series; and those series have become bigger and bigger 
brands that down the road will become subscriber events as they grow.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And then, David,
 
let me ask you one more question just on the U.S. subs. 
There was a new user interface on the desktop that much more immersive 
experience. There were also a lot of competitive launches that maybe gained 
greater 

 
increased the focus on the streaming poten
tial use case for 
consumers. Do you get the sense that either of those were materially 
impactful already or the user interface improvements of those (05:24) of the 
impact on the sub base?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
No, Mark. 
Generally, we don't see 

 
when we do a large user interface 
improvement. That's a very distributed effect. It's something that we're 
always focused on improving. Generally, it rolls out across our device 
landscape. We're pretty proud of a lot of the work t
hat we've done; and in 
fact it gets 

 
imitation is the best form of flattery. And so our user interfaces 
get imitated quite frequently across the world; and we're glad to be leading 
and innovating in that space. But it doesn't really translate immediately 
to 
subscriber growth. It's really a diffused retention benefit that we see through 
year
-
over
-
year in terms of the improvements in retention. And then in terms 
of the competitive announcements, we didn't see anything that was specific 
that we would point to
.
 
Rich S. Greenfield

BTIG LLC
 
Ted, you've talked about wanting to being HBO faster than HBO can become 
Netflix. When you think about the demographics of your user and how 

 
if 
Reed wants to get to 5 million to 6 million subscribers in the U.S. each year 
going forward for several years, what types content do you need to create? 
And what are the demographics that you're weakest in that you need to 
figure out programming to hit, beyond just simply the pricing plans that we 
talked about earlier?
 
Theodore A. S
arandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Well, I think what you've seen, Rich, is that we are launching content to 
multiple demographics and in all genres (06:45). So the reason why you are 
seeing the kind of engagement that you are seeing is that we're finding 
con
tent that everyone can love, so not just one show that's meant to appeal 
to everybody, not a handful of shows that are meant to appeal just (06:57), 
we're doing shows that are kind of very mainstream comedy, we're doing 
very elevated shows for some, we're 
also doing cartoons for kids. So we 
really are kind of programming it across demographic and not trying to be 
one thing for all people or not having our brand really define what kind of 
content that we're doing.
 
You've seen in a few of our recent announcem
ents a traditional four
-
camera 
sitcom that we hope will be watched in even bigger than traditional way, 
called The Ranch with Ashton Kutcher, bringing back the cast of Full House 
for a new show called Fuller House. But we're also doing things that are very
 
edgy, very tough, cinematic shows like Narcos that's premiering next month, 
or the revival of Wet Hot American Summer with an all
-
star cast with Paul 
Rudd and Bradley Cooper and Amy Poehler. So it's really programming 
across demographics.
 
When I said that
 
we wanted to get to be HBO before they got to be like 
Netflix, I meant that we'd have to get very good at original programming 
before they get really great at the technology and the direct
-
to
-
consumer 
relationships that they're only starting to invest in 
now.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
And, Ted, do you want to just mention the success we've been having with 
the Spanish language content in the U.S.?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Absolutely. We've rece
ntly expanded beyond our own original shows. The 
only way to watch those shows in Spanish in the U.S. is on Netflix with 
subtitles and dubs available that we're making for Latin America. And now 
we've licensed a lot of programming from Latin America into t
he U.S. and 
are getting incredible viewing on shows that were successful for us in Mexico 
that are now drawing huge numbers in the U.S. And, again, that's a very 
different demographic than we've targeted before and are just barely 
starting to touch them by
 
getting hundreds of thousands of hours of days on 
single shows. So really, really impressed with the relatively quick take
-
up on 
these shows.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
And maybe just tying this into international, as you think about the 
programming th
at you're now creating across these various segments or 
demographics, how are you thinking about the ability to leverage the 
programming and what's the success of these individual programs overseas 
versus the U.S. and some of the new markets that you've op
ened up? And 
just how that ties to David from a margin standpoint overseas, because I 
think that's a big investor question?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Sure. And the thing that's been very encouraging is that the proportion of 
internationa
l viewing of our series are pretty stacked the way you'd expect 
relative to the subscriber base. So Orange Is the New Black and Sense8 
have enjoyed great success all over the world. And all of our shows, as we 
launch, are to a differing degrees out
-
indexin
g in some cases our U.S. 
subscriber base or slightly under
-
indexing depending on the install base and 
how U.S.
-
centric or Latin American
-
centric the show may be.
 
We expect Narcos will be an enormous success throughout everywhere in 
the world and maybe out
-
index in Latin America, given the Brazilian star and 
Brazilian director and heavy Latin American cast and that we shot the show 
entirely on location in Colombia. But we also think the show will be a huge 
hit for us in the U.S. So we're seeing that great gl
obal story telling is great 
story telling.

And, Rich, just the part B of that question in terms of for investors, 
obviously there's benefits if we produce a show. If there's great reach across 
the world and we can d
istribute that show and it will be consumed and 
enjoyed across the world. So there's tremendous benefits there in terms of 
just the scale of distributing it. As we see so far, content is being viewed 

 
western
-
produced English language primary content is b
eing consumed in 
large numbers across the world. There's a lot of similarities in terms of what 
people like. That's what Ted just talked about. As we penetrate deeper into 
the markets, there might be a question in terms of do we have to add more 
of the loc
al mix into that and that will have implications for our content 
spending in each market, but right now what we're seeing is that our current 
mixture is working across the markets.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
And by the way, David, I think
 
what's exciting about that is as we add local 
programming into those territories, they will be able to find audiences for 
that around the world on Netflix, not just in that local territory. So I think 
we'll be able to find scale on local programming as we
ll.

Let me switchover to just 

 
or follow
-
up on the international questions, one 
for David and then a bigger picture one for Reed. So, David, you had about 
25% upside to the number of net international subs you tho
ught you would 
have. Was that pure content or were there other things that really helped in 
those markets, some marketing efficiencies that you found? A little bit more 
color on maybe some particular regions of the world that really 
outperformed versus you
r numbers?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Well, for competitive reasons, we gave less color on the international 
markets. But I would say you're right in the premise of the question being 
it's a little bit broader than just content driving that. 
We think we've got 
some momentum that's based on brand growth in a number of markets as 
well and we have a strong launch in Australia as well. So all of those things 
contributed to the success we saw in the sort of upside versus what we 
thought we were goi
ng to see in Q2.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And then, Reed, big picture question there is a series of these international 
launches you've got aggressively planned it seems like this year or next 
year. Can you just talk about how you plan to 
manage the execution risk 
associated with doing that many launches and that many major markets at 
once? How do you feel about managing the risk of couple of these markets 
just going off the rails, not marketed right, not contented right, et cetera?
 
Wilmot 
Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
I think that would be unlikely for any material market. If you look at the last 
four years, we've done a wide variety of launches; now over 50 nations, and 
we've learned along the way. So I'm no
t too worried about that. We're very 
focused. And I'd also say how we do in the first year in a new market is not 
that determinant of the long
-
term.
 
If I think about Brazil, we were pretty weak in the first year and now it's a 
rocket ship (13:02). And 
so, we're going to get in and really start the 
learning process, what's getting watched, why; what's generating buzz, why. 
And then in every nation we're learning. And if you think about it, around 
the world everybody wants this on
-
demand Internet TV. It's
 
just a better 
experience than linear TV. So I'm really very confident that Internet TV is 
going to continue to grow.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
This is probably a question that we can start with Reed, but you may all 
have a feeling about. Hulu was a pr
etty significant failure; I think self
-
admitted failure in Japan. Curious, where did Hulu go wrong, why will Netflix 

 
this is one of the biggest or first major market in Asia you are going into 

 
why will Netflix be successful in Japan and what are you go
ing to do 
differently from the onset?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, Hulu had a couple of missteps. But now, today, four years later, under 
new ownership, they're actually growing and seeing some real success in 
Japan. But the initial missteps, where pricing was too high, it was ¥2,000 or 
about $20 at that time a month, had no local content. So it seems pretty 
substantial missteps. In contrast, our pricing will be more aggressive than 
theirs was. We'll have a loca
l content, we may have some local originals. 
We're really focused on doing a great job. We've got more experience than 
they had at that time.
 
And Japan is a unique market because it's very brand sensitive. So Japan 
will probably be our slowest market to ge
t to certain penetration threshold, 
but it may be one of our best markets in the long
-
term because when the 
Japanese society embraces a brand, it's a very deep connection, very long
-
term. So we're willing to make that investment, knowing that it's not the 
quick route to success that might be in other countries.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
And are you seeing the CE companies come out and support you ahead of 
launch?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Yes. The CE companies,
 
Sony and Panasonic and Toshiba, they're all 
integrating Netflix into their devices. And, in fact, if you go today and buy a 
television in Japan, it's going to have a red Netflix button on it, even though 
we haven't yet launched.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG 
LLC
 
On the international side, David, if you could talk about the profitability 
ramps of some of the older markets that Netflix has been in and how they've 
looked versus either the U.S historically or some of the other older 
international markets? What's t
he profitability ramp look like?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Well, just like in the U.S. 

 
and we've made some comments in the past on 
Canadian margin getting to a 30% threshold 

 
we've made general steady 
improvements year
-
over
-
year. We had s
ome headwinds this year with the 
VAT change in January and with some of the foreign exchange which we've 
denoted in the letter to give you an indication of the impact on the revenue. 
But I'd say in general, the profile and the margin profile of each market
 
is 
steady growth. You want to take a measured approach to make sure we're 
not running ahead too fast and under investing in the competitiveness of our 
offering, but in general it's steady growth. And in fact, we've made 
comments before that our consolidat
ed markets 

 
our wave one or our first 
wave of markets were profitable on a consolidated basis; and in this case, in 
this quarter, we expect them to be individually as well.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And then in terms of your guidance going
 
forward, there's a little bit of a 
surprise to us, your international operating loss is coming down sequentially 
even though you do have a bunch of launches. I know some of them are in 
October. I guess the question, I don't know if you'll answer it or not
, I doubt 
that this was the peak international loss quarter, the June quarter, but is it 
just the timing issue and we really should see the strong content marketing 
cost behind those launches in the fourth quarter or did we just peak losses?
 
David B. Wells
 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
No, you're correct. I mean, we kind of tried to walk through that in terms of 
the timing. We've got a Japanese launch later this quarter. So you're going 
to see new content expenses and market expenses related to Japan. And 
then 
in Q4 you'll see Southern Europe, Spain and Italy, launch as well. So 
you've got brand new launches there. So you should expect those losses to 
continue to kind of work towards that; and then next year we've got rest of 
world. So you've got some commentary
 
there in terms of we expect those 
losses to continue to grow through the year.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
And, David, is it fair to say in our plans, the international losses peak next 
year?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief
 
Financial Officer
 
Yes.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
When you look at a year ago or basically 15 months ago, you were on this 
conference or on this video cast talking about kind of your disappointment 
that you were forced to basically pay for interconnect
ion and sign deals first 
with Comcast, then Verizon, AT&T, and Time Warner Cable. Today, you're 
announcing that you've convinced Charter Communications as part of their 
attempted merger or acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House to 
give up on int
erconnection fees for at least the term of the potential consent 
decree. Why this issue? Was this so important to you? Were you really that 
worried about these costs that you would support a merger simply to get 
settlement
-
free peering?
 
Wilmot Reed Hasting
s 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Yeah, Rich. I think we've been really clear over the past five years that we 
saw interconnect fees as the potential next (18:33), where it starts off at 
very low numbers and then constantly escalates throug
h a set of price 
discovery battles that impact consumers of various shutoffs to see who can 
take the pain. And then in general, it sets up an ugly industry structure. And 
then in fact settlement free was a much stronger way to go where 
broadband was great 
for what they do. We and our competitors have to be 
great for what we do and we don't have to pay each other.
 
And so we think that's the right way to go. We're thrilled that Charter is 
willing to commit to that across the entire portfolio. I think that's a
 
very 
substantial advantage for the public in terms of the growth of broadband in 
the U.S. So we're really excited about it and what it does is it freezes up 
from worrying about getting taxed by an ISP; and instead we get to worry 
about how do we make our 
experience better for consumers.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
Are there other conditions within Charter
-
Time Warner that you'd like to see 
adopted 

 
the government to adopt as part of a consent decree? And is 
there anyway given how late in the game it 
is for you to get these types of 
clauses like settlement
-
free peering into an AT&T
-
DirecTV consent decree?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
From a broadband perspective, I think this is the right condition; and so 
this 
is the one we're focused on for Charter. And then the government is still 
working through potential conditions on AT&T
-
Direct and it would be great 
from our perspective. Now that the precedent (20:03) is set and the details 
are clear, if this merger c
ondition proposed by Charter were also applied by 
the government to AT&T
-
Direct.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Two more questions on international. One, either for David or Ted. Could 
you just focus on the China market and what are the variable
s, the key 
variables to determine when and how you'll get into that market?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Sure, Mark. I would say China continues to be sort of its own entity in terms 
of the challenges and the particular characteristics of the m
arket. We're 
taking our time and being deliberate in finding a path and the right model to 
work. So just continue to stay tuned. We hope to be able to launch the 
service there next year; and we'll continue to treat it sort of as its own 
territory.
 
Wilmot R
eed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
And we described it, Mark, as modest investment once we launch; and 
nothing has changed since we use the word modest about our investment 
levels.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Okay. A
nd then, Reed, you've had a long
-
term forecast in terms of subs 
going back 10 years and you've generally been 

 
seems like you've been 
pretty right and the trend seems to definitely support the 60 million to 90 
million, the ability to park it in there some
where. You also seem to have a 
lot of confidence now about a lot of your international launches. So what's 
that bogie? How many international subs you think you can get to at some 
point in the long
-
term?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief E
xecutive 
Officer
 
Well, it depends upon the timeframe I suppose.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Long
-
term.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
But when we look at the global Internet, if you look at people who are
 
in the 
future going to be on the Internet, are interested in video entertainment, 
watch some TV and have enough money to pay for a service, that's a very 
large potential market. How much of that we'll get, how relevant we will be 
in Turkey, how relevant w
e'll be in Indonesia? That's very open
-
ended 
question, it depends on what kind of job we can do, how well we execute. So 
next couple of years, we'll be able to have a clearer picture of how we will do 
in markets that are quite different from the U.S.
 
Rich 
S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
When you think about peering, obviously you did not get Comcast to submit 
to anything because the deal didn't happen, you had the deal actually ended 
up being blocked. Is Comcast still a threat to Netflix, given that they're the 
la
rgest ISP in the country? You actively pushed for their deal to not happen 
and they have no rules around interconnection as you look at it?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, there's lots of potential threats and in 
some ways that's good for 
consumers that we have to compete with, say, Comcast's new offering called 
Stream. It's a potential threat on the peering interaction. The key thing 
about the Charter deal is it's all Internet companies that benefit; us, Hulu, 
Ama
zon, HBO Now, so that we can all compete for consumers affection; and 
it's that openness to everybody that's the key thing. We can hope that over 
time Comcast will also get to settlement free, it hasn't happened yet. It's 
something we'll continue to work o
n.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
And maybe a follow
-
up for Ted, when you think about the potential 
combinations, you've got John Malone talking pretty openly about Lions Gate 
and Stars and really wanting to roll up a whole number of companies into 
kind of 
one mega content company you've got 

 
Fox tried to buy Time 
Warner, I think they still want to buy Time Warner if Jeff Bewkes was open 
to it. But is meaningful consolidation of studios, TV studios, a risk or a threat 
as you look at your access to content?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Rich, I really don't think it's a threat. I think it may be inevitable in what's 
happening around the world today. And I just think that the underlying 
dynamics of having a great supplier relationship with peopl
e who create 
content, they don't change in the ownership structure.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Let's see, let me follow
-
up 

 
sorry about that, let me follow
-
up, Ted, two 
content questions. I think, Ted, at Con, you said something like 10% of
 
your 
content spend is now original and you'd like to get to 50%. I think that's 
kind of consistent with comments you made in the past. Any updated 
thoughts on the timing and the speed with which you can get to that 50%
-
50% level?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Ch
ief Content Officer
 
Yeah. The intent wasn't to steer you towards the percentage, it was to steer 
you away from it. Meaning that what we are going to do is continue to grow 
our content spend on original programming, both in absolute numbers and 
as a 
percentage of our total spending, because it's been working. It's been 
helping grow the brand; and more importantly, it's been driving viewing 
hours, relative to how else we would spend the money. It's been a very 
efficient investment to program with origi
nal hours versus licensed hours; 
and that's why we keep pushing that out. So I'm not trying to guide you to a 
specific percentage, because at the end of the day the total content spend 
doesn't change, just the slices of the pie do.
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief F
inancial Officer
 
And, Ted 

 
sorry, Mark, I would just say that we're still, given our growth 
rate, able to grow licensed content. We're not yet at a stage where we're 
sacrificing or cannibalizing one for the other. The numbers that we put in 
there, charact
erizing long
-
term letter our future content budgets and the 
growth of those still allow for the growth of licensed content as well. So it's 
just a trade
-
off in terms of the brand implications and the efficiency for us.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content 
Officer
 
Yeah. And I think being a partner with the studios and networks, and more 
importantly being a great source for consumers to watch that programming 
is always going to be a part of our programming mix.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And th
en, Ted, one more content question and then over to Rich; and, Rich, 
if you don't ask Reed for his thoughts on the stock price, I will after that. 
But, Ted, the Disney content that's coming on next year, at a high level 
could you explain to us how much of 
an impact that's going to have on 
overall content on the site? And do you think that that content that comes 
on, is it material enough to actually change net sub adds? Just from a high 
level, what is that content that's coming on and for a basic Netflix us
er 
what's the so what (26:05)? How excited should they be?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Look Disney has situated themselves around a handful of very important, 
very global tent pole brand, like Lucasfilms, like Pixar, like Disney Animation,
 
like Marvel. And that programming causes a great deal of excitement for our 
subscribers, both in terms of viewing hours and then potentially there could 
be subscriber events. But more likely, it's about viewing hours and people 
finding great things to wat
ch. And more than 

 
even things that they watch 
repeatedly, which is why I think that deal was more important to us than 
any other studio output deal could have been; and maybe one of the few 
output deals that we pursue going forward because of the nature 
of that 
programming, that very specific programming. It's very complementary to 
our growing Marvel relationship with our Daredevil series; and households 
with children love and trust the Disney brand, and we love the affiliation with 
it.
 
Rich S. Greenfield
 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
Does that playing off of that when you think about EPIX, which is another 
output deal that you have a relationship with. You struck a deal five years 
ago, the first two years were exclusive, it was kind of something you used to 
help build Netfl
ix; the last few years, it's been non
-
exclusive on both 
Amazon as well as Netflix. Is that important to you anymore? Is that 
contract comes up for renewal anywhere near the price you've been 
reportedly paying?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
W
ell, it helped build us and we certainly helped build EPIX. And it does have 
a long
-
term conflict which is, I don't think it's in their long
-
term strategic 
best interest to have exclusive deals; and it is in ours. So regardless what 
happens in the short
-
te
rm, our long
-
term will be to move more towards 
exclusive programming, both films and series; and that deal I think would 
ultimately have a long
-
term conflict. But, yeah, we want to have our viewers 
come to Netflix for great things that they love to watch, 
but we also want to 
be differentiated from all the other outlets.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
So, Reed and David, as you think about the stock price, I think we got a 
tremendous number of people asking kind of trying to tie back the 
performance. You're u
p over, well over 100% in afterhours trading year
-
to
-
date. Do you sense the same form or do you see the same type of euphoria 
that you kind of cited in your investor letter not too long ago when you think 
about the stock price here, or is it warranted give
n your outperformance in 
the quarter or even year
-
to
-
date your performance?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, I think it probably shows why at least I should keep my day job and 
not try to be a stock picker, because
 
when the stock was half this price I 
described it as euphoric. So it's a mystery to me. And what we focus on is 
how to get incredible content, stream it beautifully, market it in every 
country, grow the member base; and I think I'm out of the stock 
commen
tary business.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Good. Rich, our jobs are safe. Let's see. David, let's talk about the free cash 
flow in the quarter. You don't give guidance on free cash flow. Did the free 
cash flow loss that 

 
I'm sorry, the $230 
million or whatever, was that 
largely what you thought it would be?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Yes. So we've done our best to indicate the trends that our free cash flow is 
going to diverge from 

 
I mean that's going to get worse as we invest
 
more 
and more content. So indeed that was expected. You should expect that to 
continue as we invest heavily in our original content, which is more front
-
end loaded from a cash basis perspective. But we've talked in the past about 
a ratio of content P&L ex
pense to content cash; and that ratio has, in terms 
of cash over the P&L, been about 1.2 or 20%, it's drifted up to 1.3 and 
peaked at 1.4. We anticipate that ratio, it was 1.3 in the quarter, that's still 
holding. Those comments are still valid and that tr
end will continue. As we 
invest in original movies and things that are particularly front
-
end loaded, 
you might see that peak at 1.4, but we think that that ratio is still a pretty 
good guide for investors.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
And, Da
vid, you also put a ratio in the transcript or the release about 
running debt now at 4.6 times LTM EBITDA. I assume you wouldn't have put 
that in if that wasn't also something you track. Do you want to comment on 
the upper and lower band of acceptable 

 
up
per and lower acceptable bands 
on that number?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Well, I think we put that in there, Mark, just to make 

 
not to have people 
have to do their own math as particularly debt investors on the EBITDA 
number. So the goal o
f that table is to put things that people will reference 
and easily want to know upfront. That's why we put content commitments in 
there as well; and that's why we put EBITDA in there. I don't think we have 
a target range on that. We fully expect as we inv
est more in international 
and as the international loss has pulled the consolidated P&L down, over the 
next few quarters that that EBITDA number is going to get worse.
 
But we still have high confidence in the profits delivered in 2017, and it's 
back to you
r earlier question about how our existing international markets 
are doing from a profit growth perspective. Those markets are starting to 
grow. Each one is better year
-
on
-
year. The ones that were not profitable last 
year are going to start to be profitable
 
and then start to contribute 
meaningfully to profit; and then we'll see on the new markets. We have a 
comment on Japan being slow. We've got new markets this year growing. So 
we have a longer term view on the investments; and that's been validated at 
leas
t in our earlier waves. So we've got great things to come we think.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
When you think about the bundle, we've seen the bundle clearly starting to 
fray, every MVPD we hear from is thinking about smaller bundles. We're 
hearing abou
t virtual MVPDs with small offerings even if Apple 

 
whenever 
Apple tries to get into the space. But there's clearly this kind of unbundling 
and then a re
-
bundling as we see new people put packages together, the 
way Comcast is doing with the stream that Re
ed mentioned earlier or even 
Hulu new packaging in Showtime. Is there a way for Netflix to be part of 
these new bundles or do you prefer to just have it be pure à la carte offering 
standing on its own?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & 
Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, Rich, when we look around the world, NOW TV Sky's offering is an 
unbundling, Presto in Australia is an unbundling, of course the U.S. example. 
So that's something we've seen broadly, which is the rise of Internet TV and 
the id
ea that individual apps being able to choose; all of that's coming 
together.
 
In terms of being in a bundle, we would always want to be separately priced 
that we think the service has a great value and it's up to consumers to 
choose that. So it might be bil
led by a provider. So, for example, Orange in 
France does that and it's part of your cable, if you will bill, but Netflix is a 
line item say at $7.99 or whatever the local price is.
 
Rich S. Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG LLC
 
And from a product standpoint, you obviously
 
have refreshed the interface 
for laptops and PCs. Where are we? What are the big things you're thinking 
about? Kind of where you'd go from here in terms of kind of product 
priorities as you move into 2016?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chie
f Executive 
Officer
 
Well, the core is really continuing to improve the personalization, being able 
to more and more accurately present content on the screen, whether that's 
a TV screen or a phone screen that a consumer is just very motivated to 
click on an
d watch. And we've seen tremendous benefit as we've done more 
and more of that big data work. Then in addition on the user interface, we're 
always working on performance, usability, testing new ideas. We've got 
some pretty cool stuff in the lab with multi
-
video streams on the television 
screen. We'll see if it tests well. I'm pretty optimistic about it. But there is a 
ton to learn as smart TVs get better and faster as adapters like Chromecast 
get better. So there's a lot of innovation on the hardware side t
hat we're 
taking advantage of.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
We could get back to a specific question on ARPU or ASPs. In the script you 
mentioned seeing a nice uptake in our HD two
-
stream plan. Any more color 
around that? And also on the four 
kind of digital out plan, what kind of 
uptake you've seen for that?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, on our top plan which is the ultra
-
HD four
-
stream plan, there's two 
drivers. There's people who have big families
 
and want to watch more than 
two different screens at a time; and then the driver that we're really 
optimistic on is ultra
-
HD. So as more and more ultra
-
HD TVs gets sold at 
major electronics outlets over the next five years, more and more people will 
want

HD. Each stream is about 15 megabits per second. So it takes a 
good quality Internet connection. Of course that's getting more and more 
reliable. So when we see those coming together, we see over time a 
significant percentage of our membership upgrad
ing to get the ultra

HD 
service again over the next couple of years.

And then one more question on pricing and particularly the thoughts on 
global pricing. I think, Reed, you mentioned in Japan trying to come in wi
th 
an aggressive price point. As you think about all the different markets you're 
going into, do you want to offer much lower tiered pricing plans for emerging 
markets or do you want to try to maintain price integrity globally?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings

Chair
man, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, we're somewhere in between. Most of our pricing around the world is 
pretty close to the U.S. pricing. Now the recent strength in the dollar and 
then of course when you add VAT and in some cultures, you have to
 

 
in 
some societies you have to back that out. But if you look at the underlying 
price structure, at this point we're going for a model where it's pretty similar 
around the world.

When you think about Sandvine, I've been real
ly surprised by the fact that 
Amazon despite a pretty significant ramp in programming still represents 
less than you increased your Sandvine bandwidth share over the course of 
the last six months. What do you attribute the fact to that no one else has 
real
ly broken. And despite some pretty substantial $1 billion plus 
programming spend, no one else seems to be closing in on you, why? 
Because I think investors are trying to understand the barrier to entry, what 
is so different about Netflix? Are you becoming 
Kleenex for Internet 
streaming or like how do we explain what's happening?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, Amazon is growing a very quickly in terms of total viewing hours, but 
so are we. And so what's happening i
s everyone is maintaining their relative 
share, but the total amount of Internet viewing is growing at a very vigorous 
rate. So I think they are experiencing significant success on their 
investments, as is Hulu. I think we'll see that with HBO Now, because
 
there 
is massive move from linear programming on to the Internet.
 
If you mean why is our share not compressed, that's a series of reasons that 
certainly the brand, while in the Kleenex
-
type reason that you mentioned, 
the leadership gets conversation about
 
leadership. It's also our only 
business. So we're totally focused on making a great consumer experience 
as an entertainment experience; and that's an advantage. So there's a 
number of those factors and, well, we don't take it for granted. Those kinds 
of n
umbers can switch at any time; and so we have to really continue to 
double down to do new things.
 
And I think when you look, for example, at the original movie work that 
Ted's been doing, it's pretty incredible. You'll see with the Beasts of No 
Nation, a v
ery intense, Oscar caliber, amazing film; and then, with 
Crouching Tiger and War Machine with Brad Pitt coming, some really major 
big ticket studio films debuting on Netflix around the world at the same time. 
So we're continuing to try to raise the antes t
o get better at what we do; 
and I think that's the key to continuing to hold on to our share as the whole 
Internet TV market grows.

And when you think about the opportunity that you have for Internet TV, is 
there a way to thin
k about how many more markets you can open up this 
year? I mean, I think you have obviously talked about the Q3 launches. Are 
there Q4 launches that could still happen that haven't yet been announced? 
We've got that question from several people.
 
Wilmot Ree

Chairman, President & Chief Executive

Right. For Q4, we're focused on Spain, Portugal and Italy. Q3 being Japan...

Wilmot Reed Hastings

us these next two quarters, so nothing else before year

end.
 
Mark S. Mahaney

And is there anything else outside the U.S. 
that wouldn't actually happen, 
when you talk about international. Are there actual markets, anything of any 
substance that wouldn't happen in 2016?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, no, we hope to open the 
entire rest of the world in 2016. So China, 
again, we still have some things to figure out, so I suppose that's possible. 
But in the rest of the world, we're pretty confident that we'll open. And then 
we'll have to see how successful we are in Poland. We h
ave to see how 
successful we are in Indonesia. So there's still a lot of work to do.

A question for, Ted, a specific one just on the Crouching Tiger. I think this 
question came in 

 
I think that was pushed out 

 
th
e launch date for that 
was pushed out, any color around that? And I think that will be the first one 
that will be released both on Netflix and in theaters; and it sounds like you 
want to do a few others that way. Is there a greater concern on your part to 
make sure you get it right or were there other factors?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos

Chief Content Officer
 
There was a few other factors. One is that we are going to have a premiere 
of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 2 in China. It will premiere on several 
screen
s in China in 3D; and we wanted to line it up with a better window in 
that way. Give the film a little more time to do 

 
we also picked up a couple 
of extra production days to expand on the scope of the film. We're really 
happy with how that's coming out a
nd that window just lined up perfectly.
 
On the releasing in theaters, I think for us it's mostly symbolic. I think it's 
important for people to understand that these movies are not TV movies, 
they're of the same size and scale and scope of the movies you w
ill see in 
theaters. So one way to do that is to have them in theaters sometimes. I 
think the movies, as they go, will be attractive enough that theater owners 
will want to book them in their theaters at the same time that they're on 
Netflix. But in terms 
of 

 
I wouldn't move around to optimize for the 
theatrical window. So that's not really the driver. This afforded us to do a 
premiere few days early in China and helped to launch the film and the film 
brand around the world.

And then kind of probably time for two more question here, Mark. I'll let you 
go.
 
Mark S. Mahaney

RBC Capital Markets LLC
 
Let me ask one question and Rich you get the last one. David, you talked a 
little bit about gl
obal rights deals, any implications of that for the P&L? So 
just a little bit more color there. The global rights deals as you do more and 
more of those, do those allow international margins long
-
term to rise up and 
maybe exceed even U.S. levels? And when 
would we actually see 

 
we'd see 
some nice margin boost because of global rights deals. Is that three years or 
four years out?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Mark, it is probably a combo for Ted as well. So I'll take the first part and 
then he ca
n comment. But generally, it will take a while. The move towards 
the global right will be one that will take a couple of years, few years to 
really flow through. Similarly through our move towards exclusivity, and in 
terms of the P&L implications for inter
national margins. It really is going to 
be more about the penetration growth and the rate of growth in that market 
to begin with. But sure, long
-
term, we could see some benefits in terms of 
back to the earlier questions on the benefits of a global distribu
tion if it 
produces a piece of content that is consumed around the world, and 
certainly their benefits to being able to distribute that globally. And then, 
Ted, I don't know if you had comments you wanted to pile on and on.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos

Chief Con
tent Officer
 
The mechanics of it are simply that we try to gain more marginal 
subscription revenue and more marginal viewing hours than the marginal 
cost to pick up the rest of those rights, and the rest of those territories; and 
there's been some. We've b
een so encouraged by the international success 
of all of our original programming and another proof points too like seeing 
Jurassic World open number one in all 66 theatrical markets around the 
world, that if you get the content mix right, you can build th
e demand for it 
around the world in a pretty equal basis relative to the population. So it's a 
pretty exciting opportunity, and we think there's a lot more.

When you look at the programming investments that you've made and the
 
impact it's had on streaming hours, wondering if Reed could give us a quick 
update on where you stood in the quarter for total global streaming hours 
across your user base. And just how different or how much of a gap is there 
between what a U.S. subscribe
r is streaming per day, and an international 
subscriber to understand the impact of your programming?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Chairman, President & Chief Executive 
Officer
 
Well, Rich, U.S. vary somewhat from Mexico, vary somewhat from Norway, 
but if you loo
k at them all on a graph, it's a big cloud. They're all pretty 
similar. So U.S. is not unique compared to the range that we see around the 
world. And with each programming investment, we not only increased the 
viewing, and increased the satisfaction, but w
e learn is that the kind of 
programming that we should do more of, and so you really want to think of 
us as just a learning machine in terms of the programming, the variety of 
what we've done, we get so much data about how people watch, how fast 
they watch
, that really propels our programming.

No update to the $10 billion. We'll wait till we get to some nice fun and big 
number
. But in terms of binge
-
viewing, of course the most important thing 
about this call is to let you know that Friday, BoJack Horseman Season 2 
launches on Friday. So we hope everyone will have a great binge weekend 
on one of the most incredible shows; and it
's kind of controversial when I 
quoted on this call Aaron Paul a couple of years ago. So I'll stay away from 
the bad words, it is licious (44:59) show

4/17/18,Netflix,"Good afternoon and welcome to Netflix Q1 2019 Earnings Interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spencer Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted 
Sarandos; and Chief Product Officer, Greg 
Peters. Our interviewer this 
quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS. As a reminder, we will be making 
forward
-
looking statements and actual results may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Eric for the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Eric 
Sheridan
 
Thank you, Spencer. Reed, I'd love to start with you. Now that we're three 
months into 2019, against your broader goals for what you're expecting for 
the business in 2019, what are the key messages you want to share with 
investors on how the first
 
three months of the year went?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we put in the earnings letter, our weekly net adds and it's just 
phenomenal how steady and smooth and up into the right that is to start off 
the year with over 9.5 million net additions, it's a phenomenal
 
start. So 
steady progress, basically the same as many prior quarters cranking away 
on amazing content, amazing service and steady growth around the world.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe sticking with that theme on the subscriber front, we'd love to 
understand some o
f what you saw internationally in subscriber strength. 
There were some particular pieces of content that seemed to resonate 
globally on an individual and on a worldwide basis, so I'd love to ask both 
from a content perspective and a subscriber growth persp
ective, maybe to 
Ted and Greg, how are you thinking about the subscriber performance, 
especially internationally in Q1?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, the one thing that was good about in terms of the content connection 
is the things that worked best that we called on
 
the letter are things that 
worked around the world, which was really fantastic. And then we had some 
great international breakouts where they really helped drive excitement in, 
by the way of example, a Kingdom in Korea that did phenomenal and get 
watched 
and it's getting watched all over the world and throughout the 
region. So, yeah, we think we've been able to work on a very local basis and 
very global basis with the content this year, this quarter.
 
Greg Peters
 
And then from the product perspective, yeah,
 
the basic model that we've 
seen consistently across pretty much all the markets that we operate in is, 
as we launch our service, we get a chance to learn from our members, they 
tell us what content we incrementally need to provide to them, we do better 
jo
b at that, how we modify the product experience, what we need to add 
from a payments perspective, from a partners perspective, and we're seeing 
that basically in all the markets that we operate in the world. And so, the 
longer we've been in that territory 
like Europe, it's a great example, we've 
got a lot of stuff dialed in and consumers are really loving us and that's 
leading to a great accelerating growth.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Ted, maybe following up with you on local content that goes global, you've 
got a numbe
r of hits now that started as local language and went global, are 
you getting better at identifying what those pieces of content might be. 
What are your learnings as you're getting more of those types of successes 
in the model?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, we've kep
t one strict principle around it, which was that these shows 
have to be very locally relevant and to do that, you have to be pretty 
authentically local. So, what we're trying not to do is try to in
-
authentically 
make a global show, because basically that d
oesn't work for anybody. So the 
more authentically local the show is, the better it travels, which we've seen 
with Kingdom, so fans of K
-
Drama around the world loved that show and it 
resonated incredibly well for us in Korea. Similarly, coming up, we have 
a 
new season of The Rain coming out this quarter, that is perfectly Swedish. 
We don't try to make it 
--
 
water it down or make it travel any better 
inorganically and it found that the best way to make global stories is to 
make them incredibly authentically 
local.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
So, Greg, maybe coming back to you on the subscriber front, you had some 
information in the letter about the amount of traffic globally that you get 
from mobile, but we're continuing to see performance above what we 
thought in terms of
 
download of Netflix app on phones globally. Can you talk 
a little bit about mobile as a stimulant for both traffic, subscriber growth, 
and how you might go after that on the product side over the medium and 
long term?
 
Greg Peters
 
Sure. I think the most im
portant, the headline message there is actually 
frankly how much time we don't win on the mobile experience, right. So 
over 
--
 
in 97.5% around the world, people are using other different 
entertainment services, other ways to enjoy their time on their mobil
e 
phone. But certainly what we are seeing is that mobile is an increasing way 
for us to attract new subscribers. It's a great place for folks to find out about 
Netflix, to sign up for the service, even if they're signing up for the service 
on mobile and th
en they're watching on other devices like the TV, which we 
see as a common paradigm.
 
It works really well with our partners, because whether it's handset partners, 
which we can work to sort of preload our application on or actually the 
mobile operators whi
ch we can work on increasingly doing things like 
bundling the Netflix as part of their standard offering, which you see us 
doing more and more around the world. It's a great way for us to make it 
super simple for our members to sign up for Netflix and enjo
y that 
experience.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe I'll start with Spencer, but would love a couple of different 
perspectives on this. It was a solid outperformance on margin in the quarter 
and the company talked about shifting some expenses into the later part of 
the
 
year than maybe what you'd envisioned when you had guided Q1. Can 
you talk a little bit about how the cost structure evolved in the business in 
Q1, how that margin outperformance came about and maybe give a little bit 
more granularity on those shift in co
sts as you look through the better part 
of 2019?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes, sure. I think that the takeaway is, we're overall very pleased with our 
continued margin progression. We guided at the beginning of the year to 
increasing our margins by 300 basis points
 
for the full year to 13%. We 
came in this quarter slightly ahead. Part of this, we're continuing to scale our 
business in terms of some combination of content and marketing spend, in 
particular, growing at a slower rate than revenue in this quarter, in 
pa
rticular I think you saw that on the marketing line where we had a lot of 
both growth and experimentation in marketing last year, which we talked 
about.
 
We talked about the fact that we would level off that growth this year and 
you saw that come into play 
in Q1, which was a meaningful driver of that 
margin expansion. The timing in the quarter was not all that significant. 
There were some spend, particularly on timing of some creative spend and 
creative development spend on the marketing side in particular t
hat shifted 
to later in the year as well as some content spend, but nothing material and 
we are well on track to that 13% full year margin.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
And just to follow up there, Spence, just to make sure we understand the 
message from the 
letter. Still second half versus first half should be the way 
investors think about the margin profile of the business this year against 
that broader 13% goal?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes, Sheridan, I mean, you'll see some margin expansion as you can see in 
the gu
ide for Q2 as well and then it will continue to expand in the back half 
of the year. As you know, there have been some price adjustments in the 
first half of the year that have been flowing through, so that also between 
that and just our member growth, we'
ll see the benefit of that margin 
expansion in the back half.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe one more on the quarter in the letter itself, back to you, Ted, for 
second quarter in a row, you gave a lot of information about consumption of 
the product in the quarter and
 

Ted and Reed maybe to weigh in on how you think about the type of watch 
and engagement statistics the company is getting when measured against 
the broader media landscape, what that means for the company long
er term 
and whether we can expect to continue to hear that from the company going 
forward?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah, definitely. We're trying to get to a place where we could be a lot more 
transparent, both with our producers and with our customers who are 
incred
ibly interested in helping them make better choices by based on 
--
 
and 
so a lot of times, that's influenced heavily by what's the world watching. So 
being able to share some of those numbers gives people a better sense of 
what things that they might be int
erested in as well.
 
And just real quickly, [indiscernible] but obviously this show is from 
Denmark. But I wanted to point out that over the next several months, 
we're going to be rolling out more specific granular reporting first to our 
producers and then 
to our members and of course to the press over time 
and be more fully transparent about what people are watching on Netflix 
around the world.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
And Reed, how do you think about the broader media landscape? What 
Netflix is trying to sell for and
 
go after as a big opportunity over time when 
measured against the type of watch or engagement just statistics that 
company is putting up against their original content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think we're just beginning to start to share that data, as Ted mention
ed, 
and we'll be leaning into that more quarter
-
by
-
quarter. But the big picture 
for our members is, they watch all kinds of things. I mean, our members are 
watching pay
-
per
-
view and DVDs, our members are watching linear, our 
members are watching Fortnite o
r playing Fortnite, it's all of these things. So 
think of it as 
--
 
the real metric is, can we keep our members happy and 
grow that subscriber base as we did so strongly in Q1.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
So maybe sticking with you, Reed, you had a section in the letter 
about 
Disney, some of the competition that's coming into the broader landscape, 
maybe just help people frame how you see the competitive landscape? How 
do you see those types of products existing alongside or in competition to 
Netflix? And what your sort o
f view is of the landscape going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. Well, one part is great competition makes you better. And so, we're 
thrilled to have Apple and Disney in, they are awesome companies and just 
to be in the same league as them is very exciting fo
r us. And then on a 
practical basis, there's already so much competition. I mean, we mentioned 
we only win 2% of downloading on mobile, it's like 98% of the time people 
are not doing Netflix on US televisions, it's 90% are not watching Netflix, so 
there's 
a ton of competition out there and Disney and Apple add a little bit 
more, but frankly I doubt it will be material, because again there's already 
so many competitors for entertainment time, which is great for consumers 
and it's exciting for us.
 
Eric Sherid
an
 
Greg, I'd love to take that answer and maybe go to you next of how you 
think about the product itself when you see potential new competitors 
coming to the field, what do you think some of the big differentiators you 
have on the product side, how do you 
think about pricing as a company 
longer term and maybe where you want to take the product medium to long 
term?
 
Greg Peters
 
Sure. I mean, again back to Reed's model, we sort of see this broad 
landscape of competition and our job is to think about every touc
hpoint that 
we have with the service and how can we make it incrementally more 
compelling, how do we connect our members with the amazing content that 
we're making in a way which is new and differentiating, you talked about 
international, that's a great op
portunity where we think about localizing this 
content well, whether it's in subtitles or dubbing and then actually explaining 
to our members, connecting our members with those stories in a meaningful 
way, which then opens up them to watch TV shows or movi
es from around 
the world, from countries that they never would have conceived of doing 
before and I think that's a huge example of the opportunity we have to bring 
this global platform to bear and the right kind of product experience to 
create differentiat
ion.
 
And then with regard to pricing, I would say, again back to this sort of 
framework of broad, broad competition where a bunch of different 
entertainment options are being provided all sorts of different models, some 
ad
-
based, subscription at different 
pricing points, we don't really think there 
is sort of an immediate equivalency or substitution. And so mostly it's about 
how do we create more value, how do we put the right content and present 
it in the right way that's compelling and differentiating for
 
our members. If 
we think we do a great job at that, we'll just win more of those viewing 
hours, we'll deliver more value to our members and we'll be able to grow 
from a subscriber perspective like we did this quarter.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe turning to Q2, wh
ere you laid out 
--
 
the company laid out its vision 
for subscriber growth and talked a little bit about ARPU in Q2 as well, maybe 
talk a little bit broadly, I don't know, maybe Spence and then going to Greg 
as well, talk about the building blocks of the wa
y in which you're framing the 
subscriber growth going forward in Q2, the price increases that are going 
through in a number of jurisdictions, what that means for ARPU, what it 
means for churn, so investors can better understand that.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yeah, 
sure. I can start and then others can chime in. You can see that we 
got it to 5 million of paid net adds in Q2, which is similar to where we were a 
year ago. There's definitely some seasonality to our business, which we see 
in Q2, you see that again this y
ear, but I'd say in general, our paid net adds 
are very much in line with what we've been planning and targeting for the 
year. On a first half of the year basis, you see that's 7% year
-
over
-
year 
growth.
 
The specific growth in Q2 is more concentrated intern
ationally, that's just as 
we talked about last quarter, we're rolling through our price changes in the 
US. So that has some moderation on our net adds and the good news there 
is that our 
--
 
the growth in our acquisition, it's consistent in terms of our 
abi
lity to kind of grow our subscribers, there's just some temporary churn 
that enters the system in the midst of rolling out those price changes, but 

segments in Q2.
 
But overall very healt
hy going according to plan and very strong growth for 
the first half of the year and putting us on track as we also mentioned in the 
letter for another year of record paid net add growth for the full year.
 
Greg Peters
 
And, Eric, just to add on to what 
Spence said, in the guidance, you will see 
that there is an acceleration in ASP growth as well as in revenue growth in 
Q2 relative to Q1 and that's a function of some of those price adjustments 
that we talked about earlier.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
One maybe follow u
p, because it did come in, in advance in a number of 
[indiscernible], when you think about churn with the price increase, do you 
look to historical trends or do you look to sort of near term trends, because 
this was an interesting price increase that it st
arted rolling into effect in the 
middle of Q1 and it appears it'll be done in terms of going into effect towards 
the middle to back
-
end of Q2. What are the historical trends you've been 
looked to anchor yourself to or you sort of looking at other recent pr
ice 
increases on markets like Canada and others to inform how to guide?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
You want me to take that or 
--
 
Greg Peters
 
I would just say, maybe, there's a bunch of historical performance and 
modeling that we use to keep an eye on these things, b
ut generally, I would 
say things are going as expected and this is one of those relatively 
infrequent moments where as we invest more in to service, more great 
content, we've got incredible movies coming like Irishman and 6 
Underground, improving the produ
ct experience. We occasionally go back to 
our subscribers and ask them to contribute a little bit more, so that we can 
fund that next cycle of growth and everything that we're seeing right now is 
very consistent with that model.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
I would jus
t add on to Greg too that as you know, even in the US, we 
--
 
for 
the first time, we increased our entry level pricing and the overall blended 
price increase was a bit, as a result, a little bit more significant than last 
time around and even with that, the
 
churn levels are very consistent with 
--
 
when we last took pricing in the US. So it's all consistent with our plan and 
consistent with always what we've seen historically.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Along those lines with pricing being driven by success on the content
 
front, 
Ted, maybe you could talk a little bit, it's a very full content schedule as you 
get through Q2 and then the back part of the year, maybe frame a little bit 
about what you're excited to bring to members on Netflix? How so 
--
 
how 
that's lining up ag
ainst some of the key investments you're making in some 
of the buckets like movies, local language content and some of the returning 
series that people know well on the platform?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah. Well, definitely in the third quarter, we've got new episo
des and new 
seasons of some of our most loved and most watched shows on Netflix, 
Stranger Things, Casa de Papel, Orange Is the New Black, 13 Reasons Why, 
Elite, which was a big hit for us right out of Spain, a new season from Ryan 
Murphy of The Politician,
 
a brand new show on Netflix that we think our 
audiences are going to love.
 
And then you start seeing later in the fourth quarter some of our bigger film 
investments coming through like Irishman, like 6 Underground and also a 
big new original series that w
e're currently shooting in Hungary called The 
Witcher, that is enormous European IP, very popular game and Book IP, that 
we think is going to make a really fun global series.
 
So we've got 
--
 
and then moving into our kids and family and our animated 
origina
ls both on the feature side and on the series side, two of our bigger 
bets, Klaus will be on our fourth quarter animated features and Green Eggs 
and Ham from Ellen DeGeneres exec producing very ambitious 13 episode 
animated original series with the feature
 
quality animation that's been in the 
work for about four years, we're really excited to bring to our members in 
the fourth quarter.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Looking out to Q2 and the rest of the year, would love to ask a little bit 
about what you're seeing in India?
 
I know you don't break out subscriber 
additions, but we'd love to understand some of the investments you made in 
content in India? How those investments in content are resonating in the 
marketplace? And then maybe Greg you can pick it up and talk a little
 
bit 
about the product side and what you're seeing from an adoption standpoint 
in India as well?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, we've been 

 
we were super encouraged out of the gate with Love Per 
Square Foot and Sacred Games, where not only do we get a lot of viewing 
in 
India but it just took an incredible position in the zeitgeist where people 
were talking about and writing about the excitement of a show of the quality 
of Sacred Games. And then recently we followed it up again with Delhi Crime 
that people are also rea
lly loving it in India and is getting watched outside of 
India as well.
 
And most importantly, the steady drumbeat and then add to that another 
dozen original films coming in India that we're seeing the investment in local 
language content in India payback 
in the form of excitement and member 
growth and hours growth that's encouraging us to keep going.
 
Greg Peters
 
And as we sort of have that ongoing content investment and we're really 
providing stories that Indian consumers really love, it's an opportunity f
or us 
to look at how we broaden the accessibility of the service then to more and 
more Indian consumers. And so part of that is making sure that we have the 
right payments models in place and innovating and testing about our new 
models to make the Indian c
onsumer feel like they have existing ways of 
paying that are natural to them that they can use to pay for Netflix.
 
It's also much in partnership stuff. We launched a big partnership with Airtel, 
which is working for us quite well, so we can use different g
o
-
to
-
market 
mechanisms already exist that any consumers aren't familiar with to make it 
easy for them to just sign up for the service and try it out.
 
And frankly, we're also trying to do a bunch of experimentation with just our 
plan structure and thinking 
about pricing and plans and what do we do to 
test different models that allow us to bring a lower price plan with the right 
feature set at the right price in a way that any consumer and frankly 
consumers around the world can understand so we can broaden ac
cessibility 
to service now. So all of that's an ongoing effort that we think is a great 
match for the broadening of the Indian content catalog that we have.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Well, maybe if I could just follow up on one with that, Greg, it does seem 
like a mob
ile
-
only, maybe lower priced product could open up a lot of 
demand in the developing world, how do you think about some of the 
opportunities and the challenges when you think about a mobile
-
only 
offering or something at a lower price point and trying to ge
t the mix of 
content versus subscriber economics right?
 
Greg Peters
 
Yeah. I think that's a great example of something that we're trying out, 
we're not positive that's the right model, but it's 
--
 
we're quite certain that 
we should do something to find a pr
ice tier that's lower than the existing 
lowest price tier to broaden that accessibility. We think that they'll be 
important to adding members in India.
 
We'll see what the right mix of features is, because there is a bit of a magic 
to try and get the 
right set of features at the right price point in a way that 
the consumer can relate to, right, it has to be sort of natural and intuitive to 
the consumer that this is what they're getting. So we've got more work to 
go do there, but it's something we're hi
ghly focused on and anticipate, we'll 
make more progress in [indiscernible].
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe, turning next to M&A and the broader strategy for the company, 
Reed, I'd love to start with you. As you look at the strategy you've laid out 
for the company ov
er the medium to long term, how do you think about 
some of the aspects of the strategy that might be better to go out and 
acquire versus build yourself against the big long term opportunity? And 
maybe I'll follow up with one for Spence.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don
't think investors have too much to worry about there. We've been 
going for 20 years, we've done one or two micro acquisitions but no big 
appetite, no big need. We got clear sailing ahead. If we can produce the 
world's best content, we can deliver it with 
the best user interface, then we 
can grow for many, many years ahead. So that's what we're focused on. It's 
a lot of tough execution, it's keeping ourselves all focused on that and then 
we're letting other companies do many different strategies, but we kno
w 
what ours is and we're having a lot of fun just executing on it.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Okay. Spence, I wanted to jump off the M&A question and ask more about 
capital allocation. You're now more settled in your role than I think it was 
seven or eight days when we
 
did this interview three months ago, so I'm 
going to grill you a little bit harder on what you're seeing in your role? What 
you see as some of the big opportunities for you to tackle in the role as CFO 
here at the company and how that fits into the broade
r capital allocation 
pecking order for the company is trying to accomplish?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yeah. I think it's very much aligned with what Reed just mentioned in terms 
of we just see this incredible growth profile for the business. If we remain 
focused and
 
execute, it is this giant market that is continuing to shift from 
linear to on
-
demand and streaming, so there is a giant market opportunity 
globally and we want to execute against that, so that ties into your focus in 
terms of capital allocation and getti
ng smarter and smarter about how we 
allocate our content dollars and programming mixes in partnering with Ted 
and the team and continuing to invest in the product and the experience 

help
ing to continue to scale our company.
 
So we intend to be a much larger and much more profitable self
-
funding 
company over time, that is the path we're on as we talked about in the 
letter, we're committed to improve our cash flow profile meaningfully 
starti
ng in 2020 and then each year thereafter, we'll continue our capital 
structure similar to how we funded it today to continue on that path, we've 
talked a lot about that in the past. So to me, it's really about helping the 
team continue to focus, remain dis
ciplined and build that 
--
 
continue to build 
that muscle of increasing profitability and improving our cash flow profile as 
we scale.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe one more for you following up there, Spence, came in to me in a 
couple of different ways from a lot of
 
debt investors asking about the 
expansion of the credit facility, the prior comment about free cash flow 
improving in '20 over '19, how should investors think about the self
-
funding 
component versus the need to continue to tap the debt capital markets as 
you think of funding the business initiatives inside the company?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yeah. Well, there's no real change in our philosophy or our strategy. So we 
did expand our revolver recently, we did that just because this business has 
gotten larger. It was
 
an opportunity for us at the same cost of capital, so it's 
there for a rainy day, we don't 
--
 
we haven't used it, we don't intend to use 
it, but we thought it was prudent to take advantage of and we'll continue on 
our path of funding with a high yield mar
ket. As you know, we have a very 
significant cushion between our total equity capitalization and our debt
-
to
-
capital ratio.
 
We also have a high level of interest in those 
--
 
in the debt funding markets. 
It is the most efficient cost of capital for us. We s
pend a lot of time 
--
 
I 
spend a lot of time, as a new CFO, focused on our liquidity, our payment 
timing and our cash flow needs and feel very comfortable with this approach 
to our capital structure. And then, as I said, this is 
--
 
it's not a forever in 
ter
ms of using the debt markets to fund our cash flow needs, because we're 
moving towards that self
-
funding path, as I said, starting in 2020.
 
Reed Hastings
 
So I think the message, Eric, to debt investors is, you better debt in soon, 
because there's not 
going to be that much more to go.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Truly noted. Maybe sticking with content, but I'd love to start with Reed and 
then go to Ted. Probably, the most important question I get a lot from 
investors is thinking through the narrative of some of the 
license content 
that's been popular on the platform coming off over the next couple of years 
due to some of the industry players making their own decisions and how you 
think about aligning your own investments around your own original content 
to fill in an
y gaps that happen from a consumption standpoint.
 
Maybe just starting with you Reed, how do you think about the content 
landscape and how it feeds into the competitive landscape? And, Ted, I 
would love to understand from you how that feeds into the plannin
g for 
content, not only in '19, but over maybe the short or medium term over the 
next couple of years?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we don't think about it as filling in, that's very minimalist. We think 
about it as can we change the world with great stories and we
're so thrilled 
to be able to have the money to do that and to invest forward. And I think 
you'll see that the series and the movies and the reality that we're doing, 
the nature programming, I mean, you look at Our Planet, that's not filling in 
for anythin
g else, that's setting a bold new vision of what programming can 
be. And so, we're charging forward. Again, we've expected this decline of 
second window content, been ready for it, anticipating it, in fact, we're eager 
to be able to have more and more of o
ur money, be able to do spectacular 
new titles.
 
So let me pass it over to you, Ted.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes. I'm 100% concurred, and I think what's 
--
 
the thing to keep in mind is, 
this is seven years ago when we thought it was likely that the studios and 
network
s would like to keep their second windows for themselves over time, 
then we better start getting good at creating our own programming and 
getting in business with creators who could do that for us and with us. And 
that's what we set out to do.
 
And over eve
ry year, our percentage of spend, our percentage of hours 
watched have continued to grow toward our own 
--
 
owned original and 
branded shows on Netflix and films, and we're trying to do that across all the 
things that people love, scripted series, unscripte
d series, feature films, 
documentaries, standup comedy, great kids programming.
 
As Reed said, it isn't just replacing one thing for another. We have this great 
You vs. Wild, which is an interactive show for kids.
 
It's mostly being done with families that t
hey can watch interactively 
together and we'll have about 25 million people spending a lot of time on 
You vs Wild in the first 28 days on Netflix, which is an incredible success and 
it's pushing storytelling forward, which I think we're trying 
--
 
we're goi
ng to 
be doing with things like the Irishman, both in terms of windows of 
availability and also in the kind of the technical execution of great 
storytelling and that's what we're really after. So there's a lot of focus on 
what's licensed and how much gets 
watched and all those things.
 
And so on the entire history of television, there are lots and lots of hours of 
programming that people watch fairly interchangeably, but the shows that 
we 
--
 
that our members most value us for and the things that we 
really pay 
a lot of attention to, if you look at our top 10 most watched shows on 
Netflix, they're all Netflix Original brands; and the top 25, there's only four 
shows that have at least a single season that crack into top 25 even. So 
increasingly, our bus
iness is about creating and telling great stories around 
the world that are exclusively on Netflix and giving opportunity for new 
storytellers all over the world.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Eric, I would just add, if you look at the multi
-
year sort of track record of th
e 
company, we've gone through different periods of the content library 
changing where there were Epics or stores in general we've been able to sort 
of adjust the content library and really grow right through that.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah. It's hard to imagine, i
t was 2017, a couple of years ago when Fox said 
--
 
Sunset all of their second window content on Netflix off of the service to 
focus on their own efforts and we've seen how we've been doing since 2017, 
so we're pretty happy about it.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And then b
efore that, there was Epics coming off in discovery and we just 
continued to grow throughout that by using the money to invest like Our 
Planet, we commissioned four years ago. So there's a lot of planning that 
goes into this and that's what makes it exciti
ng.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Well, along those lines, I thought there was a really interesting piece in the 
shareholder letter that looked at a product that would show users the top 10 
shows that were trending. It seems like it's a beta test in the UK. Greg, 
would lo
ve to understand what the goal of that beta test is, what it might do 
for user engagement, how you think about that as a sort of natural evolution 
of the product to almost create crowdsourced content engagement?
 
Greg Peters
 
Yeah. It's an example of one of 
100 tests that we'll do in a given quarter to 
try and actually make the product experience better, but the core idea 
behind this is there's a bunch of our members who really enjoy watching the 
most popular shows, because they enjoy watching the show and th
en 
engaging in the public conversation around the show and all the memes that 
are shared around. And so the idea here is, let's look at job at using the 
product and other public communication channels to basically let our 
members know what are those most p
opular shows so they can watch and 
then participate in that public conversation. And so, we're quite bullish on 
that and we'll see how it does.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And I would only add that it's a popularity as a data point that people can 
use to choose, not the 
most important one and not the only one, but we 
don't want to suppress it if it's helpful to our members.
 
Greg Peters
 
That's exactly right. And I think, to Ted's point basically, our members have 
a broad set of things that they're evaluating, what they wan
t to watch and 
our job is to figure out, for any given member, what's the information that 
they're going to find most relevant to make that decision. For some 
members, that'll be popular.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Greg, sticking with you, another point that was raised
 
again in the letter was 
around distribution deals. What they're doing for the business is both 
growing the brand, growing awareness of the service driving subscriber 
growth, can you give us a little granularity on sort of what you see from 
these partnersh
ips? What it means for the company longer term? And what 
the landscape even could look like to do additional partnerships over time?
 
Greg Peters
 
Yeah. Again, this is sort of something we've been on a 10 plus year 
trajectory on in improving the way that we 
use partners or the way that we 
leverage those other companies out there to make a connection with 
members and start with just putting our application on different devices. So, 
yeah, there was another easy way to find Netflix and to enjoy the service 
and g
o from there, but progressively, we found things like bill on behalf of 
where members could pay for Netflix via their mobile operator charge or 
their pay TV charge, that was yet another way to make it easier to sign up.
 
And then most recently, we have bund

simplest model where you just get Netflix as part of your pay TV offering or 
your mobile offering. That's a great way for folks to try Netflix very simply, 
they have easy access to viewing on maybe their set
-
top box or thei
r mobile 
phone and allows us to access a subscriber base that might be a little bit 
slower in signing up directly with us for Netflix.
 
But I think it's also 
--
 
and while these bundled deals are great, they're 
performing quite well for us and we want to exp
and them. It's also, I think, 
relevant to note that, as a fraction through all those channels of the total 
sign ups we do in any given quarter, in any given year, it's still quite small 
relative to our organic channel or people signing up with us directly.
 
So we'll 
see more and more of those and I think it's a nice supplemental channel that 
accelerates our growth with that.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Ted, maybe turning to you on the movies front. Obviously, you continue to 
evolve the strategy on distribution of movies w
hen you think about some of 
the things having to go into theaters or thinking about different windows 
yourself for new movie content, how has that strategy evolved? What sort of 
feedback are you getting from the content creation community? What are 
you see
ing from users and how they want to consume the content? And how 
might that sort of continue to evolve the movies' strategy over the medium 
to long term?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, I think these are all case
-
by
-
case. So in a lot of times, I would say that 
we alway
s have been for consumer choice. If I had my way, I would love to 
have the movies that are in Netflix to be available in 2,000 theaters at the 
same time that they're on Netflix. We just don't control the programming of 
those theaters. So when I say that, w
hat I mean is, if people want to go out 
and have a good time and pick a great movie and if we're making the great 
movie, if they don't have the opportunity to see it on a screen, they just 
--
 
they don't go out. So the opportunity I think would be to give c
onsumers as 
much choice as possible, but we can only control what's on Netflix.
 
And we are the 
--
 
primarily we're releasing in theaters and on Netflix day 
and date, meaning that by the time they've been there on Netflix at the 
same time they're in the thea
ters, we have an opportunity 
--
 
we're taking 
the opportunity to promote the films and generate publicity for the films, 
release them in select theaters a few weeks early, but in general we want it 
to be in theaters and on Netflix at the same time, but we c
an only control 
Netflix. And I think what it is a lot less to do with the room in which people 
can consume and all those other things as we have to focus on making great 
movies. And then anyone who's involved in the ecosystem of presenting 
movies and watch
ing movies, we'll have to take notice of those films. So 
that's what we're trying to do, is just make undeniably great movies with 
undeniably great filmmakers.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Eric, we have time for one more question, please.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Sure. So, Reed, I'd love to end with you with a little bit of a lighthearted 
question, but also one that I think allows you to frame a little bit about 
where you've come from and where you've gone. I noticed in the press at 
the last week, our competitor sa
id that Netflix may or may not have a brand, 
it's what they implied. And I figure you probably disagree with the statement 
that Netflix doesn't have a brand. So I would love to understand your vision 
of sort of where the Netflix brand has come over the las
t half decade as 
you've evolved the company and how do you think about repositioning and 
evolving the brand to stay at the front of the curve of where the industry's 
going over the next half decade?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're a mix of great innovator that people 
love us for trying new things. 
That's both in terms of on
-
demand and it's creatively with a different series 
that we're doing and being really great comfort food where you just want to 
curl up and enjoy and you know Netflix is going to be great. So, it's t
hat 
combination of comfort and innovation that's so powerful for us.
 
And when I think of the quarter, just to wrap up, the one little time I was 
not watching Netflix on Sunday, I was watching Tiger Woods and the PGA, 
and like probably half of the America, 
and when I think of those beautiful 
shots right down the middle of the fairway, I think about the 6,000 
employees at Netflix hitting that perfect clean shot and that's what the 
quarter was.

Spencer Wang, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate 
Development. Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, David Wells; 
Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and 
Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. 
Our interviewer this quarter is Todd Juenger from Bernstein.
 
Before we begin, please remember that we will be making forward
-
looking 
statements and actual results may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Todd for his 
first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Todd Juenger
 
Thanks, Spencer. Just to get things rolling before we get into the details and 
one thing that makes this quarter different than other quarters is technically 

entering another. So I thought it 
might be a useful time more than usual to check in and I guess with each of 
you actually in order, maybe Greg and Ted and Reed and just if you can 

informin
g your key priorities going forward into the new year 2018 I think 
that it would be a great way to get started?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Greg Peters
 

seeing the
 
range of opportunities that are in front of us and that the 

benefits and experience which we see through our AV testing. So most 
excited that we have just so much more runway in front 
of us.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

experimentation getting out from just the core of television and film into 
things more like unscripted and other projects that are proving that we can 
do things well acros
s a broad variety of different things as long as we keep 
doing what we started doing which is hire great people, give them the 
resources to make great content and get out of their way.
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
years here 
than it is broken up in annual chunks. But certainly expansion around the 



arning better and better about how to be an effective 
global company both for consumers, for governments and for content 
producers.
 
Todd Juenger
 


questions similar to that on the way, David. 
Speaking of growth around the world, the most 

 
not important but the 
biggest metric investors often look for first in your results is subscriber 
growth. Clearly, subscriber net additions came in well ahead of y
our own 
forecast for the quarter. I guess an obvious question is, is sort of why and 
where? You addressed that a little bit in your letter saying it was broad 
based. I think you cited original content slate in the growth of Internet TV. 
But I got to ask a 
chance just for everybody who wants to expand on that a 
little bit how you did so much better coming out of the quarter than you 
even thought you would going into the quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Ted, you want to take that about the role of the big titles.
 
Ted S
arandos
 
The great thing is the big players in Q1 and the film Bright and certainly 
Stranger Things Season 2 not only landed really well with viewers and 
consumers but also were perfectly global, meaning that the watching was 
distributed almost exactly like
 
our member bases. So when a good story told 
well is a global product.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And other key things in Q4 were as you pointed out just the continued 
growth of Internet TV and we see that because Hulu is also growing, 
YouTube is also growing. And so i

Internet
-

this extraordinary 8 million net at quarter.
 
David Wells
 
And Todd just to annotate Ted and Reed, one thing is we were a little 
conservativ
e going into Q4 with price changes. And so it reflects a little bit of 
tempering of our expectations going through there. But given the broad 
scale of strength of the content offering and then the global strength, you 
put those two things together and you 
end up with the quarter that we had 
in Q4 which was great.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Makes sense. I definitely want to talk a little bit about the pricing here in a 
minute, but before we move on to that, you talked about broad based 
basically global growth. Can I ask s
pecifically about a couple of geographies? 
I understand broad based means them all, but Asia has been one particular 

want to point out specifically in Asia in the quarter or more b
roadly over the 
course of those couple quarters that are going well or not well that we 
should know about?
 
Reed Hastings
 

specifics on it. But we definitely are seeing success as 
you all know and your 
channel checks and other things tell in the different markets. And when we 


Japan; so reall

look like the first couple of years of Latin America which as you know has 
worked out very well for the company.
 
David Wells
 

our global 
launch. So for many of these markets we launched with a global product not 


markets there are stil



and a little bit younger in the smaller markets in E
urope.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Makes sense. And one of the things that you did not cite in Investor Letter at 
least in terms of sub growth was at least in the paragraph about sub growth 
was some of the plans you have with partners, MVPD partners and ISP 
partners, you
 

referring to the sub growth. Can you talk a little bit about what contribution 
those partnerships made to sub growth in the quarter, even help us box 
what percentage if you will of sort of 
net adds are on those sorts of 
relationships or total members are on those 

 
help us understand what 
proportion to your subscriber base and growth those type of deals are?
 
David Wells
 
Netflix continues to be a sort of multi
-
impression sale and so if somebo
dy 

specific promotion but it might be just the most convenient collection 
mechanism for that. That said, the importance of partnerships has grown as 
we get embedded in more ISPs an
d more CE devices and more consumer 

would say Todd it continues to be a meaningful contributor but not a 
dominant contributor in terms of being a major channel for us in terms 
of 
acquisition, again, relative to what I said about Netflix being a multi
-
impression sale. And then Greg if you want to 
--
 
Greg Peters
 

along the way in a customer journey. A

for us well is to shave off friction at each of those different points, whether 


still 

 
Spencer Wang
 
The only other thing to add there Todd is as you know most of the MVPDs 

material to our global net addit
ions.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Greg, when you think about the next couple of years where essentially all 
smart TVs have Netflix, how do you think about the potential in the MVPD 
space? Kind of roughly what percentage on a global basis are we? What 
might we become over
 
5 or 10 years?
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes, we think 

 
essentially in MVPD or the operator set
-
up box integrations 

unlike TV these operator integrations have a whole bunch of consumer 
benefits th

think about payment integration also to different demographic. Typically 
smart TV purchasers are more towards the frontend of the technology 
adoption curve and being on a set
-
up box from an
 
operator allows us to be 
in the place where a lot of folks are consuming linear TV more traditional 
and catching a little bit more of the latter adopter and then making it super 
easy for them to sign up by just actually adding Netflix to their bill or eve
n 




 
what we are in smart TVs today.
 
Todd Juenger
 

should we think about the unit economics of one of those subscribers for 
Netflix especially I guess comes to mind in terms of subscriber 
acquisition 
costs, getting a subscriber on your own versus through a partner, but then 

able to observe about the lifetime value of those two different types of 
customers?
 
David Wel
ls
 


 




inking about Netflix being bundled in with a consistently 
lower churn product that has a positive benefit to the lifetime value of that 
subscriber.
 
Todd Juenger
 
And I had one final one specifically on subs before we get probably onto 
pricing. When we think
 
about the U.S. specifically, I guess the question 
would be who is left, who is not subscribing Netflix, who are these new 
subscribers that you continue to add, where are they coming from? One 



some truth to that, how are you tracking these subscribers or these 
members who are just now deciding to sign up for Netflix? Who are they and 
how should we have confid
ence you can keep hitting those elusive groups 
that have eluded you so far?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, as you recall Todd, it was five years ago when we said we thought the 
market in the U.S. would be somewhere between 60 million and 90 million. 

at 55. So we got a ways to go just to cross into the bottom of 
our expectation range. And then we continue, as Greg said, to make it easier 
to access. And then the real driver is to make the big titles bigger. So what 
happens is so many people are talking 
about Bright or Stranger Things 2 or 


 
Todd Juenger
 
Fair enough.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

e and Frankie which launched its new 
season this week which clearly reaches an older demographic but it keeps 
getting broader and bigger every year, meaning that even though it was 
intended for a specific older demographic, young people love it as well. 
Th


market in terms of what demographics of people are watching content on 
the Internet.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Got it. 
Got to talk about pricing a bit, right. So another big thing that 
happened in the quarter was a significant on a percentage basis pricing 
increased across most of your plans across most of the world. You I think 
made a remark earlier that that drove some o
f your cautiousness in your 



 
so 
any impact at all that we should think about either maybe on churn or as a 
ba
rrier to new adds and then anything different on the mix of the popularity 


can take away from the exp
erience with the price increase.
 
Reed Hastings
 

in the U.S., so about a 10% increase. And we saw very little effect on sign 
ups and growth and thus as you said the really strong results. And you can 
take away from that that our co
ntent is just making us to be really a primary 


fundamental deal. And consumers are tolerant as long as s

improving. So we have to do is push ourselves to just keep doing more 
incredible content, downloading, easy
-
to
-


been doing that very wel


focusing now on the quality of the experience and the enjoyment.
 
Todd Juenger
 
I think you said before and please correct me if I h
ave it wrong that 
investors should think about sort of a mid
-
single digit CAGR in terms of 
average price. Is that still the way investors 

 
assuming I had that right, is 
there any change to that based on your experience in the quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I thin


able to continue to improve our content and our whole experience at a 
remarkable rate, which we can measure 
in viewing hours and things like 
that, then asking our customers to help us fund that at higher levels is 


not 

the customer satisfaction even further is to ask to get paid a little bit more 
on the current service so that we can make it even better.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Right. I think people 
come up with that value proposition based on how 

 
Todd Juenger
 
So speaking of content, you clearly have confidence that your investments in 
content are paying off. You can point to gr
owing subscribers, growing 

coming years. Let me start with this question. Why is that the right number? 
Why not 9 billion or 10 billion or why not 6 billion or 7 billion? How do 
you 

next year at least?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, at any given time that is the question. What is the right number? And 
the big one we find is that as we keep investing in content and we g
rowing 
hours of viewing and growing hours of engagement and growing net subs, 


ahead of that number. So w
e keep investing forward based on the 


 

not growing viewing hours or not growing subs or not growing enjoyment, 

hat yet.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Got it.
 
Reed Hastings
 



as we grow both 
the revenue and our content budget.
 
David Wells
 
And one of the things that you are seeing too, Todd, along those lines is to 
increase marketing somewhat slightly relative to content to multiply the 
value of that content across the business.
 



 

actually going to be better for the business overall, because it amplifies the 
value of the content.
 
Todd Juenger
 
When we think about the 8 billi
on, 9 billion, 10 billion and growing as 
investors, how should we think about the execution risk associated with 
that? That is a lot of projects to manage, a lot more than Netflix used to 
manage last year and five years ago. How much time do you spend thin
king 
about that and how much of a concern from an investment standpoint do we 
get in terms of your ability to execute on that much spend?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, we have been doubling the effort every year for the last five years 
year
-
on
-
year. And a way to look
 
at it is the investment that we try to make 

executive skill set which is picking great people, both picking great 
executives to help shepherd these projects but also picking great cr
eatives 
and great projects to run with. And if I had the same number of people at 

been ramping ourselves up and ramping up our work with creators to 
continue to keep scaling the bus
iness with our focus on is to continue to do 
it at the same level that we have year
-
on
-
year even in double 

 
with a 
100% increase in volume.
 
Todd Juenger
 

--
 
Reed Hastings
 
An epic moment, an incredible 
story.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
Todd Juenger
 

your members seemed to have loved it. So I just wondered if you can help 
us 
reconcile it. How can a film project 

 
how can you reconcile the 
disconnect between the critical response to that film and what I think you 



with that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
The consumer response, the viewer response to the film has been great and 
every kind of internal measurement that we look at in terms of viewing and 

watched pieces of original content, 

all the kind of external indicators around how people feel about the movie, 
user reviews on Rotten Tomatoes or user ratings on IMDB, you see a ve
ry, 
very positive experience with that film. So the way we reconcile it is that 
critics are an important part of the kind of artistic process but are not 

 

the way you look at it 

 
w
e look at it as if people are watching this movie 
and loving it, that is the measurement of success. And if the critics get 

that you look at who are talking to a specific audien
ce.
 
Reed Hastings
 
So I would say Todd from an investor standpoint, you want to focus on 
things like Google Trends relative to other movies like Jumanji or something 
that opened up at the same time and the critics are pretty disconnected 
from the mass appea
l, especially remembering [indiscernible] international 
at this point and most of those critical reviews you read are English language 
and usually just U.S.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Speaking a little more broadly about the film budget altogether, I think 

 
about some rather ambitious plans it seems to me at least just 

something like that.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
Todd Juenger
 
Got it. Bright was an example
 
I think 

 
of a bigger sort of tent
-
pole sort of 

 

all 80 of those films are going to be like that but just the success of Bright, 
how does that shape your thought about what the
 
profile of your movie slate 
goes for? And any 

 
of the $7 billion and $8 billion of content spend, are you 
willing to share like how much of that roughly is for what you would call 
films?
 
David Wells
 

r Ted. So Ted, let me 
take the 

 



chang
ed that. I think it probably increases his confidence in that portion set 


 
from an investor standpoint, 
feature films are an important aspect of our service that we think we need to 
get right and provide. An


 

specifics about the exact proportion of the spend. And then Ted, you can 
comment on 
--
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I would say the profile of our original films range anywhere from a 
movie like I Don't Feel at Home i
n This World Anymore that was a very low 
budget film that opened at Sundance Film Festival and ultimately won the 
Sundance Film Festival last year all the way up to the kind of tent
-
pole sci
-
fi 

 
of these 

performance of those films to increase our confidence that this form of 
subscription is a good way to monetize content at all different budget 
ranges, including the largest bud
get ranges for films where I would a while 



y one of 


budget films.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Connected to all this to me just the sheer volume of output that cont
inues to 
be added to the service everyday and there was a sentence or paragraph in 
the Investor Letter that talked about 

 
and David mentioned this before 
about increasing marketing spend faster than increasing revenue. A clause 
that you put into it caught
 
my attention said, because our testing something 
to it says that this would be a good thing to do. Greg maybe or whoever 
wants to, can you tell us a little more about what that testing is, what are 

 
a good return on 

 
Greg Peters
 

as much of the business we possibly can and has been super exciting to 
actually brin
g that experimentation into marketing and marketing around 
supporting these big title brands and how we can expose them to both 
members, non
-
members and grow viewing and acquisition through this 
purchase. So we basically run the same kinds of experiments a
nd have 
determined from that that this is a great way to spend that money to 
support our growth.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Todd, that is all accurate. We look at it as additive input on top of the 
service. And our sort of Holy Grail dream is that the service was s
o good of 


Greg and Kelly Bennett spending to see who can drive the growth of the 
titles most effectivel
y. And as we are right now, it still is a really good 
financial investment to increase on the marketing and that may continue to 

reach, social and PR of the title marketing where you 
end up having to 
spend less on the marketing. But we really 

 
as you can understand steer by 

what are the efficient ways and productive ways to get say Bright viewing 
very large 


it. And we have titles at all different ranges and we want to get people 
talking about those titles amongst their f
riends so that you get those social 
dynamics which then help us grow.
 
Todd Juenger
 
And Ted 
--
 
Ted Sarandos
 


 
that have been chosen who 
benefitted greatly from the marketing test and other shows that the site is 
p

fertile ground to learn more for sure.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And Todd, just to add. That increase in marketing spend is obviously 
embedded in our operating margin guidance. So our [indi
scernible] 300 

in that increased marketing.
 
Todd Juenger
 

accounting question I wanted to ask 
before we left content, so I guess 
Spencer or David. There was a write
-

run
-
in
-
the
-
mill business. Anything you want to say about that? But then 

 
amortization scheme for the value of content and the way that shapes that 


 
because that definitely attracts perhaps 
margins going forward?
 
Spencer Wang
 

 
said 
as is 

 

Web site, we do evaluate our content library for impairment. And when we 
do abandon a project, in this case some unreleased projects, we do write 
down the value of that. So
 
from an investor transparency perspective that 
that would be a good thing to highlight this quarter, but really not a material 
factor in the quarter because as you saw from the results we did exceed our 
operating income and contribution profit targets.
 
Da
vid Wells
 
These types of business write
-


And related to the societal reset around sexual harassment, so it was 
somewhat unusual in that re
spect.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I think it was probably a good indicator too when you have a lot of projects 
going, high
-
profile projects that 

 

concentration risk of any one project having material impact.
 
Todd Juenger
 
All right. Segueing o

with Disney Fox which some investors are probably wondering why it took 

just start at the high level, I guess maybe Reed ju
st Disney is trying to 
acquire Fox. What are your thoughts?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I was as surprised as anyone else that Fox is willing to sell. And to have all 
those cable networks together in one bundle gives them tremendous pricing 
power against MVPDs. So I cou
ld see the attractiveness of it. And then 

-
to
-
consumer service which we 
think will be very successful because Disney has super strong brands. And so 


 

lu has been, 


focus on our own consumers, how do we do the shows that we can do and 
grow our business and these 
kind of big U.S. media company mergers are 

that.
 
Todd Juenger
 

amount of Disney and Fox owned content on th
e Netflix service and the 


could help or quantify the extent there is some content that might be at risk
 
over time, how much 
--
?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

strategically been moving in this direction for a long time. It was one of the 
reasons we entered into original programming was that if we 
got to the 

that we would be replacing that with our own 

 
by creating our own original 
programming. And as kind of 

 
as is playing out in that direction, the things 
that are on the
 
site today, most of those are kind of run
-
of
-
series deals; so a 
thing like American Crime Story People v. O. J., as long as they keep making 
those shows, they continue on Netflix. Our Marvel series that Disney 
produces for us, we own those shows and they 
run until we cancel them. So 

be coming at lower volume from Disney and Fox that was coming in that 
direction for a long time.
 
David Wells
 
And to reinforce that point, the 17.7 bi
llion of commitments that we have is 
exactly that, the tractable years of content that we have licensed.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And when we say we own those Marvel shows, we get to use them for a very 
long time. Underlying copyright in that case is still owned by t
he Marvel side. 
And for example, Todd, on the Pay 1 deal movie deal we have with Disney in 





 
Todd Juenger
 
I wonder if your level of 

 

of thinking you do on this issue would change if you tho
ught about this 
expanding further. Some investors believe while this is just the start, now 

their own strategies with their Pay 2 windows where they want their content 
--
 
Ted Sarand
os
 
The big bet they have to make 

 
I would say the big bet they have to make, 
Todd, can they make more money licensing their content to us or somebody 
else by having their own services and managing their own services. That 
remains to be seen.
 
Reed Hastings
 

bunch of shows but then they licensed Star Trek to us internationally which 
funds most of the production. So think of it as an evolving mix. 
Fundamentally, if we can monetize content
 
really well, then people will sell 



not going through those other aggregators. So our exposure is significantly 

 
Todd Juenger
 
And you made it clear both in the Letter and your opening remarks in terms 
of competition from 
the new Disney direct
-
to
-
consumer services, your 
opinion on that is well understood I think. Let me ask you this nuance. Is 
there anything to 

 
it seems like Disney might be considering more of a 

 
but it seems 

maybe more adult type of service, maybe a sports type of service. Do you 

more narrow servic
e at a lower price compared to Netflix which is a more 
broad concept I think? Is there anything about that that is informing how 
you think about the space?
 
Reed Hastings
 

knows the cost of competition. But the benefits are your competitors are 

the leader in streaming. And th

other flavors and if some of it works, then we get to learn from that. So our 
view would be to let them try to innovate on those aspects and watch what 
they do and learn from consumers. Do they really love it? I

our strategy. So think of us as our thing is working and what we have to do 
is not get distracted. We have to do content at a scale very few people have 
ever done before. We have to do marketing and product at that. And if we 
do that, the 

Everyone else in streaming is trying to find one. And again, we have to 
watch them and learn. And I think in particular Disney was at strength of 


subscriber of it for my own personal watching in the same way and as many 
Disney and Fox executives also subscribe to Netflix and watch our shows. So 

f
aster because of the competition.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Let me ask one very specific but I think in a big market question about 
Disney Fox. So if that goes through, I guess Disney would presumably 
become the owner of Hotstar in India, a pretty big user base for tha
t. Does 
that 

 
in India very obviously big but particular market, does that change 
the dynamic in your mind at all in that market?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not particularly. YouTube gets the most streaming in India but Hotstar gets 


particularly change our view in India. Hotstar is a great competitor and 

Disney.
 
Todd Juenger
 
When you described the competition in Investor Le
tter you segmented into 

 
at least the way I read it into sort of non
-
advertising supporting service like 
you guys and Amazon and then free advertising supported service. I guess 

th

whether advertising would ever fit into the Netflix service at some bargain 
you make the consumer, or do you continue to see not having advertising as 
an important strategic differe
ntiator for Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 


continue to expand the relevance of a commercial free service around the 
worl
d and make that so popular that consumers are very used to and 
appreciate Netflix.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Todd, I think we have time for one last question.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Okay. Well, that always puts the pressure on 

 




cash flow that Netflix invests, the happier your investors should be because 
that shows the confidence of the service
. So if I look at sort of the 3 billion 
to 4 billion free cash flow loss for next year and combine that with sort of 
the P&L margin expansion, what would be the sign of success that the 
investors can look for to have comfort that that level of investment i
s going 
to generate the returns that you guys have the confidence in?
 
Reed Hastings
 

great shows 

 

one to three years
 
before release and then it turns into an enormous movie 


investors were quite reasonably concerned abou
t our international 


focused on the great execution of this narrow focus of what we do, not 
getting distracted by ever
ybody else. And I think the core thing is betting on 
the track record of our ability to invest that money well so that as we bring 
those content to the service in 2019, 2020 and begin to expense it that 


 

 
value. But the core thing 
is betting on the track record that we have.
 
David Wells
 
And if I can bag a CFO angle on this, Todd, in terms of 

 

our indications last quarter on where we were going. Yes, the content spend 
has somewhat come
 


we grew the business in 2017 seeing accelerating growth in the business, 

t too far off. It might be 
a little bit higher in terms of that reinvestment in the business, but I do 


c

enough room for continued growth and acceleration in that growth of the 
business, but we are seeing some of those pressures moderate a bit. And as

10/18/17,Netflix,"Welcome to the Q1 2015 Netflix earnings call. I am David Wells, CFO. Today, 
I will be joined on the company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO and Ted 
Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us will be Mark Mahaney 
from RBC and Michael 
Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.
 
I think Mark has the first questions. So over to you Mark.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Thanks, David. First question is for Reed. This was maybe an 
inflection point quarter in terms of the 
domestic streaming sub adds. They 
came in materially ahead of your guidance. They were actually up a little bit 
year
-
over
-
year, which is a bit of a surprise. In the press release you talked 
about both getting more subs in and retaining them better, maybe t
han you 
had expected. Could you provide a little bit more color? And is this 
something that you think is happening across the industry, the greater focus 
on streaming offerings is just helping the leader in the market? Or is there 
something specific that y
ou are doing on both of those ends, the gross sub 
adds and the churn?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We have continued the focus on the same things over the last couple of 
years, improving the content, improving the streaming, improving the user 
interface. And we have seen
 
the rewards of that in continued growth. I think 
this quarter in particular, we had some amazing original content with 
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, with House of Cards, with Bloodline. And so all 
of that compounded to really push us forward and certainly wh
at you are 
seeing is all of Internet TV growing. The attention of the new launches of the 
competitors is only creating a bigger ecosystem, drawing more and more 
people into thinking, hey I have got a check that out and try this Internet TV 
thing.
 
Mark Maha
ney
 
And Reed, for some time you have talked about a long
-
term goal of 60 to 90 
million subs. At this pace, sooner or later the financial markets might 
actually agree with you. Any updated thinking on where we could fall in that 
range and when we could get 
to that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I would say they agree with us already. I mean at a $25 billion to $30 
billion market cap, there is a lot of growth pressed into it, I think you would 
agree. And so yes, 60 to 90 million feels great for us. We are continuing to
 
grow. That's the 60 to 90 million in the U.S. market. Of course, the really big 
upside beyond that is in international. For most global Internet firms, the 
U.S. is 20% to 35% of usage and revenue. We are not anywhere close to 
that yet, but we are continui
ng to invest in international.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Reed in the past quarter, we have seen new entrants like HBO NOW and 
Sony Vue come out with pricing, it looks pretty expensive relative to Netflix. 
I wonder, do you think you have a pricing umbrella, given w
here they have 
launched their products relative to where you guys have price today?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, no. I think HBO at $15 is a great value. I mean I have traditionally 
paid more than $15 for my cable company for it. So I think they are doing 
great wor
k with their premium content. It does create obvious underline of 
just how great the value is of Netflix with prices ranging from $7.99 to 
$11.99. But we are really comfortable with that strategy. We are continuing 
to grow with this strategy and it is an i
ncredible value. But I think we you 
should really think about it is all the Internet services HBO Now, Netflix and 
Hulu are great values in comparison to the big bundle.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay. And David for the current quarter, you talk about the trend on
 
churn. 
I know you guys don't give out churn numbers, but what was the impact of 
original content on churn this year versus a year ago?
 
David Wells
 
Well, as Reed said, just picking up on those comments, you really do see the 
improvements in the service, bo
th on the content, the interface, the 
payments across the globe really move together. So you see that with 
acquisition and churn improving, but we did see improving churn. So we are 
saying that we saw improving retention through the quarter and that 
contri
buted to that net add performance and growth that we saw in Q1.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Great. And David, if I could stick on the U.S. business, last quarter you 
talked about 30%
-
ish margins, 90 days later we are already materially 
above that and you are telling peop
le to expect your business to be above 
that. So just, I know there are some stuff in the press release on it, but any 
more color on why there is such a pretty material shift in the margins and to 
what extent should we just be concerned that you are just pu
shing content 
cost in international markets, so really there is not an improvement in the 
leverage here in the U.S. business?
 
David Wells
 
Well, it's both, Mark. So there is absolutely an improvement driven by the 
growth. We are growing revenue faster than 
we are growing our expenses. 
But in terms of the outperformance relative to our target of where we would 
want to be in terms of U.S. margin growth, it's a couple of the things that 
we have talked about in the letter. One of them is, we are shifting marketi
ng 
from the U.S. to international. We think we can grow a little bit faster on 
international. It's more efficient to do that.
 
And the second thing is a little bit of just the mechanics of how we allocate 
content cost by geography. So by growing faster inte
rnationally and putting 
that allocation more towards international, it's going to provide some relief 
to those global originals in the global projects that we do have that are 
allocated to the U.S. and we intend to continue to invest in that. That's also 
w
hy we put in the letter that our target remains the same, 40% in 2020.
 
So we want to continue to balance the growth of profit with the growth and 
the competitiveness of our service. We want to reinvest in the service 
prudently along the way.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
S
o let me ask a two part follow
-
on question to that, one for David and one 
for Ted. David, coming back, marketing spend in the U.S. in an increasingly 
competitive market, some level that feels a little extra risky than you should 
be doing. So can you just t
alk through why you are so confident you don't 
need, you can cut back on those marketing dollars in the U.S. beyond just 
one quarter of better
-
than
-
expected results?
 
And then Ted, last quarter in the letter, there was this bolded section, 
therefore it caug
ht my eye, about content spend being more efficient with 
original content than with licensed content. Do you feel like you have really 
reached a point that that's what we are seeing in the business model today 
that you are continuing to see more leverage j
ust with that original content 
purchase?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes. I will take the last question first there. What we are seeing is the dollars 
invested in our original programming are more efficient, in that for every 
dollar spent, we get more bang for the buck in terms of hours viewed. And 
hours viewed leads to hig
her retention, more word
-
of
-
mouth and more 
brand halo. So that why we say that it turned out to be not just an 
important strategic investment but also an efficient one.
 
David Wells
 
And Mark, on your first question about our relative comfort with moving 
dol
lars out of the U.S. and in to international, which is one quarter. I would 
say we have had multiple quarters of strong growth. Marketing dollars have 
been up, they have been down. I don't think there is a direct connection 
within one quarter in terms of t
he level of marketing spend and the level of 
growth that we see. We have migrated over the last two to three years to be 
more content forward in our marketing, more digital in our marketing. We 
are getting smarter and more efficient about how we put those 
dollars to 
use. And so right now we think there is a greater opportunity with 
international and that's what we are doing, we are moving to international 
spending.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Ted, in the past six months, we have seen Viacom and Turner write down 
the 
value of acquired syndicated content. Truly the value of the content 
wasn't worth what they were paying. Can you talk a bit about your own 
usage trends on acquired content? And whether or not you think the long
-
term trend for what you are acquiring will be
 
declining on a per hour basis?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Look, as we continue to grow, the thing that's most encouraging is that the 
content we are licensing around the world has got equal and sometimes 
even disproportionate value to us outside of the U.S. So what we 
are seeing 
real global value from licensing shows in multiple territories. And as we are 
continuing to grow domestically, we are seeing those viewing hours on 
licensed content, even older licensed content as we saw with Friends last 
quarter where the viewi
ng continues to grow. So we are still seeing a lot of 
value from that programming, both our original and our licensed 
programming from all those sources.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
And you expect the price paid going forward will be trending up or down for 
the acqu
ired?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It's tough to say. Mostly it's a reflection of how many buyers are in the 
market. So we have got a few other people into the market, there is some 
value in having a larger footprint and being able to bring more value to the 
franchise, wh
at for being on Netflix that we get to realize in our negotiations. 
But I think most of those prices, up and down, is driven by the number of 
competitive buyers in the marketplace.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay. Then let me ask one more for David. You mentioned b
efore on the 
content spend shift between U.S. and international. Can you remind us again 
how you amortized content between domestic and international markets? 
How do you decide what the allocation rates are between the two 
geographies?
 
David Wells
 
Sure, Mi
chael. In terms of how we amortize is straight line for originals, 
there is accelerated. How we allocate across countries or territories between 
the operating segment of domestic and international is based on the relative 
value of that content. So we use t
he PwC media survey to help validate what 
that content would be worth in that market. And there's pluses and minuses 
to various types of allocation. We have looked at many types. So we think 
that's the most accurate in terms of ascribing the relative value
 
of content 
within each market.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And David Wells, if we have a global content, where does the allocation for 
Poland show up today?
 
David Wells
 
Today, the allocation for Poland is going to be spread across because we 
haven't yet launched that m
arket. So what's little bit new for us is we now 
have clear line of sight that we are launching the rest of the world, which is 
new relative to the last six to nine months. So we shifted a bit and you are 
seeing part of that Poland, if we sign a global rig
ht for Poland, distributed 
across our current territories. A year ago you would have seen us, if it was 
going to be launched in the next year park that on the balance sheet and 
then start amortizing it once we launched Poland. And if we prospectively 
signe
d up for a Poland right and we just didn't have line of sight to the next 
year whether we were going to launch the territory, that would be spread 
across the existing territories that we were in, which is what we would do 
today.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
If we back it 
up a few years, we would have sold off Poland, not knowing 
what to do with it and look for it later.
 
Reed Hastings
 
That's right.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. If I can get back to Reed on a question I came up really about pricing 
and maybe tearing power. So Reed, you
r latest thinking, given the 
momentum in the business and the ability to raise fees or raise ARPU over 
time and particularly via tearing either be it service and number of lines or 
content, your latest thoughts on your pricing and tearing power today?
 
Reed
 
Hastings
 
Well, Mark, we are super happy right where we are. We have got a great 
mix of pricing plans and options and for those who get a new 4K television 
and they are excited about 4K content, we are the leading service in the 
world for 4K and that plan 
is a little more expensive at $11.99. So as more 
4K TV is sold, we will get people to upgrade to the $11.99 plan.
 
In terms of the total pricing structure, we couldn't be happier with the way it 
creates an incredible value for the consumers. It feels 
fair to them and it's 
propelling our growth.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Now let me pivot over to the international markets. So we also had 
subs upside in the U.S., we had subs upside internationally. Could you talk 
about where that came from? What wasn't mentioned
 
in the letter was 
Germany and France, those are obviously major markets. Maybe they are 
growing in line or little less than you thought? What was mentioned is 
Australia, New Zealand. So any particular color there on which countries are 
performing in line,
 
better and worse than expectations?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. That's somewhat of a recency bias. We launched France and Germany 
six or eight months ago and we talked about it in the immediate aftermath 
also that they were successful launches. Now we have added 
Australia, New 
Zealand. And all of these markets, the Internet and Internet television is 
catching on and we are leading relative to competitors and we have got 
competitors all around the world. In each market, there is a series of 
competitors. So we are f
eeling very bullish on the long
-
term in all of these 
markets. We have seeing when we entered in Latin America three or four 
years ago that it takes us a year or two to build the brand and get 
awareness. But think of it as every country in the world are and
 
consumers 
in every country in the world want the benefits of Internet television choice 
and selection and price. So absent severe piracy that might be in some of 
the newer countries, I think we are going to see large commercial success.
 
David Wells
 
And Ma
rk, this is David. There was no one particular market that drove that. 
So there were multiple markets that drove that outperformance relative to 
what we thought to our forecast.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
And in Reed's tweet a couple days ago, you mentioned 10 bill
ion hours 
consumed in the quarter. Could you us give a sense of consumption rates 
domestically and internationally? Are there any international markets that 
jump out to be above normal consumers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There is variation between countries. Some cou
ntries are amazing. And U.S. 
is one of them. But it's not the biggest. So for competitive reasons, I am not 
going to give your precise color. But there is variations. And what's great 
about the viewing is if you look two years ago in this call, we said it 
was 4 
billion hours in the Q1 and over those two years, we have gone from 4 
billion to 10 billion hours of viewing. And so you can see along with our 
membership growth, we are also having engagement growth, which given all 
the new competitors, improving te
levision, is really impressive that Netflix is 
growing not only the subs but engagement also.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay. And then Ted, you recently mentioned that in China, it sounds like you 
have a go alone strategy. So what is your timing on China's launch 
and how 
does that strategy impact your actual launch in China?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, Michael, a bit of that press was lost in translation a bit. I was 
explaining to the questioner why we have not taken up partners in the past. 
But it's not a reflection of whe
ther we want to or what we are willing to do in 
China. We are anxious and open to all forms of doing business in China. So 
the press was a little bit out of context there.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. David last quarter in your script press release, you bolded one o
f 
those things was the expansion to all global market by the end of 2016. Is 
there an update on that given what's happened in the half of the year? Are 
you accelerating that timeline?
 
David Wells
 
There is no update other than the expectation for us to laun
ch in 2016 was 
as an acceleration of our earlier stated objective. So no further update.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And then for the June quarter, you talk about an increase in the operating 
loss to $101 million. You have got bigger launches in the back half of the 
year
. Help us think about when the peak operating loss quarter is in 
international and what the size of that be? Could that be, if it's $100 million 
in the June quarter, what's the worst
-
case scenario? Are you willing to run it 
to $200 million loss in anyone q
uarter?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I don't provide specific guidance four or five quarters out for our 
operating loss. But we have said that we are committed to running the 
business at global breakeven and we have ambitious plans to launch 
international. So this qu
arter, what you have you see our guide with the full 
sort of Australia, New Zealand, you see our guide with additional 
investments in marketing and some content. We will have some bigger 
launches and we described as a meaningful and significant in the back
 
half 
of this year. So you should expect those losses to trend upward and into 
2016 and then to improve from there.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Recently Reed, you changed your terms and conditions to alert people who 
use VPNs that they can be shut down from usage. W
e have heard a lot from 
our clients who are outside the U.S. as they do use VPNs to watch U.S. 
content. Why did you change the terms and conditions?
 
And for Ted, are studios asking you about VPN usage? Is that part of the 
reason?
 
Reed Hastings
 
So with VPN usage, that's where someone, to bring up Poland again where 
we are not yet operating, has the money to pay for content they want to 
access content, they want to pay for that content. Netflix is not yet in 
Poland. And so they will use the VPN to
 
come to the U.S. virtually over the 
Internet, pay for content. So it's certainly less bad than piracy, it's not 
something we encourage. It's actually very hard to detect because VPN gets 
every good at covering their tracks for all the obvious reasons. And
 
because 
we are focused on getting global very quickly, I think we will see this issue 
disappear and it will disappear because we will be able to meet the demand 
directly in all the countries.
 
Ted, anything on the studios as our partners?
 
Ted 
Sarandos
 
Yes. It's one of the many things that we have discussions with the studios 
about an ongoing basis and we do continue to work with them and work with 
these VPN. But to be honest with you, it's kind of a whack
-
a
-
mole to get 
ahead of the different us
age of VPNs become kind a lifestyle thing for a very 
small segment of the population. The real great news is, in the piracy 
capitals of the world Netflix is winning. We are pushing down piracy in those 
markets by getting the access. So the best way to real
ly make the VPN issue 
a completely nonissue is through global licensing that we are continuing to 
pursue with our partners.
 
David Wells
 
And Mark, to add to Ted, the only comments that I would add to Reed's 
earlier pricing comments were, piracy is a governo
r in terms of our price in 
high piracy markets outside the U.S. So we wouldn't want to come out with 
a high price because there is a lot of piracy. So we have to compete with 
that. So there is a little bit a governor on our price outside the U.S.
 
Michael N
athanson
 
Okay. And David, one question we get a lot of, that your content obligations 
they grew in this quarter. Can you talk a bit about your comfort of meeting 
those obligations? And when do you think you see a peak of your obligations 
on the balance she
et?
 
David Wells
 
Well, so I am comfortable with the level of content commitments we have. 
And there is a couple of reasons that I am comfortable with that, one is that 
the content is working. So we see engagement, we see value for the 
content. So it makes m
e more comfortable and confident that we are 
investing in something that has lasting value. Two is that we really are 
scaling along with the business. So we have grown from $9.5 billion in 
streaming content commitments in the table to $9.8 billion. That's 
about a 
31% year
-
over
-
year growth rate and our streaming revenue has grown at 
31% year
-
over
-
year as well. So that makes me a little bit more comfortable.
 
Now that includes what we know in terms of licensing commitments. It 
doesn't include things like Disne
y output. So let's take that as an example. 
That is for future film output at a future box office. So we are unable to 
know the licensing amount on those films, but we do have to factor that into 
our forecast as we have from the very beginning. So if we lo
ok ahead and 
we factor that in, we think it's an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of content 
commitments over the next three years and that's already baked into our 
forecast and we have been doing this from the very beginning. So we have 
got a little bi
t better at making sure that we waterfall deals, we have the 
flexibility we need to balance those commitments and that expense level 
over time.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Michael, if I could interrupt for a second, I would also add that you should 
look at that as a sign
al of future access to content, because as we identify 
the high value content, we seek to lock them up in long
-
term deals. So that 
does increase our long
-
term obligation, but for things that we want and to 
attract revenue and viewing.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Ted, cou
ld you stick on that topic on the content and especially the Disney 
output that's coming onboard next year, just to remind us of some of the 
details on that? And when you think about the white spaces of Netflix, the 
content areas that you would really like
 
to most fill out, how important is 
Disney as part of those white spaces?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Our Disney partnership is phenomenal. We have the output deal coming up 
that we just last week we launched our Defenders series for Marvel, with our 
first series Daredev
il, it's been a huge success. Disney is the licensing 
partner with us around the planet. And we are really excited about the 
output deal coming on. It's probably one of the few output deals that I am 
enthusiastic about because the Disney content is global.
 
It's tentpole. It's 
family. It's a lot of co
-
viewing among families for the content that gets 
watched. And it is a great brand to bring comfort to families who subscribe 
to Netflix. So it's a bit of a play between movies and kids programming that 
I think 
is successful for us.
 
The white space you refer to is, with all the excitement about the golden age 
of television and all the excitement about our own series, about a third of 
the viewing hours on Netflix today are still movies. So when we see 
something li
ke we did early in the year with The Interview, we were able to 
close that window to 30 days, we had a phenomenal reaction in the U.S. and 
Canada for that movie. I want to keep pushing on behalf of consumers to 
get those windows narrower and narrower, incl
uding premiering original 
movies on Netflix which is why we are doing that to fill some of that white 
space.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
A two
-
part follow
-
on on that. Are there direct outputs from that Interview 
deal whereby you can actually do this much more often in th
e future? And 
then Reed, can I swing it back to you afterwards and ask you about products 
and major product pipelines in the next 24 months. I know you mentioned in 
the letter the enhancement of bringing video playback forward into the 
browse experience. I
 
am not sure I actually understand what that means. 
Could you explain it? And then help us think about how material that can be 
to the user experience?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I would say you should look at The Interview as a beautiful one
-
off. I say 
beautiful becaus
e bypassing the theaters and premiering on
-
demand, Sony 
managed to raise about $45 million in revenue from between a modest 
theatrical and primarily from digital on
-
demand and then a very strong fee 
for Netflix for the our license 30 days following that, w
hat could have been a 
financial disaster and turned it into a financial win for the studio. So if 
anything you want to look at that and say, well, it's a beautiful possibility for 
future disruption in release patterns.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And as Ted said Mark, w
e are really sorry on the circumstances for Sony in 
the case of The Interview. We certainly wouldn't want to see more of that. 
But we are focused with our original new movies trying to push those 
windows up so early.
 
Then you asked about the product enhanc
ements. We are doing so much. 
We tried to sample a little bit in the earnings letter. The particular 
improvement that we are talking about there written today when you browse 
for movies, it's a bunch of stills and then you say play, you wait a couple of 
se
conds and then it plays the content. And what we are learning is how to 
use real
-
time video as you browse so that things are auto starting making 
that easier on the display pages, on the detail pages. So I think you will be 
really impressed.
 
But think of i
t as symbolic of a whole long series of hundred improvements 
per quarter that we are always working on in accumulation continue to make 
our experience better which pushes up the satisfaction, which helps 
retention to grow.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Ted and Reed, w
hen you first started building your streaming product, Ted 
would be in Beverly Hills giving people checks for content and all my content 
companies would say, this is incremental to the pie. We are happy that 
Netflix is a buyer. In the past nine months, we 
have seen ratings for cable 
and broadcast tumble to levels that I never thought was possible. So I 
wonder, do you worry that as our industry traditional media worries about 
ratings trends, they become less likely to sell you content and therefore it 
become
s harder to source really good second or original content? So I 
wonder how you feel about that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I am not seeing any actual evidence at the table in terms of that there is any 
reluctance to continue to sell. They are definitely trying to 
juggle the terms 
of their core business versus the license business, but that's true not just of 
us, but they are also seating these opportunities for themselves where you 
see the networks launching their own on
-
demand services. So I think they 
really are 
trying to find the right balance. And that generally I think we are 
still very healthy for the business in terms of both in terms of our licensing 
dollars and in terms of the audience generation that we are able to build for 
the shows on broadcast. And it'
s very encouraging that even with all of the 
disarray to you spoke about, that Fox can have a phenomenal cultural hit 
like Empire in the middle of all that. So I do think that there is obviously 
plenty of concern about the old way of doing business, but th
ere is lots of 
action going into how do we do it going forward as well.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And you know, Michael, it is pretty naturally you have got to linear TV has 
been an amazing fifty
-
year run, Internet TV is starting to grow. Clearly over 
the next 20 year
s Internet TV is going to replace linear TV. And so I think 
everyone is scrambling to figure out how do they do great apps, how do they 
things like noggin are fantastic and that will just keep getting built up and so 
it's a transition into figuring out the
 
Internet. And the way people do that is 
to get involved with us, with our competitors to try to start to learn what are 
the new patterns and modalities because Internet TV is the way that people 
will consume video in the future.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay. An
d David, can you just talk a bit about your cash spend versus your 
P&L spend? I think this quarter was a 30% higher cash spend than P&L. Is 
that the right way to think about this year and even next year as well?
 
David Wells
 
Yes. Michael, we have been prett
y consistently telling people that prior to 
the buildout of originals, it was 20% over the expense. Now it's drifting up to 
30%. It could drift up to 40% and peak around there in certain quarters, 
especially if we take delivery of a lot of original product
. But in general, we 
are building out our content investments, our original content investment 
and that is cash intensive as we put in the letter and we have been pretty 
consistent about this. I think what you are going to see now is several 
persistent qua
rters and going forward of negative free cash flow while we 
build this out.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
On that, David, you did this $1.5 billion debt offering in March quarter. 
Should the expectation on the market's part be that you won't need to come 
back to the market
s for the next year
-
and
-
a
-
half? Or do you want to have 
the flexibility to, if international launches really do even better than you 
think, to come back for even more?
 
David Wells
 
Well, if we are successful in building out the content and if we want to get 
to 
ever
-
increasing mix of original content, meaning that up to 50% of our 
business is really our own owned content, then we are going to continue to 
invest in that content and that will require more and more cash. So I don't 
think we are saying no, that we
 
are good now for the future. I don't think we 
are saying we are definite. But likely we will need, if we are successful to go 
back to the market at some point to continue to build that investment.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And I want to ask a net neutrality regulatory
 
question to Reed. This actually 
came from Rich Greenfield. With the FCC laying out this clear oversight of 
interconnection in that newly filed net neutrality order, do you think if that 
had been around before, that Netflix would have had to pay for the 
in
terconnections? If those rules had been in place, would they have had to 
pay for interconnections as they have been for whatever the last year or so?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It is awfully hard to tell going forward as we think about interconnection. It's 
a new clima
te with the FCC Title II in place and we will try to figure that out. 
We have a number of contracts that are in place already. So there is no 
immediate actions. But we are very encouraged by the general consumer 
perspective and political perspective that b
roadband access is so important 
that it is a utility. It is like power distribution where it's a natural monopoly 
in the last mile. There should be one fiber or one cable going to a home with 
super high speed and that's the architecture of the future. So e
verything 
around it being a utility is great for Internet companies like ourselves and 
it's great for consumers.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Reed and Ted, in the past couple of weeks we have seen the NFL of all 
people explore Internet TV when they are announcing the
y are going to 
stream the game over the Internet. We have asked you in the past, but 
given the changes in the model, do you think you can add sports as a 
category to Netflix at this point?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Michael, I think the part of our core consumer proposi
tion is on
-
demand. We 
make viewing certain kinds of content better because they are on
-
demand. I 
don't know that on
-
demand sports is remarkably better than live sports. So 
that's why we haven't been that excited about why we haven't chased it. 
There is eco
nomic reasons as well. But I think in general that sports is great 
for live television.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And the great thing, Michael, about the emergence of sports online, is it 
frees people up to be more à la carte which gives us more money to be able 
to sp
end on Netflix. So if we can anchor the entertainment side for movies 
and TV shows for every consumer and somebody else or other set of leagues 
anchor the sports part, which is still over the Internet, then the Internet TV 
proposition is even more powerful
 
for consumers.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay. Over the past year, we have asked you about the Comcast
-
Time 
Warner Cable merger. You said, we would love to see deal conditions put on 
that in order to protect the Internet. You have gone above and beyond with 
the F
CC Title II support. But one of the questions we have at our firm is 
price regulation Title II. So where do you come down on the FCC's ability to 
regulate pricing? Is that a good or a bad thing for the development of 
Internet TV?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I will have 
to say, it's very clear that broadband is a necessary utility across 
the land. I don't think anyone is a fan of price controls. So our main goal at 
this point is to get the government to block the Comcast
-
Time Warner 
merger. We think, were that merger to c
ome together and as DSL fades, 
that company combined would have over 50% of U.S. residential Internet 
homes. And frankly that's just too much in one company.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
I wanted to ask a question on marketing to either David or Reed. You talked 
about may
be shifting more of your marketing budget online. Any more color 
beyond that? There is a lot of different places and ways to spend money 
online including via Facebook, et cetera. So any more color on that? And 
then why the switch to online? Is there someth
ing that's made the offline 
marketing channels less efficient for you?
 
David Wells
 
Well, it depends on the market, Mark. So in places where our brand is really 
well
-
known, we have noted that we are much more efficient being very 
targeted with that and 
being very specific around content marketing. 
Outside the U.S. in markets where we are building a brand, you should see a 
mixture of that. So you should see some offline and some online in terms of 
our spend. But every year we get more efficient and more k
nowledgeable 
about where that money is best spent. So we are an experimental company. 
You know that. You followed us. So you should see us continue to test 
around the edges of where things are better spent.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. And then a question on the act
ual end usage of Netflix, so maybe a 
broad question for Reed. When you think about the different use cases in the 
living room TV, on the go with mobile devices, et cetera, have you seen over 
the last two or three years a dramatic shift in how people are co
nsuming 
Netflix content? And particularly as you go into international markets, which 
may be more mobile
-
oriented, particularly in Asia, are you set up the way 
that you want to be set up on devices in the formats to work that mobile 
trend?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We
 
are feeling really good about our preparation for continuing to expand 
around the world over the next two years in terms of devices, in terms of 
networks, in terms of content. So yes, we have fought through a lot and 
studied the patterns of consumption an
d we are ready to at least begin that 
journey by launching around the world. And then what we will be able to do 
is learn from there, frankly as we did in Latin America three or four years 
ago.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Reed, following on that question, has there 
been a handoff on tablets versus 
smart TVs? A couple of years ago we kept thinking smart TVs will be the 
device that drives Internet TV, but have you seen a difference on 
consumption by tablets versus smart TVs, the past couple of years?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Now 
we have seen smart TVs just continuing to grow and grow in usage and 
sales. Virtually every new TV sold now is a smart TV, at least at the middle 
and high
-
end and it's natural for people to use. Now, do they also watch on 
tablets? Yes and on phones. So rea
lly all those categories are experiencing 
absolute hours growth, but on a percentage basis, smart TV is one of our 
fastest
-
growing categories.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Okay. And David, you called out the impact of foreign exchange in the first 
quarter. Could you 
give us a sense as to what the year is going to be on 
foreign
-
exchange? And then when do you expect to break out revenues by 
region so we can get more details on the regional and international?
 
David Wells
 
Well, if I knew what was going to happen with fore
ign
-
exchange, I would 
probably quit and then run a hedge fund.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
No, but what about for today. As of today? Okay.
 
David Wells
 
I would say, in Q1, most of that below the operating income foreign 
translation loss was unrealized, right. So we 
did have a change in our 
functional currency for our European entity. So when we first launched into 
Europe, we were very U.K. centric. So most of our operating cash flows were 
in British Pounds, which leads you to an accounting decision to a functional 
cu
rrency accounts. Since we have expanded in Europe and particularly into 
mainland Europe with more and more of our operating cash flow switched to 
the Euros, we switched it over. So there is some impact of that in that 
translation adjustment.
 
Going forward,
 
it really does depend on what happens in terms of the Dollar 
strengthening further into the Euro. We are about 25% in terms of revenues 
exposed to foreign currency and that's growing. If we are successful, that 
will grow to 50%, but we also are pretty tra
nsparent that we don't hedge. 
And so we are not really concerned with those accounting translation 
adjustments.
 
We are pretty transparent to you as an investor that we don't hedge. You 
have the option to go out and hedge if you feel like you are exposed wi
th 
your Netflix investment and we are watching in terms of our opportunities 
for natural hedging, but with the move to a global license, we may see more 
and more of those be dollar
-
denominated. So I will have to update you along 
the way in terms of our for
eign currency exposure.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And why don't we hit it with one more question each guys and then we will 
wrap up.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Okay. Let me, David, just check off real quickly, ARPU in both international 
and in the U.S. market, in international mark
ets assuming currencies stay 
where they are, does ARPU stabilize where you guided to implicitly in Q2 and 
where it came out in Q1 and then start moving back up as price increases go 
into effect? Or should we just straight line it? And then in the U.S., ARP
U has 
been rising. Is any of that caused by tiering of services? Are you getting a 
lot more people signing up for the $11.99 plans? Or is that just the impact of 
the price increases?
 
David Wells
 
It's both, Mark. So just to answer your question, on both dom
estic and 
international we are seeing ARPU progression because of people taking the 
higher tiers and the higher value plans and we are also seeing the expiration 
of people sort of coming off, grandfather rejoining or joining the service new 
at the higher p
rice point. And obviously, we have a lot more subscribers in 
the U.S. So you are seeing that ARPU increase disproportionately rise 
internationally versus the U.S. just because we are building from a base of 
much fewer grandfathered subscribers outside the 
U.S. So you see both.
 
But your very first question was, should we see that progress? Yes, but we 
have a large body of U.S. subscribers that come off grandfather next year. 
So you can waterfall your churn models and you would expect that the U.S. 
has a much
 
larger base of folks at the older price point.
 
Michael Nathanson
 
Reed, over the past 10 years, you guys have a pivoted perfectly from selling 
DVDs, to streaming, to making old content, to going overseas. So I wonder 
when you look at your business plan, wh
at gives you worry? When you look 
at the challenges ahead, what's the thing that worries you?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, you are nice to say we pivoted perfectly, but I think you are forgetting 
about certain incidents four years ago. But we have 
succeeded in getting 
through them and the key thing is that the company is very agile. We are 
just a learning machine. When you think about how Ted has grown our 
original content muscle is just so impressive. How are continuing to expand 
to international, 
it's just like were learning country by country. We don't get 
everything right upfront, but we fix that. So I think the fundamental is, we 
are just open
-
minded, curious, we are learning and then frankly it's that 
Internet TV is growing around the world at 
incredible rates. And so were 
really propelled by that big macro trend.
 
And to wrap up here, Ted's producing so much content. I though Ted, maybe 
you could share a little bit of this quarter's highlights like Chef's Table, 
Sense8 and Orange is the New Blac
k and just the amazing things that Netflix 
is debuting.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, you definitely get a sense of the diversity of the programming that we 
are going to be offering up, just if you look at just what's coming up next 
quarter with our first original do
cumentary series called Chef's Table from 
the director of Jiro Dreams of Sushi. We have got a third season of Orange is 
the New Black which is a global sensation that will break in June, of our 
comedy with Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda called Grace and Franki
e that we 
are really excited to show to the world. Sense8, I think will show everybody 
what global TV series can really be like, filmed on location in nine cities 
around the world, spectacular scale and scope of a theatrical film, directed 
and created by W
achowski siblings and even original series for kids with How 
to Train Your Dragon 2. So we are super excited about both the volume and 
the quality and the diversity of everything we are doing in our original 
programming next quarter.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And 
Ted, are those series is globally available on Netflix?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Globally available on Netflix in 4K.

7/19/17,Netflix,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Netflix Second Quarter 
2011 Earnings Q&A Session Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as 
a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Now I would like to

Relations.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Second Quarter 
2011 Earnings Q&A Session. I'm joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO; and 
David Wells, CFO.
 
We announced our 
financial results for the second quarter at approximately 
1:05 p.m. Pacific Time today. The shareholder letter, and the Q2 financial 
results, and the webcast of this Q&A session, are all available at the 
company's Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.c
om.
 
As is our standard practice, this call will consist solely of Q&A and we're 
going to conduct the Q&A via e
-
mail. Please e
-
mail your questions to 
ir@netflix.com.
 
We may make forward
-
looking statements during this call regarding the 
company's future perf
ormance. Actual results may differ materially from 
these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A 
detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, inclu
ding our annual report 
on Form 10
-
K filed with the commission on February 18, 2011. A 
rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 
6:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.

ly to questions. Similar to last quarter, we have 
organized the questions by topic as we've received them via e
-
mail this 
afternoon. We'll start with questions about the pricing changes we 
announced just 2 weeks ago. How are you feeling about the price inc
rease 2 
weeks since announcing it? Do you expect for some of the subscribers to 
reign off with the pricing increase, that they will return later once they try 
other alternatives?
 
Reed Hastings
 
This is Reed. Like any customer
-
driven organization, we feel ba
d about 
having customers upset with us. But we feel great about the amazing new 
content we're going to be able to license in the fourth quarter and next year, 
which will further propel our growth and our subscriber satisfaction. And the 
price change takes 
effect upon each subscriber's renewal in September. So 
we don't have a full range view of it. But so far from what we've seen, we've 
been very pleased at the effects, and we're feeling great about the decision 
as tough as it is, and it's going to allow us 
to have this fantastic streaming 
content going forward.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
While still early, could you help us understand the initial effects of the 
subscription plan pricing change so the net effect on subscriber growth, 
churn, and ARPU?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Because o
f the timing, we announced it at the very beginning of the quarter, 
we will see the negative effects of it in Q3. That is the elevated churn and 
lower revenue growth that we would otherwise have. Then the price increase 
takes effect essentially mid
-
Septemb
er on average. So we get a little bit of 
benefit at the end of the quarter, and then the real benefit comes in the 
following quarters, Q4 and beyond. But in terms of tracking where we are 
and our expectations, we're feeling very good.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you t
ell us what percentage of subscribers have canceled the service? 
Have you seen subscribers migrate more towards the unlimited streaming 
plans, or towards the DVD plans, or they opt in for both?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we're making estimates for the end of the 
quarter. That's what's in our 
guidance. And we'll see over time what the split is. We feel great when you 
think about it with our DVD service at $7.99. It's an incredible value. It's the 
lowest priced offer in the market place, it's the best service levels
 
in the 
marketplace. So if a customer wants DVD rental by mail, we're definitely the 
place to go. And then in terms of streaming, we've gained increasing 
confidence over the last 2 years about the viability and strength of a pure 
streaming plan. We gained 
some confidence when we launched in Canada 
and that blew away our expectations with the response. We gained some 
confidence when we led on our nonmember homepage with streaming only. 
And as we put in our shareholder letter in Q2, about 75% of subscribers 
c
hose streaming only. In other words, even though DVD was only $2 more, 
75% stuck with streaming only. And again with this pricing change, we're 
going to be able to strengthen that streaming plan with more content. So 
that's why we feel good about it.
 
David
 
Wells
 
Just to add on to that, our guidance in the letter shows people the strength 
of the offerings in the sense that we do feel that most people are taking the 
hybrid offering. A lot of these hybrid subscribers are staying on both plans 
and that's implie
d in both the guidance and the diagram that we put into the 
letter.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So a follow
-
up question on timing. Why did you implement the recent pricing 
changes now when subscriber growth is near the highest you've ever had? 
Why not wait until you are f
urther into your penetration curve?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think the reason we felt confident about doing it now is the strength 
of streaming only. Really, we got convinced that we can thrive on streaming 
only. And with the great new content, we're going to
 
be able to get with this 
pricing change, the best timing was now.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why did you decide to push through such a large pricing increase over the 
smaller, less disruptive one?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We didn't approach it as what percent price 
increase should one do. And I 
think if we had, we probably wouldn't have gone to 60%. So I can 
understand the question. We really approached it on, that we should 
separate the businesses and the plans because streaming only was going to 
become a global off
ering. And we wanted to really focus on that global 
streaming offering. And DVD is an incredible U.S.
-
based plan that's very 
profitable. It's very large and we wanted it to be able to be successful, and 
to have a group that was going to focus on it. And th
e pricing change 
somewhat was an outcome of that.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why lower the price on DVD only? As sub
-
shift to streaming, the economics 
of the remaining DVD business would appear to be working against you. Is 
there a lot less infrastructure for less subs?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we didn't lower the price on DVD only. We never had a DVD
-
only plan. 
So the perception of lowering might come from the combination plan which 
was $9.99 and that was the only way to get DVD. And for someone who is 
very rural and doesn't 
have broadband, they were essentially paying that 
extra $2 for streaming not being able to access it. And so we felt great about 
making a low price 
--
 
to aggressively low
-
priced $7.99 DVD plan. And that, 
that was the right plan to carry forward on our DVD 
side.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Could you explain in more detail the thought process and drivers behind 
separating the DVD only business. You started DVD only marketing again 
and looking to improve your service after several quarters of effectively 
putting that part of 
your service back of mind?
 
Reed Hastings
 
One of the aspects that we wanted to get is that the DVD can last a long 
time as a successful service and generate lots of satisfaction and lots of 
profits if we give it a platform to succeed on. And it is true that
 
we haven't 
marketed it much in the last couple of years, but by now, having it as a 
division within Netflix, we've got a way to measure the P&L and we think it 
will be a smart investment in its growth and sustainability. And whether 
--
 
if 
growth was proba
bly a bit overstated, that would be an aggressive case. But 
at least that it will shrink slowly as opposed to rapidly with a little bit of 
investment. And we'll figure that out over the next couple of quarters.
 
David Wells
 
And I think we've always talked a
bout the DVD side of our business in a 
spectrum of emphasis and focus and rather then being pushed to the 
extremes, what we've said is that we focused on streaming. We've proved it 
out. We've had 2 to 3 quarters of tremendous growth. And now, it's the righ
t 
time to go back and look at how easy is it to find the DVD service, how easy 
is it for those subscribers to find what interests them and that's what I think, 
this is a step in that progression.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Does the separation of streaming and DVD plans s
et the stage for the 
acquisition of streaming content on a per subscriber basis?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, there's no connection between those issues.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you please give us a little bit more color on your Q3 guidance? I was 
hoping to hear your thought
s on your subscribers. Are you expecting 
significant cancellations with the new price plan? Are we close to the peak 
number of subscribers Netflix reasonably hopes to attain in the U.S.?
 
David Wells
 
Well I think we've answered most of that question in a se
nse that we've 
provided a pretty clear guidance in addition to providing some streaming 
versus DVD subscriber guidance. I don't think there's any implication that 
we're nearing the peak in that and I think that we're expecting Q3 to be a 
quarter where we h
ave subscribers choosing where they want to land. And in 
Q4, we expect to return to growth, as the comments in the letter indicate.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Netflix prides itself on customer service. Did the call volume after the price 
change surprise you at all? Calls
 
were actually being disconnected 
instantaneously. And what about the social media reaction? Was the noise 
level in line or higher than you expected?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, believe it or not the noise level is actually less than we expected given 
a 60% price 
increase for some subscribers. So we knew what we were 
getting into. We tried to be as straightforward as we could, and that has 
worked out very well for us. In terms of the customer support line, it was a 
very short amount of time that it exceeded our cap
acity there. And now, our 
service levels have returned to our normal great service levels.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How does separating your DVD and streaming business impact your 
relationships with the studios? Do you expect the content partnerships to be 
negotiated s
eparately in the future? What kind of impact does that have?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The content acquisition is mostly been separated for a while. That is movie 
studios mostly have different divisions between DVD and streaming. And 
then the television studios very m
uch have been different for a while. So we 
don't see any significant effect coming out of the separation of the plans.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Let's move to questions about content. Could the company please address 
what proportion of total streaming content is 
obtained under revenue 
sharing agreements, along with color as to what types of titles are usually 
obtained under such arrangements, and how the economics of revenue 
sharing compares to the company's other content purchasing agreements?
 
Reed Hastings
 
For s
treaming content, we buy like our industry in pay television and 
network TV buys and cable networks, which is you have to commit upfront 
and you have to pay a fixed amount per time period, typically per year, for 
access to that content on your network. So 
that's the industry in which we 
compete and we buy in that way. So there's not revenue sharing in the DVD 
style model. And then of course, on DVD, we had some revenue sharing, 
and that's as it was always has been.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Sony Picture's films are still
 
down from the Netflix service. Could you go 
directly to Sony and Disney for streaming content, or is the Sony/Starz 
agreement exclusive until 2016, 2017?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The Starz agreement and that industry, for example, HBO, also are 
exclusive. So it's wo
rking through Starz, that is our preferred option.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In the shareholder letter, you noted that streaming content deals are ""being 
recognized as assets on our balance sheet"". As the content become available 
to streaming customers, how, if at all, 
does this affect the former $1.6 billion 
of commitments related to streaming content license agreements that do not 
meet the content library recognition criteria? Is this how those commitments 
move on to the balance sheet? And in that case, how are the ass
ets matched 
on the liability side of the equation?
 
David Wells
 
So it's a pretty long question. But in general, that is how the staging area for 
content contracts as they move into what we call in window or available for 
streaming. When they do that, depend
ing on the payment terms on the 
matching side, they'll be cashed out for a quarter of payment. The quarter of 
expense associated with that. And then to the extent that there is short
-
term liabilities, it will move into accounts payable. That's one of the r
easons 
that we discussed that in the letter. And if they're longer than a year, it will 
increase accrued, the other accrued liabilities. At this point, I'll take those 
questions and sort of refer you to our IR website. There's a pretty detailed 
treatment o
f our content accounting. And it should walk you through exactly 
what happens under each scenario.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Could the company please address: one, what is the total content obligation 
as reflected in the content 
--
 
excuse me, in the contractual obligati
ons 
footnote at the 10
-
Q outsetting as of 6/30/2011? And what amount of 
content obligations are due within the next 12 months?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. This will follow in the next few days as we file the Q. But right now, 
there's $2.44 billion in that contractua
l obligations versus $1.84 billion in the 
last quarter as of 3/30. And roughly 0.25 or about $625 million of those are 
related to short term.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Do you find that demand for streaming titles fades after their streaming 
debut, or does the demand rem
ain constant over the life of a content's 
availability?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's very title specific, so we're very excited about launching Mad Men in a 
few days and being the exclusive subscription provider of that content. And 
what we expect to see is a burst 
of activity, and then it'll slow a little bit. 
And then there'll be another burst as season 5 goes live on television. And 
consumers want to go back to seasons 1 through 4 to get into the story. So 
it gets built by that outside promotion. So there's a lot 
of patterns in that 
way. But in general, we've been very pleased with kind of continuous 
viewing that we've seen on when we licensed content that it doesn't die right 
away and in fact has a great life.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Bloomberg and other outlets have said Netf
lix is in discussion with 
DreamWorks animation for a streaming deal. Can you comment on those 
reports? Or generally, on the potential to take away studio output deals from 
HBO and other premium services, should we see a potential deal with 
DreamWorks as a 
potential hedge on the risk of not renewing with Starz, 
and thus losing access to Disney's family movies?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're always in talks with all of the different providers in terms of licensing 
more content. But we're not going to comment on them in 
advance. If we 
conclude a deal, we would typically announce it, and go
-
forward on that 
basis.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
We're going to move now to questions on our International expansion. A lot 
of us on the sell side thought that the Latin American and rollout would 
ma
ybe be just 1 or 2 countries at first, followed by an additional 1 to 2 
countries 6 months later after you've climbed the learning curve, instead it's 
43 countries simultaneously. What's your reaction to the notion that you 
guys are biting off more than yo
u can chew? Why not focus on the larger 
countries first? Why spread marketing dollars so widely?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think that's driven by, internally, some balance between moving too fast 
and too slow. So you could make the argument that we should just focus
 
on 
Brazil say, and learn some lessons there before expanding to the rest of 
Latin America. Or you can make the argument that we should go even faster 
and we should do Asia and Europe and South America all at the same time. 
And we ended up in the middle of
 
doing Latin America 
--
 
all the countries at 
the same time. Our primary focus is on the larger countries in terms of 
where we spend on the marketing. But most of the content deals are Latin 
America wide, so it's inefficient to arbitrarily not allow the ser
vice to be in 
certain countries when we've essentially paid for the content for those 
countries anyway. So that's, where we get to. But we're definitely focused 
most of our time and effort on the major countries.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you offer us a little 
color on your progress with signing local content? 
What will be the local versus American content mix available to consumers in 
these new countries? Have you been able to secure such local language 
programming at reasonable rates?
 
Reed Hastings
 
As we get c
loser to launch, we'll have more content to announce. Obviously, 
in Latin America, there's lots of watching sports, which we're not going to be 
carrying. There's lots of watching of Hollywood films, which we'll have. And 
there's lots of viewing of telenove
las, and we'll have a very nice compliment 
for telenovelas for launch.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What level of streaming content is necessary to launch markets in Latin 
America? Do you believe it to be more or less than Canada either from a 
dollar or title 
perspective?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we're going to launch with much more content than we did 
proportionally in Canada. And that's because we're more confident of the 
outcome, which is part of what we've learned in Canada. We started Canada 
pretty cautiously a
nd then quickly built up the content and we have more 
confidence. And so we're starting even stronger in relative terms in Latin 
America than we did in Canada.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Your guidance for International subscribers seem to suggest that you expect 
fuller s
ubscriber growth in Latin America compared to what happened in 
Canada. Do you expect adoption rates in Latin America similar to what you 
experienced in Canada?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, that would be too aggressive. Canada is consistently rich as opposed to 
pocket
s of wealth, and Canada is broader in broadband 
--
 
has more 
broadband penetration per capita and it also has more video game consoles 
per capita. So on a per capita basis, it will be slower than Canada. On a per 
broadband household, it will still be slower
 
because of payment methods and 
because of video game consoles. But still, we're very optimistic about what 
we can create and what will happen in Latin America.
 
David Wells
 
The only thing that I'd add to that is Reed mentioned that the major 
reasons, there
's a small brand halo effect in Canada that we don't have 
down in Latin America as you would imagine. So we're building a brand that 
is largely unknown down in Latin America so there's a little bit of effect there 
in terms of the speed.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So movi
ng to questions specifically about Canada. What feedback have you 
gotten from Canadian subscribers about the data plans? Has the subscriber 
growth number been materially affected by the data plan?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't think that the subscriber growth num
ber is materially affected by 
the data plans post our shift a few months ago to default people to the lower 
data plan, which is a very efficient use of data. So the primary things that 
we're learning in Canada is that it operates from a seasonality basis. 
A little 
bit like Alaska, which is that summertime is great. People are outdoors and 
watching less content. And wintertime is cold and dark and people watch a 
lot of content. So in the U.S., we see more seasonality in Maine and in 
Alaska than we do, for ex
ample, in the rest of the country and Canada is 
operating consistent with that increased seasonality.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So based on that, how would you expect that in Canada to trend year
-
over
-
year in say, Q3 and Q4?
 
David Wells
 
Well, in Q3, we had a large pent
-
up launch. And so it will be difficult for us 
to match that comp. And I wouldn't add anything other than to the guidance 
that we've already provided in terms of International subs.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions about competition. How is Amazon's deal for
 
CBS 
content change the landscape for acquiring content? How specifically will 
Netflix exchange it's strategy, if at all?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It hasn't changed. That deal hasn't changed our perspective. Our brand is 
strong and focused. And that's what we're cont
inuing to invest in and 
improve and we haven't been able to detect any effect from the Amazon 
prime bundling.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What most concerns you about competitive streaming services? Have you 
seen much traction for Amazon service or HBO GO as creating a co
mpelling 
alternative experience in Netflix subscribers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We haven't seen anything that's an alternative service. HBO GO is a very 
impressive application. It doesn't have any of the content that we have, and 
we don't have any of the 
content that it has. So again, it comes back to my 
metaphor of baseball and football competing for some of the same dollars 
and time, but really different offerings.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
All right. Let's move to questions about subscriber metrics. As it relates to 
the current churn rate, could you please provide some numbers on what 
percent or number of your current customers are repeat customers, 
meaning they have had the service in the past, canceled and then sign back 
up?
 
David Wells
 
What we've said in the past i
s it's about 1/3 in terms of the rejoin rate. 
Obviously, the price changes have had a small effect on that and we're sort 
of waiting for the trend to revert to a new level. But I would say that the 
effect on the rejoin rate was not more than 20% in terms o
f that trend.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
As we prepare for Netflix to provide less information about subscriber growth 
and churn, it will be helpful to understand the retention levels for customers 
based on their tenure with Netflix. Do you see different rates of retenti
on or 
churn for customers depending on how long they have subscribed to the 
service? Are longer tenured subscribers retained on a higher or lower rate 
than the subscribers with the use of service for a year or less?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, all subscriber servi
ces have the aspect that the longer a subscriber has 
been with that service as a class, they are preselected to either be really 
comfortable with the value proposition and churn declines with age 
continuously. So that's 
--
 
I'm sure that's the same on all s
ubscription 
services, and it's certainly true for Netflix. But mostly what we focused on is 
net adds. It's very easy to get distracted by SAC and churn in our 
experience. And we focus on how is our net ad growth compared to the 
following 
--
 
prior year peri
od and compared to other aspects of the service.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So one more follow
-
up question on churn. Is there a material difference in 
churn between streaming only customers and a streaming plus DVD hybrid 
customer?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, as we've said before
, the streaming only is higher churn. It's a less of a 
commitment than those who have taken DVDs, and the DVDs are at home in 
that way. So it's also easier to sign up because you can use the service 10 
minutes later as opposed to wait for the DVD. So you g
et easier to sign up, 
more cancels. But again, if you look at the net adds, they're very positive. 
We just want a lot of people to try Netflix. If they don't currently have the 
budget to keep it, that's okay. They will over time. So we're really fine with 
lots of people trying Netflix and being exposed to that.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Let's move to questions about the financial results. You had a large 
sequential spend increase in tech & dev and G&A, while historically you have 
had very moderate move from Q1 to Q2 in t
hese expense lines. What 
specific new investments are you making? And will these expenses continue 
to grow in a similar pace going forward?
 
David Wells
 
So taken separately, tech & dev is generally headcount growth associated 
with both our domestic and our 
International investments. There's some 
partner spending in there as well but it's mostly dominated by headcount. 
And as a percent of revenue, it didn't actually grow. So it grew sequentially 
but in terms of percent of revenue, it's still about 7% of reven
ue. I would 
expect that line to continue to track as we invest further in terms of percent 
of revenues. In terms of G&A that should scale more slowly, but we did have 
a $5 million commercial settlement charge in the quarter that it was a 
onetime charge tha
t you normally wouldn't see in the quarter.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Given your relatively modest cash position relative to the size of checks 
you're running for content, and the success you're having with that content 
investment, what is the rationale of buying back s
tock? Given the multiple 
you get for subs, won't you generate more value by investing and adding 
subs versus buybacks?
 
David Wells
 
We think about that slightly differently in the sense that our marketing 
expense is not constrained by how much cash we have 
in the bank. Our 
marketing expense is constrained by 2 things. One, how much marginal cost 
or marginal subscriber acquisition cost we'll have to layout to acquire that 
subscriber? Can we do that at a profitable level? And then the second 
constrain on our m
arketing expense is basically our earnings targets that we 
set forth. So we have 3 legs basically of investment, one is our streaming 
content investment, one is our marketing, and one is our earnings target, 
basically putting money towards 
--
 
back to inves
tors. And setting the 14% 
operating margin, domestic operating margin target, allows us to set 
basically a content spend and a marketing spend. And so how we think 
about cash relative to the buyback is independent of how much we spend on 
marketing. And I'd
 
say how we approach the buyback is, what could we do 
with that cash as an alternative use? Should we hold it as an insurance 
policy or should we return it to shareholders and a buyback is the most 
efficient way to do that.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In Q4 2011, you say 
that growth in net subs will resume. Is it fair to assume 
that the improved year
-
over
-
year trend is driven by a return in cancellation 
rates to normal levels? In other words, you see the price changes as 
stimulating, only a one quarter hiccup in cancellati
on rates.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, basically. What's happening is in Q3, there's an increase in cancellation 
because of the price increase announcement and then taking effect. And in 
Q4, we expect the more typical year
-
over
-
year trends of net adds growth to 
retu
rn.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You had guided that Q2 2011 gross margins would step down versus the 
first quarter and it didn't happen. You are essentially saying the same thing 
for the second half of 2011 versus the first half. Why should we believe you? 
Have you alread
y signed online content deals that would cause a gross 
margin step down in the second half of the year? Or would you need to sign 
new deals to hit your guidance for a step down?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We have to sign new deals to get there. So we believe that we 
will find that 
content on the right terms. And so that's why we're saying that. But it's 
definitely possible that it will be like in the past, where we underspend 
slightly on the content side. But we definitely want the flexibility to be able 
to spend to t
hat, and thus our statements.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
As we think about 2012, how should we think about domestic operating 
margin target. In 2010, it was around 12% plus. In 2011, it is 14%. So 
you've exceeded it in 2 quarters in a row. Should we consider the 14% 
oper
ating income target a long
-
term target or a near
-
term target?
 
David Wells
 
I think you should consider that a target that we're comfortable with for 
2011. And as the year progresses and as we know more about how our DVD 
division does and our streaming offer
ings do, we'll probably look to raise 
that target going forward slightly. But it's all relative to our International 
investments and our domestic investments, both DVD and streaming.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And I would say that's been a multiyear pattern. We were at
 
10%, 3 or 4 
years ago. So you see our value system in terms of allocating profits in 
growth, and as we continue to grow also increasing the operating margins.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
At maturity is there any reason to think that the margins in the U.S., and 
Internati
onal streaming businesses will be materially different?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think the operating margins are really most closely linked to the 
competitiveness in the market. So if in a given country, we've got 5 big 
direct competitors, I would expect the operat
ing margins in that territory to 
be less than in another market, where we have fewer number of significant 
competitors. So it really depends on ultimately on the number of 
competitors. That's what drives the operating margins.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A question on the
 
balance sheet. What happened to current payables and 
other non
-
current liabilities? They exploded during the quarter.
 
David Wells
 
I think I addressed that earlier but basically, as we have these large 
multiyear content streaming agreements come into windo
w or available for 
streaming, they're recognized as an asset. They come on into the content 
library. And depending on the payment terms, there's associated accounts 
payable increases or other accrued, which indicate it's just longer than a 
year in terms of
 
the payable.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to a handful of miscellaneous questions. There have been several 
service disruptions to the instant watch service during the past quarter. 
Could you please characterize the nature of these disruptions and indicate 
what can 
be done or has been done to reduce or eliminate them going 
forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're working very hard in expanding our systems to be able to handle the 
growth in capacity. And we think we'll be making great improvements in 
those, and so we're very focu
sed on improving that.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you explain the domestic Facebook issue? Consumers are already 
showing a lot of broadcast and cable network viewing data on Facebook and 
Twitter. Why should Netflix be viewed differently as long as it opts in?
 
Reed Ha
stings
 
Yes, unfortunately, Judge Bork, when he went for Supreme Court 
nomination, some enterprising reporter got his video rental records in a local 
video store. And in the next few days, Congress passed an act perhaps 
propelled by every Congressman's fear
 
of their own video rental records 
being released. And so it passed so quickly, but it was fairly poorly drafted, 
and it's very ambiguous what happens and who it applies to. Does it only 
apply to people who rent DVDs, or is it more broad that? Does it appl
y what 
--
 
can a consumer get permission? So it's that ambiguity that leads us to 
want to seek this clarification. And that's why it's different.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Does Netflix still plan to launch family plans? Or is it something that you're 
still thinking about
?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't have any specific plans to launch family plans. We do have an 
interest as we said over the next few years in figuring out individual 
accounts and making Netflix feel more personal to the individual. We've got 
a couple of building b
locks in that, including the Facebook integration. So 
that's not going to happen in the very short term. But it's consistent with 
what we said before, which is something we're working on over the next few 
years.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
All right. Moving to the 
final topic, DVD. Overall, does DVD become more or 
less of a priority? Now that the service has been decoupled from streaming, 
will the DVD business start to decline faster than anticipated? Any color here 
would be appreciated.
 
Reed Hastings
 
It will become
 
less important to those people at Netflix working on streaming 
and much more important to those people in the dedicated DVD division. 
And that's the purpose of putting it in a separate group, so that they can 
focus on that. In terms of the long
-
term decli
ne rate, it's hard to know. If 
you look at the music industry starting in 2000 then it was around 10% per 
year, so that might be a proxy, but it is hard to know. What we do know is 
that we're going to maximize whatever opportunity is there. And that's why 
we've got a dedicated group who actually has come up with some pretty 
neat ideas for how to improve the DVD service, which will be 
--
 
and those 
improvements will rollout in Q4.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What will the key performance metrics be for the 
standalone DVD business? 
Will there be an increased focus on near
-
term profit and cash flow as 
opposed to subscriber growth?
 
David Wells
 
I don't think there will be any increased focus. That part of our business will 
still be revenue, operating profit, spe
cifically operating profit, and trying to 
maintain or grow that profit if they can. So I don't 
--
 
I wouldn't characterize 
it as an increased focus. I'd say it's about the same as we've had before.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You mentioned that you will begin marketing the
 
DVD business again in the 
fall. Is this incremental SAC cost on top of the streaming service cost, or do 
you feel that the streaming service is established enough to pull back from 
that underspending there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's not really either. We're focu
sed on backing the DVD service and then 
we'll see what happens. We'll see how effective that marketing spend is and 
learn and adjust from there. What we wanted to do is make it clear that we 
think DVD has a longer and bigger life than many people otherwise
 
think. 
And that we're prepared to do some investment to see that thesis through.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you tell us what type of improvements we can expect from this division 
going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, we'll be announcing those in Q4.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Final que
stion. Will you now be breaking out streaming and DVD segments 
separately in your financials to give us a better understanding of the 
transformation? Or does this replace the domestic and International 
segments?
 
David Wells
 
I think we addressed that in the
 
letter, but just as a repeat, what you'll see 
from us is in the Q4, by Q4, we will have enough information so that we're 
looking at our business in the different segments. So in the January filings, 
you'll see a segment oriented around DVD and a segment a
round streaming. 
And we've also provided additional information in or guidance this quarter 
for Q3, and you'll see that again in October for Q4.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Okay. That's the last question for today. We'd like to thank everyone for 
your time, and we look fo
rward to speaking to you again next quarter.

4/18/17,Netflix,"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Netflix Third Quarter 2011 
Earnings Q&A session. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for 
opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. 
Ellie Mertz, VP of Finance and 
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Third Quarter 2011 
Earnings Q&A session. I am joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO; and David 
Wells, CFO.
 
We announced our financial results for the 
third quarter at approximately 
1:25 p.m, Pacific Time today. The shareholder letter and the Q3 financial 
results and the webcast of this Q&A session are all available at the 
company's Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.com. As is our standard 
practic
e, we will begin the call with questions received via e
-
mail. Please e
-
mail your questions to ir@netflix.com. In the time remaining after e
-
mail 
Q&A, we will also open up the lines to take live, follow
-
up questions. The 
dial
-
in number is within our investo
r letter, but let me repeat it now. Please 
call (760) 666
-
3613 if you would like to get in the call queue.
 
We may make forward
-
looking statements during this call regarding the 
company's future performance. Actual results may differ materially from 
these s
tatements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A 
detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report 
on Form 10
-
K filed with the commiss
ion on February 18, 2011. A 
rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 
6 p.m. Pacific Time today.
 
Now let's move directly to questions. Similar to previous quarters, we have 
organized the questions by topic as we receive
d them via e
-
mail this 
afternoon. We'll start with questions about the domestic business.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Given the sub losses in October, why are you so confident that November 
will be flat and December will have positive net adds 
for streaming? What 
does the churn look like week
-
to
-
week in October?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Now, what we've seen is a second wave of cancellations from the price 
increase. The first wave was in July upon announcement, and the second 
wave has been in September and 
October, as people become more aware of 
the price increase, and then either changed the plan or canceled. And that 
wave has been declining very steadily over the past couple of weeks. And so 
we have substantially less weekly cancels now than we did just 3 
to 4 weeks 
ago. So that's what gives us confidence that it's 
--
 
this wave passing 
through.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why do you specifically believe your December month domestic net adds will 
be strongly positive? Do you plan a major marketing campaign to help make 
this
 
happen?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Our marketing has been very successful for the last several years, and we 
don't plan on any substantial change to it. It's a great set of campaigns that 
work very well at attracting streaming subscribers. And in Q4, particularly in 
D
ecember, there's more focus on a set of devices, video game consoles that 
get sold, iPads that get sold, a wide range of devices. And so our 
expectations are modeled from prior year's performance.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why not reintroduce a combined streaming DVD pl
an offering at a discount 
for taking both?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, as we addressed in the letter, we think the future is brightest by 
focusing on streaming. We could, in principle, offer discounts for hybrid, but 
if we were going to use discounting dollars, we
 
wouldn't want to trying to 
incent more DVD use and subsidizing DVDs, we'd want to be discounting 
streaming, and focus on getting even more market share. As it turns out, we 
think that $7.99 streaming is such a great price, that mostly we should focus 
on c
ontinuing to fill out the content. And so we're really quite comfortable in 
our growth with the 2 $7.99 programs.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Do you mean to ramp spending to win back sentiment, to drive a virtuous 
cycle, even if it means lower margins for the next 12 to 1
8 months? Has 
your programming spend targets for 2012 changed due to the change in 
subscriber trends? If so, what type of content are you giving up?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, as we said in the letter, the focus for us is in building back our 
reputation and brand
 
strength. But that's not through grand gestures, 
signing some crazy content deal or doing something else. It's the same set 
of steps that we've been using year after year for the past 10 years in terms 
of building our brand, which is a steady focus on exe
cution, improving our 
service quarter
-
after
-
quarter. And in terms of our programming content, we 
do have built into our plan substantial increases in the content investment 
over this year and over the prior year. It's really exciting that we're able to 
fil
l out that content as we documented in its effect in our letter.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you please provide apples
-
to
-
apples comparisons for your subscriber 
guidance? What does it imply on a unique subscriber basis? And how many 
hybrid subscribers are you assuming
 
for Q4?
 
David Wells
 
This is David Wells, the CFO. So in terms of our subscriber guidance, what 
we said in the letter is we will be up slightly from the 23.8 million unique 
subscribers we needed Q3 with. So that tells you sort of where we are from 
a unique
 
subscriber basis.
 
I will say that from a hybrid subscriber basis, we expect streaming only 
subscribers to grow substantially, DVD only subscribers to be up somewhat, 
and for those subscribers taking both services to be down. And I think all the 
pieces are
 
there in the letter and the guidance.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Would churn peak in Q4?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Really, we focus on net adds and growing the business. And we make it very 
easy for customers to exit or cancel Netflix and then come back. So we 
really don't 
focus on churn. We focus on total growth with the business or 
net additions.
 
David Wells
 
And I think if they were meaning to ask the question of, will the number of 

already answer
ed that question in terms of the weekly trends that we see, 
and retention rates.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you provide more detail about around your domestic streaming 
contribution margins? 8% seems unusually low, given that you already have 
21 million streaming sub
scribers, and should therefore have significant 
scale. Is there a subscriber level at which you believe your streaming 
contribution margin will meet or exceed your DVD contribution margin?
 
David Wells
 
I think in the long
-
run, the long
-
term margin structure
 
for streaming will be 
ultimately determined by the competitive space, and how many competitors 
we have. In the short run, we've been aggressively adding streaming 
content at the same rate of subscriber growth, and we continue to anticipate 
investing in th
at in 2012. But we do have the confidence that we'll be able to 
grow in pace along with that rate of investment addition. So we think we'll 
be able to take up contribution margin at the same time.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Related question. How will U.S. content cost do
uble in 2012, and 
contribution margin be up 100 basis points over the quarter?
 
David Wells
 
I think I just answered that question, but we would anticipate that the 
growth of streaming subscribers to outpace the content addition.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, in the o
ther part is that in Q4 of this year, we've taken the content cost 
way up. So it's not doubling the Q4 levels going forward, it's on a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What is the impact of the overall bad publicity on your cost per addition in 
each of th
e streaming and DVD
-
by
-
mail categories? Is the adverse impact 
more so on the streaming side, or the DVD
-
by
-
mail segment?
 
I can take this one. As you saw in our investor letter, Q3 SAC of about 
$15.25 was actually comparable to the prior quarter. In Q2 we r
eported a 
very similar SAC of $15.09, and it was actually down this quarter about 
$0.24, 24% from a year ago. So to date, we haven't seen any of the 
negative publicity affect our subscriber acquisition cost.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think what we would imply is tha
t our SAC might be even lower had we not 
had a brand hit.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So moving on to questions specifically about the DVD business. I understand 
the ripping of the Band
-
Aid off approach, excuse me. I understand the 
ripping the Band
-
Aid off approach you us
ed with your pricing changes. But 
what possible rationale could one use to justify the idea of paying to develop 
and build an entirely separate brand like Qwikster?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, in hindsight, it is hard to justify. I will tell you that the brand pro
perties 
of DVD and streaming are quite different. DVD is complete, but it's got the 
by
-
mail aspect, which is quite slow. Streaming is instant and the selection is 
less. And so having separate brands representing really the different 
audiences that care abo
ut those 2 services can, in theory, make sense. 
However, in practice, post the price increase, Qwikster became the symbol 
of Netflix not listening. And we quickly changed course on that, and we're 
going to stick with DVD as part of the Netflix brand. And g
oing forward, we'll 
be very aggressive on promoting streaming Netflix and the benefits, and 
anyone who wants to also subscribe to DVD will be very welcome, but we're 
going to be pushing and promoting streaming.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What are your assumptions for gro
wth for the domestic DVD business? Are 
the DVD trends company specific? Or is there a larger industry trend or 
change in consumer behavior? I noticed that DVD margins are currently 
much higher than streaming. What are your long
-
term contribution margin 
tar
gets for U.S. streaming, international streaming and DVD?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think David answered part of that on the long
-
term margin. And DVD is 
partially high margin because of the U.S. First Sale Doctrine, where we can 
buy the DVD, pay for it once, and 
then rent it as long as we want. So it's an 
unusually 
--
 
it's an unusual situation limited to DVD.
 
And then in terms of DVD subscriber counts and base, this quarter, there's a 
big downdraft, as evidenced in our guidance, and then it will be a slow 
decline 
over the next well, many years, for DVD. And as we've said in the 
letter, we don't anticipate further investments and equipment and property 
brand equipment for DVD. So we think that we can manage that downward.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So this is a similar, related qu
estion. Given that DVD
-
by
-
mail is a mature, 
someone called it buggy whipped, business category for renting recent films, 
do you anticipate a steady decline in that business? Or do you believe there 
is a stabilized level of subscribers that the business is 
likely to support? In 
other words, what is the minimum subscriber level required to sustain a 
reasonably profitable cash cow business in that segment? And how viable do 
you believe it is?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It will probably be something like AOL dial
-
up from 20
02 through to today, 

-
term 
residual market. And there's very little fixed cost in the business. So that's 
not a material cutoff of its efficiency, it's almost all variable cost. The 
post
age, the labor, all of those aspects.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Final question on the DVD business. Historically, Netflix DVD business was so 
successful because it could effectively monetize the back catalogue, with a 
rental mix of only 30% new release and 70% back cata
log compared to 
Blockbuster at effectively 90% new release and 10% back catalogue. How 
has the streaming service affected this mix for hybrid customers? And how 
much impact on profitability is there as DVD rentals shift towards new 
releases?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There's been no substantial shift in the DVD mix over the last couple of 
years. And so DVD is still primarily a catalogue rental business, where 
people like the incredible depth and breadth of the catalog, over a 100,000 
titles.
 
David Wells
 
And I would als
o add to that, that we've said before that Netflix is not the 
only service that our subscribers use to source their entertainment. And so 
to the extent that subscribers also use their local video store, Redbox and 
other services, they continue to do that.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Let's move to questions about content. Have expensive content become 
more important? What is your bias in terms of paying either higher fees for 
pure exclusivity, or paying lower rights fees and letting something like Epix 
become non
-
exclusive?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, as we mentioned back, I think, in our April investor letter, the industry 
is mostly an exclusive licensing industry, and we'll end up doing more and 
more exclusive over time, and that has been witnessed in what we've seen 
to date. So w
e do expect to continue to expand exclusive licensing 
arrangements. And then on Epix specifically, I don't have a comment.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Is original content the key to reenergizing gross additions?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well gross additions are up over a year ago. A
nd, of course, we always want 
them to be up even more. And original content may play a part in that over 
time. We've got some smaller, innovative, original content with Lillehammer, 
and some larger high
-
profile content next fall. And those are nice 
augment
ations to the strategy. But the core of our strategy is to create a 
great customer experience with the content we have, using the 
personalization, the on
-
demand incredible streaming that we have, and 
that's what's really propelled our growth over the last 
several years.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Specific question about Epix. The folks at Epix say that there is a window 
starting August 10, allowing Epix the option of either renegotiating new 
terms on your current deal or leaving the terms as is. Therefore, can you 
confirm
 
that this is indeed the case?
 
David Wells
 
We don't talk about specifics on the deals that we had. I will say that, that 
date sounds early.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
To what extent are your streaming content deals, which usually encompass 
multiple years on variable cost
 
terms, i.e. tied to subscriber numbers, to 
better assure maintenance of your operating margin targets?
 
So I can take this one. So essentially, all of our streaming content licenses 
are on a fixed fee basis, and we amortize them straight
-
line over the leng
th 
of the license agreement.
 
Next question. Do your content deals include broad changes in control 
limitations, which would cancel the agreements, if you were ever acquired?
 
David Wells
 
Again, we don't usually talk about specifics, but no, there isn't a 
limitation.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Are you okay with being rerun television?
 
Deborah T. Crawford
 
While I think as I said over last couple of months, it's not how I would 
characterize it, but it's not fundamentally inaccurate to say that we have 
incredible complete pr
ior season, like the last couple of seasons of ""Mad 
Men"" and ""Breaking Bad"" et cetera, and that, that creates a great customer 
experience, especially for episodic content. And going back on series, you 

nto. And so complete 
prior season, plus a huge selection of movies, is a great combination service.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In advance of the release of the full 10
-
Q. Give an updated figure for total 
off
-
balance
-
sheet streaming content commitments.
 
David Wells
 
Sure. 
Streaming content commitments in the table will read $3.5 billion, up 
from $2.3 billion and that number is inclusive of what's already in the 
library, so essentially, we're writing up another $1.1 billion in the future 
commitments that don't meet the crite
ria for library recognition.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What's the split between movie streaming and TV streaming in the U.S. 
market? Does that differ in Canada?
 
Reed Hastings
 
TV, as a percentage of hours, is ahead of movies at this point, in most 
places in the world for
 
us. But it can vary sometimes on the programming 

 
Ellie Mertz
 
When you say that you'll be spending nearly double what you've spent for 
the content this year in 2012, would that be all new cash outlay, or would 
that include the multiyear contracts fields you've already in entered into, and 
currently hold, either on or
 
off the balance sheet?
 
David Wells
 
It will include the deals that we've already announced and included, and 

I mean, the existing deals.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And the increase referred t
o there is P&L view.
 
David Wells
 
Sure.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So moving to some questions about competition. What is your competitive 
advantage competing against the traditional pay channels? What about 
against all the presumed new entrants that everyone seems to be 
so 
spooked about, such as Amazon, Hulu, Dish, Google and Apple?
 
Reed Hastings
 

people, including me, subscribe to HBO because it's got incredible content in 
addition to Netflix. So 
think of it as multiple channels, and people will 
consume in 
--
 
from multiple providers. That being said, when budgets are 
tight, there's a hierarchy of which ones do you use most. And we definitely 
want to win those. And so our competitive differentiation
 
there is that we're 
a pure on
-
demand experience, to which we can create a much better user 
experience by being pure on
-
demand, we're highly personalized, so it's 
much easier to discover lots of content we might not know exist that's 
unique for each indivi
dual. And then, of course, how more enormously great 
value at $7.99 unlimited and unbundled from the traditional cable system, it 
creates an incredible value. So those are the primary 3.
 
And then in terms of the many new competitors, that's exactly what 
ha
ppens in a big new opportunity. I think everybody sees that Internet video 
is going to be an enormous market over the next couple of years, and it's 
completely predictable that there will be many new entrants. And so we're 
focused on how do we extend our l
ead and our benefits, again, focused on 
streaming.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What, if any impacts, have you seen from Dish Network's effort to build out 
its Blockbuster Movie Pass streaming option? Same question for Amazon 
Prime free video offering.
 
Reed 
Hastings
 
From neither one have we seen any impact.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions about international. How long will the international 
expansion be halted?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we're going to put a pause on our international expansion post the 
U.K. and Ire
land 'till get back to global profitability. So that depends on how 
fast we can grow our global subscriber base, which will be some number of 
quarters. And we're eager to get back to continuing the international 
expansion because we see it as such a large 
opportunity. But we need to 
take a few quarters to get our subscriber base back to the appropriate size.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why did you choose the U.K. and Ireland as your next market, even though 
it's expensive on a relative basis, and are already fairly competi
tive? Hasn't 
Sky locked up most of the content rights already? What is your point of 
differentiation there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Sky Movies does have the fixed major studios, but there is a wide 
range of other movie content available from the non
-
fixed majo
rs, and then 
there's a tremendous amount of television that's available also. And Sky 
Movies is expensive at GBP 16, or about $25 a month and it's only taken 
now by less than 5 million citizens or households. So there's a big 
opportunity for those who don'
t have Sky Movies. And then for those who do 
have Sky Movies for using our TV content selection to attract those 
subscribers.
 
So the answer to the question of why the U.K. and Ireland, it's because we 
see a very attractive market, with great, over
-
the
-
top 
penetration. Many 
consumers are very comfortable with online video, and use it frequently 
from 4 on Demand, from BBC iPlayer, Sky Go, all the different providers. So 
it's a very fertile market in that way. And our big advantage is really 
knowing streaming 
technology well, streaming marketing, and we feel great 
about entering with all of our CE partners.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
On international, you're now investing in multiple markets, when your core 
domestic market is experiencing growing pains. With U.K. and Ireland,
 
you're entering into a market where LOVEFiLM was the first mover. Can you 
discuss how you think about the trade
-
off between establishing a foothold in 
international markets, while attempting to grow domestically through 
broadening the content library?
 
Dav
id Wells
 
Well, in the U.S., we're very confident of our success in streaming. Our 
content is in the best shape it's ever been. It's really an incredible selection 
of content, and that's showing up for us in viewing hours and all the kind of 
key metrics. In
 
Canada, we're very successful, so we're excited about that. 
And now, we're going to be focusing on the U.K. And LOVEFiLM, which is 
owned by Amazon, is a well
-
run firm, they'll be a great competitor, they'll be 
one of a dozen competitors for over
-
the
-
top, 
including, as I mentioned, the 
BBC iPlayer, 4 on Demand, Sky Go and others. So it's 
--
 
we look forward to 
entering in the market and establishing what a great value Netflix is.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I would also add that LOVEFiLm was the first mover in DVD
-
by
-
mail
 
in the 
U.K, it's not clear to me that they're there the first mover in streaming. They 
do have some offering and they're increasing that offering. But if we launch 
in Q1, that it's not clear that they're the first mover in streaming.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Will you 
quantify the magnitude of consolidated losses that you are likely to 
incur in the first part of 2012, as you launch in U.K. and Ireland?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, what we've said in Q4, we guided to contribution profit midpoint of $65 
million loss. If you put th
at together with our statements that Canada is 
roughly breakeven, then you can assume that most of that is Latin American 
loss, plus some expenses related to prepping for the U.K. And I would say 
that the first quarter loss for the U.K. is, in rough number
s, akin to the Latin 
American loss.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In posted your guidance, are you saying that Netflix will be unprofitable on a 
global basis over all of 2012? In other words, were losses over the next few 
quarters be larger than any profits that could come 
in 3Q or 4Q of 2012?
 
Reed Hastings
 
What we said is, that in the first few quarters, we're putting a pause on 
international until they get back to global profitability, and we haven't 
guided to the later half of 2012.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Are any differences in term
s of the types of content that are working in Latin 
America versus the U.S. and Canada? What types of shows and films are 
proving the most popular there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're very early in on Latin America, about 45 days since we launched. So 
we're just 
starting to learn those lessons, and to figure out how to constantly 
improve our service, as we did when we launched Canada, and then 6 
months after we started Canada. So we'll learn more every quarter on that.
 
David Wells
 
An easy anecdote on that one is t
elenovelas work well in Latin America, and 
they don't work in Canada. But I don't think that's telling you anything other 
than what Reed said.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you provide any more detail on your Latin American rollout? Which 
specific countries in Latin Ame
rica have been the biggest contributors to 
your international subscriber growth?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, as you would expect, Mexico and Brazil are the 2 largest broadband 
streaming markets, and those are our 2 largest markets.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving on to a quest
ion about CE devices. In January at the CES 
conference, you announced that Best Buy, Memorex, Panasonic, Samsung, 
Sharp and others would add Netflix buttons to their remote controls to their 
devices. Can you give us an update on these partnerships? Will th
ese 
devices they should be in time for the 2011 winter holiday season?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don't know specifically on specific brands, but on it as a whole, I would say 
the Netflix button program has been going great and there will be lots of 
devices in the ma
rket in Q4 in preparation for Christmas.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Some other miscellaneous questions. What is the company's guidance for its 
future tax rate?
 
I can take this one. We guide to roughly 30% effective tax rate for the full 
year, and probably slightly higher
, something around 38% for Q4, likely 
trending to say, 39% in the following year. If you look at the Q3 effective 
tax rate, it was quite low at approximately 33%, and that was due to the 
expiration of some statutory limitations on some past audits. So we h
ave to 
treat benefit in Q3 that we won't have in future quarters.
 
David Wells
 
And just a clarification, Ellie, you said 37% for the full year, correct? Okay.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Yes. How long will you wait for regulatory clarity in the U.S. related to the 
Facebook
 
issue?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, there's a bill in Congress now, H.R. 2471, which clarifies that a 
consumer does have the right to get permission for their video data that we 
shared, and that predicting what the U.S. Congress is going to is not 
something we're 
going to engage in. If it passes, that's great, and fantastic 
for consumers everywhere. If it doesn't, we'll figure out our next best steps 
at that point.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Great. So at this time, I'd like to turn it over to the operator and begin 
taking live, c
all
-
in questions.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Youssef Squali from 
Jefferies & Company.
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division
 
Reed, just a couple of questions, or really one question going back t
o the 
DVD business. Clearly, it's 
--
 
as it starts atrophying, I'm just trying to 
understand what is the value of that business to you now, outside of just 
being a cash cow? Are there any synergies that still exist between that and 
the streaming business? A
nd if there is any value to actually keep it under 
the same umbrella?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Youssef, at this point, it's a source of profits funding our international 
expansion, and it's a source of satisfaction to the more than 10 million 
members who 
subscribe to our DVD service, whether they also subscribe to 
streaming or not. And so we'll keep it and run it steadily, and keep the 
service levels great for it. So that would be the plan going forth.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our next question com
es from... [Operator 
Instructions]
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, that's okay you guys. Our job as we see, it is try to anticipate your 
questions and answer as many of them proactively in our investor letter as 
possible. I'll take the absence of telephone questions t
hat, at least in that 
dimension, we're doing a good job. And we want to thank everyone for their 
support. We know it's been an extremely challenging time to be a 
shareholder over the last couple of months.
 
And I want to tell everyone that we are extremely 
focused on growing our 
streaming business on a global basis, and believe it's a tremendous 
opportunity to create a very valuable and important and respected firm, and 
that's what every day here at Netflix is spent doing.
 
So with that, thank you all very mu
ch.

1/20/17,Netflix,"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Netflix First Quarter 2011 Earnings 

remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Ellie Mertz, Vice 
President of Finance and 
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix 2011 Earnings Q&A 
Session. We now start our financial results for the first quarter at 
approximately 1:05 p.m. Pacific Time today. The 
shareholder letter and the 
Q1 financial results and the webcast of this Q&A session are all available at 
the company's Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.com.
 
As is our standard practice, this call will consist solely of Q&A, and we're 
going to condu
ct the Q&A via e
-
mail. Please email your questions to 
ir@netflix.com.
 
We may make forward
-
looking statements during this call regarding the 
company's future performance. Actual results may differ materially from 
these statements due to risks and uncertaint
ies related to the business. A 
detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report 
on Form 10
-
K filed with the Commission on February 18, 2011. A 
rebroadca
st of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 
6:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.
 
Now let's move directly to questions. We've organized the questions by topic 
design, and we'll start with content questions. Here we go.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer
 
Session
 
Ellie Mertz
 
As you acquire digital content rights, what level of competition are you 
seeing during the negotiation?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There's a substantial level of competition, as you would expect, not only 
amongst the online players but against cabl
e networks and sometimes in 
partnership with cable networks in the window sharing. So content owners 
want to get the best price for their content as you would expect, and they're 
pretty sophisticated about making sure that they've got all the possible 
offe
rs on the table.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Related question, how much risk is there that Amazon will outbid for Netflix 
for digital rights to Starz content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'm not sure that Amazon specifically is a different risk. I would say, in 
general, Starz, like any
 
other content provider wants to get the most money 
for their content. The Starz deal is non
-
exclusive today so it could be across 
a range of providers, it could be a single. But I don't think I'd particularly 
single out Amazon as a risk factor relative to
, say, Hulu Plus or Dish or 
anybody else.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In the past, Reed has commented about shutting down Red Envelope and 

unreleased content, but they've bet on creativity and was out
side of Netflix's 
circle of confidence. How can you reconcile these previous remarks with the 
recent move to invest in the House of Cards series?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, there is a slight shift there, which is we're willing to try a little bit more 
riskier wor
k than we've done with a little bit of our budget, and then we're 
going to see how it goes. So sort of how we approach international, when we 
tried Canada first before getting too committed. And our theory is that with 
serialized content, we may be able to
 
build an audience very effectively 
because if you 
--
 
with on
-
demand, you can get back to the first episode as 
momentum around the series builds. I don't know if it's anything we'd bet 
the farm on, but we're certainly willing to try it with a small percent
 
of the 
budget in House of Cards and then 2 or 3 other smaller ones that we would 
look for. And if we're successful with it, then we would expand our circle of 
confidence a little bit more, a little bit more. So we'll take it step
-
by
-
step 
and year
-
by
-
year.
 
David Wells
 
To add to that, this is David. In the House of Cards deal, it was a 
prepackaged deal that came to us. We weren't looking for 
--
 
out there 
looking for creative talent or directors or a script. It's a small nuance, but it 
was an important one fo
r us and the fact that we weren't having to manage 
the larger part of the creative process.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
An additional question on House of Cards. Are you seeking to buy domestic 
or global rights to House of Cards? Is your intent to keep House of Cards 
excl
usive to Netflix? Or actually presenting the series on Netflix, will you look 
to sell subsequent lengths to other cable or broadcast networks or online 
services?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, House of Cards doesn't start until the fall of next year so it'll be a 
cou
ple years out before we are faced with those decisions, and we've 
licensed it for multiple territories.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Okay. Press speculation puts your spend on Mad Men at nearly $1 million per 
episode, which seems to be lower than recent syndication deals f
or 
procedurals, but higher than deals for some other low profile, serialized 
series. Why did you just decide to pay for exclusivity? And should we think 
of your Mad Men deal as typical of some other TV deals you may be doing 
going forward or was it the uni
que case?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't comment on the specific deal terms of any of our deals.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you share any data that supports your view that putting a previous 
season on Netflix grows audience for a current season of the show? Wouldn't 
Netflix also diminish sales of prior season DVDs?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, what we've seen as an example with Spartacus is we've seen 
something even more aggressive, which is we have current season with 
Spartacus, that's a Starz original, which has been very su
ccessful. And now, 
it's one of the highest rated shows on cable despite the fact or maybe 
because of the fact that it's also on Netflix. And so I think, in general, it's 
opened our eyes to the fact that more and more awareness of a given show 
sometimes cre
ates more viewing on both cable and our MVPD [multichannel 
video programming distributor] and on Netflix.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Given the size of your subscriber base, is it getting easier to negotiate 
content deals or is there still a level of animosity with some c
ontent owners 
that must be worked through?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don't think there's any animosity. It's only a question of is our check big 
enough. And so as we get a larger subscriber base, that becomes easier to 
write bigger checks. And it's very respectful, 
I would say, across the board.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to the topic of international. In terms of international expansion and 
content acquisition in non
-
U.S. markets, what type of expenditures do you 
anticipate making for locally relevant content, and how might
 
deals with 
foreign outlets differ from domestic deals?
 
Reed Hastings
 

With Canada, we've got a fair amount of Canadian content and it's quite 
successful for us. And our new terri
tories will also license some local content, 
and then we'll feel our way along as we see what's our subscribers are 
viewing and what they enjoy.
 
David Wells
 
I'd say there's an opportunity here outside the U.S. in some markets. And 
with respect to some loca
l content, there might not be a secondary market 
or a third or fourth sort of channel for the content owner. So to the extent 
that we might be the only syndicated buyer in the market, it's going to work 
well for us in terms of the economics.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Wi
ll new geographies take priority over the U.S. as you build out content? Or 
should we continue to expect the U.S. to see the bulk of the spending?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think you should think about them as separate. We'll run the U.S. around 
14% operating margin
 
and spend on content in accordance with that. And in 
international, you'll spend as we see appropriate to launch the service, 

as possible, within 8 quarters in our target model get
 
each territory to be 
positive operating margin. In Canada, we've been very successful and we 
intend to be at breakeven on a operating contribution basis within 4 quarters 
of launch which is in Q3 and really quite extraordinary. That's probably too 
high a 
bar for every international territory, but 8 quarters feels good.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
On the topic of Canada, can you provide a little color on how the ISP 
bandwidth cap in Canada have impacted consumer behavior? What 
percentage of your Canadian customers are usin
g the new ""managed video 
quality tool"" in watching lower quality video? Also do you believe ISPs in the 
U.S. or other countries are thinking of capping bandwidth in a similar strict 
fashion?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't have any indication that in the U.S. low, 
call it, below 100 
gigabytes data caps are going to become a significant offering. In Canada, 
it's switched to default so every virtually everybody is on our low data 
usage, slightly lower video quality plan. And it is helping both directly in 
terms of the
 
usage and indirectly in terms of the general fear of usage 
charges, so it's a mitigator. I'm not sure I would call it a solution. It helps. I 
think, the right solution, over time, is that Canadians enjoy great untapped 
Internet like the rest of the develo
ped world.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Related question, how do usage patterns in Canada perform relative to your 
expectation given the various cap rates? What drove the more modest 
subscriber growth performance relative to your expectations?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think on what
 
drove the overshoot on the forecast is just we don't have 
any seasonal data. So the growth was very consistent throughout the 
quarter, and we're really happy with it. And it's a pretty small percentage, 
but we just don't have multiple years of year
-
on
-
yea
r data. In terms of the 
caps, they play a role, but they played a role from inception. The caps are 
not something that were new this quarter. The caps have been in effect for a 
year or more in Canada.
 
David Wells
 
Just to add to that, we achieved 8% of 
broadband household penetration in 
Canada in 7 months. It took us 6 years in the U.S. to get there. Just so that 
you don't feel like we're sort of trying to makes ourselves feel better on the 

t a great 
business going in Canada and we're excited about going forward.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Another related question. The shareholder letter mentioned the seasonality 
curve in Canada. Can you elaborate on this comment? Is your initial sense 
that the markets simi
lar to other colder regions, where subscriber growth is 
more tepid in the warm months?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We'll know in 1.5 year from now after we've gone through the initial 
seasonality is massed by the launch. And so you really can't get a clean read 
until at
 
least a year from now about the beginnings of the seasonality effect.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Is it reasonable to assume that Netflix could enter as many as two 
international markets or more per year starting in 2012?
 
Reed Hastings
 
If we continue to see the kind of s
uccess that we've seen in Canada, if we 
think it would be very smart for us to move at least that fast, yes.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You noted a high probability of success in our second international market, 
driving early content commitments for a third market What a
re the data 
points that you focus us on to define success prior to launching in a market?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The reason that we feel a high degree of confidence is how well Canada has 
done, how well our licensing has gone for content in our second international
 
market, and our qualitative focus group work on the reactions in that market 
for our service. So those are all very healthy indicators that we'll enjoy 
success.
 
David Wells
 
And those qualitative factors have a lot to do with how much that content is 
going
 
to cost us relative to where we think we could price it and the 
consumers' willingness to pay based on their other entertainment 
alternatives. And we've grown more, I think, confident over the last year 
given where we think those economics are going to wo
rk out.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to the topic of subscribers and subscriber metrics. Do you think we 
get tiered pricing for multiuser households from Netflix by year end? In that 
case, how big an addressable market is it?
 
Reed Hastings
 

re was that the individual subscriber market is 
that 2 to 3 or few year, I think is how we characterized it in the last Investor 
Letter. And we haven't changed our point of view. This is a gradual 
evolution. It's not going to be an immediate 90
-
 
or 180
-
day
 
thing for Netflix. 
And I think pricing is certainly part of that evolution, changes to the 
interface are part of that evolution, changes to how we 
--
 
if and when we 
enforce concurrent stream limits, either per device or by account. So there's 
lots of thin
gs for us to figure out and tease out. We wouldn't want to alienate 
the subscriber or the consumer as we go through those. And I think that 
we'll evolve to those over the next couple of years.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you share any details on Facebook integration t
hat you are working on? 
What will be the primary objective of the same? Enhance your 
recommendation engine or drive engagement or acquire subscribers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's better for us to share those details when we launch that. So I'll defer 
that.
 
Ellie Me
rtz
 
Are you starting to see DVD subscribers trade down from multi
-
op 
subscription?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don't think so. In fact, what we've said before is that basically downward 
migration and upward migration are canceling each other, and that's what 
we contin
ue to see. With respect to the price change, we saw behavior that 
was more linked to the immediate announcement than to the credit card 
change. Meaning when a subscriber actually got the change to the price on 
their bill, there wasn't as much activity as w
hen they were notified of the 
change.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So related to the price increase. Was the price increase a contributor to the 
increase in churn or was it more of a normal seasonal pattern?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Normal seasonal pattern. It's also a factor of 
the tremendous growth we saw 
in Q1. If you followed our company for a long time, you'll note that when we 
grow quickly, our churn goes up because the retention rates of early 
subscriber are lower than those subscribers that have been around for 12 or 
more 
months. And we continue to see that.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Another question on churn. Can you comment some on the churn rates for 
streaming
-
only customers in the U.S.? And is it above or below the average? 
Do you expect a decline over time as customers are maybe tes
ting out this 
service today?
 
Reed Hastings
 
What we said is streaming only has a higher churn rate. It's easier to get in 
of and out of so it's the same as we said last quarter.
 
David Wells
 
Yes and we've said before that the streaming
-
only plan actually cro
ssed over 
the DVD only. So that is retention for streaming
-
only subscribers is actually 
a higher rate than DVD
-
only subscribers. It's going to be slightly lower than 
hybrid, but it's better.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
And the final question on churn. It still seems 
like the overall churn rate for 
the company is still high relative to other MVPD companies, and causes you 
to respend SAC [subscriber acquisition cost] dollars on customers that have 
already been Netflix subscribers in the past? If your customer satisfacti
on is 
very high on your streaming products, shouldn't your churn materially 
decline over the next 18 months in the United States?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, given how stable churn has been the last 2 years, I'd be hard put to 
think why it should suddenly decline 
in the next 18 months. And the 
question refers to us like other MVPD, and MVPD is a much different service. 
It's premises
-
based. It's more expensive, and it's more considered an 
essential service so it's really just quite different in all those dimensions.
 
We 
have a low subscriber acquisition cost, and we have higher churn. And 
people do test out the service, come back, go out, go in. And that's fine 
because our overall growth, our net adds are continuing to increase.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to the topic of SAC.
 
Why did the domestic SAC rise so much quarter
-
over
-
quarter? Which should be the right base level going forward, Q4's 10 
87? Or Q1's 14 38?
 
David Wells
 

in the last quarter's Inves
tor Letter and we reiterate it in this Investor Letter 
is that we identified the fact that we would have additional money. We would 
love to spend it on streaming content. Because of the complexity of those 
contracts, there's more lead time acquired and the
refore, we put the money 
into marketing. So the higher SACs sequentially from Q4 to Q1 is a 
somewhat of an artifact of additional marketing dollars we spent up to the 
efficient point in Q1. And we'll continue to make that trade
-
off going 
forward. Now what 
we've said in the Investor Letter, just to remind folks, is 
that we're going to weigh streaming cost. We plan to do that. We're going to 
continue to do that, and so you should see marketing as a percentage of 
revenue somewhat mollified relative to Q1.
 
Elli
e Mertz
 
As subscribers have grown to streaming, how's the demographics of the 
Netflix subscriber changed? Is the demographic in Canada comparable to the 
U.S.?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, there is no material difference, in fact.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you get U.S. in SF [
San Francisco] Bay Area household penetration?
 
David Wells
 

penetration in the U.S. is 21%. You can calculate that for yourself by looking 
at the 22.8 million U.S. subscribers and taki
ng it over roughly 110 million 
households. The reason that people ask us this is we've given out Bay Area 
before because when we launched the DVD service back in 1999, we started 
in the Bay Area. And we had thought at that time that the Bay Area would 
be a
 
good proxy for the rest of the country. We've come and evolved that 
notion to believe that that's not necessarily the case especially with a 
streaming product that we've launched nationally. So in terms of 
penetration, it's 21% U.S.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Your Lette
r to Shareholders mentioned that you expect DVD shipments to 
decline slightly year
-
over
-
year. In the past, Netflix has announced various 
milestones in DVD shipments such as 1 billion that were in 2007 and 2 billion 
April 2009 just shipped. When did Netflix
 
ship the 3 billion discs? Are there 
other notable DVD milestones?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Our focus is really on streaming at this point. So I don't anticipate that we 
would have or will make those kind of announcements.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to the topic of 
competition. Can you speak to the competitive 
landscape sans peers [ph] and how serious it is today versus, say, a year 
ago, especially with Amazon's free video streaming offering and with Dish 
streaming HBO content and Starz channels for free?
 
Reed Hastin
gs
 
Well, a big market attracts a lot of competition. I think, it's pretty clear to 
everyone that online video is a big opportunity. There'll be a number of 
substantial competitors. If Dish launches something into the Blockbuster 
brand, that'll be the newes
t entrant. Clearly, Hulu Plus and Amazon may or 
may not have been having a success but they haven't held us back at all, at 
what you'd expect to the growing market because in Q1, domestically, our 
net adds were up over 90%. So we feel great about that.
 
Ell
ie Mertz
 
You mentioned Dish as a competitor. Could you elaborate? Blockbuster is 
currently a VOD product, white labeling Sonic technology. Do you expect 
that to change?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We really don't know what Dish is up to, but presumably they paid a coupl
e 
hundred million for Blockbuster not for its technology but for its brand. It's a 
well
-
known brand. And they would do that, it would be consistent to do that 
if they had plans to launch a service with a fair amount of content and a fair 
amount of marketin
g such that it would make sense to pay $300 million to 
be able to use the Blockbuster brand.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
One more question on competition. How do you look at HBO and HBO GO as 
a competitive product as it prepares to expand across the many platforms 
Netflix
 
currently occupies?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, HBO GO is an implementation of TV Everywhere. A consumer can't 
subscribe to HBO GO directly. And so it really doesn't compete today. I 
would say our overall effort that TV Everywhere is making is how to improve 
MVPD
. And one aspect of that is HBO Online. But for example, in the 
Comcast implementation, you don't use HBO GO as the user interface. You 
use the Xfinity user interface. And so, I think, you'll see different 
implementations and the only 
--
 
the competitive th
reat to take out of that 
for us is TV Everywhere.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving on to questions about the financials. In response to a question posed 
last quarter regarding the significant increase in AP, the company indicated 
that ""largely payments, are at a short t
iming at the end of the quarter that 
could reverse itself in Q1."" Can the company indicate why did this not 
reverse in Q1 and instead AP increased further?
 
David Wells
 
So I was just responding to you the sequential increase in AP last quarter. I 
answered i
t somewhat narrowly in saying that the two contrasts that drove 
that AP increase were going to reverse themselves out in Q2, and they did. 
On top of that, in addition to that, we signed a bunch of new content deals 
that we discussed in the Investor Letter.
 
And to the extent that those deals 
were within a year with identified titles, it drove the AP up. So let me answer 
this in a general sense. Cash payments for content increased $130 million 
year
-
over
-
year versus $110 million year
-
over
-
year increase in the 
expense 
associated with that content. So to the extent that we'd talked about close 
matching of our payment terms with our expense, we are continuing to 
execute on that. We ran a little bit ahead in Q1. In terms of the sequential 
increase, the cash out the
 
door for content was roughly in line with the 
expense increase. So I think you should see the accounts payable and the 
associated long
-
term accrued payable line increase with our continued 
investment in streaming content. I don't think you'll see it incre
ase at quite 
the same rate, say, going forward as you saw in the last couple of quarters, 
but it will go up.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you explain the large sequential and year
-
over
-
year drop in acquisitions 
for the DVD content library?
 
David Wells
 
I'm sorry, repeat
 
that one more time.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I can handle it. There's a mix there when you do a rev share title. Most of 
the expense, essentially all of it, does not go through that line. So that can 
be a shift towards rev share from purchasing DVDs.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
On 
the streaming side, are storage and incoming costs typically fixed or 
variable? And are they significant relative to content delivery cost?
 
Reed Hastings
 
They are not significant.
 
David Wells
 
No, not significant.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
What drove the G&A 
increase in the quarter, and what are your expectations 
going forward?
 
David Wells
 
So mostly headcount. There were some increase related to stock comp 
expense due to employees taking more equity compensation versus cash 
competition, but mostly a headcount 
increase.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why is fulfillment cost still growing? Do you expect it to slow as DVD 
shipments decline?
 
David Wells
 
Fulfillment cost as a percent of revenue is actually declining. Fulfillment, the 
absolute fulfillment cost is growing because we shi
pped more in the quarter. 
We have more subscribers that have more credit card expense associated 
with them with their revenue. But as a percent of revenue, it's actually been 
declining over last 6 quarters or so.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Next question. If you are a gro
wth company, why are you dividending cash 
out to shareholders rather than reinvesting it back into the business?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're generating cash flow when we anticipate continuing to generate cash 
flow.
 
David Wells
 
And I think we're doing both. I think
 
we're trying to draw a fine distinction 
between being a pure company that invests everything we possibly have into 
growth and also returning some to shareholders. So I think it's consistent 
with the strategy that we've had for quite some time of trying to
 
draw both, 
to do both; be a growth company and also make sure that we're not setting 
up a false promise to return earnings down the road.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Turning to a handful of miscellaneous questions. When will we start seeing 
Netflix streaming on Android d
evices? Will future versions of Androids solve 
the DRM [digital rights management] issues that prevent making Netflix 
widely available on the platform?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're working hard on Android. Don't have any news at this call. It's a big 
priority for u
s, and stay tuned.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Device partitions have been a significant component of building out the 
footprint of streaming subs domestically, and it seems like it could be used 
as a valuable tool in building out the international footprint. To what exte
nt 
will your U.S. device partnerships be applicable internationally? Or what will 
it take build out a similar ecosystem of devices?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We very much expect to work with our CE partners around the world. And 
certainly in Canada, we've already done
 
that with specific Canadian 
implementations across all of our major CE partners. And there's now many, 
many devices in the Canadian market. And that's a good blueprint for what 
we'll be doing going forward.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
In the press release, you say T
V shows and feature films are consumed in 
equal volumes. Is that true domestically and in Canada?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's approximately true in both, yes.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to a marketing question. [indiscernible] is likely to be a very 
lucrative 
upfront process for both broadcast and cable networks come this 
May and June? Do you see it paying what is rumored to possibly be as high 
as low teens price hikes for the network add inventory for marketing 
purposes? Or do you just bypass network televisio
n spending and gear your 
marketing spend more towards lower CPN alternative such as outdoor or 
radio?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We always try to market most efficiently we can. And sometimes if one 
channel, say, outdoor or online or print or network to increasing cost
s, it 
would get less of our total dollars. So it's a big broad mix of which the 2 
primary components for us are online and television, not necessarily network 
but cable offering.

10/18/16,Netflix,"Good afternoon. I am Erin Kasenchak, Director of Investor Relations at 
Netflix. And I would like to welcome you to our Fourth Quarter 2013 

-
looking 

performance and actual results may differ.
 
Joining me today is Reed Hastings, our CEO; David Wells, CFO; Ted 
Sarandos, Chief Content Officer and helping to facilitate is Rich Greenfield of 
BTIG Research and Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.
 
Let me turn it over to D
oug for first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay, thanks Erin. Thanks everybody for being here with us today. So the 
first question I wanted to ask about the fourth quarter and guidance, you 
guided to 2.25 million subs for 

you noted that you are in the middle of the S curve. Can you give us some 
color on the seasonal trajectory of 1Q? What percentage of your subs 
typically come in very early in the quarter? And also can you talk about
 
your 

 
Reed Hastings
 

is or at least it is the same seasonal pattern so far in the quarter, which is 

atively front
-
loaded compared to other quarters. And then your second 


for the year and then that
 
pretends very well for us and we are excited 

 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
When you wrote your last quarterly letter, Reed, you talked about the 

 
what kind of the stock price volatility you referenced you would actually 
broke it
 
out in the letter, you said some of the deals like the euphoria back 
from 2003, your stock I think that evening was at $354 a share. That 
section was removed from the quarterly letter this quarter. I think your 
stock right now was trading at about $393, c
urious is the euphoria now gone 
given your business conditions or do you still feel like there is euphoria built 
into the stock?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well at least, I was clearly right about the volatility, Rich. I mean, we have 
been all over the math here. And I
 
think we will just stay focused on doing 
the best we can on improving the service, growing the membership and I 

the stocks.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
In your long
-
term view, y
ou asked about 

 
you talked about apps replacing 
channels, screens proliferating, just wanted to ask you more specifically on 
the last point here, we frequently ask about mobile. Sometimes, I feel like 
you may downplay it a little bit in terms of impact, b
ecause this user base 

your current thinking on how material mobile is to your business now and 
going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 

s some, but so much 
of our viewing is on smart TVs or TVs connected to a Blu
-
ray player or a 
game console. For a lot of our entertainment, we are really pretty large 
screen centric. And so we are less driven by mobile trends than say a music 
service would 
be.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Do you feel like that difference at all for newer subscribers?
 
Reed Hastings
 

be any one screen. So we were great on a tablet both Android and iOS and
 
we were great on the TV. And so we are not trying to pick and choose. And 
in fact in any time period say a month many subscribers will use us on 
multiple screens, so watch some on the smart TV, some on their laptop and 

for us.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 

and ended on another.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
David, you talked about wanting to have increased transparency for the 
reason for shifting to a 
single point estimate for guidance. Is there also a 

 
David Wells
 

sort of made the shift. I think for you guys, you are al
ways trying to figure 
out if our guidance ranges also include modest conservatism on top of an 
internal forecast and I think for us it was an attempt to just remove that one 
marginal layer. You already had the midpoint of our ranges. We wanted to 
simplify 
our message and the transparency of our guidance and just moving 
to our straight internal forecast does that.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
And two quarters ago. Sorry go ahead.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Sorry Rich. David would you agree we had the same 
visibility we have every 
Q1 at this period? There is nothing special about this Q1?
 
David Wells
 
Yes that was the intent of my first statement which is there is nothing 
special about this quarter.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
But there is something special about 
this quarter that you highlighted a 
couple of years ago which is the Olympics and there is a Winter Olympics 
and curious to what extent having the Olympics impacts your guidance and 
whether you can read through anything towards the World Cup this summer 
an
d maybe just one other factor to throw in there as well, you got Season 2 
of House of Cards, is that playing into the increased confidence in Q1 as 
well?
 
David Wells
 
I will take the craft [ph] and then I will go to Reed. I would say Rich that you 
correctly
 
articulated that that there is factors on both sides. The Olympics 
for us are generally are negative because people are focused on watching 
something else rather than signing up for Netflix. We feel like the social [ph] 
games are small factor in that and 
might be disproportionate in sort of the 
territories that are really excited about the Winter Olympics. The U.S. is 
excited generally, watches it but it's not a large factor and then House of 
Cards will be on the other side of that which will be a positive
. So our 
guidance numbers reflect all of those pluses and minus but again there is 
nothing particularly special about this quarter. You have articulated one or 
two swing factors, every quarter we usually have one or two swing factors in 
terms of influencin
g our guide.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And I know it will be in the filing soon, but if you could give us an update on 
off balance sheet obligation talk about the U.S. and international businesses.
 
David Wells
 
Sure Doug. So usually when people are asking this
 
or asking about that 
content obligations or the overall obligations filed in our financials and those 
rose from 6.5 to 7.3. There is a little bit of rounding. So it was a 700 million 

bout 
and we have announced. So the Marvel deal and some of the originals, the 
Universal deal and the Sony deal that we have done in terms of extending 
some existing deals.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And then maybe another balance sheet question to stay on this
 
topic. Can 
you provide some background as to what content assets or prepaid content 

presentation of the balance sheet?
 
David Wells
 
Sure because it has gotten so small that it's 
immaterial in terms of those 
changes. So our team felt like it was not needed to break it out anymore but 

 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And perhaps just lastly in terms of 1Q. A strong guide here but looks like the 
EPS is per
haps a little bit lighter for 1Q. Can you just talk a little bit more 

quarter?
 
David Wells
 

business does s
ee a decrease in profitability because of increased usage and 
a sort of continued small decline of the subscriber base. Our international is 
going to see a pretty good improvement, you see not in our guide. We will 
see a step
-
up a little bit in our G&A cos
t as those are reflected in sort of 
mark to market employee compensation but those would be the big factors 

 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Can we move over to pricing? When you look at your lon
g term view 
statement you actually removed the phrase I believe at some point over the 
last several months simplicity is at our core and there seems to be a change 
in your philosophy surrounding pricing and I think review it for a long time 
talked about th
e importance of keeping it simple with one price point 


 
Reed Hastings
 
It's an interesting story, a friend of mine I was preaching
 
about simplicity 
and a friend of mine pointed out that the simplest iPhone would have no 

had no App Store and that in fact great product is a combination of 
functionality and 


shifted away from simplicity to an end goal to simplicity as an input towards 
ease of use and towards matching functionality
 
that people want and so we 
have slightly are more focused on best functionality independent of it's 
simplicity and of course try to make it as easy to use and we try to make our 

s all. 
We added the four
-
screen program almost a year ago back in April of last 

think we are justified we are willing to take a slightly richer offering and 

ight be better for consumers and for us.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Reed, can you also comment on the $6.99 plan who you are targeting with 
that offering? And does it say anything in your view in terms of penetration 
and maturity in the U.S.?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We 


much into that other than we are probing around the edges. There is no 
definite plan to do that. I wo
uld say generally as we put in the letter, we are 
trying to figure out some models of good, better, best price tiering that 
makes sense and provide some flexibility for our customers at least for our 
new customers, our existing customers of course we would
 
grandfather very 
generously.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
When you look at the $6.99 plan, why does somebody who is willing to 
spend $7.99, why does a dollar make a difference, I mean do you really 
think that there is that much impact from that $1?
 
Reed Hastings
 

But and going from 33 million U.S. members who hopefully more than twice 
that, every bit of savings is important to people. And so we definitely look at 
those kind
 

other than we are testing some things. And we are continuing to try to figure 
out how to evolve to a good, better, best plan that makes sense to 
consumers and feels fair.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTI
G Research
 
Any early elasticity learnings though you can talk to directly?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. Once we figure out what we think the best plan and we will talk about 
that and why we think it is, but we are not specifically taking a part at each 
option that we
 
are testing.
 
David Wells
 
The only thing I would add, this is David 

 
the only thing I would add on that 

levels, but in pricing period, there is also a sense that consumers ma
ke 
choices around heuristics. And so a dollar rich might not sound like a lot on a 
logical basis, but consumers may have shortcuts that they make, they take 
the middle or the upper or the low and so that factors into the right course 
as well.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And then if we think about it on the other extreme, there is likely a large 
percentage of subscribers that would perhaps pay dramatically more for 
Netflix service that had even more content on it. How does the company 
address how they might reach
 
that subset of members without risking the 
growth at lower prices?
 
Reed Hastings
 


us to have it i
n addition to that. So we have to pay the full not of getting an 


think we will stick at what we are doing
 
now and just continue to do it a little 

the last eight quarters.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
You referenced before the iPod or the iPhone, when you think about ways to 
tier o
bviously there is things like WiFi or Mini and not Mini for an iPad and 
iPhone, are there more ways to tier for Netflix than simultaneous streams 
and SD
-
HD what other things should we be thinking about?
 
Reed Hastings
 

out what works best in our testing and 
research with consumers, but sure there is a dozen type of things that you 
could tier on in principle, but the trick is not having too many factors, 
keeping it understandable and then really that it feels fair and res
onates 
with consumers.

Last week, HBO commented that shared passwords are not a big issue for 
HBO Go, because those users eventually will have enough money to 

 
Reed Hastings
 
That was an interesting comment I suppose. So, I guess Plepler is the CEO 

plepler@hbo.com and his password is Netflix.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
When you think abou
t advertising I think that there is a lot of people who 
now believe investors that believe that your services has gotten to the point 
where it's sticky enough but people would tolerate preroll ads such as when 
they go to the movie theater and they are forc
ed to tolerate several minutes 
of preroll ads. Is that something that you would ever envision doing?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We have no play on to go towards advertising based models. Our grand at 
least over the next couple of years and at this point really stands f
or that 
commercial free experience that we have where the consumer is in control of 
the experience. They get to watch when they want, they get to pause it 
when they want. They can play it when they want, watch it how and where 
they want. So it's fundamenta


 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Do your contracts even allow it though?
 
Reed Hastings
 

Ted could talk of it, it 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah it tends to be a separate set of rights and to your point we have got a 
go to grade extremes [ph] to give consumers control of the content yo
u 
know going all the way to the extreme of putting the entire season out at 
one time so the notion of frustrating for the first or the last couple of 
minutes seems a little out of step at that.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
I will shift gears and talk about net n
eutrality a little bit. What is the impact 
of the net neutrality rolling last week and what is your expectation for how 
the ISPs little act in the near term?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well as we put in letter Doug there are some draconian scenarios where 
some ISPs bloc
k Netflix but we think it's very unlikely and the most likely 
scenario at least in the near term is that there is no real change and the 
reason is if ISP especially major ISPs were to contemplate blocking Netflix or 
other services it will significantly fue
l the fire for more regulation which is 
not something they are interested in. So the long term we still need to figure 
out what it means and how that works out but I think in short term it's very 
likely that there is no change.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
You lobbied pretty hard though against the court overturning the net 
neutrality rules. Verizon obviously lobbied very hard to have the rules 
overturned, I guess there is a lot of investments who fear that this is kind of 
a zero sum game and even i
f there isn't a notable attack from Verizon or 
other ISPs I think the fear is it's a little bit like boiling a frog. Does this turn 
it up and tweak it little bit each year just to disadvantage you versus 
themselves. So it may not be overly noticeable, how 
much of an issue is 
little bits of bad behavior?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well it's a legitimate fear I suppose but we operate in 41 countries that have 
quite of a variety of states of net neutrality and we never had a significant 
problem to
-

won't or we haven't to
-
date and I think 
what it is ISPs have a very profitable business and they want to expand that 
business and part of delivering and expanding for consumers is having a 
good Netflix experience and good YouTube experience, things like th
at, 

economic interests are pretty coaligned which is how it's worked so far.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And can you comment on Open Connect and does it mitigate some of the 
impact here a

now with Open Connect?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure Open Connect is a pretty independent issue. We could be delivering 
through Akamai and an ISP could block Netflix vid, so they are really not 
closely associ
ated other than they are both on vid delivery. And then Open 

more ISPs, higher percentage of the traffic but think of that as a cost 
savings and improvement as opposed to say fundamen
tal to these net 
neutrality issues.

JPMorgan
 

Sandvine studies. I was I think when we were looking at the fourth quarter 
statement it showed I think 16 megs was their st
ream necessary for a 4k 
stream and kind of your eyes pop
-
out when you see the amounts of data 
that a 4k stream call it a two hour movie if we think about streaming all of 
Breaking Bad over the course of the next few weeks given how many 
seasons you have. H
ow does 4k going to impact the net neutrality debate? 
Just given how much data, I assume that 30% surges be you will have 4k 
content before a lot of others. So your 30% would really surge over the next 
couple of years?
 
Reed Hastings
 
If you are on the cost 
side than ISP, then you may be affected by that and 
think about that, but if you are on the revenue side, you are celebrating, 
because now there is a real need to get a 40 or 50 megabit plan. So you 
could support two streams and you have got something to g
et people to 
upgrade to the faster plans. And so as long as the fast plans are priced 

faster, applications get richer, which was a reason to get faster PCs, which 
then enabled 
richer applications. And that ecosystem really grew. Now of 
course in the short
-
term, there is not many people who own a 4K TV. So the 
4K is going to come about as a percentage of all viewing fairly slowly, 
because you got to get a 4K TV and then only a pe
rcentage of our content is 
available in 4K. So there is no tidal wave coming in the next 18 months. But 
it is a great way to work with ISPs so that their higher speed plans have 
more merit in the consumer size.

rs and move over to international, you talked about a 
more expensive European rollout coming in 2014. There is clearly a lot of 
speculation on you entering France and Germany in particular. But can you 
talk a little bit about maybe those countries specific
ally the over the top 
players they are currently state of broadband and the interest in U.S. 
content there?
 
Reed Hastings
 

to expand to. So there is a number of players in all the ma
jor markets and 
then the smaller markets. They are all doing good work. I think what we 
have seen with our success in the UK is that there can be very strong 
players like the BBC iPlayer, (indiscernible) and Sky. And we can still build a 
very successful bu
siness. And so I think the key is having unique content, a 
great reputation, a good value proposition and we can succeed and in many 
cases, that competitors can also. So we mostly focus on finding good 
markets that love content and that will steadily expan
d in Europe.
 
David Wells
 
And to your second part of your question, the appetite for U.S. content 
around the world still remains very, very high throughout Europe, 
particularly. And you think and there are some pockets of the world where 
local content is no
w outpacing U.S. programming on the movie side, but that 


 
is that necessarily a reflection of the desire for the content 
itself as much as it is to specific distribution models in those countries.

So you thin
k content like House of Cards or Breaking Bad, those series work 
well in or would work well in markets like France or Germany specifically.
 
Reed Hastings
 
House of Cards and Orange is the New Black is a hit for us in every territory 
I preyed in and is a 

travels incredibly well those shows too. And Breaking Bad is an enormous 
show for us in every one of our territories.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
And just because you brought it up when you have
 
sold shows like Orange is 

when you launch in those markets? Do those write back to you if you chose 
to launch in France or are you added to market with some of your key 
originals to th
e length of the series?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It depends. There is multiple windows and we will continue to have those 
negotiations as we get close to those launches.

Can you give us some color on how international subs breakout by market? 
H
ave you crossed the 2 million sub number in the UK? And then perhaps 
also a comment on profitability in the UK and Canada if you are there yet or 
how far away?
 
David Wells
 

profitability
 
or the number of subs. We have said in the past in there or 
probably two years ago that Canada broke even within two years, but 
beyond that, we are really treating international as the segment again for 
competitive reasons.

David Wells
 
Sorry Rich. Doug, this is David. I would just say that for those that have 
been following us for a while. I mean, we have been making consistent 
statements about improvements in every market. So we have given some 
col
or in terms of if you have tracked the history from launch, where we 
might be along the way and you should get some confidence that there is 
improvements in every market we made that comment in several quarters.

So there is no way to
 


broken even already, because you are just no longer ever going to comment 
on individual market profitability outside of Canada?

in London but not in England, but not in Scotland or vice a versa. In other 
words what we care about is the total P&L and much of the licensing is either

Can you talk about the sort of early returns on the set top box integrations 
in Europe particular through the middle partnerships? H
ow those are working 
so far? If you could comment a little bit on the economics and then also 
what you think the potential is for future deals that are similar going 
forward?
 
David Wells
 

t one 
was with Virgin. Virgin has always been an innovator in the UK market. They 
are really strong cable company. Lots of fiber, they have done lots of 
investment to have some of the highest speed broadbands in Europe and in 

e working with them, it's on the TiVo platform. 
It's been a really great reception. It's just very convenient for people use 
Netflix right on the same input and the same device that they are used to 
using it on and of course we have had several years of hi
story of working 


the world and I think what an MVPD sees is that people are going to use 
Netflix anywa
y and I as an MVPD would rather have the music on my remote 
control in my box than get used to the Smart TV, the Apple TV, the Roku. So 
they see that these things are going to exist anyway so they might as well 
have Netflix right on their box integrated, b
etter consumer experience and 

it's a win
-
win all around and we will see it start to expand.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
When you look at the MVPD you know the cable companies th
at I cover and 
look at it seems like a no brainer, this is clearly positive for them. It 
simplifies the user experience which is what everybody is looking for but a 
big piece of this is the programmer and the programmers try to differentiate 
where they mak
e content available and the more of that I can easily choose 

new programming in the evening. That would seem like a meaningful threat 
if I were an executive at one of these big conten
t programmers in the U.S. 
How do you address that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It's a stroke of the remote control Rich. So the idea that like Reed said most 
of those viewers are doing it now and they are exiting the cable eco
-
system 
to do it which I think is much more d
isruptive than the idea of giving ease of 
use to the consumers switch back and forth but yet stay within their eco
-
system. So right now I think when you look at the numbers of a cable show 
people are tuning on a Sunday night often the number, a single show
 
on 
Netflix could dwarf that number. So I think it's already being kind of 

best interest to keep in mind consumer convenience. So staying within the 
eco
-
system with an easy push o
f the button, I think it's great for everybody.

So you talked a lot about personalized merchandising and these two [ph] to 
back it up as well. Can you talk a little bit about how much better your 
predictability algorithms ar
e becoming, can you quantify the improvement 
over the past year and how much room there is to go? What this means for 
the business going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well if you think talk about how much better has Google search gotten over 
the last 10 years? It's pretty hard to quantify. Would you say it's twice as 
good, three times as good? It certainly is a lot better and I think it's like that 
for us which is it's 
tremendously better than 2 

 
3 years ago. It's continuing 
to get better. We can measure it in the narrow when we do an A/B tests. So 
everything we will have several tests running, we will figure out which style 
[ph] actually works better for consumers. But
 
then that means to an 


continuing to improve where our guys are coming up with new ideas all the 
time about
 
how to improve it. So that the effect of it is that when you turn 
on Netflix on your tablet or on your TV that shows on the initial screen are 
almost always like three of them, you are like oh, I want to watch that. 

sense that you turn on Netflix and 
there is just already, you got a couple of shows right away that you want to 
watch.

With net adds accelerating year

over

year, how do you 

 
despite the size of 
your subscriber base, how do 
you think about the total addressable market 
in the U.S.? Are you starting to rethink what the upper boundary is or I may 
use to put a pretty wide range on it? Are you getting more comfortable with 
the upper end of the range and I guess just to frame that 
a little bit larger,

Before moving directly to questions, I'd like to turn it over to Reed Hastings 
for any opening remarks.
 
Ree
d Hastings
 
Just jump over to questions, Ellie.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
All right, let's move directly to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Similar to previous quarters, we've organized the questions by topic as we 
received them this afternoon. So we'r
e going to start with general content 
questions. First question. Can you help us better understand the fixed versus 
variable components in the content deals you are signing, or how the 
industry is maybe moving more towards variable mechanisms as content 
ow
ners better understand digital?
 
David Wells
 
This is David. We have been bidding in an industry that was set up before us 
by the cable, satellite and paid television world. So all of our deals are fixed. 
And that reflects the nature of the market that we're
 
competing in. It's been 
like that for 10
-
plus years.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What is your appetite for bidding against HBO for film studio content in the 
pay TV window when the pay TV studio deals come up for renewal? 
Assuming linear and over
-
the
-
top rights for those
 
deals are decoupled, 
would you attempt to acquire both as you did in the case of DreamWorks?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don't think it's likely that those rights will be decoupled. So we'd be bidding 
for the 
--
 
and that's because HBO, as an example, would certainly 
want 
both. So if we are to win the bidding, we have to really be willing to bid for 
both as we did in DreamWorks, Relativity. And yes, we will continue to be an 
active bidder in that market.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Are you relatively comfortable with your current leve
ls of content, or is 
Netflix still on the market for Blockbuster
-
size content deals? Do you 
anticipate that a potential slowdown in content acquisitions will have a 
meaningful impact on new subscriber acquisitions?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're rapidly increasing th
e amount of money that we spend on content 
domestically and internationally. The only thing that's slightly different is this 
quarter, we're increasing our spend over a year ago over 100%. So it's more 
than double one year ago. And that year
-
over
-
year incr
ease is declining. But 
it's still a substantial increase on a year
-
over
-
year basis all through this 
year. And the question is are we comfortable with the content? We always 
want to get more content. That's the virtuous cycle, which is as we get more 
subscr
ibers; we're able to get more content, which then helps us get more 
subscribers. So we'll continue to invest in improving the service by adding 
more content for a very long time.
 
David Wells
 
And just to add on to that, it's not just about adding new conten
t. As we 
discussed in the letter, that increase in expense is somewhat a small portion 
for renewals that actually is for new content to the service. So it's going to 
be exciting as we add new titles to the service through 2012.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How should we th
ink about subscription costs as a percent of revenue for 
2012 and longer term?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, that will vary by market and maturity. What we think about it as, as 
contribution margin and contribution profit. And as we talked about, we did 
better in 
Q4 than we expected, and so we're taking up our target for 11% 
for Q1 for contribution margin in the U.S. In our different international 
markets, we're still contribution margin negative. And that's 
--
 
the losses will 
abate in each market as it grows and b
reaking into contribution margin 
positive.
 
David Wells
 
And I think for longer term, we'll 
--
 
there's only 2 buckets. There's content 
expense and marketing. And so if we're going to expand our contribution 
margin, our profitability long term, we'd be lookin
g to leverage some of that 
content long term as well.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Would Netflix work with the virtual MVPD, adding a premium layer of content 
the way HBO offers content as tier on traditional MVPDs?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'm not sure what's meant by virtual MVPD. 
If it means like what was 
reputed that some of the Internet firms we're working on, which is sort of a 
national footprint over
-
the
-
top MVPD, I don't think that's going to come into 
existence. Several large firms have tried to put that package together and 
backed off. I think what we'll see is a continuation of the current localized 

 
Ellie Mertz
 
What's driving the change in tone and/or practice in terms of importance 
around exclusivity of content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
So the more that we 
bid against other cable networks. So there were many 
bidders for Mad Men, and there's many bidders for the movies. Those other 
bidders are cable networks that demand full exclusivity against us. And so 
we're essentially pushed into bidding exclusive to suc
ceed in this industry. 
And so what's driving it is that we're in the first leagues of cable network
-
buying now in syndication, and that's always been done exclusively.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Even with Netflix's growing movie streaming library, one of the biggest 
appe
al seems to be TV series episodes. Do you have any plans to offer 
current season episodes of shows after they air on traditional television 
instead waiting for their DVD release as Breaking Bad fans are dying to find 
out what happens next?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Ca
tch
-
up TV is really a good model for authentication. To the degree that we 
try to be a substitute for cable networks by, for example, having current day 
and date content, then we get into a cord
-
cutting kind of battle that's not 
really in our interest. And
 
our view is to be complementary by having 
complete prior season, and that we think authentication TV Everywhere 
interfaces like Fox is doing is the way to go for the broadcast networks and 
cable networks to maximize their opportunity. And we're comfortabl
e with 
that partitioning because we feel like our segment is very broad and big at a 
low price point of $7.99. And so that's why we're partitioning ourselves to be 
prior season. And so no, we're not bidding on any current season, and we 
don't have any curr
ent season.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How will you measure whether your original programming has a positive ROI 
and a success? If you believe original programming can start to drive 
incremental subs, will you commit significantly more capital to this?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well
, HBO spends about 1/3 or 40% of their budget on original and the rest 
on already produced movie content. So that would be the high watermark. 
And they do a great job on those originals. We're starting much more 
modestly with our originals. Some of it will
 
judge by how much it gets 
viewed by the 
--
 
and how much it costs. Is it an efficient source of 
programming? And some others in terms of does it attract and build 
--
 
attract new subscribers and build the reputation for Netflix? And today, it's a 
modest par
t of our budget, and we'll keep it as a modest part of our budget 
until we learn more as we go year
-
by
-
year.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you talk about 
--
 
can you talk through the rationale of making all the 
episodes of an original series available at the same time, l
ike you're doing 
with Lilyhammer, instead of spreading them out a bit more?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. Netflix's brand for TV shows is really about binge viewing. It's the ability 
to just get hooked and watch episode after episode. It's addictive. It's 
exciting. I
t's different. And our release strategy for original content 
emphasizes that brand strength, which is to be able to get hooked and pour 
through those episodes rather than get strung out. And we're not 
particularly focused on a single show for driving reten
tion. It's the 
expectation of more and more shows that really drives retention.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Final question on originals. Can you please talk about how accounting for 
these series will work? And under what scenarios are write
-
downs possible?
 
David Wells
 
The
 
accounting for them will be straight
-
line. We always monitor the content 
in terms of the engagement or hours viewed. And unless proven differently 
in the usage and watch patterns, it'll be straight
-
line. Now I'll point out, as 
Reed discussed, that for 201
2, it's a very modest portion of our budget. So I 
really think this is more of an issue for 2013 and going forward. Unless you 
see us announce some other large originals, it's going to come out this year.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Do exclusive contracts only 
differentiate you from other web
-
only players or 
also the TV Everywhere players? For example, could Xfinity show some of 
the TV catalog that is exclusive to you either via the set
-
top box or Xfinity 
app; or the contracts like Epix, where authenticated pay
-
TV subscribers can 
watch the movies online?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It varies. We have different types of exclusivity in different contracts. In the 
strongest form, it's like DreamWorks or Relativity. And then it's in all forms 
other than DVD. In sum, it's just excl
usive in the Internet SVODs, some in 
all SVOD with different carve
-
outs. So there's quite a mix there.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Given that your content purchase deals are based on assumptions of 
subscribers, did you experience with the price increase and subsequent 
slo
wdown in net ads that you have spent more on content than you would 
have, given all the information you have now? In other words, do you feel 
like you're in an overbought position now?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We feel great about the content we've got. We don't feel 
great about the 
profit stream we have for this quarter. And the impact of the relatively lower 
subscriber than we thought we would be at is not showing up in the quality 
of our service, which has continued to be excellent. And for the content to 
grow, it s
hows up in our profit stream. We hope to mitigate that obviously as 
we grow the subscriber base over this year and return back to breakeven 
and continued rapid international expansion.
 
David Wells
 
And as Reed said, we've been really pleased with the engage
ment of the 
content that we added through Q4. So I don't think that we've bought a 

 
Ellie Mertz
 
What is the balance of purchase commitments for content as of 12/31/2011?
 
David Wells
 
So I think t
his is referring to the contractual obligations footnote, and 
they're probably asking before we file the K. It was $3.5 billion at the end of 
Q3. That goes up to $3.9 billion at the end of this quarter, Q4, that we're 
reporting on.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What percent
age of streaming is occurring on TVs versus mobile or 
smartphones, versus tablets versus PC/Macs?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't break it out publicly. All of those platforms are very successful for 
us, an important part of the mix.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
If the goal of Netf
lix is to provide consumers with a convenient place to 
watch TV shows and movies, a subscription can only allow for a partial 
library of what a consumer wants to view. Why doesn't it make sense to add 
the ability to rent à la carte new
-
release films? In ot
her words, what's wrong 
with being everything to everyone and providing a one
-
stop shop for digital 
movies through Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don't think there's a lot of brand strength in being 
--
 
to use the ""everything 
for everyone."" You gain profit and br
and strength from being something 
important and precise. And we believe that unlimited for a low fee in the 
USD $7.99 a month is the core of our brand proposition and that if we were 
to add pay
-
per
-
view, it would be at a negative. It would confuse the bran
d. 
And there is a number of providers, Wal
-
mart's Vudu, Apple's iTunes, 
Amazon Unbox, Best Buy's CinemaNow, Blockbuster, the list just goes on 
and on of providers who already offer pay
-
per
-
view. And we have no way to 
do it better that we know of. So what w
e're focused on is instead working 
with all of those partners and keeping the clarity of our brand. So our 
strategy is to 
--
 
essentially, you can think of it like Dolby Digital is, be in 
every platform and get along with everyone. And we believe that there
's a 
large enough market at a $8 unlimited subscription to have us grow very 
large. So to some degree, it's a niche strategy, but it's a very large niche 
that we think we can lead. And so that's why our focus is exclusively on 
unlimited. And we're not at a
ll nor have we ever been interested in pay
-
per
-
view.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What does content underspending mean as it relates to margin impact on 
streaming in the fourth quarter 2011?
 
David Wells
 
It was a small underspend, and it's related to contract date shifting 
out by a 
month or so. So it's a pretty small number. And we always have contracts 
that are moving around up, backward, in terms of when the window 
availability starts. And that's what it was related to.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
All right. Let's move to questions about 
international. I know it's early, but 
what have you seen so far from international? Is there a case that can be 
made one way or the other about the relative profitability long term for a 
U.S. versus a non
-
U.S. subscriber?
 
David Wells
 
I'm sorry, 
repeat that one more time.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'll take it. The profitability of a subscriber is based upon the barriers, 
competitive barriers on a relatively scale. So in any market in which we have 
very strong scale advantage, we'll have higher profitability.
 
In any market 
where, for example, there's 3 roughly equal
-
sized firms, then we would have 
less profitability. So it's not so much U.S. versus non
-
U.S. It's relative scale 
in each of the markets. And that's part of why we're investing so 
aggressively to be
 
early and to lead this market in as many markets as we 
can.
 
David Wells
 
And the only thing I'd add to that is it's also about relative consumer 
offerings in that market or competition. So between the scale and the 
available consumer offerings, it 
would be those 2 things.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How do you determined that your initial launch offering has the right 
ingredients for a successful launch and positive word
-
of
-
mouth?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We focus on a front of the research in terms of consumer preferences, l
ook 
at Nielsen
-
type data in terms of what people are viewing. We do in
-
market 
research. And all of that informs our intuition. Then we launch, and then we 
start to really learn what people are viewing. What they like in terms of, say, 
subtitles. What they 
like in terms of how much of it is high
-
def, how 
important is that, what platforms. And there's considerable variation 
between markets. So think of it as, we do a bunch of effort upfront but it 
doesn't matter much. It just gets us started. And then we rapi
dly iterate and 
learn as to what are the important preferences in each market.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Looking at Latin America, there are some key differences in terms of income 
levels and broadband penetration rates. Is there anything about Latin 
America that indica
tes the region may achieve profitability faster or slower 
than a region like Canada? How should we think about the cost of content 
deals in Latin America compared to the U.S. and Canada?
 
David Wells
 
So Latin America, you can infer from our discussion in th
e earnings letter, 
both from our net additions in this Q4 for international versus last year, is 
growing slower than Canada did in its first quarter launch. I'd say that we're 
building a new brand in Latin America where we had much more of a U.S. 
halo bran
d effect in Canada. And device penetration in Canada was higher 
than it is in Latin America. Those 2 things are turning out to be important. 
So I think Latin America is a good and perspectively a great market for us 
going forward, but it does look like it'
s going to be on a path slower to 
profitably than Canada. And then the second part of your question dealt with 
--
 
can you ask that one more time?
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How do you think about content deals and the cost in Latin America relative 
to Canada and the U.S.
?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. So content pricing is related to the value that the owner of that 
content and the producer of that content can monetize in each different 
market. It's more specific than even Latin America. It's within a country 
market. And so relative 
to Canada, it's hard to answer that question in terms 
of the content. It would be less if that content owner has fewer monetization 
options in, say, Brazil or Mexico than they do in Canada.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So given the situation you're describing in Latin Amer
ica, is it going to take 
you longer than you have anticipated to reach profitability in that market?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's early to say. But on balance, I guess, yes, that it will take us longer than 
2 years. So we're working hard on all of our payment issues
 
and subtitling 
issues, rapidly improving them, and then we'll be able to see what's the 
underlying growth trajectory. So it's not out of the question, but I would say 
the odds are it will take longer than 2 years. And I'll point out that the 2 
years is a 
bit of a aspirational arbitrary benchmark. If you look at DIRECTV, 
it took them a number of years to gain their market position, and now they 
have an extremely valuable franchise. So mostly, the 2
-
year goal is a great 
internal goal because we want to turn 
around that money and invest in the 
next market. But the fundamental 
--
 
really get a return on it is we feel very 
strongly about where the growing economies in Latin America and our strong 
relative competitive position that we can build a very valuable fra
nchise in 
Latin America.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In examining your Latin American product, would you say that most of the 


n 
American streaming product is priced versus the competition? And do you 
think any pricing tweaks are necessary?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, definitely, pricing is not an issue. We're very aggressively priced. For 
example, MXN 99 in Mexico. Most of the content vi
ewing is Hollywood 
content, and that's how we've programmed. And then we complement that 
with the telenovelas.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
When negotiating with the studios, how does the prevalence of piracy in 
Latin America impact the deals in terms of pricing and/or rel
ease schedules?
 
David Wells
 
So I think it's back to my earlier comment about the available monetization 
channels that the content owner has and if piracy depresses those, then the 
cost of the content is lower because their ability to monetize the 
content in
-
market is lower.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why do you dismiss Web film [ph] so quickly as DVD
-
only?
 
Let me take this one. Historically, Web film [ph] has been predominantly 
focused on DVD. Streaming is really something that they're only in the early 
stage of,
 
whereas we've been focused on streaming for 5 years now. And so 
if you look at the services, we're better, faster and easier to use in the U.K. 
So we expect they'll likely be 
--
 
continue to be successful in the DVD
-
by
-
mail 
and the hybrid segment of the ma
rket, which for us domestically is about 
40%. And if you just look at how they're offering the service today, they 
came out with a strong streaming
-
only offering around the time of our 
launch, and yet it's still very difficult to find on their website. So 
we'll 
continue to monitor them. But I think we have a leg up in terms of our 
streaming experience.
 
Now that you're operating in 4 distinct regions: U.S., Canada, Latin America 
and U.K./Ireland, is there a need to favor one specific region over another in 
t
erms of allocating the content spend?
 
David Wells
 
No, there's no such need.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why did international freeze subs decline quarter
-
over
-
quarter? Is it normal 
seasonality?
 
David Wells
 
So I think the reference in terms of international freeze, if you 
take the total 
less...
 
Reed Hastings
 
That would be Lat Am. We launched Latin America mid
-
September. And so 
there was a big burst of trial subs, and there was no market that we 
launched in December.
 
David Wells
 
Right. So seasonal with the launch.
 
Ellie Mert
z
 
Do you expect international quarterly losses to begin to decline in the second 
quarter of 2012?
 
David Wells
 
What we said in the letter was that the losses would moderate. So yes, I 
think that implies that they would go down in moderation from Q1 to Q2.
 
E
llie Mertz
 
I think it's safe to say that our losses will obviously be dependent on 
subscriber growth and the revenue that we generate from that growth.
 
Let's move to questions about DVD. If the DVD business continues to 
decline, would you look to consolida
te warehouses? How do you expect 
closing of post offices to impact shipment time?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The closing of post offices has been put off probably post the election. So I 
don't see a big threat on that this year. And then in terms of closing our 
distrib
ution centers, there's no practical savings to closing those. Most of the 
costs are the discs and the postage. So very little of it is our own processing 
centers. So it's just not material.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How do you think consumers will react to a 56
-
day new 
release window? Do 
you expect that to drive more consumers away from DVD subscription?
 
David Wells
 
Well, our DVD consumers, including hybrid and DVD
-
only, continue to be 
weighted towards catalog. It's less than 30% in terms of the shipment mix 
that are 
new
-
release oriented. When we went to 28
-
day, we didn't see a big 
shift because, again, that mix was about the same then. And it's actually 
gone slightly down. It hasn't gone slightly up as you might surmise from 
more concentration to DVD subscribers.
 
Elli
e Mertz
 
Will you be adding video games or 3D movies to your product offering, 
especially if subscribers are willing to pay a premium like they do for Blu
-
ray 
discs?
 
Reed Hastings
 
3D movies, we already have. We have a lot of Blu
-
ray that's 3D. And on 
stream
ing, that's definitely something we can do and we'll be looking at. In 
terms of video games, we have no plans to enter video games.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Looking at your Q1 guidance and utilizing the midpoint, it seems that your 
guidance is suggesting that a DVD sub
scriber is contributing about 6x more 
to profits than a streaming subscriber, or around $15 per DVD customer but 
only $2.50 for a streaming customer. Do you still feel it is a wise strategy to 
push customers towards the streaming service? And if so, what e
ffects do 
you anticipate on long
-
term margins?
 
David Wells
 
The analysis is well intentioned, I'm sure, but it's looking 
--
 
not looking at 
the marginal cost and the marginal increment, which is the important one. 
So a marginal streaming subscriber is almost
 
pure contribution margin. 
There's a little bit for credit cards, CS and CDMCs [ph], but it's pretty 
modest. A marginal DVD subscriber has a number of variable costs, the 
postage and DVD fees in particular. So actually, it's the opposite, which is 
the prof
itability of a new streaming subscriber, the contribution margin is 
almost twice what it is for a DVD subscriber. So that's the way we think 
about it. And we're 
--
 

obviously, that's both more revenue and 
more profit. But if they were only 
going to use one, we'd much prefer them use the streaming service.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why the reduced expectation for Q1 DVD contribution profit margin? Are 
content costs going up? Or you expect to market the service more?
 
David
 
Wells
 
The reduced margin is related to the reduced revenue that we discussed in 
the letter. I don't think 
--
 
it's not going down too much other than the fact 
that there's a seasonal increase in usage in the DVD business. So Q4 to Q1, 
we usually see a marg
in reduction in the DVD business.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In terms of retention initiatives are being done in the DVD segment, will 
Netflix be marketing the DVD service in 2012?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There are no specific retention efforts, and we don't plan on marketing the 
DVD service. Our primary goal is to keep it stable, very high functioning to 
keep our operational metrics in terms of top of queue fulfillment; in terms of 
one
-
day turnaround, very, very high, and not to otherwise to start 
--
 
keep it 
running very well.
 
Dav
id Wells
 
And when we've tested DVD plans and putting more emphasis on DVD plans, 
there hasn't been a great take rate. So I think we get that question a lot and 
we have looked at it through AV testing. And there's not a large consumer 
adoption of those plan
s.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions about our consolidated results and outlook. With the 
stated goal of returning to profitability before launching new markets, is it 
fair to expect that you'll be basically 
--
 
you'll basically be matching the 
rollout of new
 
markets to profitability for the foreseeable future, meaning 
that once margins go above breakeven, new markets will be launched but 
bring them back down until that profitability is reached again and the cycle 
repeated until you reach a global or near
-
glob
al offering?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. That's a very articulate description.
 
Ellie Mertz
 

streaming rights domestically, we agree the breadth of content on Hulu and 
Amazon does not appear to mat
ch Netflix today, but you see that changing. 
Are you seeing them or potentially other players bid more aggressively for 
broader rights analogous to yours? In other words, is the bidding activity for 
streaming rights picking up?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There's very l
ittle market just for streaming rights. It's mostly for 
generalized exploitation rights. And so actually, Hulu Plus and Amazon are 
quite small bidders compared to the cable networks that we bid against. So 
no material change from them.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You 
talked about Amazon getting into the stand
-
alone subscription market at 
a lower price. Would you expect them to do that with their current offering? 
Or would they need to acquire more content and more aggressive movies?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not sure on their cont
ent strategy, depends on how much they want to 
spend.
 
David Wells
 
Today, they've taken a measured approach, but we'll see.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What do you think the implications of the future Apple TV that is reported in 
the works might mean for your business's st
rategy?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don't have any insight on an Apple TV. But there is a small 3 inch by 3 inch 
box called Apple TV that Apple invited us on about 2 years ago, and it's been 
very successful for us. We've just updated that application, making it 
even 
better, adding a great Netflix for Kids interface on it. It's now throughout 
Latin America, and we expanded the agreement with Apple for the U.K. and 
Ireland. So we're working really well with the current and existing Apple TV.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to q
uestions on the financials and other metrics. In early January, 
Netflix announced that it streamed 2 billion hours of content in Q4. Can you 
explain why hours streamed is a relevant metric? If subscribers stream more 
hours, what impact does this have on Ne
tflix's subscription cost? Will you be 
reporting hours streamed on a regular basis?
 
David Wells
 
I would liken that to a 
--
 
in 2007 when we announced the milestone 1 
billionth DVD shipment. It's a measure of engagement and scale in terms of 
the widespread a
doption of our service and the use of our service. So I 
wouldn't expect us to regularly update that on a quarterly basis but on a 
milestone basis. And it's a great milestone for us to have hit and, like I said, 
shows widespread adoption and usage of our se
rvice.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And there's very little margin impact for more usage. It's only in the CDM 
[ph] fees, is the only place where that exists.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Could you update us on the percentage of subscribers who are both DVD and 
streaming?
 
I can take this
. At the end of the year, we had about 8.4 million subscribers 
who were on both of the services. So about 40% of our total streaming 
subscribers domestically.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And it's continuing to fall.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Any impact to cost from the Durbin Amendme
nt?
 
I can take this as well. Durbin Amendment as related to our business 
basically caps the interchange fee charged to merchants when transacting 
even with debit cards. And so as can be expected, we have a high 
percentage of our transactions that are indee
d conducted through debit 
cards. And so we will see a decrease in the percent of revenue paid towards 
credit card use this year and is incorporated into our guidance.
 
David Wells
 
It's buried in the cost of revenues, though. Streaming content expenses 
obvio
usly are much bigger than our transaction fees on debit and credit 
card.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Going forward with international mix, what are your assumptions on the 
blended tax rate for Q1 and all of 2012?
 
David Wells
 
Q1 will be 39%. We continue to be pretty 
close to a full tax rate payer. It's 
unknown whether the R&D tax credit will be renewed this year. My guess will 
punted through until the end of the election. And if it behaves similarly to 
2010, if it isn't adopted, they'll probably make it retroactive, a
nd we might 
have a similar tax pattern to 2010. Which means that we'll have 38%, 39%, 
and then there'll be a low rate catch
-
up in Q4.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Right. Let's move to questions on Facebook. How has the Facebook 
integration impacted subscriber growth in Can
ada and Latin America?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There's no direct measurement that we're able to do on our success in all of 
our international markets, how much of that is due to Facebook and social 
integration. So instead, what we look at is engagement: how do we ge
t 
people to enjoy it more, use it more, click on more of the stories, watch 
movies from The Social Rose. So our driving and focusing each of our 
updates is just increasing engagement, and that's been going very well. And 
we're excited about the possibiliti
es of social TV as we continue to figure out 
how to evolve it and improve it.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Is there an update on when you expect the app to be available to U.S. 
members?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think we covered that in the investor letter under the BPPA [ph] sectio
n.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Do the international test to date provide meaningful data in terms of the 
average boost to new subs, increased fees ensuing from existing subs, et 
cetera?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I don't think we covered that, which is we don't have a clean A/B. So we
 
can't tell if this success is because of our brilliant advertising or because of 
our Facebook integration.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Move to questions on devices. Apple sold 16 million iPads last quarter. But in 
the past, you have said you don't believe that tablets ar
e a subscriber 
acquisition channel for Netflix streaming. Do you think that the faster, out
-
of
-
home bandwidth speeds would possibly convert tablets into bigger 
subscription 
--
 
into a bigger subscription acquisition channel?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not particularly. 
Tablets are very successful, and people are watching Netflix 
on lots of tablets. That doesn't make it an acquisition vehicle. It's a great 
consumption vehicle. And tablets as opposed to phones tend to be Wi
-
Fi and 
tend to be used then without data caps. Wh
ereas phones tend to be used on 
mobile plans, cellular plans that have data caps in the U.S. generally. So 
we're very bullish on tablets. We're investing heavily in it. We updated our 

 
in 
that. So it's a key part of our strategy.
 
David Wells
 
We said earlier that we don't comment on the relative usage across devices, 
but one of the reasons that we're investing in tablets is because we do see 
people enjoying a lot more of their viewing on
 
tablets relative to the PC.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Have you seen any impact from Smart TV sales during the quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, absolutely. Smart TV is one of our fastest
-
growing device categories. 
It's just beginning obviously. But as consumers set up and bu
y, or buy and 
set up Internet TVs, they certainly want to be able to use Netflix. And in 
many of them, we've got a great red Netflix button right on the remote 
control, so it makes it very easy. So the long
-
term trend for us on Smart TV 
is very exciting an
d positive.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So one question on the Q4 financing. In hindsight, do you wish you waited 
on the secondary given the quarter and guide for Q1 was better than original 
guidance? Why did you not just wait until Q1 to do the raise?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's 
always fun to pick stock prices in hindsight. You could have great returns 
when you do that.
 
David Wells
 
Yes. I'd say that hindsight's easy. Given the same facts, I'd make the same 
decision. And the relative dilution is unfortunate. We'll work a 
little harder. 
But otherwise, we're in a much stronger position.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Great. That's the end of the email 
--
 
submitted email questions. At this time, 
I'll turn it over to our operator and we'll begin taking live follow
-
up call
-
in 
questions.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich [ph] Greenfield 
from BTIG.
 
Richard Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG, LLC, Research Division
 
A couple of follow
-
ups. One, Reed, when you initially were going to separate 
the 2 plans with Qwikster, you had talked a
bout investing in the DVD 
business, and that's part of the reason you were doing it, was to invest in 
that business because you thought it had a long life. And it seemed like 
--
 
the comment you made earlier, you made it seem like the DVD business is 
someth
ing you're not going to put a whole lot more emphasis on from an 
investment standpoint. I'm just 
--
 
does this all relate back to the fact that 
the DVD business is actually now declining? I mean, do you expect stand
-
alone DVD subs to be down each of the qua
rters throughout 2012?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, Rich ]ph]. We expect DVD subscribers to decline steadily every quarter 
forever.
 
Richard Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG, LLC, Research Division
 
But even 
--
 
because the stand
-
alone subscribers I think actually we're up in 
Q4. And
 
so now you actually think that now that the shift from hybrid to 
stand
-
alone DVD had subsided, the net effect will be stand
-
alone DVD
-
only 
subscribers going down quarter after quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. We don't think about it as stand
-
alone versus hybrid
. There's just DVD 
subscription to DVD subscriptions, which are 11 million at the end of last 
year, are going to decline steadily essentially forever.
 
Richard Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG, LLC, Research Division
 
And then if I could just 
--
 
one last question on viewer
ship. The 2 billion 
hours I think was a real surprise to most people in the industry. And I think 
one of the things that is talked a lot about by investors is that people say 
the content is not that great, there isn't that much to watch. And yet when 
you s
ee 2 billion hours, or people watching an hour a day, there seems to be 
a real disconnect between what people are doing with Netflix or even what 
some of the other media executives in the industry think people are doing on 
Netflix than what they're actuall
y doing. What do you think the biggest 
reason for this disconnect is?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The average American household watches 8 hours of TV a day. And the 
average investor does not watch 8 hours of TV a day. So there's 
--
 
when one 
looks at one's own personal 
behavior, there is a big disconnect, I would say, 
relative to median or typical Americans which is, at over 20 million 
subscribers, is most of our market. And so if there is a disconnect, that 
might be the reason why.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from 
Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.
 
Jason S. Helfstein 
-
 
Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division
 
Two questions. First, not sure if you want to comment. In the last filing, you 
guys talked about expecting an EPS loss for the year. That was around your 
offer
ing. Wondering how the near term results in your outlook for the first 
quarter affect that outlook and if that's still a current number? And secondly, 
can you just update us what share count was at the end of the quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
On the first part, I
'll refer you to the investor letter, which addresses that 
precisely. And then the share count?
 
David Wells
 
55.4 million was the diluted share count at the end of the quarter. And I'll 
just...
 
Reed Hastings
 
And that's in the letter 
--
 
investor letter, obvi
ously.
 
David Wells
 
Yes. It's on the first page of the letter.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays Capital.
 
Anthony J. DiClemente 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
On the Warner Home Entertainment moving its 
window to 56 days from 28, 
you'd mentioned in the letter that, that improves your relationship with 
Warner. And I know that is relevant to the DVD side. But I guess there's 
--
 
some investors out there are wondering if there's a possibility that you 
license
d more of the Warner Bros.' TV studios content going forward? I just 
wonder, is your relationship with Time Warner and Warner Bros. improved 
such that it's any more likely incrementally that you can secure Warner 
Bros.' TV content from here? And do you thi
nk expanding window relate to 
that in any way?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Just to correct you, I don't believe that we said it improved the relationship. 
And...
 
Anthony J. DiClemente 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
It can maintain a direct relationship with Warne
r.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, as opposed to going to Wal
-
Mart and buying the DVD sideways. So 
that's what that's a reference to. So it's a perfectly healthy, respectful 
relationship and one with a top bidder. And we make them more money than 
everybody else, we 
get the content. And when we're not the top bidder, we 
don't get the content. So we don't do them favors, they don't do us favors, 
but there's trust and respect. And when there's an overlap, then we're able 
to do good business.
 
Operator
 
Our next question c
omes from Mark Mahaney from Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
The comment about underspending in marketing in Q4, could you just 
provide a little more color around that with our new found efficiencies? Or 
was that just a timing issue
?
 
David Wells
 
That wasn't timing, Mark. This is David. It was related to the fact that we 
had to make some estimates on Netflix button payments for CE 
manufacturers. And our estimates were too high.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Mike Olson from Pip
er Jaffray.
 
Michael J. Olson 
-
 
Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
 
So you said in the letter that you won't add new geographies until you 
return to profitability. Is that global profitability on a quarterly basis or full 
year? So I guess in other wo
rds, if you [indiscernible].
 
David Wells
 
Quarterly.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
The first read on the DVD business has this inherent upsell capability given 
the
 
multi
-
disc and the Blu
-
ray premium as well. And so for streaming, it's 
less clear. You've talked historically about the possibility of things like family 
plans. And I'm just wondering if you can speak to those opportunities to the 
extent that you think th
at they do exist and whether you think the $7.99 is 
the right long
-
term price for the U.S. streaming product?
 
Reed Hastings
 

--
 
feel great about the 
price. We're succeeding at that price. We've got a 
growing contribution 
margin, growing market share at that price. So we don't have any plans to 
change that. We will be adding various kinds of multi
-
account options over 
the year that our Product Officer, Neil Hunt, has talked about. And those are 
aimed at
 
providing a better experience so that, for example, not all of your 
kids' content shows up for you, and not all of your content shows up on your 
kids' accounts. So we'll continue to improve the experience in that way.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Res
earch Division
 
And separately, you've also mentioned that the streaming business has a 
higher incremental contribution margin profit. And so I understand it's early 
and subscribers are a key ingredient, I suppose, to the margin profile of the 
streaming bus
iness overtime. But how do you think about the margin profile 
of that business given that on one hand, your retail price is lower than 
premium TV providers. On the other hand, if you take the premium TV 
providers such as HBO, and even if you gross their bu
siness up for the MSO 
[ph] rupture, they have operating margins in the mid
-
20s.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I agree with your facts, Scott, but I'm not sure what the question was.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
The question is how do you 
--
 
as you p
osition your streaming business and 
you're thinking about understanding that it's very early, what do you think 
the margin profile of the domestic streaming business is?
 
Reed Hastings
 

--
 
so HBO gets round numbers, around $7 or $8 per sub fr
om 
the MSOs [ph]. We hope that we can have a much larger subscriber base 
than them. And that will allow us to spend even more on content and have 
an even better service. Then you've got, obviously, the on
-
demand aspect of 
Netflix and all the work that we d
o to make it personalized and even more 
useful. So we should be able to, in the long term, have an even better 
margin position than HBO, but it really depends on a relative scale. So if 
we're twice as large as the nearest competitor, it would tend to lead 
to large 
margins. If it's neck
-
and
-
neck of us and HBO in terms of subscriber size, 
then there would be tighter margins for both of us.
 
David Wells
 
And if there's more substitution between those 2 rather than complement.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Exactly.
 
Operator
 
And 
our next question comes from Matt Schechter from Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch.
 
.
 
Matt Schechter 
-
 
Center for Financial Research & Analysis, Inc.
 
In the past, you have said that you have seen, at least initially, that there 
was a kind of a shorter duration
 
or lighter connection with streaming 
subscribers leading to [indiscernible] versus streaming subscribers on a 
cohort 
--
 
same cohort basis? Are you continuing this? And where do you 
think streaming churn will end up relative to your historical near 4%?
 
Ree
d Hastings
 
Matt, you're on a mobile phone and it was cutting out while you spoke. The 
question I got was kind of long
-
term churn. It's not something that we really 
focus on. We make it easy for subscribers to get in and get out. And one of 
the aspects of t
he membership change that we referred to, definitional 
change, for example, is that if we go to your credit card and the charge 
doesn't go through, you're essentially instantly canceled. For membership 
purposes, you no longer count as a paid member. And th
en when the credit 
card clears, you become a member again. And so you could imagine that if 
you treat it that way, that wreaks havoc with 
--
 
or makes churn numbers not 
really that sensible. So that's some of the reasons that we've really been 
focusing on n
et additions and total subscriber growth and not churn.
 
David Wells
 
Actually, the other thing I'd add to that is just like the DVD business, our 
subscribers that higher in retention, the longer they are with us. So I think 
you're referring that to the rela
tive statements we made about streaming 
retention, early subscribers versus streaming retention, hybrid or DVD 
subscribers. But that retention does get better the longer the sub remains 
with us, just like it has before. So the more the base 
--
 
the subscrib
er base 
ages, the better our retention overall.
 
Matt Schechter 
-
 
Center for Financial Research & Analysis, Inc.
 
David, just a quick follow
-
up. Does that equal out to very similar on DVD 
versus streaming on a same cohort basis in time, the age of subscriber
?
 
David Wells
 
So if the retention pattern starts a little bit lower, our retention pattern is 
not going to equal. Because 
--
 
I see what you're asking. You're asking if 
someone who's been with us for a year, streaming subscriber, is equivalent 
to someone wh
o's been with us with a year on the hybrid or DVD in it? It's 
roughly in line.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
A couple of things. So first, just on the 1Q 
streaming guidance. Can you just 
clarify; you mentioned the 200,000 fewer domestic streaming subs 
potentially in 1Q, based on the change on payment hold. So you're 
suggesting that, that guidance would be 200,000 higher if it weren't for that 
change? And th
en also, any commentary on what you'd expect for streaming 
sub growth in 2012?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Correct on your first one and nothing more than the letter on the second.
 
Douglas Anmuth 
-
 
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Okay. And if I could just follow
 
up with one more. Could you just clarify why 
there's no deleveraging the DVD business if you have to continue to operate 
the warehouses around the country?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Because the warehouses are 
--
 
I shouldn't say no deleverage. But the 
warehouses are s
uch a tiny percent of the total cost, and most of the 
equipment or a lot of it has depreciated that there's only very modest 
deleveraging.
 
David Wells
 
So if you think about the DVD cost, postage and the cost of the content are 
more variable. And those are 
the bigger pieces than the cost of the 
fulfillment. That's one of the reasons you see that our fulfillment as a 
percent of revenue is going down.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Andy Hargreaves from Pacific Crest.
 
Andy Hargreaves 
-
 
Pacific Crest Secu
rities, Inc., Research Division
 
Can you give us a sense for how you think about the mix of marketing 
versus content spend as you're entering new markets?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Andy, I can't really help you on that for competitive reasons. We enter big 
on both to c
reate both a lot of brand awareness and to have it be a good 
experience. So each country, we're learning more and more. Or each 
market, we're learning more and more. We started in Canada. We've 
adjusted that mix a little bit for Lat Am. We adjusted it agai
n for U.K. and 
Ireland, and we're continuing to improve in terms of that mix. But we view it 
as a good proprietary advantage.

And then just a model question. Is there early conversion on t
he PTV convert 
so that you would have to count those shares in the diluted share count at 
the current price?
 
David Wells
 
The forced conversion price is 111.54, and it has to be at a sustained level 
for a number of days. So it's possible, but the conditions
 
are somewhat 
public in terms of...

And when does it become eligible for that, David?
 
David Wells
 
When it's

in 6 months.

So 6 months from issuance? Mid

Right.

Our next question comes from John Blackledge from Crédit Suisse.

A couple of questions. The 4Q '11 subs, in 
particular the net unique sub apps 
are a little better than what you guided too. Just wondering what drove 
that? Was December better? And then if you can give us a sense of what the 
net uniques sub losses and/or additions by month were in the fourth quarte
r, 
that would be helpful.
 
Reed Hastings
 
John, it was better as we said in letter that October and November matched 
what we had expected and December was stronger. And that was a 
combination of more growth adds around the holiday period, integration into 
al
l the devices and fewer cancels than we had expected.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Okay. That's going to be the last question for today. We'd like to thank 
everyone for your time and look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And I feel obliged, since I 
just got back from Sundance, to give you 2 movie 
recommendations to end the call on a light note. Both The Surrogate and 
Beasts of the Southern Wild hopefully will get picked up and distributed and 
everyone will be able to see them. They're fantastic movie
s. And I'll try to 
make sure they're on Netflix for all of you, too. Thank you, everyone.

Erin Kasenchak
 
A

received them this afternoon. The first question is in regard to domestic 
streaming. How do you think about the risk in allowing domestic streaming 
margins to rise too high quickl
y, example enticing more competition or 
under investing in future growth?
 
David Wells
 
Hi. This is David Wells, the CFO. Well, we think that, with our growth, we are 

so we are tak
ing a measured approach and with the growth we are able to 
do both.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Great. Do you believe you can maintain domestic streaming marketing costs 
in 2013 flat with 2012?
 
Reed Hastings
 

-
by
-
quarter, but as 
our reputation improves from the service improvements we are making and 
we get great PR around the original content, then that is what gives us a 
larger presence despite steady paid marketing spend.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Do you see direct correla
tion between the time and consumer spends using 
Netflix daily or monthly and their propensity to churn?
 
David Wells
 
Yeah. We do. We said this before, and it still holds that the more a 
subscriber watches, the better they retain in the service.
 
Erin Kasench
ak
 
Great. When you think about drawing your domestic subscriber base, how 
do you prioritize, one, reaching first
-
time streaming subscribers; two, finding 
a way to bring back consumers who have tried the service before and left; 
or, three, reducing churn to
 
maintain your current subscriber base. Have you 
seen any notable changes in these three groups over the past several 
months, if so, why?
 
Reed Hastings
 

service, so that it works bette
r for them. And so, someone who is rejoining 

-
based 
streaming is better, or the iPhone interface is better depending on the 
reason that they cancelled.
 
In terms 
--
 

y much with paid marketing, 
because they have a pretty firm idea of what Netflix is. You move someone 

perceive before by those examples that I had.
 
With new member marketing, they
 
have a more hazy idea of what Netflix is, 
and so paid advertising can have a bigger impact in changing their 
perception to be something that they are interested in trying for free. And 
so, when we advertise, we think of it mainly as this great service app
lying to 
new members. But of course, there is a spillover benefit to existing members 
that are still on the service and to rejoin, but the fundamental of it is to 
never join.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Great. Another question as it relates to marketing. Your 
marketing campaign 
has evolved pretty dramatically over the past year as we have illustrated. 

much more seriously?
 
Reed Hastings
 

ographics have 
evolved. And so, our advertising evolves as we become more streaming 

well as just great execution.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
How do you think about shared accounts? It grows y
our brand, yet it is 
revenue loss. How do you think about the need or importance of cracking 
down on shared accounts?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It depends what you mean by shared accounts. We usually like to think that 
a husband and wife can share an account, and that



on serving the immediate family.
 

--
 
our standard plan has two simultaneous
 
streams, and that 
serves the vast majority of families around the world quite well. There are a 


-
stream option for about 
50% upli
ft.
 
But again as we said, we expect a fewer than 1% of our members to take

I'm going to share my password

E
rin Kasenchak
 
What do you see the realistic TAM for Netflix? If you look at other premium 
networks, they tend to peak out at about 30 million subscribers. If you get 
to that point, where your net ads start to slow down, would you put in place 
price increas
es, especially since HBO retails for $15 and you only charge $8?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, first we started streaming at $7.99 three years ago when we 

years. We are very happy with that 



near term coming in that.
 
Second, in terms of the total available market

as best we can as two to three times that of HBO linear. HBO linear is at 
about 30 million and our best guess is that market for service like Netflix, 

 


with any confidence when we get there.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
What was the biggest driver of domestic streaming 
subscriber upside in Q1, 
higher growth additions or lower churn versus your internal projection?
 
Reed Hastings
 

to great lengths to raise the content and the quality of the content
 
on the 

engaged in the site and with the content.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Great. Moving onto questions about content, based on the greater than $4 
billion streaming hours reported by Ne
tflix in Q1 2013, we estimate the 
average Netflix subscriber is streaming 87 minutes of content per day. 
However, when we analyzed [Sand Wine] (ph) data related to overall 
bandwidth consumption, we have noticed a dramatic difference between the 
mean and me
dian, but the median only one
-

median monthly streaming dramatically skewed from the mean?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. Median typically is less than the average because of the heavy users, 

 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Have the
re been any notable changes in third

party content negotiations 
since you became more active with original?
 
Reed Hastings
 

months is Hulu and Amazon bidding more aggressively, and that 

content owners much happier and has made the prices to us higher than 
they would otherwise be.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
How many users access Nickelodeon and MTV content monthly?
 
Reed Hastings
 


been part of our service for the last two or three years. And as we stated in 
the letter, we have some bids in on particular shows, and so we will see how 
that works out.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Also, on the Viacom relationship, as you moved fr
om a global licensing deal 
with Viacom to one covering specific titles, can you provide some color on 
the magnitude of impact this could have on the money you spend licensing 
domestic content from Viacom?
 
Reed Hastings
 

change. You are not going to see any blip 
in what we spend or in contribution margin, for example in Q3.
 
David Wells
 
I would say that the content 
--
 
our content acquisition has already factored 

ngs that we 
can add. So you will continue to see us invest in content.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 

Arrested Development to drive significantly higher net additions in Q2? The 
guidance implies rat
her modest sequential gains.
 
Reed Hastings
 
If in Q1, we had seen, for example, the week before House of Cards 
launched and the week after of the Spike, I think then we would be 
forecasting bigger numbers around particular titles like Arrested 
Development. 


 



evidence or no history of it being a step function. So we are comfortable 
with the projection being our median probability.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Releasing all episodes of House of Cards, Hemlock Grove and soon to be 
released Arrested Development
s clearly puts the consumer first, yet the 
social media buzz appears to die off very quickly. In contrast, when you look 
at TV series, especially HBO and Showtime, which it appears Netflix is trying 
to emulate social media buzz benefits notably from the we
ekly release of a 
new episode. Why are you so confident in your all
-
at
-
once releasing 
strategy?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I would put the buzz on House of Cards, and I think we are going to 
see that with Hemlock. As we mentioned in the letter, Hemlock viewing ha
s 
been fantastic for us and as fantastic as the House of Cards is, Hemlock is 
getting viewed by even more subscribers in its first couple of days in 
opening weekend than House of Cards. So we are feeling very good about 
our original strategy including the 
release strategy of being focused on all 
episodes at once.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Next, there are several questions about how to gauge the success of House 
of Cards? Would we share any metrics like what percentage of the base 
watched one or more episodes, how view
ership of House of Cards compared 
to other top shows on Netflix? And if not, how do we convince someone that 
it was a good investment?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think, when you look at Netflix you get to invest in Netflix, not in 
particular shows. So, what an 
investor cares about is that Netflix is a good 
investment as opposed to say House of Cards. And then individual marketing 
programs, individual shows, individual regions are really what we have to do 
as management in terms of making good tradeoffs to make N
etflix more 
valuable overall.
 
And on that basis, we are feeling very excited about what happened with 

Development and Orange Is the New Black. And I think over this year with 
continuing rollout o
f these original shows, you are going to see a very nice 
redefinition and broadening of what Netflix is to our members. But it is 
something we will take a step at a time. As we mentioned, our total P&L 
spending on originals is still single digits, it will 
still be single digits next 

then.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
House of Cards is available for pre order on Amazon.com, can you explain 
where your rights for the show stand in relation to
 
sales of the show on DVD 
and Blu
-
ray, do you receive a cut for each one sold, and if so, how much?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We are not going to comment on the specifics, each deal for original is a 
little bit different, MRC developed House of Cards, and we were the 
first 
window licenser in certain territories, and then they have the other rights 


 
Erin Kasenchak
 
With House of Cards you promote
d the show in a very visibile way when 
people logged into their Netflix account? Should we expect ongoing Hemlock 
Grove promotion in the same way?
 
Reed Hastings
 

things like 
Vampire Diaries and such shows, because what we do is match it 
to the person and to their viewing history or someone in your household is 
watching that, so we try to be very good about matching the right promotion 
to the right person.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Lookin
g over the next few years, how many original series do you believe 
you would willing or able to produce?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 
we go in terms of 
what we learn, what experience, so there is no set number we are trying to 
target, and it will depend upon the results that we see.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
How do your originals perform in international region versus the U.S.?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well,
 

And I would say each one is unique in its territory. So we do program for 
these being good internationally and some of them have been really big hit 
and you may have notice that with Hem
lock we did one of the first premiers 

on the global attractiveness of the content.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Regarding the expensing of original content such as House of Cards, over 
how m
any month, quarter, years, does Netflix anticipate amortizing a cost of 
the content, that is what is the expected life of original content, also does 
original content generally carry a longer useful life relative to other 
purchased content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I

content. We could discuss whether not the actual useful life of that content 

conservative at this point and the typi
cal license period or typical 
amortization period is over 
--
 
straight line over the license period.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Looking at the costs produce very high quality content like House of Cards. 
Do you think that cost will increase, decrease or stay about the 
same 
overtime?
 
Reed Hastings
 

any thing the scale of distribution drives both movie production cost per 
hour and television cost per hour up because the value of great product with
 
a large distribution channel has increased, and that effect has over 

production through a digital film making techniques.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
With the success of House of Cards and 
your growing stable of originals has 
movie became a less strategic assets in Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure hope so given 
--
 

spend with Disney and we very much our investors in the movie franchise 
both in the U.
S. and around the world and big believers in the role of movies 
on a service.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 

some popular title, are you seeing them be highly competitive in most of 
your negotiation o
r they just stepping up for select content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It varies quite a bit by region and by type of content, but certainly all the 
sellers of content want to have many active bidders, so they are approaching 
everybody Redbox, Google, the cable network
s to try to get bid to be 
competitive.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 

plan for international growth, meaning is there percent of cash flow 
generated domestically that you will invest annually into
 
international. Do 
you envision continuing to add new overseas market ahead of getting the 
entire international business to profitability? Meaning should we expect 
overall international losses to continue for years to come in aggregate?
 
David Wells
 

--
 
been our approach with 

profitability and our overall confidence in the growth of the existing market 

o, I think, it is safe to say 
that you will see another couple of years of international losses as those 
markets mature and grow towards profitability, and as we launch additional 
markets.
 
And as for going forward, we will continue to take that measured ap
proach. 
We will have to gain confidence in the new markets as we address new 
opportunities and go from there.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Sort of a follow up, any update on the profitability timeline for individual 
international markets like Latin America or U.K. speci
fically?
 
David Wells
 



 
Reed Hastings
 
And we said specifically that all of the markets 

profitable in Canada.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Would consider setting down the higher loss territories like Latin America?
 
David Wells
 
Well, we are still making very good progress. Again, we said that we are 
growing and we are reducing 
losses in those markets. We are not losing out 
to any competitors and so if we get into a situation where we thought we are 

ourselves today.
 
Reed Hastings
 
So the simple answer is, n

 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Should we model the initial spend for the European launch to be comparable 
to other international launches, will this be Q3 or Q4?
 
Reed Hastings
 

mode
l at about like other launches.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Turning to a few questions on DVD, do you believe that you have less 
visibility into the subscriber and revenue elements of DVD business? Is that 
the factor in reducing the guidance disclosure?
 
David Wells
 
No.
 

say year to 18 months ago. The reason we dropped the guidance was 
because profit is what matters and that really is the only thing that matters 


give guidance on the profit.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 

--
 
you have been able to 
relatively maintain strong DVD contribution margins even with declining 
subscriber level. At 
what level of DVD sub would that ability to leverage fixed 
costs breakdown and lead to a meaningful step down in overall profit 
margins?
 
David Wells
 
Well, we took the DVD business profitable at around million subscribers and 


continue to invest in our content library and our DVD content library, we feel 
pretty good about our ability to maintain those margins going forward.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 

product improvement. ISPs up here 
increasingly open to the idea of offering promotions incorporating Netflix as 
a benefit to their own subscribers for paying us the premium service higher 
speed tiers, how do you think about this opportunity?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think, ISP business is turning out to be extremely profitable because 

purchase higher bandwidth packages that almost pure additional margin for 
the ISP. And one of the major reaso
ns that our customer might do a higher 
bandwidth package is to use video from us, from Google, from Amazon and 
others.
 
And so the more that our network integration is highly effective that they 
are integrated with Open Connect then more their customers wil
l actually 
get the benefit of our faster less mile. So there is a nice synergy there us 
together providing a better and better experience for their end
-
users.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Great. A question social. While you succeeded in wining a change in DPPA 
there doe
s not appear to be a meaningful amount of Netflix subscribers 
choosing to share their streaming activity within their friends on Facebook. 
Do you think consumers simply are not interested in being that open with 
their social network?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think 
it will evolve overtime, the core focus right now is not so much 

default is that it shared within the Netflix interface, so if you get the 
permission, the default permissions, you
 
and your friend share within the 
Netflix user interface, what your friends are viewing and get ideas but not in 
the Facebook ticker and feed?
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
How does the profile feature work for household with the Netflix 
subscription. And what was the ea
rly response from the testing?
 
Reed Hastings
 



ssarily want to see what 

really be targeted at families.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 

quantify its off balance sheet
 
content liability, specifically interested in those 
the total amount of obligation is outstanding, as well as the amount 
currently outstanding that is not on the balance sheet.
 
Reed Hastings
 

question. We 
had $5.6 billion liability 
--
 
$5.6 billion in commitment as of the end of 
December. That moved to $5.7 billion in commitments as of the end of 
March, $2.4 billion being part of liabilities on the balance sheet and $3.3 bill 
not on the balance 
sheet.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 

additional debt raise. Would you consider raising capital given the low
-
rate 
environment?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we just did raise capitals. So yeah, we would conside
r it. And I would 
say that we are fine on capital at this point.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Great. You had anticipated that free cash flow in the quarter would be more 
negative than the prior quarter. And it ended up more favorable than the 
prior quarter. You acquired
 
less than $600 million of streaming content this 
quarter less than your quarterly run rate last year despite the payment for 
House Of Cards. For any content acquisitions deferred to the June quarter, is 
this a good run rate for content acquisition or was 
it a low quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
So no content payments were deferred. I would say that we anticipated a 


 

 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Is this a good run
-
rate for content acquisitions?
 
Reed Hastings
 


ansion 
has declined over the last year and two years. So the rate of expansion has 

 
Erin Kasenchak
 

for the second 
quarter and the balance of the year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The balance of the year should be between 34% and 35%. We had a very 
strange tax rate in the first quarter. Because of the retroactive 
reinstatement after Federal R&D tax credit. So I think it was over 100
% in 
terms of, sort of, strange rate. But that will flip back to us, sort of, normal 
rate going forward.

Youssef Squali

Cantor Fitzgerald
 
Okay. Thank you very much. Just couple of questions, please. You guys 
spent a little more on DVD content this quarter than we
 
were expecting and 
you also lost a fewer DVD subscribes than we thought. So was there a 

that you guys are now kind of baking into your business going forward.
 
And second, can you ext
end on the profile function

profile function, you 
guy spoke about in the letter. Vendors that launch and what efforts would

what effects would you like to see from it?
 
Reed Hastings
 

ar. And if not 


--
 
nothing going to be nothing material to affect 
the business about it off itself.
 
David Wells
 
And then Youssef, this is David. On your DVD
 

draw a direct correlation. The first quarter is always the high
-
release quarter 
from new releases. And typically, it depends on the release dates with 
studios in terms of what they put out. And we sort of set those amounts wel
l 

that in general, we were pleased as well that DVD subscribers declined at a 
slower rate than we anticipated and we continued to work hard to make sure 
that those folks who conti
nued to choose physical have a very good service.

Thank you. Have you deployed Open Connect to 
major domestic ISPs such 

case and how do you describe that, which are of view that Netflix is good for 
them because it helps them differentiate their offer? Thank you.
 
Reed Hastings
 

progress with ISPs. We started mostly in Europe first because we were just 
ramping, so that helped with the capacity we could handle the capacity and 

ast majority of Europe traffic is now in Open 
Connect and growing percentage of that traffic is in United States. We 
certainly think that over the next year or two, we will be able to work with 
all the major ISPs to get the benefits to both of us and Open 
Connect.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open.
 
Mark Mahaney 
-
 
RBC
 
Great. Thanks. On the new customers to domestic streaming customers, is 
there anything you can 
tell about their usage patterns versus customers you 
brought in the past that they seem to be consuming content similarly to 
similar cohorts in the past? And in terms of international marketing costs, is 
there a way to strip out the new country launch cost
 
from the other 
marketing costs? Once if you take those out, is it that international 
marketing costs are kind of a steady ramp, is there something to suggest 
that they could flat line or is that way too early in each of those countries 
experienced for tha
t to happen? Thank you.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Mark, on the domestic side, the new members were performing consistent 

viewing as the content and product improves. And so P1s today are little 
better in usage than P1s a year ago, that kind of things.
 
And then second on the international marketing, yeah, there is a launch 
marketing and then a run rate marketing just as you would expect. But since 

we have launched quarters, 
you will see the marketing be larger than you might otherwise have thought.
 
David Wells
 

or flat. I would say flat is a safe assumption at this poin
t.
 
Erin Kasenchak
 
Next question
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley. Your line is 
open.
 
Scott Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley
 
Hi. Thanks. You were talking in the shareholder letter about a decline in your 
willingness to pay for n
on
-
exclusive, bulk deals. And now you have an 
increasingly diverse content portfolio between TV movie kids and originals 
and your sub base is much larger than competitor. So, theoretically, you 
would think that you have the ability to amortize the content 
that you spend 


this diversity of content now. I just wonder if you can talk a little bit about 
the fut
ure to the extent that that could change over time.
 
And then secondly on an associated topic. Ted has been quoted recently in 
the media discussing extending the original portfolios of levels of north of 20 
per year, which is quite a bit higher than where y

wondering if you could clarify that comment to the extent that you think this 
20 plus is a reasonable level and if so what type of timeframe of getting 
there? Thanks.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Starting on the second part, it all depends on the tim
eframes. So in the next 
two years, it modestly increases if that it will widely successful for us as the 
first three shows have been, we could continue to expand to 20 or north. But 
that would be dependent on all of the 
--
 
what happens rest of this year. 
W

only been out for four days suddenly take our commitments up to that kind 
of 20 plus level.
 

 
In terms to the first q
uestion, I think we are focused on moving towards 
more and more exclusive content, which reinforces a reason to join Netflix, a 

and on other services than it might be pleasant to
 

not really reinforce of why stay with Netflix or reinforce what you would loss 

three years evolving towards more and more exclusivity in that content.

Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG. Your line is 
open.
 
Richard Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Hi. Could you give us more info on kind of why the Open Connect initiative is 
so positive for Netflix?
 
And then, just kind of tied to that, cable operators 
that showing you like within their actual commercials now in marketing you 
in their mailers, is there a way that they could basically promote Netflix or 
give away Netflix or passthrough cost of Netflix,
 
the way they do and give 
like each six or 12 months of HBO or Showtime, how could that work, and is 
that something we might see in the next year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
See Open Connect is one of our investment to improve the Netflix member 
experience, long form c
ontent has some unique aspects that you can tailor 
at low costs on the CDN it do not also serving short form content like the 


y significant.
 
In terms of the second question which is kind of commercial integration with 


for Netflix and
 
then advertise that if a person signs up for service or buy the 
device, they also get three or six months of Netflix which is a gift certificate 
that they bought. And some of those are working quite well. But I doubt that 
you will see anything in the way 
that you typically would have seen for HBO 
or Showtime marketing with cable where you get those up big free period in 
exchange for signing up.
 
The business model we have now works very well for us and since its 
working very well we are more likely just to 
focus on executing it extremely 
well rather than making it say more complicated with those types of 
interaction.

Hey. Good afternoon. It looks like originals are having success out of the

s? You could argue that 
subs will perceive higher value in the subscription. So under that assumption 
as we get further from the PR issues over a couple years ago, will you look 
more seriously tweaking up pricing?
 
David Wells
 
I think we are pretty clear in
 
our letter about that.

open.
 
John Blackledge 
-
 
Cowen & Co.
 
Great. Thank
 
you. Two questions. If you could just provide an update on the 
brand, is it recovering more quickly than you anticipated since the brand hit 
following the split of the streaming and DVD service in 2011? And then 

uidance at the midpoint is bit 

commentary from the 4Q '12 letter which suggested 2Q ' 13 net ads will be 

moderately bette
r guidance or are there other factors involved? Thanks.
 
David Wells
 
John, I think the second part of that question which is our 2Q net ads 
guidance. I would say that ordinarily we would expect because of seasonality 
to have a lower Q2 than prior year 

 

product, in our content and the interface and in the brand recovery. And I 
think those are carrying through. So we're anticipating being sligh
tly up 
year
-
over
-


 
Reed Hastings
 
And on the guidance, we have arrested development in the end of May, 
which will be in absolutely spectacular phe
nomenon, where we've got an 



e 
seasonal pattern where Q2 is less than the prior year
 

expected, which is sort of over three years, where you get the bulk of that in 
the first part and were making steady progress
 

hard to make steady progress going forward.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is 
open.

Great. Thanks for takin
g the question. Just wanted to ask two things, first 
how do you compare Netflix's ability to curate and influence original content 
relative to other pay TV networks. How important is that to producers when 

 

where you would expect Netflix to bulk up in order to work more closely with 
creators on content.
 
And then secondly just a question on mobile. Any color on a percentage of 
usage coming from tablets and smartphones? Do you think there'
s any 
chance here going forward that we could see mobile smooth out some of the 
seasonality that you typically see during the summer months? Thanks.

outs seasonality, I

-

sort of home use and rather than over to say, the networks which have fairly 
low data cap. And then, what was the first part?
 
How we work while we are up? With producers, yeah, we are getting I th
ink 
more sophisticated in terms of working with producers and the creative 

we well continue to learn as we do more. And as we bring great success to 
the creators then certainly that 
increases our reputation in the creative 
community.

1/20/16,Netflix,"[Abrupt start] Director of Investor Relations. Welcome to this live video 
interview for our 2013 second quarter earnings results. We may make 
forward
-
looking statements during today's interview and results may differ 
from those statements. Now I 
would like to turn it over to Reed Hastings, 
our CEO.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Thanks, Erin. We focused on efficient and effective investor communication 
for a long time. We worked through our shareholder letter, our long
-
term 
view. In terms of the Q&A, we have 
always admired the fire side chat format 
at investor conferences as being the most dynamic and interesting. And this 
is our attempt to bring that value to the broad online public. Now we are on 
our webcams on our laptops and on YouTube, so I hope the quali
ty is 
acceptable. And we look forward to any suggestions from you afterwards.
 
With me today from Beverly Hills is Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Thanks, Reed. I am glad to be here today.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Thanks, Ted. And also with me is
 
David Wells, our CFO.
 
David Wells
 
Thanks, Reed. I think at this point we will start the questions. I am going to 
turn it over to our first interviewer, Rich Greenfield from BTIG.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG
 
I think we will have Juli

 
Julia Boorstin

CNBC
 
Thanks, so much. Julia Boorstin here from CNBC. I just wanted to say that 
Rich I have been emailed and tweeted a wide range of questions from a 
range of institutional investors, individual s
hareholders, sell
-
side analysts, 
and also other companies in the media industry. Now because there was a 
lot of over allotment of questions, we are not going to be attributing 
individual questions but rather trying to compile them all and get through as 
ma
ny as possible. We have received emails of a very wide range and a lot of 
questions. So we going to get right into it.
 
And the first question is about the format of the call. Reed, this question is 
for you. You alluded to it a little bit but there has been
 
a lot of criticism by 
your decision to format the call this way. How do you address concerns that 
it actually minimizes the ability of investors to communicate directly with 
you?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think we should process that after the interview and l
et's see if it's 
productive and useful for investors and see what they think.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
Rich?
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Reed, why did you not reach the top end of your domestic sub guidance? We 
talked about where you have seen the success of your 
original 
programming. You have been Emmy nominated. You have gotten a lot of 
free marketing in the quarter and yet you did not get up to the top end of 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah, when we do o
ur forecasting in the beginning of the quarter, when we 
know all of the factors going into that, we try to set the range so that we 
come in in the middle of the range as we did. So we are really happy with 
the progress in the business. We are happy that ne
t adds were higher than a 
year ago in our domestic business, and much higher on the international 
business. And so we are feeling quite good about the business.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
You alluded to the impact of Arrested Development in the quarter but you
 

many of your subscribers came from adding that programming?
 
Reed Hastings
 
When we look at original content, whether it's House of Cards or Arrested 
Development, we are just in a ver
y early innings of this. We are figuring out 
how to promote them, what the ongoing value is. And what we see is, if we 
do it right these will turn into real franchises. That is House of Cards Season 
2, Orange Season 2, Season 3, Season 4, will be just trem
endous assets to 
the company. Arrested was a unique look forward because it already had a 
developed brand and we were bringing out Season 4. And what we did see 
was a little rise in gross additions which translated to net additions, more 
than the weekly pa
ttern would have suggested. But it was not, particularly it 
was enough to move our net adds higher than last year, but it was not 
tremendously significant in the short
-
term.
 
And in general remember that people subscribe and retain with us for a 
variety of content, not just a single show. So they might be become that 
Arrested Development was the excuse to join but then they start watching 
all of our great content. So think of it as just part of the content mix. And I 

o add to that all?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I would just point out that with every series that we have launched, both the 
viewing audience and the total hours viewed has grown sequentially with 
every single 
--
 
with every series that we have launched. So remember we 
la
unched from kind of ground zero with the first, both in the concept and in 
the show itself, and then continued to grow it and grow it and grow it. So I 
agree with Reed that these are going to have very long term implications. 
And we have been saying from t
he beginning that they have subtle impact 
on subscribers over time because you are realizing it with things like brand 
halo and reductions in churn that happens certainly and over time.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
But you chose to single out Arrested Development
. Does that mean Arrested 
Development is responsible for say 15% of the subscriber growth this 
quarter? Can you give us any number to actually quantify what you indicated 
in the letter?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I believe we just pointed it out because it breaks the se
asonal pattern in a 
way that can be attributed more directly to that.
 
Reed Hastings
 



 
starting with already created brand. The general case 
with Hemlock, with Orange, with House of Cards is for us to be the first 
season in debut. So think of Arrested as an unusual nice opportunity, but the 

more like House of Cards, 
Hemlock and Orange.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
So does that indicate that you expect to see an uptick for House of Cards 
second season for example?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah. I think we would probably see a little bump there in our numbers. 
T
hat would make sense and hopefully by the time we get to Season 3, 4, or 

Potter
-
esque global massive phenomenon, when is the next season coming 

ve only made some progress on that. 


 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
May I even point out that even the most iconic TV brands like the Sopranos 
and Seinfeld took several years before they became brands.
 
David
 
Wells
 

and I say consistently that it will take several shows for folks to be engaged 

be one show. If yo
u think about whether you join HBO or Showtime because 
of one or two shows, Game of Thrones is the only example where people 

take us a while for our originals to get there.
 
Jul
ia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
Moving on to some more questions about the most recent quarterly report, 
your investor letter indicates that Q4 margins will decline dramatically 
despite the fact that you project margins to improve 400 basis points for the 
whole year. I
s this is the beginning of a problematic trend in the fourth 
quarter?
 
David Wells
 


margin and the fact that
 

delivered on our target of about 100 basis points a quarter. And so content 


 



 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
But adding up the math, the fourth quarter does show 
--
 
is goin
g to show a 
decline in margins. I guess my question is, how much of that is due to an 
increase in additional content spending compared to an anticipation that 

fourth quarter.
 
Reed 
Hastings
 



in the question.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 

400 was 400 for the full year, not 400 in the fourth quarter as they were 
looking at your out performance in the first three quarters and assuming 
that mean
t a very large fall off in Q4 to stick to the 400 for the full year.
 
Reed Hastings
 


for the 
fourth quarter this year is 400 basis points ahead of the fourth 
quarter last year.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 

confusion among the analysts questions and investor questions.
 
Reed Has
tings
 
Correct. Apparently we accidentally created that misunderstanding with per 
year, but meaning quarterly year over year.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
Got it. Thank you. Rich?
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 

them in terms of 


When you look at the Q3 guidance for subscribers, is there a benefit from 
originals becau
se you seem very excited about Orange is the New Black. 
How do we think about that?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Ted Sarandos
 

positive effect. They are subtle effects, 

that when we launched Orange is the New Black, surprisingly it drew as big 
a first seven day viewing as any of the other original series and actually had 
been growing every time, which we have to leave you to believe that p
eople 
are taking more confidence of the idea of Netflix Originals which is creating 
some excitement for upcoming seasons as well and upcoming new series as 
well. So the brand is starting to mean something to viewers already, even 
though we only started doi
ng this in February. That's what we're enthusiastic 
about.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
Now, obviously, Netflix is proud of its Emmy nominations. Why don't you tell 
us how much 
--
 
how many people watch those shows that were nominated.
 
Reed Hastings
 
We said public
ly, well we continue to say publicly that we are not releasing 
viewing numbers. Our actual ratings would be apples and oranges 
comparison to what happens on a network. We view the viewing over a very 
long period of time. We'll tell you though, that you sho
uld look at our 
renewal of a show to a second season as a very positive sign. Because if 
we're renewing shows that people aren't watching in big numbers then we're 
creating a huge opportunity cost in our content spend. In other words, we 
won't have money t
o spend on things that people watch. So these shows are 
performing really well for us. They are hitting our numbers with remarkable 
precision in terms of what we forecasted enough, so that we had confidence 
to renew Orange Is the New Black, based on our vi
ewing models even a few 
days before we launched the show.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Final question on Q1, and this is for David specifically. There is a footnote 
one that talks to a restatement of your contribution margins related to an 
SG&A shift. Could you 
explain why that was made and what happened?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. That's related to our global spending on marketing overheads of 
people. It's really marketing folks. They are working on projects, on 
branding projects that are for the Netflix brand, a brand a
cross the globe. So 
they're not working on things that are specific to a particular territory or 
operating segment. So we felt like we wanted to treat them like we do our 
other content folks that are making our content deals and we treat them as 
a global c
ost and that those costs were moved down from the marketing line 
which was a cost of revenue down into a G&A line.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Now just moving on to actual questions in categories. We're going to try to 
break these up into big topic categories. 
The investor letter starts off by 
talking about a saturation based on competition. And I wonder, since Reed 
you've talked about this 60 million to 90 million potential for Netflix, why are 
you even talking about saturation given where Netflix is today?
 
Ree
d Hastings
 
Well, I think we never know when and how saturation will hit, and what we 
are trying to be clear on is there is a couple of different forces. One is that 
our content is getting better, our service is getting better. And the other is 
that the lar
ger we get, of course the harder it is to grow and also the longer 
time goes by the better competitors are. So those are the opposing forces. 
And given those forces, we're extremely excited to have our net adds be at 
the same level as last year because tha
t implies that there is no near term 
saturation.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
And are you still comfortable with the 60 million to 90 million ultimate 
market potential?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We are. We're feeling very good about that. Because what happens is, by 
the 
time we get to 40 million and 50 million, we get the content better and 
the service better. And so it's not 60 million or 90 million for the current 
service, it's 60 million or 90 million for the future service that's much 
improved. That maybe a lot more o
riginals and just incredible streaming.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
Many investors have shared a concern that virtually every one in your 
potential market has already tried Netflix at least once so you have very few 
actually new customers. What is your level of 
churn?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You know what we really focus on is the net adds. Because someone has 
tried Netflix before, they're probably more interested in trying us again as 
the content gets better, as the streaming gets better, as the play back 
software and the
 
devices gets better. And so there is lots of people who tried 
us and then they will try us again to see if we meet their future needs. So 
we're feeling very comfortable about that.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
I understand you stopped reporting churn but can you
 
tell us anything about 
the churn and what that might reveal about future growth?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I can tell you that as the CEO of Netflix, I focus myself. I don't even look at 
the churn numbers. Essentially, I'm looking at net adds all the time, because 
yo
u get various trade
-
offs, and really what we care about is total growth. 
And so it's bringing the world in line with how management looks at it, which 
is in terms of net additions which we do check every week, every day.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
And 
--
 
no, 
go ahead.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
If consumers are now watching over 90 minutes of Netflix a day, why is that 
household churning. Like what else do you need to do if you're already at 90 
minutes of household viewing per subscriber in the U.S.?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, let's say, if that household that's watching 90 minutes a day probably 
isn't cancelling. But that's an average, so I think of it as a bell curve of 
usage. And the people at the lighter end that are not using Netflix much 
then they're more prone to c
ancel it than someone who is watching a lot. So 
we constantly just try to make the service better which is what we've been 
doing over the last five years.
 
Julia Boorstin

CNBC
 
We received a number of questions and concerns about your free cash flow. 
Over 
the last few quarters you've had a disparity between net income and 
free cash flow suggesting that you're really making an investment in your 
streaming migrate content. But the question then is, what is the duration of 
the content that you're investing in 
and when should we expect it to run 
through the income statement?
 
David Wells
 
I'll probably take this one. This is David. So we've been very, very clear and 
very transparent about the fact that our content investments are going to 
run ahead of our P&L expe
nse and weigh on our free cash flow. And we were 
pleased this quarter to actually flip to positive. Likely we'll continue to make 
investments in originals and other content that will continue to weigh on our 
free cash flow. But we're very comfortable with 
where we are today. We 
think that the viewing that follows from those content investments, our 
accounting has to follow from that viewing. So to the extent that the 
industry is set up that more of the money is paid upfront in order to fund 
production, that
's something that we can only affect a little bit. We have to 
be competitive buyers in the industry. So we have to meet those payment 
terms and a lot of these deals are more cash upfront loaded.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
Well certainly, but some investors who 
we've spoken to calculate disparity 
between that income and free cash flow at over $2 per share. Will we see 
that pressure EPS?
 
David Wells
 
I am not sure about the $2 per share. What we've said is that our free cash 
flow runs ahead of our P&L expense, abou
t 20%. So the ratio of cash out to 
P&L expense can run 20% above that P&L. And that's typically holding, even 
with some of our more cash upfront originals deals. You'll see some of that 
start to unwind as we get older and a lot of the deals start to mature
 
down 
the road. But while we're expanding content, you should expect and 
investors should expect that to continue to weigh on our free cash flow.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
But David, when you look at the original programming, the amount of spend 
versus the am
ortization, your website spends a lot of detail going into how 
that's amortized. But what is the actual cash outlay? You talked about it 
being higher. How should we think about how the cash for these originals 
and even some of your new deals like DreamWork
s, how does that actually 
flow into your actual cash position as we think about your balance sheet?
 
David Wells
 

--
 
we make payment 
partially upon delivery, and then another section it depends on the deal
. And 
we don't talk about deals specifics, but illustratively it could be 18 months, it 
could be 3 years. It depends on the license period. So again it really 
depends on the delivery of that content and when it comes in. And for 
output style deals, that re
ally depends on the size of the box office card that 
we're paying. So, again it depends on the content as it comes through, but 
we've been fairly conservative I'd say in terms of preparing for this. We 
raised debt earlier in the year. We restructured some 
debt. We feel pretty 
good about our cash position. And we put in our long
-
term letter, depending 
on the expansion of originals, we may need more capital down the road, but 
right now we're fine.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And Rich I'd say too that we've been able to 
get very favorable cash terms 
from our suppliers or most of our deals. And I'd say that the more high 
profile the programming is the more likely it is original and exclusive, the 
cash outlay has accelerated versus some of the very deep catalog that pays 
ou
t very smoothly over several quarters.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
When you drive more subscribers at a lower price, or generate a higher 
profit margin at a higher price, it basically 
--
 
why is $7.99 the right price?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I would say $7.99 is pretty cl
ose to the right price. I don't think we could be 
certain that at $6.99 or $8.99 it would be a little bit better or a little bit 
worse. But once you've picked a price, there is a tremendous value in 
consumer stability. And we're growing very strongly at th
e current price. 
And so we feel great about that situation.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
But there is an overwhelming number of questions from investors and other 
analysts of are you going to be forced to raise price? Because you literally 
can't afford your cont
ent commitments, so either you need to raise equity or 
you need to raise the price of your service.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, if you look over the past three years, we've raised the contribution 
margin in the United States business from sub 10% to over 20%. And 
so I 
think there is plenty of evidence that we can grow revenue faster than we're 
growing content costs.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
But a specific question that was asked by a number of people is, given the 
negative operating cash flow trend, obviously our cash
 
flow is positive this 
quarter, but given those trends and the high costs for original content and 
also exclusive content, what is the probability that you'd either be forced to 
raise debt or subscription prices in the next 12 months?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, l
et's see. Let's separate the two factors. One is domestic, where we're 
hugely profitable in growing very well. And the other is international, where 
we're growing extremely strongly. Revenue was up 155% over a year ago 
but it has negative P&L, we're in inv
estment mode. So we've got the strong 
U.S. business supporting the investment in international. In terms of the 

that then what we said which is we're very comfortable where we ar
e in the 
$7.99 price point, and we're growing very strongly. And in terms of debt, it 
would be pretty unlikely in the next 12 months.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
But I guess looking beyond that, beyond the next 12 months, over the next 
couple of years, many inve
stors and analysts who you know, said they 
believe you will need to execute as stock sales to pay for content 
obligations. What is your outlook in terms of your plans for potentially a 
secondary stock offering in the next three years to four years?
 
David W
ells
 
It's too far off to speculate on. At this point what we can say is what we've 
said.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
Would a price increase be a way to avoid a capital raise?
 
David Wells
 
We're very comfortable with our $7.99 price point and with the growth that 
it generates.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Schwartz believe that your stock is exceedingly expensive. When you look at 
the valuation of where you are now, how do you get comfortable with the 
growth potential of your stock from these levels?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I
 
think management is probably not the greatest judge of their own 
stock price and so we try not to comment specifically on that. We try to 
provide lots of information to investors and then there is a natural process 
through that of the price getting set. W
hat we focus on is how to grow the 
subscriber base, how to expand internationally, how to improve the content. 
Those are all the things that we're focusing on.
 
Julia Boorstin

CNBC
 
For investors who've been on a roller coaster ride with Netflix over the p
ast 
two years, what would you say to tell them or reassure them that what 
happened two years ago is not going to happen again?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Stocks go up and down, our stock has been so volatile. I mean a year ago 
we were at $80 now we're over $200. 
Five years ago we were at $30, we 
went public at $7.50. So the general trend is quite positive but there are a 
lot of ups and downs. And it's been a very volatile stock because we're 
growing so aggressively. We're choosing a business strategy which has a 
s
plit essentially all of our domestic profits into international expansion. And 
that's the right move, but it definitely takes a strong stomach on the part of 
investors.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
So, Reed, really following up on that international point. What 
is the 
strategy? I mean do you want to essentially grab as much market share 
over the next five years as you can without regard to profitability or do you 
think you are actually going to start showing meaningful international 
profitability before going to 
too many more markets?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Now what I said is the statements we have put in the long term letter, which 
is we are investing substantially all domestic profits in international 
expansion. And we think that's very smart. If you look at our internat
ional 
growth, it's tremendous. We think there is a huge opportunity around the 
internet in the international markets and we're investing for the long term in 
that. And I think we've been very clear in that for almost three years now.
 
David Wells
 
Yes. And t
he only thing I'd add to that, Rich, is that we have demonstrated 
good progression in terms of operating losses, reductions in international. 
We're 25% down year
-
over
-
year and we're very pleased, as Reed said, with 
the growth in those international markets
. So it's more about the 
progression of our existing markets and the path we're on than it is about an 
overall line.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
If I could also add too, the success we're seeing with our original 
programming we're seeing in throughout our international m
arkets as well. 
That proportionally to our sub base, our subs overseas are excited about 
these shows roughly the same level as they are in the U.S.

Shifting gears over to your license content spending. With two of the last 
three Dream
Works Animation films disappointing at the Box Office, 
underperforming DreamWorks Animations average. Do you have an [out] of 
the big deal that you announced with DreamWorks Animation.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I am sorry Julia, you're talking about the series deal or 
the film output.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
The series deal and the 
--
 
I mean the larger deals.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Look I am very comfortable with DreamWorks performance at the Box Office 
even this weekend. Yes, Turbo opened a little soft but it came out with 
CinemaS
core ratings of A, with very good word of mouth. Likely to hold up 
-
-
 
likely to continue to expand the box office. Cruise was a nice a little hit 
actually at the end of day for DreamWorks. And there is a rate card that 
regulates the fee for those shows rel
ative to their box office performance. So 
we're thrilled with DreamWorks and the performance of their films and the 
quality of their films. And they translate to very high viewing on Netflix, 
even in movies that don't perform as well at the box office.
 
Jul
ia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
But the fact that Turbo has been such a box office disappointment, specially 
compared to all the other DreamWorks animation movies, doesn't that 
diminish the value of that DreamWorks animation content on your platform? 
You said that it w
ould be a game changer, that this additional content is a 
game changer. Doesn't this diminish that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

down with the performance of the films. And as far as the s
eries deal is 
concerned, these are very iconic characters that tend to last a long time, 
way beyond opening weekend performance. Our series will launch post the 
DVD release of these films so they get a whole second wave of marketing 
out of them too.
 
Julia 
Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
I am sorry, go ahead Rich.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
I was going to just say, Ted, when you buy content, do you see a point 

buying in the UK, in every single market? Wh
en can you scale buy globally?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, increasingly all of our original deals we're doing globally. We have been 
doing all of our independent, non
-
studio deals globally. And we're doing a 
much more multi
-
territory licensing as well. So, sometime
s global plays out 
to our favor, and sometimes you don't really achieve the scale of it. So right 
now we're trying to weigh through that and see where we can pick up global 
efficiencies.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
Can you give us an example of where 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Rich, even when we're global, for example in Asia where we're not currently, 

if not exploiting it globally, it's really multi
-
regional.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
Moving on to 
--
 
quickly before we move on to original programming 
spending, can you tell us how many subscribers quit Netflix after you chose 
not to renew Dora the Explorer and the other Viacom content?
 
David Wells
 
Ted Sarandos
 
You sa
w it in the net adds. We grew.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
So moving on to the original programming spending, Netflix and Reed often 
draw the comparison to HBO. But unlike HBO, Netflix does not own the 

s. It also doesn't 
have exclusive rights. For instance House of Cards you can buy elsewhere, 
though Netflix does have the streaming rights. How do you justify 
reinforcing this parallel to HBO when HBO does have a different business 
model?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Juli
e most original programming originates in this way, which is you want to 
hedge your bets a little bit on building the confidence and building up before 
you build out the infrastructure. So you step in and do more licensing deals, 
which is how Showtime does
 
most of their deals, which is how HBO did in 
their earliest days, how AMC did in their earliest expansions. So this is not 
unusual at all. And the more confidence we build, the more likely we are to 
take a full ownership stake and to take 
--
 
and to build 
out more 
infrastructure around it.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
So, does that mean 
--
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
Starting to? Have you started to build out infrastructure that is?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, we are managing a broader set of rights today than we used to for 
sure.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
Does that mean 
--
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sorry. It's Reed here. Think of it as a broad expansion, which is HBO has a 
lot of licensed content, for example all the movies. So it's only the originals 
and only some of their originals that th
ey own. It's natural for us to grow 
into that over the next couple of years. So it's part of our long
-
term view.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
So do you have specific plans to move into full ownership in the near term?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Absolutely. It's something we'r
e looking at and there are so many gradations 
between what full ownership is in every territory. But think of it as over time 

exclusive to Netflix. But while we were getting started, it w
as really smart 
for us to work with Media Rights Capital and Lionsgate and others to be able 
to leverage their skills and competencies.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
Reed, do you think that you have a structural advantage in creating original 
programming versus y
our peers, whether that's the releasing pattern, 
whether it's the data, or whether it's the fact that you're commercial free?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We have some advantage in creating it, but I think the biggest advantage 
we have is in matching with the 
content and distributing it, essentially 
monetizing the content. And you can see that with the breadth of our 
success. So, one view of our four for four and are starting our five for five, if 
you include Lillehammer is Ted's God's gift to programming. And 
I think 
that's probably true. But the second part of it is also that we've got this 
online performance matching where the content is selectively promoted to 
each subscriber appropriately and that helps tremendously. And it's not 
really important for us to 
tease apart which is more true. We want both 
excellent, excellent programming and we want to do amazing promotion and 
we get stronger from that without worrying too much about which side is 
contributing more or less. You do see that Ted has an Emmy next to
 
him in 
the frame, and it's got a little story for you in that.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah. The Emmy we brought along today. I think it's a great example of 
Netflix to strive to be excellent as both a technology company and an 
entertainment company. And fitting to 
that, this Emmy was actually awarded 
to Netflix on the technology side last year for the advancement of television. 
And so actually the first Emmy came from the tech side of Netflix.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
But I guess I don't understand, how do you define 
a hit? You said Ted's five 
for five, Reed. How do you know Ted's five for five?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well. The easy one is, a hit is something we want to renew. And, thus, five 
for five is we want to renew because the economics for us are good.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
C
NBC
 
A question about your content cost, just to follow
-
up on that. How do you 
know you want to renew it? Is it the percentage of your subscribers who are 
watching? Is it subscriber bump (inaudible) slightly inflated. So how you 
know that you want to renew?
 
David Wells
 
Relative to how else we would have spent the money. Relative to spending it 
on license content, did we get an increase in viewership, did we get an 
increase in some of the intangibles like brand halo publicity, and the bring 
the brand more in 
focus with our consumers. So, relative to how else we 
would have spend the money on other programming, we think it was a big 
hit. And by the way without giving total, without giving ratings numbers, I 
would tell you every one of these shows are drawing TV 
size audiences. So 
you know that House of Cards is a hit because when you walk in to 
Starbucks people are talking about it. You know when the show is being 
spoofed at the White House Correspondents' Dinner and 3,000 people are 
laughing at the slightest ref
erences to the show, you know that people are 
watching it and you know people are talking about it. So without the 
precision of a number, you know that these shows are hit too.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
Okay. Well we're going to keep on asking for a number and
 
it's (inaudible) 
you will give one to me.
 
David Wells
 
Fair enough.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
So a question about content cost. Seemingly every network, cable, and 
broadcast and all of these new digital channels, are all spending aggressively 
on original progr
amming. Doesn't that threaten to drive your content costs 
spiraling higher and what kind of threat is that to you margins?
 
David Wells
 
How would it drive them higher?
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
If there are so many people competing for content. There are new bu
yers for 
content.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
(Inaudible) over license content.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
(Inaudible) Yeah.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
With so many people producing original programming, it creates a lot of 
competition in the market for license programming in their season 
after 
model. And in terms of competing for original programming, I am much 
more comfortable, to Rich's earlier question, around some of our structural 
advantage about not having to have a bunch, a lot of performance pressure 
on a show on its first week, wh
ich actually drives the ability for consumers to 
find the show overtime before we have to pull the plug on it, the way many 
other broadcasters force do in your television.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
But to raise the question about competition you have 
Amazon which is 
investing $1 billion in licensing content. You have Hulu which has got $750 
million from its parent companies to spend on content. The influx of all this 
cash for content both licensed and original, doesn't that threaten to push up 
prices?
 
David Wells
 
Yeah, maybe. And I could tell you that in the more exclusive deals that 
we've been negotiating, the one thing that's nice about that is you get to 
know what the walk away prices are. And I can tell you in everyone of those 
cases we've been comf
ortable at the prices we walked away from and 
comfortable at that level 
--
 
at the pricing that our competitors are paying for 
that content. So, yeah, there is definitely some competition in the 
marketplace which does raise the prices, which is good for the
 
producers and 
eventually good for consumers too.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'll add to that, that it's great for content owners and it's great for creators. 
That there is renaissance particularly in serialized TV. So on one hand, it's 
top on us that Amazon and Hulu a
nd others are bidding. But there are so 
many great stories to be told that it's exciting. And if the prices are going to 
go up, than we as one of the major scale players have a big advantage. And 
so, it's good for the creators, it's acceptable for us and w
e're seeing this 
total renaissance in television. Unfortunately, I have to tell you we're down 
about two minutes left. I did set this up as a 30 minute view. If it's very 
successful and investors like it, we will try to do a longer session next time. 
But l
et me hand it back to you for the closing two minutes.
 
Julia Boorstin 
-
 
CNBC
 
Okay. I hate to say it. We were emailed so many questions by investors and 
analysts, I wish we had a little bit more time. But I'm going to ask a quick 
question about competition.
 
You mentioned Amazon and Hulu, both of them 
are stepping up their investment spending. What kind of threat do they pose 
to you in the next, I would say starting in 2014 once we start seeing impact 
of that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we don't really know. We alwa
ys take them very seriously. They're 
very successful. But if you look at Showtime in HBO, when Showtime does 
great work it doesn't take away from HBO. And we think that Hulu and 
Amazon will do great originals, it will grow the whole internet TV market. 
And
 
then what controls our destiny is, do we do great programming? Do we 
have a great user interface? Do we have incredible streaming? And so we 
really just focus on maximizing that opportunity by making our service the 
best it can be.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
We were just talking about incredible streaming quality, but the issue really 
is most of your viewing occurs on fixed line connections because that's 
where the quality of the experience is good. International 
--
 

wireless isn't that good. Do you 
think that over the next few years we're 

Son is putting a tremendous amount of capital just buying Sprint. Do you 
think you're going to see a big shift in your business towards wirele
ss over 
the next few years?
 
Reed Hastings
 

proportion of our viewing and that helps the ecosystem. Better and cheaper 
connectivity, more competition for broadband, that's all very p
ositive. But 
these are gradual multi
-
year effects. Five or 10 years from now consumers 
will have incredible devices, incredible broadband at low prices and that's 
very favorable in the long
-
term. But I don't think it's a short term catalyst.
 
Rich Greenfiel
d 

 
BTIG
 
Is tablets even 5% of your viewing today?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't disclose the specifics.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
Reed, a question about the business that you are starting off with, DVDs. 
Many investors have pointed out that you seem to be allowing y
our DVD 
business to atrophy. Do you plan to shut down that legacy DVD business?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. We've got over 7 million members who love the service. It's got 
incredible selection, every movie and TV show ever made. So it's got a great 
part of the value
 
equation for over 7 million members and that will go on for 
a very long time.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 
Reed, one last content question.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Go ahead.
 
Rich Greenfield 

 
BTIG
 

into original TV series. A lot of people are asking would you go into the 
movie business and create movies? Would you create talk shows in the 
evening like a Jay Leno type show? Would you do a news program like the 
evening news that people could watch for 
24 hours on the subscription 
service? Like what other content makes sense for Netflix?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Rich, in the letter we mentioned that we're going to expand in the coming 
months into original standup comedy specials and documentaries that will 
premiere on Netflix to be exclusive to Netflix. There is no reason we wouldn't 
do some of those other 
--
 
those things that you've listed, including movies. 
If we can bring too it something like we did with original series, change the 
distribution model in 
the favor of the consumers with things like launching 
the whole season at one time and things that give us advantages over other 
forms of distribution.
 
Reed Hastings
 
If you look at HBO and Showtime, they also do quite a bit of sports 
programming and live s

happiness business. Now, we don't anticipate getting that far from our core 
brand, but it's a very flexible relationship, where we can have lots of types 
of content over the next 5 or 10 years if it makes our s
ubscribers happy. 
We're fundamentally in the membership happiness business as opposed to in 
the TV show business. And so we do have a lot of flexibility. But in the next 
-
-
 
in the short term we're focused on learning this craft bit by bit and having 
our cu
rrent shows be wildly successful.
 
Julia Boorstin 

 
CNBC
 
Can you tell us how many more originals you plan to launch over the next 
two years and how much you plan to spend on them?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not, precisely but we can say we're continuing to expand that. 
And it's a 
great wrap
-
up question. I want to thank all our investors for participating in 
this. We look forward to your feedback on the format. And we'll try to just 
keep on improving it to make it efficient and effective for all of you. Thank 
you very muc

10/16/15,Netflix,"Good afternoon. I am Erin Kasenchak, Director of Investor Relations at 
Netflix. I would like to welcome you all to our third quarter 2013 earnings 
interview. During today's discussion, we may make forward
-
looking 
statements and our actual results may 
vary from those statements.
 
With me today, is Reed Hastings, our CEO, David Wells, CFO, Ted Sarandos, 
Chief Content Officer and helping to facilitate our discussion is Rich 
Greenfield of BTIG Research and Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan.
 
Let me now turn it over to
 
Rich for our first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Thanks, Erin and thanks, everyone from Netflix for being here. We are going 
to switch questions tonight between me and Doug. I think the first question, 
though, really for Reed is, when you look at the investor statement, your 
stock is up a lot, year
-
to
-
date and you actually make a comment about the 
fact that it is a little bit of a sense of euphoria like there was in 2003. 
Normally, you have always said t
hat you leave it for Wall Street to 
determine what happens to your stock. Why did you make the comment this 
time about your stock and specifically about euphoria?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Rich, every time I read a story about Netflix is the highest appreciating
 
stock in the S&P 500. It worries me, because that was the exact headline 
that we used to see in 2003. You can definitely, we have a sense of 
momentum investors driving the stock price more than we might normally. 
There is not a lot we can do about it but 
I wanted to honestly reflect upon 
that.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
Go ahead, Doug.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Great. So our next question, we are going ask you a couple about 3Q in 
particular. So, Reed, can you help us understand what kind of impact you 
t
hink Orange Is the New Black had on subscribers and in 3Q you pointed out 
pretty early, obviously, in the letter, and maybe if you could compare to 
some of the initial impact that you have seen from other originals this year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think Or
ange was a great success for us but we don't have a way of 
separating out, is that why we did well, you know where the top half of our 
U.S. guidance or how material it was. It was also our overall content 
improvement. There was the general brand improvemen
t. Then remember 
we have a soft comp from last year. So being up, year
-
over
-
year is not as 
tough this quarter or in Q3. So it definitely helped. We are thrilled about it. 
But there is no clean analysis and we are not particularly trying to 
-
 
we are 
trying 
to do more great content like Orange, but we don't need to know, was 
it 2% or 5% or 10% of our sub
-
goal.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And from the standpoint of the Chromecast, you announced an offer during 
the quarter where Google, I believe, was funding some o
f the subscriber 
acquisitions for Netflix. Was it a material 
-
 
you didn't really make a lot of 
comment about it in the press release. Just curious, how significant that was 
and how do we think about those type of offers going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, w
e would like to see more of those types of offers. They work 
particularly well for consumer electronics companies, selling smart TVs and 
other things. But it's pretty small today and it was not material on the 
Chromecast, because most of those three months
 
went to existing 
subscribers.
 
If you think about the kind of person who orders a Chromecast in the first 
three days, you are pretty into technology and gear and most of those 
people were already Netflix subscribers, so it was a nice way to get a 
jumpstart
 
for Chromecast. We are very excited about the in the long
-
term, 
but it was not in this instance material to the membership growth.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Just a quick follow
-
up on Chromecast, can you help us understand how the 
economics work there?
 
Reed H
astings
 
Dave, what did we said so far?
 
David Wells
 
Yes. Doug, it's no different than other devices. So, we don't talk about the 
very specifics of all our deals, but it's no different than the economics of 
other devices that we have had out there.
 
Rich Gree
nfield

BTIG Research
 
In the statement, you make a comment about Latin America, that you had a 
significant number of what you would call low quality promotions in the 
market. It looks like if you are doing the math right, that it added 
somewhere around th
e [$200,000] to $400,000 if you compare the growth 
in total numbers versus the paid numbers, you lose a few hundred thousand 
plus subscribers. Just wondering why did you do the low quality promotions? 
What was going on there? Give us some background.
 
David
 
Wells
 
This is David, I will probably take that one, Rich. It's not that we did low 
quality promotions. It's that we are continuing to optimize and hone our 
payments in Latin America. It's something that we had been challenged 
with. We were first in the 
market and we optimized how much we are 
validating upfront in terms of methods of payment both, on direct debit card 
and on credit card and you can make choices to let in a number of 
subscribers that you think might be a high percentage of fraud, in which 
case you have got a lot of people in the free trials that aren't become paid 
subscribers.
 
You crank down on that and you run the risk of blocking a few people that 
are going to be paid subscribers, so you are always optimizing between the 
two, so our state
ments were more about the continual optimization and the 
fact that in September we had a fair number of folks, say, less than 20% in 
our Latin American free trials that were 
-
 
we were in a state, where we 
didn't think that we are going to matriculate to a 
paid subscriber.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Just one more related to 3Q in particular for you David. Can you help us 
understand the breakdown in the amortization cost and the library between 
domestic and international?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. I mean, you ha
ve got some that in our cost
-
to
-
revenue breakout in 
our financial statements, but if you are referring to the change in the 
amortization, the $27 million in additional amortization, $20 million was 
domestic and $7 million was international
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Moving on to Q4, now when you think about Q4, you are looking for a 
notable improvement in Q4 profitability internationally in terms of 
streaming. You didn't really give much background in terms of what was 
driving that. Is it just that pur
ely a subscriber growth in no new market 
launches or is there is more to why international profitability is starting to 
really improve?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You have got right synopsis of it, Rich, which is about growing the revenue 
and we don't have a new launch
 
country, so on the natural, on a sequential 
basis, you would see it steadily improve absent additional launches.
 
David Wells
 
The only thing I would add to that, Reed, this is David, is that with more and 
more markets, if you have got a small improvement i
n each one of those 
additional markets, it's just the nature of having multiple markets that when 
you stack them all together you see a total that actually improves 
sequentially. That's a little bit of easy math there, but it is part of that 
picture.
 
Rich 
Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Reed, just a question on 4Q and the outlook in particular, you talked about 
in 3Q having the easier comp from the summer Olympics. Why not expect 
4Q U.S. streaming net adds to be above the 4Q '12 levels given the way 
content has 
improved over the past year.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, that's where I started our internal forecast discussions, because you 
know we have had three quarters where we have been above past year, so 
it makes sense that you know we would all think that but it really
 
does turn 
out that in Q1 we were ahead of year ago because of our subscriber 
redefinition we did in the prior quarter.
 
In Q2, with a launch of Arrested, which is the only franchise that already had 
a big market upfront, and then Q3 we have the soft comp, 
so that's why we 
will be quite pleased with steady year
-
over
-
year out for Q4 and that's a 
underlying belief system and that's what we are tracking too also in the first 
three weeks of the quarter.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And when you look at that, we move o
n category wise in domestic 
streaming, when you think about your comments about margin 
improvement, I think on the last few calls you have talked about 100 basis 
points, you shifted 100 basis points to 400 basis points year
-
over
-
year for 
each quarter and y
ou said that that was really [contingent] upon your ability 
to continue to grow subscribers domestically at the same rate that you have 
been. When you look that you seem pretty good confident in your ability to 
keep that going, going forward, should we tak
e that to mean that you think 
that you can continue to add 7
-
ish million subscribers in 2014 and beyond? 
Or does margin improvement have to slow as you move into '14 or '15?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well on this calendar year it's about 6 million domestic net additio
ns, not 
seven, but if we are able to continue six next year then we believe we can 
keep the margin continuing to grow. So that's what that says is that, we 
really need that 6 million next year consistent with this year and then the 
margin can continue to g
row the 400 basis points quarter
-
over
-
prior year 
quarter. Does that answer your question?
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Yes.
 
David Wells
 
And Rich, this is David. I would add to that that we are also growing content 
expense. So the growth that we were talking abou
t allows us to expand 
margin and also grow our context expense.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
When you think about domestic streaming and, for Reed in particular, you 
have talked about 60 to 90 million U.S. subscribers potentially at some 
point. Do you think abou
t either the quality of content or the technology as 
being the bigger inhibitor toward reaching this goal overtime?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We have that same debate internally and the metaphor I use is that it looks 
like a plane with two big engines and you want 
both engines working as fast 
as you can. You don't really know which one is contributing what but we 
want to have the most incredible technology that we can in terms of on
-
demand, the personalization and that makes a fundamental difference and 
we want to h
ave the most incredible content that we have, both licensed and 
original. And if we can do both of those really well for the next couple of 
years, that is very optimistic for us and would lead to a big growth.
 
The third one that we are getting better and b
etter at, is our advertising. As 
you can see we put in some links in the script and you can get the feel and 
sense of the improvement in our ability to market our content and really 
develop that connection. And why don't I flip it to Ted for a second on ki
nd 
of what you see Ted as kind of content growth improvement because I think 
Doug is talking about that.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, thanks, Reed. And Doug, I think that the content continues to improve 
and I guess, as David pointed, out in the current forecast it i
ncludes room to 
continue to invest. What we have seen is, is that some of the original 
content has got a particular halo effect on the brand that creates a stickiness 
that we are liking the signs of, for sure and that's why we are continuing to 
invest in t
hat space. So it is like one of those things where evolving Netflix 
from being a place where I can see a lot of my favorite shows to the place 
where I can see the shows that I love, I think is a big investment that we 
are moving towards. So it is all depen
dent on having the great delivery 
technology that keeps that kind of in the background for consumers, when 
they define how Netflix works, that's where you lose them. So it is fun to 
know, you just push play, and it works.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
So you laun
ched personal profiles in the quarter. That's something that has 
been talked about for a long time getting to more an individualized basis. 
Did it have a notable impact? Are you seeing most consumers set up 
personal profiles? Or is it still something where
 
it's an education process? 
And just attached to that, you haven't updated in, I think, six months now 
actual usage of Netflix from a global standpoint. I think in Q1, you said 4 
billion plus hours were streamed after House of Cards aired. Any update you 
c
an give us on those numbers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure, Rich. We did about 5 billion hours in the last quarter. It's continuing to 
grow. On profiles, we are seeing continued growth in the adoption. It's 
mostly targeted at new member signing up. Most existing memb
ers have 
waited. They use Netflix like they used to and a few highly motivated of 
those will set up a profile but most of it comes in the initial set up screens 
and hence targeted largely at families where you want to set up a profile for 
one of you kids o
r all of your kids and keep the kids viewing separate from 
the parent. So there is a little more use of profiles. In that, you can use 
them in various ways but that's the initial big focus. And there have also 
been great 
-
 
yes it's been talked about a long
 
time and we are really excited 
to actually have it out in use.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
A question for David. Can talk to us more about how you expect streaming 
margins to scale overtime and do you believe you can get to the current 
margin levels of pay
-
TV 
cable networks?
 
David Wells
 
Sure, Doug. What we said in our long
-
term letter and previous questions we 
get, and as we don't really have a long
-
term margin target. We think as long 
as we are able to continue to grow at the rates we have seen this year, next
 
year we can continue to expand and investing content and grow margins. 
With continued scale and growth, our margins should continue to grow, but 
we don't have a long
-
term target.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
You know when the studios, if we are going t
o kind of move over topic wise 
over to your actual original programming strategy. I was thinking, when 
content is commissioned, you end up with people watching a whole number 
of episodes at once. It really is up to the consumer to choose how they want 
to w
atch and what they want to watch. The average broadcast show is 
actually, I think people try it and generally get only a couple of episodes in 
before they end up usually giving up and it is a very rare show, where 
people end up watching an entire season of
 
content.
 
For Netflix, when you say that your content is going to ""successful"" and I 
think all of you talk to a kind of five
-
for
-
five batting average. Does that 
assume that the average consumer is watching all of the episodes or your 
average Netflix subscr
iber who starts House of Cards has actually watched 
the whole series, or they are only watching say six or seven of the shows. 
How do we think about that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Rich, we have a remarkable complete rate and that's one of the metrics we 
talk about. W
e talk about success, because it's a pretty safe bet that if 
somebody watches all 13 episodes of a show in a pretty short time span if 
they love that content, so it's a good leading indicator for us that we are 
doing okay with them.
 
I know, to your point w
here there is a traditionally a pretty bailout rate after 
the third or fourth week of new show and what we see is a pretty kind of 
steady growth as people both, been drive out of the gate and then settle into 
a more comfortable viewing pattern, so we do ha
ve I think a favorable 
complete rate to anything that I have seen on television when I check the 
ratings.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Just as a follow
-
up on original, Ted. You said in the past that, each 
subsequent show has been better or had more view
ing than the one 
proceeding it in terms of originals. Can you just talk to.
 
David Wells
 

new shows.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay. Can you tell us how audiences are building for some 
of the early 
originals for example like of House of Cards?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
In what and what patterns are they building?
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Well, just in terms of how the show continues to build audience even after 
the initial run?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
They are 
continuing to build. I mean, we have this kind of burst of 
excitement at the beginning usually tied to the marketing that we are doing 
and also the positive press event that's going around the new shows in their 
first couple of days, but unlike other shows
 
it tend to lose audience week 
over week over week. We cumulatively kind of gain audiences as we go 
along and House of Cards get another unique bump when the show was 
nominated for the Emmy Awards.
 
It was a measurable bump in both, users and hours watched 
as people 
discovered the show for the first time and or returned to the show after 
having tried it at the beginning, so we are seeing kind of 
-
 
they are certainly 
not dead after the first couple of days or the first couple of weeks to the 
show and they con
tinue to find unifying new audience. The way we do for a 
licensed content too where we saw lots of audience build around Breaking 
Bad early seasons as the last season came on air was receiving a lot press 
attention, so no different than that.
 
David Wells
 
O
ne of the things that we will see for the first time next year is what we are 
able to do with Season 2 of these shows, so when we have Season two with 
House of Cards, we are going to be doing a lot to get people in to Season 1 
in the beginning and to reall
y complete that, so we think we will get a big 
boost in Season 1 viewing as we are remarketing the brand House of Cards 
and really gauging the excitement around Season 2.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
You recently announced that, I think Ted announced ac
tually when he was 
speaking that you are increasing your investment in originals. You had 
before said that it was maybe kind of under 10% and now you seem 
comfortable with a number larger than 10%.
 
Our overall programming eventually over the next couple of
 
years being 
original programming, curious I assume embedded within that as now in the 
Season 2 all the shows we just mentioned, but also the new damages writer 
show that you just announced with Sony. Then just curious you also had a 
show, I believe, from 
the [Whitehouse]
 
David Wells
 
Yes. We announced that a few months ago. Right.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
That's also a 2014 show, because that wasn't in your press release. I am 
just wondering what is actually in your expectations for '14 original 
prog
ramming and why the change in the level of spending?
 
David Wells
 
Well. I would say remember that we are kind of trying to optimize for a 
high
-
quality shows, so they take a long time to discover, they take a little bit 
longer to build and the delivery time 
becomes a little bit longer to build. And 
the delivery time becomes a little more elastic. So we have announced last 
year, we expected Sense8 to land in the end of 2014 and we still do. It's 
subject to move a little bit, I imagine. We do expect the KZK sho
w to deliver 
in '14 as well. I know we have some other announcements coming along the 
way. So to your earlier part of your question, we said it's a doubling of 
where we are at today. That includes some of these shows, some shows that 
we are yet to announce
 
and then including some big shows that have yet we 
have to launch like the first wave of the DreamWorks Animation deal, the 
season two is another of the content. So we are trying to move as quickly as 
we can and we think that, its not that we are beginnin
g comfortable with the 
number if begin in 10. We are comfortable at the number that we are 
currently sitting at and where we are currently looking to grow to and we are 
going to keep reviewing it. So HBO, as an example, about 40% of their 
spend is on origi
nal programming. So there is a big gap from where we are 
to where we could be.
 
David Wells
 
And Rich, this is David. Just at the risk of repeating a little about what Ted 
just said. To reconcile some of those comments our intension is, as we have 
said, to d
ouble it. The expense, it will still be a sub 10% likely next year. It 
just takes along a long time in terms of the lead time to get the shows out 
and with the commitment to quality to get those out but the doubling of 
expense over time is certainly there 
and we have talked 10%, 20%, 25%. 
We don't know what the right number is but we know that it is going to grow 
over time and with the success we have seen to
-
date we are going to 
continue to expand it.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Just along those lines, 
would you even want to own content outright? How 
do you think about ramping up your own production capabilities to control a 
series completely? What would have to happen for you to shift the model 
more in that direction?
 
Reed Hastings
 
So we would like to c
ontrol the territories and the windows that we need and 
we could either achieve that through owing it out right or by negotiating with 
third party producers to end up in the same place. And I am a little 
indifferent between the two. I think in our early go
ings we were protective 
and trying to kind of hedge our bets as we stepped into the content and 
certainly do want to build a big infrastructure around ownership. Something 
we would be much more comfortable doing today and could, particularly 
considering th
e complexity of new territories as we open them up.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
When a company fails in the original production business, all of your peers, 
Ted they end up taking an immediate write down of the content. They really 
have to expense it right away
. Given your model where it's all part of the 
subscription process, how does one determine whether a show would have 
to be written off and given the long life of being able to be on the Netflix 
""shelf"", will we ultimately see write
-
downs from Netflix, beca
use obviously 
everything you won't make won't be in a five
-
for
-
five batting average range.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, I will probably take this, Ted. Rich, likely you won't see many write
-
downs, in the sense that we have already got a shorter amortization period 
t
han the license period. But if we feel like the hours viewed are not going to 
be generated from a particular title or PC content, we would look across that 
category, we would look at the title and say are we materially off of it and 
then we would have to m
ake a judgment. But generally, we are already sort 
of shorter than the license period. So there is a some conservatism there. 
And then we would look at our projections to see how far apart we are but 
generally it is about those hours coming in spread over 
the life of the term 
which is less about whether you have a piece of content that you think is 
going to be viewed half than something you expected before and it is more 
about the pattern of those hours.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
How quickly the viewing happen
s right?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Right, and so there is an opportunity cost though. If we do have a show that 
is performing significantly less than we expected that will obviously crowd 
out other investments that we could be making in other content that we 
could be 
making.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
This one is for Ted. You have obviously already broken new ground in terms 
of releasing all the episodes of a particular season at the same time. How do 
you think about breaking further convention and perhaps 
releasing a second 
season or next season of the show sooner than that tradition 12 month 
Hollywood cycle?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. We are very excited about trying to do that, in terms of when we go to 
into a show, particularly if we committed to multiple season
s upfront, then 
we would accelerate the production schedule. But again we don't want to 
loose track of quality. So we want to leave time for the writing to be as best 
as it can be and also for the talent to rest in between seasons. But ideally we 
would lik
e to reduce those cycle times between seasons beyond the tighter 
than the one year we are seeing today.
 
David Wells
 
We went to a second season of Orange Is the New Black early because we 
have seen all 13 episodes. We are highly confident the forecast model
s and 
the quality of the show and it enabled us to move into production sooner and 
close the window between Season 1 and Season 2, so you see in that show 
already.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
If we look at the content beyond the TV series that you are 
creating and 
think more broadly, I asked you at the end of the last conference call about 
movies and it seems like over the last few months more and more of people 
in the movie industry keep expecting you to do something in the movie 
business. Curious what
's stopping you? It seems like you seem to have quite 
an interest in breaking into the movie business. If you did it, what would it 
look like? Documentary, 100 million
-
type? We talking Avengers? What do 
you want to doing and why would you want to be in the
 
movie business?
 
David Wells
 
We are looking at all those things you just described and we are actively 
looking right now to few documentary projects that will premier on Netflix 
versus more traditional windows.
 
On the movie side, I would keep my mind wide 
open to what those films 
would be and what they would look like and really the driver of it is like we 
are able to kind of break convention on television by operating all episodes 
at once, hoping that consumers have really loved we like to do more of that 
in the movie space. In that today we are kind of held to the traditional pay 
model meaning the movies are not coming to Netflix, until they hit pay 
television almost a year after they are in theaters. Even through that window 
is moving, I don't know if it 
moving aggressive enough for people who really 
do have experienced more in demand and on
-
demand lifestyle around their 
content, so I think that the more we would be aggressive with windowing by 
taking more control over the content earlier in the process th
at would be 
good for our members.

There is an increasing talk about the NFL looking to sale certain digital rights 
to other providers. Can you talk about your appetite for a live event and 
sport content and how you might be able to u
se that potentially as loss 
leader for sub
-
acquisition is a possible you can even make the economics on 
that content itself workout.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I would say we are in the same place we were Doug, we are still not 
interested in sports. What we bring to th
e table is a lot of improvement, 
because of all the attributes are on
-
demand and I don't think that brings 
much to sports viewing which is primarily a linear experience.

A topic that I think is near and dear to everybody rig
ht now in terms of 
Netflix is, your MVPD, ISP relationships and kind of how that plays out. I 
think Doug and I have a number of questions on that topic. I think first off, 
John Malone was in New York for the Liberty Analyst Day, obviously 
representing [Cha
rter] and he basically said that riding on the pipes of the 
ISPs for free is ""simply unsustainable"". He was hoping from kind of a big 
picture response from Reed.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. I mean, when you look at broadband collecting $40 to $60 dollars a 
month fo
r operating broadband and not having to pay content cost, I could 
say, well that's unsustainable. They have to pay some of the content cost.
 
In fact, the arguments works both ways and we think it will work out in the 
long
-
term best if there is neutrality a
nd that if we bring the bets there is an 
interchange and that there is no charging at the interchange and this the 
architecture that's allowed the growth of the global Internet which is not 
taxing each other, so we are very optimistic that that will contin
ue. There 
are people who say own cable companies or own content companies who 
aspire on the other side to collect I don't think it's going to happen. It's 
definitely still emerging and growing.
 
In general, with our Open Connect, which is free to all our IS
Ps, we are 
seeing a great adoption. It's nearly every single ISP outside of the U.S. and 
its many of the smaller once inside the U.S. so we are definitely making 
some real progress there and I think it will leave room for great consumer 
services from broad
band companies and from content companies.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Along those lines, can you help us understand how the recent deals are 
structured with Virgin Media and in the past I believe you primarily paid for 
on devices and subscriber acquisition on 
more of a per sub basis. Are we 
seeing any more of a shift toward recurring economics with these kind of 
deals going forward?
 
David Wells
 
Yes. Doug as you would suspect I can't get it into the individual terms. What 
I would say is that we are really set to
 
try to that help Virgin expand their 
footprint. They are doing a leading hedge job with their MVPD and what we 
hope to do is be able to use their quality of experience that they are 
generating to help them grow share because of course then other MVPDs so 
long to do that also.

When you look at the U.S., what are the biggest challenges? Google Fiber 
has you on their box. They actually in some ways sell their box to the 
consumer. Others are leasing the boxes. Is it possible for
 
you to be on a 
Comcast lease set
-
top box or does it have to be on a box like the Roku or an 
Apple TV? Can you just walk us though what are the biggest hurdles to 
replicating this in the U.S.?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, I am sure we could be on a Comcast box. So 
the real question is, we 
have to figure out deal terms that make sense for both sides. And it's been 
an ongoing discussion with many of the MVPDs not limited to Comcast. But I 
have a X1, the Comcast box at home. It's got an apps and I listened to 
Pandora o
n it. I think personally, I would like to be able to watch Netflix and 
that will keep me on the Comcast X1, which is a great product. So I am 
really hopeful that we can do that with both Comcast and other people in the 
industry.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG
 
But 
David, I think was speaking at a conference just a couple of weeks ago 
and said that, some of your programming deals make that very challenging. 
Could you elaborate?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. I don't think at this point it would be a problem to be on a Comcast 
b
ox and presumably others. So, historically there definitely were some 
concerns but I think we are through that at this point.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Just following
-
up on that, just the CDN you built play into implications for 
getting wholesale deals done?
 
Reed Hastings
 
A little bit, because what we want to do is have a great experience on these 
boxes and the ISPs that directly interconnect with our Open Connect CDN 
get a better experience, higher video quality, less rebuffering. And so with 
Virgin, we are i
ntegrated all the way through and it creates a better 
experience. I am not sure that what everybody wants is a better experience.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Could you talk about your ISP penetration rates? Do you see notable 
difference in terms of cable operat
ors versus telco fiber versus DSL? Are 
there real differences at this point? And are people looking towards the 
highest quality charts that you roll
-
out each month in terms of who's the 
best?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, let's say a few consumers look. But I can't s
ay that people move in 
droves from one to another just based on our comparison. But what we 
really see is that ISP's, especially cable and fiber, want to invest in the next 
generation architecture to be able to offer 100 megabits, a gigabit and you 
are see
ing this. This is a very highly profitable businesses, if you can get 
them to scale and there is a no point for a consumer getting a 100 megabit 
pipe or gigabit pipe if doesn't get to places like Netflix and YouTube quickly. 
So it's both the on ramp that's
 
the speed that's rated and just how well 
interconnected it is and that's why we developed this free Open Connect 
program to be able to supply those highest possible speeds.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Just shifting gears to talk about international streaming a
 
little bit. How 
should we think about the relative degrees of profitability in the international 
markets? How many, perhaps, are currently profitable and how do you think 
about the general timeframe to reach breakeven?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Go ahead, David.
 
David
 
Wells
 
Either one us can answer that. But Doug, we have said, for competitive 
reasons, that we provide additional color on the markets. You can take the 
information that you do have, which is the progress of the overall 
international loss getting better ea
ch quarter and in our statements that we 
are growing net additions or members in each one of those market. So both 
of them give you an indication of improving pictures in each one of our 
markets.

When you look at the top 10 
broadband markets, I think Netflix right now, if 
you look at total household subscribers in millions, Netflix is only in three of 
the top 10, the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. That leaves seven very large 
broadband markets that you haven't attached yet. The m
arkets that you 
have actually entered most recently, leaving of Latin America, are actually 
relatively smaller in terms of total broadband subscribers. When do you go 
for the big ones? What's holding you back from getting into some of those 
very large broa
dband markets?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well it is definitely something we are looking at, Rich. We definitely have 
been being a little more cautious since the price change two years ago and 
our thinner base in the U.S. Now we are gaining momentum there. We 
expanded 
in the Nordics a year ago. Netherlands, recently. And so when we 
look forward to next year, we will definitely be looking at some larger 
expansions, in terms of their size of broadband markets.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Just following
-
up there. You highlighte
d the initial response in the Nordics 
and the Netherlands. Can you talk a little bit more about the experience you 
have had there so far, the characteristics in those markets that have made 
them potentially off to a faster start than some of the other mark
ets that 
you see?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We really we have great and consistent success across all of the markets 
except for the payments issue that we underestimated in Latin America. We 
have been straight forward about that. We are making progress on that. And 
ov
er time, Latin America will be an enormous success for us. It's already 
growing rapidly, the number of broadband households in Latin America will 
exceed the U.S. over the next five years, so it's really a huge and broadband 
household is subscribers' househ
old we have enough money to pay for 
broadband, so that kind of evens up the count and Latin America will be 
huge in that category and huge for us. But other than the payments issue, 
we had a very consistent reception across all of the markets. People want 
on
-
demand and everybody loves, not everybody but in every market there 
are a lots of people that love Hollywood content. Then we are continuing to 
argument that with lots of local content.
 
David Wells
 
It's probably worth point out too, Reed, that, 
House of Cards and Orange Is 
the New Black particularly, but also Hemlock Grove and all the original 
shows have been remarkably popular in every territory we operate in. Even 
on much lesser market expense. So we have been thrilled that we have been 
able to
 
find some real scale, international scale with the original programs as 
well.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
And Ted, while my Brazilian is not great or my Portuguese is not great, it 
does seem like from reading some of the local papers that you have don
e a 
little bit of local programming in Brazil. Wondering if you could talk to us 
about that? How significant spend wise and is this the start of much larger 
local programming strategy overseas?
 
David Wells
 
Rich, it's pretty much a scale problem. So you hav
e to have enough people 
there to program for them specifically order produce for them specifically. I 
would say what we are doing in Portuguese local language content in Brazil 
is very much at the experimental stage and we think given the indicators 
that w
e are seeing in Latin America that's it's very feasible that we can make 
the economics work for the local productions in some of these territories.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Just one more on the international markets, do you ultimately believe that 
most of th
ese markets can look the U.S. in terms of penetration, usage 
assuming the technology. The broadband capability is ultimately on a 
comparable level or do you think that there is something else unique about 
the U.S. just in terms of penetration or usage goal
s that would make this 
market different?
 
David Wells
 
No. I don't think there is anything fundamental that's different about the 
U.S. If you look at YouTube usage, it's about 80% international. If you look 
at Skype revenue before they were acquired, it's ab
out 83% international. 
Given the relative size of the economies, the U.S. which is 5% of the 
population, generates more revenue than its population count in the world, 
but it should be around 20
-
80 in the long
-
term may be 30
-
70 since we 
started so U.S.
-
cen
tric and DVD
-
centric, but those are the numbers that 
they are the large internet firms have.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
If we shift over to competition, we have new management now at Hulu, new 
cash infusion of $700 million at Hulu. Amazon supposedly it seems l
ike 
worst
-
kept secret is rolling out some form of set
-
top box. Wondering when 
you look at 2014, are you expecting a more aggressive domestic competitive 
landscape than we have seen throughout 2013?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not particularly. There are certain markets 
like the U.K., that are very 
competitive with BSkyB and Now TV. There are other markets, well, all of 
other markets really are pretty competitive. Remember, we don't just 
compete against say other $8 to $10 video services. We compete broadly I 
guess cables
 
and satellite, we compete against video games, we compete 
against just browsing time killing time on the web and so it's because we 
compete so broadly that we haven't seen any material effect as competitors 
more direct competitors have risen and fallen in
 
the last two or three years. 
There is a lot of competition for content, but then if you think of our 
originals, there we compete with about 40 different cable networks that are 
producing original, so if you are a writer, you have the great idea you know 
y
ou are biting it all broadly to see who will buy it at the best price.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Just one more in the competitive front, Reed. If we look at Google Searches 
for Netflix, it looks like they vastly exceed those for LOVEFiLM right now in 
the UK. 
What do you think is driving the success that you are having there 
relative to lot given that they were earlier to the market?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's a really tough thing doing a hybrid play with DVD. People associate you 
with DVD and the branding of LOVEFiLM 
Instant is impossible to deliver on. 
It's a congruent that we figured out that we were doing both, so LOVEFiLM 
people are meant DVD is supper broad selection and LOVEFiLM Instant which 
is the brand means all that but now streaming and for a series of right
s 
issues no company can deliver on that. And so Redbox Instant has the same 
problem. The brand, fundamentally, is not correct because they can't deliver 
on that promise, as exciting as it sounds to consumers. So that's a big 
tension. Now Amazon is having a
 
lot of success on the pay
-
per
-
view side and 
on streaming inside of Prime. So I think those are really the areas of focus 
for them and they are very successful in those areas.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Playing though, is that thing what you just said, Reed an
d shifting over to 
your DVD business, Netflix really has become synonymous with streaming 
on a global basis. Is your DVD business at this point strategic? Are there 
other ways to best create value out of that business for Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think the
 
best way is within Netflix and it's running as a standalone group. 
It's doing great work. We have got over 7 million people that are very 
excited to have that breadth of selection including all the HBO and Showtime 
series on DVD. So it's just got a super 
selection. But we don't market it a lot 
partially because of that brand confusion problem. So it's really, it will shrink 
a little bit every year but I think the best way to monetize it is going to be 
keep it as it is.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG
 
Reed, you have
 
only talked about users preferring to watch Netflix content 
on their large screen TV's. Google, the other night, said that 40% of 
YouTube usage was now coming via mobile. How much of Netflix's total 
viewing comes from mobile devices currently? And how muc
h of a driver do 
you think mobile ubiquity is just in driving new subscribers and also reducing 
churn?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well there is mobile on cellular networks and that's fairly small for us. I think 
it's a combination of the long form content and the data 
caps that are one 
those plans. Then there is mobile within the home where it's on Wi
-
Fi and 
it's the device you watch in bed, you watch curled on the couch and that's 
been quite large for us. So it really depends on the sub category but 
fundamentally where
 
Netflix works best is with a Internet screen that's got 
on Wi
-
Fi rather than on cellular networks.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
And when you think about those devices, could you give us any color on, is 
tablets now getting the in
-
home viewing, is tablets now a meaningful 
percentage and do you see differences between 
-
 
are people using it more 
on iOS than on Android? We have heard f
rom some people, Alan from 
Machinima the other day indicate that most of their viewing actually occurs 
on tablets on iOS devices. Are you seeing similar type patterns where there 
really is skew?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well. We don't give that individual 
breakdowns, either on devices or on OS'. 
But in general, I think the competition between the Android family and the 
iOS family and the Windows family is creating a great bounty for consumers 
because of the low prices and attractive usage patterns. And then
 
Netflix, 
YouTube and others benefit from all of those usage patterns. So tablets are 
growing, mobile phones are growing but frankly so are smart TVs is going 
very rapidly for us.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Can you talk about what kind of lift you expect to se
e in 4Q from the new 
gaming consoles and is this as material now as it was in the early days of 
streaming when you were just beginning to get distribution?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Doug, I think we will see very little lift from that because the people who 
buy the PS
4 and Xbox One are the people who already have the PS3 and the 
Xbox 360. They are the hardcore fans who want to get the coolest, latest 
thing to play more games. So the first way does not expand the market for 
us or for them. So it's really a question of, 
do those companies, over time, 
pioneer a model where instead of 60 million or 80 million as a lifetime, they 
get to 200 million or 300 million units. If so, through some combination of 
price and utility and then it becomes expansive. But that's a couple of
 
years 
down the road.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
When you look at the overall viewing that you have, you have talked about 
three quarters of it coming from your recommendation engine. Just curious, 
when you look at that recommendation engine going forward, can
 
it still get 
a lot better? I think in your press release you talked about or actually, the 
update to your long
-
term view, you actually detailed that you are increasing 
your spending on technology up to like $400 million from $350 million was in 
the prior 
long
-
term view. Is that to make things like the recommendation 
engine better? What are you trying to do in terms of make the product 
better? Like what's not good right now in terms of baby offering?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, the recommendations are getting bette
r and better which is a 
combination of the data that we can collect and then how much CPU 
intelligence we can put in terms of processing that. And so its got a long way 
to go. If you think about where we will be in 5 or 10 years, how much better 
will Googl
e Search be? How much better will Netflix's recommendations? 
How much better will Amazon will be? All of the different businesses are 
getting better at processing these large amounts of data to synthesize better 
and better recommendations, so, I am very op
timistic about it over the next 
couple of years getting to where there is half dozen recommendations that 
we offer that are cherry picked and that a large percentage over time one of 
those half dozen or exactly what you are looking for.

A question for David just on the balance sheet, what are your thoughts on 
the strength of the balance sheet currently? If you had access to more 
capital, how would you potentially look to deploy this in terms of either TV 
production moving into movies,
 
perhaps more directly or expanding 
international quicker?
 
David Wells
 
Well, Doug, we haven't used any cash this year. We started year with the 
February raise we were about $1 billion. Now we are about $1.1 billion. The 
two primary things that continue to 
be a use of cash are our international 
investments in the sense that they run, we run negative on those and there 
are on a loss on a consolidated basis and our content spending and that's 
predominately originals and output style deals and we will continue 
to assess 
these, but we are pretty comfortable where we are right now. Obviously, the 
market conditions are attractive in a number of different places, but we still 
continue to assess and be pretty comfortable with where we stand.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Just a foll
ow
-
up, last quarter I think you made a comment that there might 
be a need to tap the markets to move faster. Is that something that you 
think about? I guess, given where your stock is, given where debt markets 
are, why aren't you trying to move even faster
 
right now than you are in 
terms of international expansion? I mean, debt is cheap and your equity at 
all time record highs. Just why not faster I guess it's really the open 
question.
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think Reed and I can take a piece of this together, 
but I would say 
that we don't feel capital constrained right now in terms of our pace of 
expansion. If we did, we would go out and tap the market, but Reed if you 
got a follow
-
up for that too.
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. I would say the same thing which is, we think
 
we are going at a great 
clip. We wanted to get back to solid profitability, be able to fund our 
international work. If we weren't much faster on international, we would 
drive the global P&L negative, which is not something we have been 
comfortable with, s
o on a practical basis we are more P&L constrained on the 
international.
 
On originals, Ted knows. He has got the cash if he needs to use it to be able 
to get the right talent on the right projects, so there is no particular 
constraint there. The only reaso
n frankly that we haven't raised more money 
is, we don't see the need right now, so then we just balance what's a good 
security market and we think we are pretty comfortable, but you can 
certainly make an argument we should, given all the conditions you sa
id, 
take it up a little bit but it will be pretty immaterial if we did something.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
Just following
-
up on that. In the past you have talked about running the 
overall business on a breakeven basis. Of course, we see in the domes
tic 
streaming business the 400 basis points of year
-
over
-
year margin expansion 
and being reasonable obviously in terms of how you are expanding into 
international markets. How do we think about that statement of running 
breakeven going forward?
 
Reed Hastin
gs
 
Well, we definitely say running profitable now. Keeping the business 
profitable, so that's how we have evolved that statement.

When you think about Aereo, they have kind of defied the logic of the 
broadcast and seeming to
 
prove themselves legal to
-
date in the courts. Well 
I know that you look at yourselves as a cable network or digital cable 
network much like HBO, the combination of an offering of $8 a month for a 
DVR with a bunch of broadcast television stations as well a
s deep catalog 
and great original programming from Netflix does seem like a pretty potent 
combination for a good chunk, maybe not 10s of million, but certainly 
millions of consumers, is an alliance or some form of greater working 
arrangement a possibility 
for you as you look forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well Aereo is both opportunity and threat. To some degree it's opportunity 
that more people get used to on demand and love that. It's also a threat 
because the natural course for them as they get to a couple milli
on 
subscribers is first to license other cable networks trying to build the better 
package. Then ultimately become a competitor for Netflix.
 
Now, there one competitor or many of competitors as I talked about so we 
don't spend any particular time on 
Aereo. Think of it as the entertainment 
time pool for money and time. It's very large. And so no one competitor 
really has seemed to be able to effect us either positively or negatively. So I 
would really doubt that we notice anything specific about areas 
growth upon 
Netflix, either positive or negative in the next couple of years.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Just a question on cord
-
cutting, Reed. Can you just talk about your current 
views in terms where we are with cord
-
cutting in the U.S.? What do you 
think th
e trends are there? And if you have any kind of idea in terms of how 
much of a driver this is for Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well the trends have been quite clear that there is zero cord
-
cutting. We are 
at $100 million on a year
-
over
-
year basis and Q2 does dow
n a little bit every 
year as students move but it same as Q2 last year. So right now there is 
zero cord
-
cutting. The question is, well, will that last? And that really 
depends on does cable continue to get better. Cable is taking share from 
satellite, fibe
r is growing a little bit a too. So there are some important and 
interesting secular notes in that. But in general consumers are getting a lot 
of content on cable and that's doing well for them and our market has not 
been the cord
-
cutter market. I mean if 
you think about it domestically, as 
we have grown from zero to 31 million and there has been no decline in 
MVPD household. So it really seems pretty strong that consumer see as 
complementary to MVPD rather than a replacement for it.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
From an HBO standpoint, you have passed them now in the U.S. I know that 
certainly the media blogosphere seems very excited about that statistic, but 
it seem like in shareholder letter that you seem more focused on a much 
bigger long
-
term opportunity, whic
h is the international subscribers of HBO 
at a 114 million and obviously with your international business where it is 
now you got a long way to go but it also sounds like you have some big 
plans for international market launches in the next 12 to 24 months
. Is it 
years away? Meaning five plus years away to be bigger than HBO globally? 
Or could you actually get there even faster than that given the pace of 
broadband adoption on a global basis?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It will get probably take longer than that because 
they are continuing to 
grow. You know the thing about us is, as we grow HBO is really focusing on 
doing incredible work. They will probably do some of the best shows they 
ever do in the next five years. They are expanding more aggressively in 
international
. So I think what we will see is they grow some. We hopefully 
grow a lot and I don't know when we will catch them. It is going to be a long 
time. I mean at 114 million, they have been at it since 1972. So that's 40 
years and we have been at it, in the stre
aming sense, only seven years. So I 
am really happy with our progress to
-
date they but we do have a long way 
to go catch up to them.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
A question for Ted, just on originals and other content. Can you just talk 
more about, obviously, si
nce you have had the originals over the last six to 
nine months or so, this particular wave, how much that's opened up the 
door for writers and producers to come to you directly where you are on 
inbounds and how that's changed the environment for you?
 
Ted 
Sarandos
 
So both the success of the shows, in terms of the launching and certainly the 
success at the Emmy Awards was helpful. But mostly, I think, content 
creators are really attracted to the notion of creative control and being able 
to come here and make
 
the show that they intended to make without a lot of 
creative interference. So we get a lot of inbound traffic. I would guess that 
on most major projects, we are the first and not the second stop for these 
content creators because I think they are mostly 
incredibly enthused about 
the idea of how we make and release the content and how we support it 
once it's live. So far it's been incredibly door opening which was the intent of 
doing high profile shows like House of Cards, right out of the gate.

Kind of a housekeeping question for David on the amortization change that 

Because you are obviously ramping your marketing spend that Reed talked 
about. You are continu
ing to ramp your technology spend. You, I assume, 
didn't know heading into last quarter when you gave guidance that you were 
going to have the step up in accelerated amortization, both in Q3 as well as 
in Q4. Where is the offset? Is it just purely on a sub
scriber growth number 
that you are making it up or how do we make up that delta?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. So you are correct that we didn't know heading into guidance. 20 
million of it is domestic and about half of that we were made
-
up in terms of 
our performance
 
with subscribers, revenue, lower content and some 
marketing expenses that got pushed. The other half we were able to adjust 
marketing spend, and so you will see some of it get shifted into Q4, some of 
the discretionary items that we were able to shift som
e of the other money 
around, so we made up the difference that way.

The question just on the DVD front, can you talk about where you are now in 
terms of distribution centers compared to where you were are the peak and 
other things th
at you have done in terms of the improving efficiency there?
 
David Wells
 
I will probably take this one, Dough. We were about 39 centers and I think 
we peaked out at about 48 and maybe around 50, so probably about 20% 
less, but we still continue to reach a 
great percentage of the U.S. in one day 
service, because even if we drop a distribution center we will add a shuttle 
which still gets the nail to that local postal center, so it's not a one
-
to
-
one 
relationship when we close a distribution center that folks
 
in that area get 
two
-
day service. It has a large part to do with the U.S. postal system and 
what's happening there, so when they close distribution centers, there is 
only so much we can do in terms of moving things around, but we are still 
pleased with ho
w much of the U.S. we get in one day service.

Shifting over to Open Connect. Reed, you mentioned it before, when you 
had this video hang out the last time, I believe you were acquiring Open 
Connect in order for people to hav
e access to your highest quality content. It 

content up into the market. Could you just discuss that change in strategy?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. We realized with 4K coming, we want to be one 
of the big suppliers of 
4K content next year that we want to not to complicate that as to which 
networks that was available on and not and if we are going to have 4K 
available everywhere. We should have super HD also available, so it's really 
driven from t
he impending next year 4K expansion.

David just a follow
-
up on the amortization, so you pulled forward the $27 
million in 3Q, can you talk just a little bit about over the few quarters how 
we should think about that impact?
 
David Wel
ls
 
What we said was, we are not coming off our targets, so the impact is 
absorbed basically right now. You shouldn't think of there being any impact. 
Obviously, there is some hit to the international side and so that's part of 
the losses of the 
international, but overall, I will just remind folks that it's 
still less than 10% of our overall content expense. Even though there is this 
change, the majority of that was catch up amortization related to titles that 
were released prior to Q3.

When you see a show like Walking Dead versus let's just say House of 
Cards, you are seeing a dramatically different profile in terms of viewership, 
in terms of people are watching House of Cards basically within a few month 
window whe
re something like Walking Dead every night, the most watched 
episode is still the first episode of Season 1 and so you are seeing that 
define trend change or do you think that once you launched Season 2 of 
House of Cards, that's going to actually change ba
ck to more of the Walking 
Dead like modeling, change in the amortization policy may have been too 
early to adjust if that makes sense?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, well it is possible, Rich, that will be true, but we have to do what we 
can based upon estimates that w
e have. The difference is not so much on 
kind of what happens to the tail. Remember with The Walking Dead, we 
don't get it on the same day as the new episode comes out. We get it 
following season, so you are tapping into a much more stable part of the 
dema
nd curve in society, whereas, when we released House of Cards, we 
create a fervor around it as the new episode of the new show, and so think 
of it as when with content that they have used on Netflix, there is surge of 
viewing in the first couple of months 
that's quite strong. Then so, we 
allocate the cost on that basis. Whereas, when we get prior season from 
anybody else then it's not the amount of backup promotion going on about 
that show is less for the prior season, so it's a relatively stable demand and
 
that's the fundamental difference in the linear versus accelerated.

Just the question regarding social and Facebook in particular, any update 
just in terms of social sharing and how that's driving engagement currently?
 
Davi
d Wells
 
Well, we are continuing to work on it, we have got some big tests that are in 
flight now, trying to find the right balance, the right consumer model that 
people are excited about, but so far no big news to talk about.

We have
 
gotten several questions from investors asking about Carl Icahn 
and what your relationship with him is now and if you have any sense of just 
how Carl thinks about what you have done in a fairly short time of his 
investment.
 
David Wells
 
Well, he says he li
kes people that make him money. So he is happy with me 
for now. But I would have to refer you to him in terms of how he feels about 
the investment.

Just a question on pricing. Reed, you make it pretty clear in the letter tha
t 
the $7.99 price point is working well in terms of members and contribution 
margin growth. How do you think about that potential to change further out?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well we are always looking at ideas and thinking about it, but we are not on 
the edge of 
doing something. So the $7.99 is working for us very well. We 
will continue to monitor the trends. We have got many markets around the 
world. So we are able to potentially look at some different avenues. We did 
do a price increase in Brazil that was necess
ary relative to inflation and it is 
something we can look at if we have to. But right now the $7.99 is working 
great for us.

And when you look at international markets, we have got a couple of 
questions that both point to in terms of
 
what you are looking for now? I 
mean obviously you chose to go into some relatively smaller markets. But 
what are the key things now as you go forward that you are looking for in 
terms of which markets to launch and will we see kind of groups of markets 
l
ike Scandinavia and Latin America or should we expect more targeted 
individual countries going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Ted, do you want to take that one?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
In how we are looking at? We are looking mostly at markets that have all 
those characteris
tics that we have looked for from the beginning. Really 
active online consumers, sophisticated payments structures that we can tap 
into. So well established e
-
commerce behavior and a good healthy appetite 
for Western content. I think our programming has be
en, like I said, so for 
has been really successful wherever we go. So we are looking for markets 
where that programming will travel incredibly well and continue on that 
path.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, you guys are almost set here.

We have 
one more. Well, at least I have one more question, and Doug has 
one more as well. But the one question that everyone wants to know from 
Ted and this is very important. Something that Ted is really excited about. 
Breaking Bad, when are we going to see the f
inal season of Breaking Bad on 
Netflix?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It has a DVD cycle that we need to honor with Sony who puts that through. 
So I don't have the date in front of me but it's going to be open in few 
months
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG
 
Before the end of the 
year or probably after the end of the year?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
After the end of the year.

7/16/15,Netflix,"Welcome to the Q2 2016 Netflix Earnings Call.
 
I am David Wells, CFO. I am joined today on the company side by our CEO, 
Reed Hastings and dialing in remotely are Chief Content Officer, Ted 
Sarandos.
 
Interviewing us today will be Ben Swinburne from 
Morgan Stanley and Scott 
Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus. And I think Ben, you have the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Yes, thank you. Reed, I am sure we're going to spend a lot of time on the 
quarter and the long
-
term 
outlook, but I wondering if you could just give us 
a sense what gives you confidence that the churn the shortfall in the quarter 
was really driven by confusion among members around the price increases 
or the un
-
grandfathering versus other factors for examp
le content, or 
competition and any color you might have on voluntary versus non
-

happened versus your expectations.
 
Reed Hastings
 


you asked a question why are we confident at this explanation. Well, the 
obvious explanations other than this are competition, which we're pretty 
confident is not a factor because we got this slight uptick in churn in multiple 
countries 


separate set, Crave and Shomi that operate in Canada.
 

n again if it 
was saturation, what we would be seeing is hit to gross ads more than we 
would in terms of churn.
 
So, other possible explanations were that we did something on our service, 


coincident with that Google trend data we included really indicates that 

 



what makes us feel very strong and positive about the long
-
term and that 
this is a short term phenomenon.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And David just as a follow
-
up, when you put the third quarter guidance 
together, are you assuming that this churn thro
ughout the entire base 
remains elevated or have you seen that initial April churn subside and really 

--
 
on the actual un
-
grandfathering, which you talk about in the letter being in line with 
expectations?
 
D
avid Wells
 



assuming that pe
rsists into Q3 and maybe into Q4 as we continue to un
-
grandfather.
 
And just a cautionary, the usual customary language I realize I sort of went 
straight to your question, but we will be making forward
-
looking statements 
in this call and actual results may 
vary, but we'll go back to our regular 
questions.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thanks. This is Scott Devitt. Reed, just wondering if the effects of the un
-
grandfathering have any longer term ramifications in terms of how you think 
of pricing power on the platform globally
?
 
Reed Hastings
 

fundamental driver of value for subscribers, how much they watch, how 

improve and again with new m

prices to our 8, 10 and 12 last October and we've had a couple of quarters of 
great growth on the gross add side.
 
So I think this is really around change resistance, whatever the price is for 
something people don

is most of what drives growth, the new pricing is working great.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And in terms of, for David, in terms of the timing the links that you provided 
to Google Trends, I think the uptick starte
d the week of April 3,
 
so as the 3rd 
for the '16 that pre
-
dated when you gave earnings last quarter, what was 
the response? Was it immediate in terms of the uptick in inquiry volume and 
interest or was it somewhat delayed.
 
David Wells
 

ind Ben or Scott that the 
--
 
what we're talking about is a 
very small change, right, but because of the large base a small change can 
result in 300,000 subscribers, which is the miss that we had on domestic 

gh in the past not to 
overreact to immediate trend changes.
 
So it was a swing factor when we were discussing Q2 and into Q3 even and 
trying to shift through what might affect us in the quarter. We saw a little bit 
of it, but it was very right before we set
 
earnings and we were on this call 
three months ago.
 
And so we felt it was a small factor, but it did persist through the quarter 

-
on
-
year growth and also 
the lower growth versus expectations.
 
Scott Devit
t
 
And just sticking on the theme for around churn with another question, 
David, what are you seeing with the un
-
grandfathering members as they 
face different pricing options? I know you tested a lot over the last couple of 
months, what are you seeing in 
terms of their choices and how does that 
impact your ARPU expectation and when should we 
--
 
when will the 
grandfathering process be finished in the U.S.? Is that something in the 
fourth quarter, any help there would be great.
 
David Wells
 
Yeah. It finishes 
in the fourth quarter. So it finishes about mid way through, 
toward the end of November and then in terms of their choices especially 

as we expected.
 
So we continue to see folks cho
ose the lower plan and some smaller 
increments in the higher plan and some increments. So, our expectations of 
ASP growth are still there about consistent.
 

grandfathering choice, t

continues to persist.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And does any of your data suggest you're seeing anything interesting around 
members that were inactive or may be membership sharing as a result of 
the pricing changes?
 
R
eed Hastings
 
No, on both counts, so.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Okay.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And this question may have been addressed in the letter given that you gave 
un
-
grandfathering commentary around international as well, but would be 
interested if you could just talk thro
ugh your expectations for existing 
markets versus new markets and where you beat and missed?
 
David Wells
 

--
 
the trend was across multiple markets 
and as we put in the letter, it was in markets that are more highly 
penet

sort of pricing talk that was affected, but in addition to that, we would say 
that our newer markets have an expectation of multiyear growth.
 

for us and then we hit a point 


seen that in the past for some markets pick up and then moderate and then 
pick
 

 

America to build that market to where it is, has taken us four or five years at 
this point to get it there.
 
Scott 
Devitt
 
And Reed you 
-
 
I am sorry.
 
Reed Hastings
 

significantly different from early Latin America. It paints a pretty similar 
picture at least for these first six months.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And Reed
 
you reiterated the $60 million to $90 million in the U.S. We would 
be interested if you could add some color in terms of where you think the 
friction points are if its content portfolio, competition or those being the two 
most significant where you see so
urces of friction and what gives you 
confidence still in that range?
 
Reed Hastings
 

Everyone is using Internet video and Internet television more and more. You 
see the rise of the
se virtual MVPDs. All of these things are building out the 


competition.
 

 
but think about 
entertainment and pay television are pretty ubiquitous. So in the Internet 


-
term in 
this market.
 
Scott Devitt
 
I want to just ask a little bit more about the guidance David, last quarter you 
called out the comp versus Australia, which was I think a bigger one or a 
tougher one than we all understood, when you look at third quarter I think 
you have Japa
n and then fourth quarter Southern Europe, could you just 
maybe put those at least in relative context versus Q2, so we can think 
about what those headwinds may or may not look like?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. There is always a headwind when we've had a prior 
launch of a large 
market or a market like Australia where we saw strong initial uptake. In 

-
up demand that then sort 
of reverts to a more normal pattern over time.
 
That can take several quarters, it can tak

different experiences by market. So I would say Japan was a pent
-
up market 
in some respects and then starts to moderate, so that does factor into the 
comp.
 
And some of our other markets maybe experiencing flat or even down year 
o

that have decelerated then pickup again and accelerate.
 
So collectively across all of our basket of investments in markets, we think 
there is a large long
-
term opportunity that 


that will take time to get there.
 
Scott Devitt
 


t into your guidance, you mentioned gross 

let you comment if you choose, are you assuming that impact the gross adds 
and if so, is it a U.S. phenomenon or a global phenomenon i
n the third 
quarter?
 
David Wells
 
It would be global and so back 
--
 

you can say roughly in line year
-
on
-
year and so with an assumption of a hit 
from the Olympics, which largely affects us in the past on gross adds
 
where 

-
over
-
year trend. We expect that to be a meaningful small, but still meaningful 
impact on the quarter, negative impact.
 
Ben Swinburne
 

al with Comcast and was 
without a timeline. I was wondering if you could give any clarity in terms of 
timing and then more broadly how you think about MVPD in the U.S. as a 
driver of subscribers in the way that years ago getting on to consoles and 
other de
vices actually led to an acceleration in growth?
 
Reed Hastings
 

second half of this year. So it will be between now and the end of the year 

egration points very smooth and 
the Comcast engineers are doing great work on it. So look for it later this 
year.
 


hou
seholds, Comcast households now have a Smart TV or have a Roku, but 
it will certainly help and from a user perspective to just live on the Comcast 
remote and to be able to stay on that input as opposed to having the switch 
inputs is a great thing for them 

pleased with. So all of those is one more positive force for us coming later 
this year.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And then secondly maybe for Reed or Ted, the Disney deal is coming soon 
with content supposedly launching in Se
ptember, how much of a factor is 
that in guidance; how significant do you think that content launches from 
Disney will be for the business?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well keep in mind they're U.S.
-
only, the deal and those films are I think 
they're very important for wa
tching and distinguishing Netflix as a different 
destination for parents because we'll have all the Disney movies, all the 
Lucas Movies, all the Pixar Movies and which distinguishes us separately, but 

movies is there about 10 

we do expect it to drive a lot of customer joy.
 
Reed Hastings
 

for example that are
 
coming on to Stars this summer. Those will stay with 
Stars for the 18
-
month window. So it will build up over the first 12 to 18 
months.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
When we think about the next 12 to 18 months or 24 months for the 
company, it would seem that the Olympic
s as well as the un
-
grandfathering 
are to some extent onetime events. And so as we think about 2017, I know 

sense to assume that churn, the churn impact from the stuff rolls off 
and 
maybe the churn continues to decline the way it has been organically over 
the last several years across the service, certainly at least if you're 
successful around the original programming.
 
I just want to give you opportunity to talk about what the bus
iness looks like 
as you come out of this multiple headwind period here over the next couple 
of quarters.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well let's see, in the individual market we would expect it to be as you said, 
we would expect it to return to its normal patterns and it
 
continue to 
improve, as we expand throughout Asia and Central Eastern Europe, the 
overall global may be a different number because those as new territories 
will be more high churn, but fundamentally I think your analysis is right, 
which is there is some s
hort
-
term headwinds for this year.
 
And then looking at the broad growth of Internet television, which is 


 
So, I
 

competing against the linear hours and there are still so much linear hours 
to see that that there would be any material change competitively around 
the world.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Great, and just on the rest of world markets, you mentioned I think Poland 
and Turkey in the letter, you also mentioned being economically prudent, 

localization efforts what that even mea
ns and why the pace is what it is for 
that part of the business here over the next couple of quarters.
 
Reed Hastings
 

subtitling and some dubbing across thousands of titles. It's locali
zing the 
service the different apps and then it's doing local language marketing and 

 
The whole advantage of going broad in January was to increase our rate of 

rkey in the absence 
of any knowledge, but now we can clearly see positive trends we're starting 
with those and we'll continue to roll out improvements in other markets 
again as we see that the content is forming a great match with the society 
and continuin
g to work on that content.
 
David Wells
 
And just around out Ben, Reed, some of the factors we could do partner 
deals in certain countries, we could do local payment options and so those 
are the ones that we're referring to or depend on the economic prudence
 
like 
the size of the opportunity in those areas.
 
Scott Devitt
 

acquired content, could you talk a bit about where you feel you will be in 
2016 and whether 50
-
50 for the right next 
long term.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

conservative one, but I think the growth of those original films, series, series 
for kids, documentaries, have proven to be great investments in terms of 
their efficie
ncy relative to other high profile content that we license, which is 
encouraging us. I think it's made our rest of world launch possible by having 

 
And it certainly helps in terms of 
the complexity of global licensing. So we 

quality at the same time of doing very high volume. So, we put in the letter 

for 
Emmy Awards, 54 Emmys this year.
 


us to keep pushing.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And it will be 600 hours of new content
 
in 2016.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah, I expect that it will surpass that pretty comfortably.
 
Scott Devitt
 

can you actually put on the service before you no longer need to add 
content. The que
stion is as it relates to original specifically is that a fair way 
to think about it when trying to think through longer term content 
obligations?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah definitely. I think as we 
--
 
our appetite for licensing off net decreases 
with our appetite
 
to increase our originals volume and as long as the 
customers are happy with the transition it encourages us to being aggressive 
in that space.
 
David Wells
 

and we intend to reduce in

able to grow revenue faster than our content spend internationally, but we 
would like to do both.
 
The advantage of our global distribution platform to the extent that we can 
find content that appeals broadly
, there is an advantage and scale there in 
terms of distributing it. So we would love to continue to expand that content 
spend and also to drive some to profit as we go. We think we can do both.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And I would just add real quick, one of the mos
t positive developments from 
our original programming has been today an original show from Netflix can 
be just as attractive as a show from any network in the United States, when 
licensing for territories around the world.
 

oing licensing first window for some titles 

that when we're launching our new original series, there is a huge appetite 
for them around the world.
 
David Wells
 
And Scott I think it so
mewhat depends when you ask how much content is 
enough and whether you think of it as trying to attract a 100 million 

billion members like Facebook or YouTube are at today on the Int
ernet.
 
So it just depends upon the size of your aspirations and as we accomplish 

continuing to grow essentially forever.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Reed just going back to Internet TV as a 
segment and some of the initiatives 
there, how do you think about what we 
--
 
really think this new Hulu product 

fairly robust on
-
demand offering, how do you think that impacts y
our 

 
Reed Hastings
 

--
 


penetration among Sling
 
TV users is quite high. So think of that as cable 
getting better MVPD getting better and Hulu is a potential example of that, if 
the reports are correct.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And Ted when you think about your relationship with the owners of Hulu, 
particularly Dis
ney who is a critical supplier of yours globally, are you 

to Hulu versus Netflix?
 
We noticed Disney did a deal for some kids programming during the second 
quarter and FOX has alre
ady made some pretty big shifts towards Hulu from 
an SVOD perspective. How do you feel about your relationship with those 
companies in the context of this Hulu launch?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well the relationship remain very strong. We continue to do business with 
e
very studio, every network in every territory. They're in the business of 

--
 

that they would sell it for less to Hulu than they would to us because they 
have participation problems w
ith the talent that they have to work through.
 

position and buy everybody out for everything that would meaningfully 

ent that 

--
 
that it will be business as usual with the networks and 
studios.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thank you. Ted, in terms of local originals understanding that every market 
will be different, can you talk a bit in terms of us trying to understand l
onger 
term profitability in international markets, how you think about local 
originals as a portion of the mix if you can take a few examples or paint a 
broader brush throughout the international platform?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

of our international original life 
programming. We launched Marceau. We've launched original shows in 
Japan. We've launched in Mexico and we currently have productions going 
on in Germany, Spain, Italy, Korea, Japan, France, Brazil, Cambodia.
 
So we are pro
ducing around the world original programming and it really has 
an outsized impact in those first couple of shows because I think it does 

infrastructure, we're investing in their culture and 
taken, most importantly 
taking those shows and distributing them around the world.
 
So when we released a show like Ebana in Japan, people are watching Ebana 
all around the world at the exact same time, which makes us a very 
important part of the entertainm
ent landscape in those countries and 
ultimately to those consumers as well.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And David you seen to have changed the language in terms of the 40% 
contribution margin by 2020 and adding possibly earlier as well, I know the 
trends over the interme
diate term past have been trending better, can you 
just add some color to that comment?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think it's just acknowledging that, like you just articulated that we 
were running ahead on that. So, we have to acknowledge reality that we 
may get
 
there sooner than we 
--
 
then we initially targeted. I think for us 
broadening it back from just a quarterly performance of that progression 
towards U.S. contribution margin is the right amount to reinvest in the 
business.
 
We know that we want to drive eff
iciency. So we want some discipline there 

the right amount of reinvestment in the business to maintain 
competitiveness both domestically and abroad.
 
And I think the U.S. business, 
I mention this in the past that to the extent 

markets we're in more and more markets the U.S. P&L does receive some of 
that relief because there is a smaller share of that allocation g
oing to the 
U.S. then there was before.
 
So some of those that was at play, that was in the past my team reminds 
me and nowadays the profit growth of the U.S. is being driven just by 
growing revenue faster than content, but I think those two things were at 
play in the last four to six quarters as we look at the trends. Thanks.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Ted, just want to ask you to comment a little further on the market for 
acquired programming. I think there is a concern in the marketplace that its 
getting increasing co
mpetitive and expensive and I would love to hear how 
you see the market today, especially versus your expectations or your 

exclusive.
 
And maybe you can comment on the Amazon PBS
 
deal as well as your own 
agreement with the CW of the StarTrek announcement today and also the 
Chuck Lorre announcement from a few weeks ago.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Right, you covered a lot of ground there. So I may try to address some of 
them. As for the CW, 
the CW is a real anomaly in terms of a network. They 
happen to produce programming that has very consisted sensibility and a 
very consistent band base and that fits very nicely with a big viewing 
demographic and efforts.
 

 
them. We opted to re
-
up that 

-

individually licensed many of those shows for global distribution.
 
And we're thrilled to do that and not only to re
-
up our business, but also to 
move u
p the availability date of those shows to just eight days after their 
last episode airs versus having to wait until just before the new season 
launches.
 
So the fans of the CW programming are going to love that development. 
Then as far as the PBS Amazon, I 
would say we have so aggressively 
improved and expanded our original kids programming. In fact we have 35 
different original kids programming, kids shows on Netflix, now many more 
in production in various forms of development.
 
So, more and more of that pro
gramming is leaning to our exclusive global 
programming and our regional programming in place of massive loads of 
content from other sources.
 
So our appetite for that meaning our appetite for high prices has gone down 
quite a bit and what else did I miss t
here? Star Trek, so Star Trek is an 

U.S.
 
But this is one of those overhangs of regional licensing is that CBS was not 
making the U.S. available and we wanted to make sure that we c
ould bring 

to premier the new Star Trek series all over the world outside of North 
America.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Great. And I just want to may be pick up on the content, go ahead.
 
Ted Sara
ndos
 

think it still holds true. You should think about content cost like player 
personnel cost. At any given season, a super star goes free agent and that 

oes to the roof, but player personnel cost, they 

 

price for that goes up, but the overall spend you have baked into our 
business model.
 
B
en Swinburne
 
Got it, and just following up on margins, David if you look at the 
international markets, which I realize is a portfolio, do you have a good 
sense for how much local programming you need in a given international 
market?
 
I realize there is a ra
nge and does that percentage impact the profitability of 
those markets long term? In other words if you need in a market like 
Germany half the content just to make something up needs to be German, 
does that mean that market is structurally lower margin and
 
say the U.S. 
market or your broader portfolio or is it still too early to figure those things 
out?
 
David Wells
 

one given market is the competitiveness and that can manifes
t itself in the 
competitiveness for content bidding. It can manifest itself for 


entertainment.
 


80/20 model today and very disparate non
-
English markets in Chile, in 
Finland, in Netherlands and so we do have markets, early markets like Japan 
that are tilted a little bit more towards local content, b

margin characteristics are going to be necessarily determined by the percent 
of local as how competitive the market is.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Thank you. Reed, time spent on the platform is such an important metric. I 
was wondering if you could
 
update us just on time spent per user to the 

 
And then secondly, Sandvine, in their reports peak traffic showed a downtick 
and Netflix are still dominant, but little bit lower relative
 
to peers in terms of 
the domination even from a compression technology during that period, can 
you just talk a little bit about how much of an effect that could have had on 
a metric like that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure, I think on the Sandvine, which covers Nort
h America it might have 
been like 35% to 33% something like that, which would correlate very well 
with what we think was the increase in coding efficiency. So think of that as 
a flat result as opposed to a down result and then what was the first 
question?
 
Ben Swinburne
 


 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. Viewing overall is pretty seasonal. So you have to look at it on a year
-
over
-
year basis. But on
 
a year
-
over
-
year basis, total viewing which is the 
fact that we sometimes releases up, forget you have the good numbers, but 
think of it as we were I think it was 13 million a quarter ago and it was 
maybe 10 million a year ago.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes 
Scott. Sorry Reed, you did release those numbers at CES in January. So 

to.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Total viewings continue to grow.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Okay. And then secondly...
 
Reed Hastings
 
On
 
a year
-
over
-
year basis.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Great, download functionality which is a hot topic, some competitors have 
taken that on. You historically have suggested not interested and it seems 

our 
interest there and then also cost implications in terms of contractual 
obligations.
 
Reed Hastings
 


bei

look at it and there is no material cost implications.
 
As you know some of our competitors in different markets in Germany, in 
the U.S. and others include a local cashing capability. So 

standard part of most deals.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Question for David, just turning to the financials, that your remember 
growth fell short this quarter as you guys acknowledged in the letter, but 

hanged.
 
If you think you expect substantial profits or material profits excuse me in 
2017. Could you talk a little bit about the cash flow burn, cash burn outlook 
'16 and '17 David and any comment around P&L expense versus cash now 
that the top line at lea
st seems to be growing a little more slowly than we all 
expected?
 
David Wells
 
Well cash flow despite all the perturbations of content coming in and out and 
the uncertainty around when that content might time has been relatively 
steady at about $0.25 millio
n a quarter.
 
So I would say there has been no change from my understanding and 

and we expect that again going forward.
 
So free cash flow will improve when we drive more profit 
and start 
organically funding more of our content investment and in terms of the ratio 


 
Ben Swinburne
 
Any color on the sequ
ential increase on contract 
--
 
contractual obligations, I 
think it was 13.2 at the end of the quarter, how do you think about that 
number again given the context of a slowing little bit of lower top line, any 
thought?
 
David Wells
 
Well, content is one of th

quarter, you invest several years or years. So, I think what you're seeing is 
our investment in rest of world, the rest of world launch and the growth of 
additional territories.
 

investment in some of our younger territories 

our territories that are more highly penetrated or have been operating for 
more years, but just like Reed was saying that the offline vi
ewing or the 


 

that bands an
d is consistent with prior trends and prior territory launches.
 
Reed Hastings
 

this a long time. We've had these short quarters before. Nine years ago in 
2007 we actually went down in 
subscriber. So, this quarter we're growing, 
but not as much as we want, but in 2007 we went down from 6.8 million to 
6.7 million in this Q2, which is a generally seasonally tight quarter for us.
 

ver $80 million. 
So, you just got to take a long term perspective and Internet TV is going to 
be an enormous market. We're very confident of that and our competitive 
position is very strong so those are the two fundamental things that give us 
confidence in
 
the long term and want to us to continue to invest in more 
content.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Thank you.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Any update David on the chip card transition to the extent there is still any 
remnant that you may have seen in the quarter from that?
 
David 
Wells
 

--
 
it was back then that was 
--
 
became 
outsized because we pointed to it as one of the explanatory reasons that we 
had an involved churn uptick, but I would say it continues to be a small 
background issue.
 
Scott 
Devitt
 

shared publically, but in terms of the product portfolio today and global 
rights that you have if you think of it may be relative to your spend, what 
portion of the portfo
lio has global rights associated with it and then 
secondly, as it relates to global rights, how are the allocations done between 
markets?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
So the allocations are done by media market share models and you should 
think about our global allocation
s as all of regional programming is fully 
global. Several, but we haven't broken out an exact percentage of our off
-
net licensees that we do on a global basis.
 
And then there is individual libraries from each of them, from each 
--
 
from 
around the world tha
t we have global rights for of the lot of content that you 
may never have heard of, but actually get healthy niches of watching all 
over the world as well.
 
Scott Devitt
 

Netflix like so

as global to where we currently operate.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And with the exception of our 
--
 
on the original side, which today it is always 
included China.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Thanks. Yes, talk a little 
bit about how the Asian market rollouts have gone 
so far relative to your expectations and whether you're thinking about may 
be different price tiers or still sticking to the global price point as you look at 
the results there.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yeah, we though
t about it and after launch and debated, do we want to try 
to be a low cost service like a $2 service or should we try to add content to 


ng to invest to build a great $10 
service.
 
We look at the iPhone 6s globally. We look at some other high value 
products and we want to be an incredible content service at this $10 price 
point rather than be very much lower cost or even free service and so 

what we're focused on as our current model.
 
David Wells
 
And then we already do have some price choices in our tiring. So, we do use 
the entry level tier as a mechanism for those folks that might be more value 
oriented. So, we do have some ability th
ere to separate across price in terms 
of capturing those subscribers that might be more value oriented.
 
Ben Swinburne
 

while, can you talk about the Latin American market and whether th
at 
continues to be strong and how you might think something like the second 
season of Narcos might results there.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, go ahead.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes Latin America has continued to grow well for us and what's been 
fascinating is the growth has be
en pretty steady even in Brazil where we see 
a significant recession and a difficult government situation.
 
So it seems that neither of those factors really affects a value
-
oriented 

see 
great viewing throughout Latin America and throughout the world, but 
similar to our other originals.
 
Reed Hastings
 

think we're very excited about the prospects of global television
. We also 

of Club de Cuervos in production.
 


irst few 
months of the Latin American market, trying to figure out what those people 
in each of those countries love to watch and creating a service that is worth 
every penny of the subscription fees.
 
Scott Devitt
 

--
 
both asked ques
tions around cost structure and 
other components of the international business, I guess to try and gain 
understanding of longer term profitability, understanding differences in ARPU 
and content cost by country and local originals and things of that nature,
 
is 

contribution margins that are similar to the U.S. over time?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think each market will be different when you roll them up. I think 
structurally we can still get to 

demonstrated a Canadian proof point as well. It depends on whether you 
include them in that 
--
 
in that international bucket or not, but we do think 
that we can see across the system a variety, but if you average across 
it, we 

seen today.
 
We may penetrate into deeper into markets that have much lower ARPUs 

market do 
we want to address at that price point? Is that the bigger pie from 
a revenue profit perspective or we want to experiment down in the price to 
broaden the market and go after a bigger market at maybe a lower margin. 

latter case.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then second question again for David and apologies if this was answered 
earlier but in terms of the un
-
grandfathering process, so where are you in 
the U.S. and then where are you in the international markets that you 
named in 
terms of customers that are going through that process having 
seen it at this point?
 
David Wells
 

through and that will play out 
--
 
continue to play out over Q3 and into early 
Q4.
 
Sco
tt Devitt
 

 
David Wells
 
Correct. Now a point worth making here is that our international markets 

--
 
disproportionately more subscribers 
that are newer and already at
 
the higher price points than the U.S. does, 

 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
Scott Devitt
 
I just want to ask about Europe, especially the content yo

of these markets now for a couple of years, but I think they have been slow 
for either of you or all of you, what do you think you need to do in 
Continental Europe and Southern Europe to accelerate that growth and how 
much of it is conte
nt versus some of the payment stuff or anything else you 

 
David Wells
 
Well let's see, just to remind you in Spain and Italy, we only launched it last 

had 
really nice success in all of those markets with continued strong growth 

which will be the closest proxies in terms of wealthy markets with high pay
-
TV penetration.
 
So big competit

in those markets. Payments are not an issue. So we feel very positive about 
those markets.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thank you.
 
Ben Swinburne
 

e 
of friction in some earlier international launch markets, can you talk about 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes around the world eCommerce is unequally well developed. So in some 
markets there is 
very strong eCommerce payment platforms like the 

today we only accept international credit cards.
 
So we'll develop really along eCommerce in that whole ecosystem as people 
want pay fo
r things online and that may come through mobile payments like 
Android and iOS, it will come along with third
-
party payment systems, but 
again the general economy and people are moving online through mobile 

we are taking advantage 
of that.
 
So in the long
-

want to be able to purchase many things including Netflix.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Thank you.
 
David Wells
 
So thank you both and thank you to all of our i
nvestors. We apologize for 


growing the business. Thank you very much.

you think those are having such an impact on gross adds today and any 
particular color o
n markets that might surprise us about where those 
originals are really driving the business?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. If you look over the whole year we've generated 12 million net adds 
this year. Last year we generated 12 million net adds. So there's been 
rem
arkable steadiness measured over the three
-
quarter period. But if you 
look at any single quarter, were high, were low and I think what's happening 
is that when we have some big originals it indefinitely grows the business, 
but some of that is a pull forwar
d from the natural underlying growth rate.
 
And so, like if in hindsight if we look back in Q1 we over interpreted that. In 
Q2 that we over interpreted a low, but it is actually quite steady over the 
midterm which is basically a fundamental organic growth o
f this on
-
demand 
Internet television. So think of it as it can affect the quarter a lot, it affects 
the year only a little that is as the total programming is better.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Yes, and you mentioned that the churn I think globally was roughly in line 
with your expectations as you moved through the quarter. As we just think 
about the longer
-
term particularly next year there's probably some logic to 
say that your net adds could improve next year overall given you are not 
going to have this elevated, so h
ow do you think about the impact of churn 
as we move into 2017 and do you have any expectations for price increases 
at this point?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we definitely want to increase net adds, but when I look over the last 
three or four years at how steady 
they've been, how hard they've been to 
move up and similarly that they've been very steady, we're only probably 
going to be able to make a little progress on increasing year
-
over
-
year net 
adds next year. So, we're fundamentally in this growth cycle that's 
to do 
with the Internet, smart TV, people getting used to on
-
demand, all of those 
aspects. So we're continuing to make progress. I wouldn't get to the micro 
variables about this churn or that churn or this show. It's much more of a 
deep force that's changi
ng the market as more and more people are getting 
used to Internet television.
 
David Wells
 
Yes Ben, if I might add, it's probably useful to talk about U.S. and 
international a little bit differently. The U.S. is a much older market in terms 
of our ability 
to improve that product and have more time. We've kind of 
settled into a rate of churn that's lower than some of our international 
markets. They get there over time, but I would say and this in terms of that 
conversation, we think that there's room left to
 
improve the U.S. as we is 
that sort of un
-
grandfathering effect fades out over time. But outside the 
U.S. we will definitely have more opportunity to improve churn turnover time 
as we improved these products outside the U.S.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And not to do my
 
Lester Holt impression, but Reed to make you answer the 
question, do you have any expectation for price increases at this point that 
you could talk about?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, we have no plans on price increases outside of an inflation adjustment 
that we do 
in Brazil on an annual which is the law there.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Okay, thank you.
 
David Wells
 
Then to just followup on another part of Ben's question which was 
international over performance which markets actually ever performed to 
the extent that you can iden
tify specific markets or even that it was some of 
the older markets that were over performing relative to new or otherwise.
 
Reed Hastings
 
For competitive reasons we're really not going to break out per country 
markets and results. I would say we're having 
broad success around 
international. We're continuing to make those investments. We've got a lot 
of room to go to improve the service. We mentioned the letter that we've 
only just now localized Poland and Turkey. That brings us up to 22 
languages. YouTube i
s at 50. So we've got a long way to go in that 
localization effort.
 
David Wells
 
I'll just add on quick, the one of the really encouraging points was our big 
series that we had going on in the quarter, Luke Cage, Stranger Things, The 
Get Down, Narcos of cou
rse. The great thing is they performed 

hoped. Scott and Ben I would say it wasn't any one market, it's okay to talk 
about the fact that it was a very broad
-
based performance acros
s multiple 
international markets so very broad.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And then secondly, the quarterly volatility in the stock and the performance 
relative to your visibility three months out domestically and internationally, 
it certainly does seem to accelerate t
he growing process for folks like me 
that watch the business on a quarterly basis. And I was just wondering to 
the extent that Reed you just mentioned that the visibility into the business 
and the linearity and progression of subscriber growth on an annual
 
basis 
seems to be more predictable. Is there any thought in terms of providing 
annual guidance as it relates to subscriber growth instead of quarterly 
guidance?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'm not particularly, I think we can all see that it's time for me to 
apologize 
for the volatility again, this time it's in a good direction, but I think more and 
more investors are able to look at the multiyear picture and they see the 
patterns emerging and so then it will be less and less about our guidance.
 
I think the ma
in thing about one year guidance is we probably don't have 
any more insights than investors do, whereas in the current quarter when 
we're two or three weeks into it we do have a little bit of an advantage, so 
that's why we do the current quarter guidance.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Let me ask you Reed, or David about the X1 integration. Brian demoed it 
recently at a conference. It looks quite elegant. Do you expect this to be a 
meaningful contributor in the fourth quarter when you look at your domestic 
net adds and mayb
e stepping back Reed do you think these partnerships 
play a larger role over time in driving your business than they have may be 
historically?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes we sure hope so. I mean, it is rolling out this quarter. It's a really nice 
integration. Comcas
t users tend to be pretty advanced high income 
households, so many of them already have Netflix. But having it integrated 
to X1 will make it easier to use. Our increase is the word
-
of
-
mouth and all of 
these MVPD integrations they help just like being integ
rated in smart 
televisions. So think of it as the more devices we're in the easier it is to use, 
but there's no step function here because again most of those homes 
probably have Netflix already.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And do you have any concerns at all that the c
onsumer who accesses it 
through the X1 is not as deep in the Netflix universe from an experience 
perspective as they might be using it in the smart TV or an app because 
they are sort of navigating through the XFINITY guide that you, how do you 
get comforta
ble that that wasn't going to be a negative, net negative, we 
felt like it was offset by other positives?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, there are definitely concerns like that and on the same side and MVPD 
has concerns about putting on Netflix. You know they'll buil
d more Netflix 
awareness and we have concerns that the UI, but ultimately where we get 
together is let's try to learn together what the customer really wants. And if 
we're thoughtful with each other and we're focused on the customer 
together, we're both go
ing to be able to prosper. And then on the X1 
specifically, when you click on say it's in the guide to the show it brings you 
into the Netflix user interface for showing you the show and then the post 
play kicks in where you've got the different followup s
hows that you could 
watch on Netflix.
 
David Wells
 
And Scott and Ben we have other partners that we've launched with Virgin 
and others that we've gotten sort of an early preview in terms of how the 
consumer interacts with the application and as long as we'r
e able to continue 
to improve the attractiveness and the compellingness of the content and the 
experience of Netflix we feel like we're 

 
it's a good partnership.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And the X1 is the most powerful CPU box we've ever seen in the MVPD space 
and s
o the percentage of streams that are HD and the UI is really 
spectacular. It's the best that we've ever seen.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Reed you mentioned no plans for pricing increasing in the near term, now 
that you've gone through the un
-
grandfathering which has cre
ated a level of 
consistency and pricing across the customer base, I'm wondering how you 
think about pricing increases in the future. It seems like with where the 
product is priced in the U.S. and internationally today that there's still quite 
a bit of room
 
and just wondering philosophically how you think about acting 
on that over time?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, look we've had a great couple of years at these price points and there's 
a lot of competition entering the market. What we're focused on is just how 
do we
 
increase value to the consumer by having more spectacular shows, so 
that people watch more of Netflix. And over time, that will take care of itself, 
but we don't want to get overconfident just because we've had a good 
couple of years here.
 
David Wells
 
And
 
there's a small technical carve
-
out on Reed's answer in terms of we do 
have some territories in the world, countries of the world, changing their 
VAT or their GST laws and to the extent that we feel like that's a territory or 
a country
-
level response and 
we can pass that to the consumer, we may do 
that. It's just, we have a lot of different price points across the world at this 
point. So it's just a technical addition to Reed's answer.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then David, back to you. In terms of the commentary ab
out material 
profits, we're now closing in on 2017. You added some language in the 
shareholder letter about mature process, again, in 2017 and continuing to 
grow from there. Could you add any numbers to that in terms of what 
material profits actually means
? How we should think about that next year 
and in coming years?
 
David Wells
 
Well, we added some numbers in Q3 and in our guide for Q4, so you're 
starting to see that operating margin grow and the operating profit and 
we're growing both revenue and operatin
g margin. So you're starting to see 
that grow already, but it will grow more and more materially next year and 
forward.
 
So I think as we are able to reduce our international losses, we don't have 
another set of territories that we're launching next year. A
nd as we're able 
to grow both margin and revenue in the U.S., you're seeing that lift out, but 
we'll have more specifics to say in Q1 in terms of providing some more 
guidance on that.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Dave, let me just pick up on that since we're talking abou
t sort of the 
financial outlook. It looks like this year I think you guys are guiding to about 
$1.5 billion of free cash burn, which is higher than we were before. I mean, 
we could talk about what's driving that variance?
 
And then as you look to next 
year, $6 billion of content amortization is a 
20% growth rate year
-
on
-
year versus 50% this year. So we're seeing the 
content cost grow slow, yet if we look at content obligation, which are over a 
billion sequentially or your free cash flow guidance, I thin
k it used to be 
similar next year to this year. The gap seems to be widening between 
amortization and cash, so maybe just talk about what's driving that, if I 
have that right?
 
David Wells
 
Yes a little bit right, correct, a few points in there, but I would 
say our 
former sort of guidance for free cash flow was around a negative $1 billion, 
$1.2 billion. Now we're saying $1.5 billion for this year. It's a little 
-
it's 
uncertain next year what that number might be. But I'd be surprised if it 
grows on a quarter
ly basis. So I would say as we're able to raise operating 
income, we'll be able to fund more of that organically.
 
So we should be able to take more of that inside in terms of 
-
 
and reduce 
our free cash flow. But I want to give some level room for the scale
 
of the 
business. If we're successful and if we grow faster than we expect, then we 
could expand our content even more than what we consider we would do 
today. So there's a little bit of matching that to the scale growth of the 
business.
 
How successful we 
are, how big the business we are growing internationally. 
And I would say in terms of the commitment number that number is up to 
14.2 from the 13s before. And that has a lot to do with the expansion of our 
originals, our licensed originals and our internat
ional. So we launched the 
Rest of the World in January this year.
 
e continue to add content to all of our international markets as well, so we're 
seeing that grow. I would expect that to somewhat moderate in the 18
-
 
to 
24
-
month period as we go forward. We 
don't have another international 
launch to layer on to that. But we are expanding the business so you've got 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Ted May be you can go through it a little bit when we do t
he self
-
produced 
content like Stranger Things, all the advantages to it for the business, 
despite the increased use of cash.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, absolutely. I think when we see something like Stranger Things come 
across, there's the Simple One, which is it d
oesn't come with the studio 
markup it's attached to it. That is just purely expenses not on screen and 
the other is much, much more flexibility in terms of the rights that we have 
and the rights 

 
and how we contain to exploit and how we continue to 
mainta
in exclusivity, but we're not seeing the content against our wishes 
going to other markets in the syndication, in DVD and others.
 
And we're able to produce it at a very high
-
quality and also much more 
efficiently. So to the extent that we can do that, whil
e it does require more 
cash up front to fund the development process versus a studio who'd take 
that on, we find it's a great trade
-
off for cash.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And to reconcile back to your question, some of that was already reflected in 
our forecasting an
d in our guidance. But I would say, as we get better and 
we sort of exercise that muscle of our own production, more of that is 
reflected in our pipeline. So you're seeing that number, that 1.2 number 
float up to up to 1.5.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And Ted, there was
 
a comment in the letter where you were talking about 
your recent acquisitions like Quantico and Designated Survivor. We've talked 
about ensuring early financing. So just kind of connect David's point, are you 
talking about providing early financing to stu
dio partners in exchange for 
better windowing globally? Was that what that comment's related to that's 
impacting the free cash flow timing?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Nothing that has been done to date. It's basically just setting the table, 
there's a bunch of other dif
ferent ways that you can get involved as a 
production partner with our studio partners versus a second window buyer. 
And some of that would include securing financing rather than having the 
studios continue to pursue deficit finance models.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Go
t it. 600 hours of original content in 2016 is going through 1,000 hours in 
2017. I think David, you recently said at a conference, that you're about 1/3 
to 1/2 of the way to the 50
-
50 split between original and third
-
party 
content. Where would that 1,000 
hours put you in 2017.
 
David Wells
 
Well, it's a combination of Ted and I, so I'll pass it to Ted in a second, but I 
would say, we don't have a target. The 50 
-
 
my comment about 50% was 
more sort of grounding people towards the earlier comments that we made
 
about 20% or 30%. So I'd say we like what we see in terms of the 
engagement on our originals so we're continuing to expand them. And so 
we're going to keep growing that. We don't have a magic target there that 
we're trying to hit. It's more about continue
d expansion and that mix of our 
content, being more of originals and less of licensing, but we're still 
expanding both licensing content is still expanding. Ted, if you want to add 
to that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I will say, I would just say, to your point, the lice
nsed business, while as a 
percentage of business will shrink as an absolute number it will continue to 
grow for the next couple of years. And there isn't a magic target to David's 
point. What we want to do this, have really great compelling and 
differentia
ted programming for our members and we there through original 
programming when we do it successfully. So we just want to keep steering 
the business that way.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And do you have any targets for the original content that is produced by 
your own stu
dio in terms of the ratio that is ultimately produced by your own 
studio versus licensed originals?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
No, similarly, what we're trying not to do is get trapped in the business 
model to making creative choices, meaning that sometimes someone else
 
owns the IP, and you want to do it right by the viewer by giving them great 
things to watch, and the only way to do that is do it through a third
-
party 
licensed deal. Our financial preference of course, is to produce it through our 
studios, and when that 
opportunity will continue to present itself, we're 
going to increasingly do that as well. But we're not locking into a formula of 
how much of the programming should be self
-
produced versus third
-
party 
license.
 
David Wells
 
Exactly.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Ted, 
let's just stick with you here for a minute on the content side. Stranger 
Things and the Get Down, interesting content examples over the summer 
that got a lot of attention. I believe the Get Down was quite expensive. 
Didn't seem to get the same size audien
ce as Stranger Things, which I 
believe was less expensive and attractive economics. Why when you look at 
the Get Down, is that a good investment for you given the ticket size? And I 
think you've renewed it for a second season, what is that doing for your 
b
usiness that people might be saying oh the popular price is missing?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, it's still to come. It's the second half of the first season, so that's still 
coming up. We're excited about how it got started. Yes, it's an expensive 
piece of televis
ion, mostly because it's a very large
-
scale cinematic. The 
reason why films work around the world is that a kind of attractiveness. So 
we're still seeing how it's going to unfold for first season, and all of the 
shows land at a different level of noise in 
the press and probably depending 
on what circles you run in, whether or not your friends are talking about it. 
But we're really very excited about how the show's been performing, 
particularly in the quarter where we had four shows that turned out to be 
kin
d of big event programs for us.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And you've commented before that sort of output deals and Pay 1 deals from 
a timing perspective are suboptimal, but at the same time, you said really 
nice things about Disney's product over the years and how th
ey work on 
your platform. How is the Pay 1 deal performing versus expectations? Are 
you happy with it? I believe it is a relatively short term deals? You'd like to 
do more of over time with Disney?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, look I think it's 
-
 
we expected it to be
 
very popular content and it's 
turning out to be. So Zootopia was the first really high profile film to come 
through, and it's performing in huge numbers because it's great kids 
viewing, beyond being great movie viewing. And the Disney brand are 
different 
from any other studio can deliver that kind of tentpole kids 
programming that the family loves and as long as it continues to perform at 
those levels, we'd look to expand it with Disney. But I don't think any other 
studio really can match that output and m
atch those economics and 
therefore deliver that viewing. So we're going to still look opportunistically. 
Our films are available for that window. But really continue to put energy 
behind our original film initiative as well.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And in some count
ries, we have the Disney movie output, Australia, Canada, 
U.S., but in other countries like in the U.K. we lost the bidding to Sky about 
two years ago. So it really varies by market. We're one of the bidders and 
we hope to over time, be one of the biggest 
bidders so they choose us, but it 
really does vary by market.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Thank you.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Reed, it's been speculated in the media that downloading off
-
line viewing 
may become available on Netflix by the end of 2016. Can you provide any 
insights or
 
clarity on that speculation?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, well we said this year is we're open to it. It's something we're looking 
at. But we have nothing more specific to offer.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then secondly, password sharing in the U.S., you have plans in place 
that limit that. Just interested still in the enforcement of password sharing in 
the U.S. in terms of limiting that currently and in the future and then 
similarly with VPN networks within the international business, your views of 
that in terms of accessing
 
content outside of countries that have certain 
geographic rights?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think we've been very successful at finding technological ways of 
inhibiting the cross
-
border VPNs, which is roughly like I had mentioned, we 
didn't win the bidding fo
r the Disney movies in the U.K. so it's clearly not fair 
to rule out our U.K. subscribers to watch the Disney movies from Canada to 
the U.S. And so we found with the help of the studio, some more technology 
that enforced their rights. We tried to get globa
l rights for everything, like 
How To Get Away With Murder from ABC, because then it's available to 
everyone, which is clearly what consumers want. In terms of the 
-
 
what was 
the other question you had?
 
Scott Devitt
 
Password sharing.
 
Reed Hastings
 
No plans 
on making any changes there. Password sharing is something you 
have to learn to live with because there's so much legitimate password 
sharing, like with sharing with your spouse, with your kids. So there's no 
bright line and we're doing fine as is.
 
Ben Swi
nburne
 
Reed, just sticking with the theme of Disney, Bob Iger made some 
interesting comments a couple of weeks ago, talking about how his bountiful 
group list of brands ABC, Pixar, Marvel, may not be enough in the future and 
that distribution, figuring out
 
distribution was important. Do you have any 
reaction to that? Because it seemed to be aimed at over the top and he does 
have a relationship with Hulu, which is a potential 

 
a competitor or may be 
a bigger competitor over time, but do you have any reactio
ns to those 
comments?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, I mean they have a great strategy. They've got Hulu. They've got the 
Major League Baseball initiative and they bought some of that. And then of 
course, they've got Disney Life, which they operate in a number of countries. 
So it makes a ton of sense for
 
them to be growing on the OTT side and to 
figure that out as it does for us to do content. And I think you'll see more 
-
 
you saw CBS All Access in the last two years, really become a big focus for 
CBS. So it's just a continuation of that theme.
 
Ben Swinbu
rne
 
And Ted, just somewhat related here, I realize this is a hypothetical, but 
access to content is a big debate for Netflix. And I'm curious if you thought 
being part of a larger media company would inhibit your ability to acquire 
content from others in t
he industry who are competitors to that kind of a 
company?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Like I said in previous quarters, this kind of frenemy model has existed for 
decades in television where competing studios produce for one another 
constantly. And it's really the quest
ion I think that our suppliers want to 
make when they're making decisions around their expansion over the top is, 
can they make better returns selling to Netflix or building their own thing? 
And that's both a long
-
term and a short
-
term question and current
ly 
hypothetical.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Right, thank you.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Reed, just following up on competitor comments, Jeff Bezos recently made a 
comment that possibly Amazon video could be the fourth pillar of Amazon's 
business and I was just wondering how you thi
nk about, you have such an 
extensive lead in this global build out. How do you think about Amazon long
-
term as a competitor and Mr. Bezos' comments there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we think about it as share of screen time. And when people are doing 
other things
 
with their screens be they mobile or television screens, they're 
not doing Netflix. So Snapchat, YouTube, Facebook video, all of that is it 
takes a lot of hours, probably much more so than Amazon. But there are so 
many competitors out there for screen tim
e than we win today. Such a small 
percentage of total screen time bit moves by specific competitors are 
unlikely to have a material effect.
 
What affects us is, can we continue to win affection? And that's through 
doing all of this incredible content throug
h expanding globally, having all 
those rights be global eventually, so those are the things we're focused on.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Okay and David, you commented in the letter about going to market for 
acquiring more debt in the coming weeks. You also mentioned at 
a 
conference recently that you thought the business was under levered. You 
mentioned a 5%, I think debt to cap ratio. How do you think about debt 
longer
-
term in terms of what that looks like and how you think about it is it 
net debt
-
to
-
EBITDA or otherwise?
 
David Wells
 
Yes, my comments at the Goldman Sachs conference about a 20% debt rate 
or a long
-
term optimization and cost to capital. I don't think we're talking 
about by the end of the year, getting to a 20% leverage ratio. So just to talk 
about sort of a 
shorter term or a medium
-
term, we would be looking to raise 
as needed in terms of funding our content expansion. So we've been pretty 
clear along the year that we would go
-
to
-
market sometime this year to add 
a modest amount of debt to the balance sheet. An
d then do that on a 
recurring basis as needed to fund our content expansion.
 
So, over time though, we anticipate that we could get and would optimize 
our cost of capital up to a 20% leverage ratio. And we're talking about a 
debt to market cap at that point
, but I think we will be closer to an EBITDA 
basis as well because the business is growing and operating income and 
EBITDA.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
David, you guys recently localized your first batch of Rest of World markets. 
I believe it was Poland and Turkey and i
t sounds like it's been successful in 
driving growth in those markets. I guess the obvious question would be, why 
not move faster on localization? You've got a lot of recent Rest of World 
launches. Is that a cost benefit analysis or human bandwidth sort of
 
throttle? 
What is keeping you from moving quicker? And what's the right pace for us 
to think about 2017?
 
David Wells
 
Damn it, move faster, I think it's a quality abstract right? In terms of we 
want to make sure that we have an eye towards quality as well.
 
We had a 
couple of rough blog entries about some of our localization and subtitling in 
some markets and we pay attention to those. So we're moving as quickly as 
we can, being methodical and thoughtful about those opportunities to 
localize. And yes, we are
 
pleased with both Poland and Turkey in terms of 
those impacts.
 
It makes sense that people want to consume in their language and so it's 
not going to make sense to localize in a super small territory. But for the 
larger territories, it's going to make sens
e and then even for the medium
-
sized territories. We'll get there eventually. I think it's just a matter of 
sequencing.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And just to come back to maybe more of the short
-
term. You had talked 
earlier this year, about Australia and New Zealand b
eing a difficult comp, I 
do believe in Q2. You've called out in letter Q4 comp of Spain, Portugal, 
Italy. Is there any way to kind of put that fourth quarter comp and the 
second quarter comp in some kind of context, just maybe a thing in the 
order of magni
tude?
 
David Wells
 
Well again, back to Reed's earlier comments about for competitive reasons 
we don't talk specifics about our markets and I probably wouldn't. But I 
would say that there is a harvesting of the NAND initially when we launched 
in the market. 
It is that first launch quarter that we tend to have higher net 
additions and then that moderates over time and just sort of a run rate 
that's a little bit more normalized. We have the same thing going on that we 
highlighted in Q1 where we have Rest of Wor
ld in the first quarter of this 
year, was a large number. And when I look at Wall Street's estimates for Q1, 
they're higher I think they're not taking that into account, so we wanted to 
call that out so that folks had the benefit of anticipating that.
 
Ben 
Swinburne
 
Any other Wall Street estimates that you'd like to call out?
 
David Wells
 
Just growing operating income and just the fact that I think Q1 was a little 
high relative to our expectations.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Got you, thank you.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Ted, as you 
look at localized content and new markets how easy or difficult 
is it to find the talent in those markets to produce the content? How 
successful have you been there? And along that same topic, how do you 
think about some of these newer markets in terms of 
how much of that 
content ultimately, will need to be localized to create that S
-
curve inflection 
in some of the markets that were launched in 2016?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
So, in terms of successes to date, Club de Cuervos our first Mexican original 
was quite success
ful and we're getting ready to bring out the second season. 
Marseille for our French customers, not only successful in France but 
successful throughout Europe and got a significant amount of watching in 
the United States subtitled and dubbed in English.
 
So
 
we're continuing to push. It's not degrees of difficulty it is just a matter 
of understanding the production community and the local tastes and who's 
working and making great films in those markets in some cases and are 
anxious to make the migration to te
levision that they've been seeing 
happening in the U.S. So it's difficult in terms of not being on the ground 
they're usually. But I think we're making trade
-
offs in terms of the company 
culture to travel our folks into territory, get to know the folks in 
the markets, 
work with the best and brightest filmmakers and television creators, and 
bring their shows to the global markets through Netflix.
 
And in terms of localizing for taste, in many parts of the world, U.S. content 
or English
-
speaking content locali
zed into local languages has been 
incredibly successful. In some places where tastes run much more local like 
Japan, like India, we're certain that will take more of a local approach in 
terms of licensing and producing more local language content there as 
well. 
But I think over time that the taste will fall into line with the kind of desire to 
see the big spectacular shows that people are talking about around the world 
no matter where you are.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And maybe you can give us some color on [indiscerni
ble] Cable Girls, in 
terms of being content that may spread beyond their home market?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes absolutely, what we tried to do, we're producing, as to Reed's point, 
we're producing showing now, that are just going into production literally 
today ca
lled Dark in Germany. It is with quite a successful filmmaker whose 
films have traveled around the world. We've been in the business of buying 
though films from those filmmakers and making them travel around the 
world for years. So I think that will contin
ue with the move into multi
-
episodic series as well.
 
So we get that scale advantage of being able to take a German show that 
the German audiences will be very excited about and we know that, that will 
expand throughout Europe and that we've been really gre
at at finding 
audiences even in the U.S. in subtitles and dubs, which has been really a 
niche business for most people, but very mainstream numbers for us.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Going back to David's comment about the difficult first quarter comp 
internationally. Y
ou had 130 markets that launched at the beginning of 
2016, so it's obvious what the comp issue is. But also in your business, you 
have that initial wave, but then you have things like localized content, 
awareness and other factors that actually drive as an
 
example in the Latin 
American market that inflection that happened two to three years after the 
initial launch.
 
So as we look at 1Q 2017, and then think about the 130 new markets, how 
do we think about that initial bump relative to the potential of these 
new 
markets actually beginning to really kick in throughout the year in 2017?
 
David Wells
 
Well, as you say, they do 
-
 
one is going positive in terms of growth and one 
is negative in terms of initial launch. And what I was trying to call out 
without actuall
y providing our Q1 guidance in January was back in January 
of this year, which I tried to moderate the estimates or the expectations 
coming out of our global launch, we had a very successful launch. In Q1, we 
had a lot of demand associated with that launch
 
that started moderating into 
Q2.
 
And I think people saw the success of Q1, and really raised their numbers in 
Q2and trying to get a little bit ahead of that in the sense that we had a very 
successful launch in Q1 of this year that is going to be very diff
icult to 
replicate. Some of that was pent
-
up demand and we're not going to be able 
to do that.
 
That's not to say that many of our other markets are growing in terms of 
growth. It's just right now, in terms of what we see that large launch is 
going to overw
helm some of the growth of the other markets. So we still like 
what we're seeing in those markets. We're growing year
-
on
-
year in some 
moderate.
 
We've had very different, a wide variety of results across markets. We've 
had markets that slowed down and then 
accelerate in growth. So if you 
abstract that I think the general trend is the world is embracing Internet 
television and we're riding on a very strong kind of tailwind of technological 
change. And that is definitely intact.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thank you.
 
Ben Swi
nburne
 
David, any color on how the 2014 markets are ramping or at least France 
and Germany in particular, I think there has been some concern in the 
marketplace that France isn't going well, I think you closed an office there 
and in Germany Amazon seems to
 
be doing quite well? So can you just talk 
about how the model may or may not be working in those 2014 markets?
 
David Wells
 
Let me disconnect one thing there, in terms that we did choose to 
consolidate some of our French staff into our Amsterdam 
staff, but that had 
nothing to do with the market whether the market was growing or not. That 
had everything to do with the synergy of communication and how the teams 
are working together.
 

fically 
about our markets for competitive reasons, but you would have to take my 
earlier comment about the fact that we saw very broad sort of 
outperformance relative to expectations in this quarter or in Q3, that would 
be inclusive of those markets. So I 
think we're pleased with how things are 
going.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Great, shifting gears back to you Ted, you hired, hope I am pronouncing this 
right, Bela Bajaria from NBC recently and one of her mandates is unscripted. 
So I'm just wondering is unscripted going
 
from something that you have a 
couple of bets in, which is something more strategic for you when you think 
about 600 hours to 1,000, how much is unscripted driving growth? Is it a 
material part of the plan for next year, and why?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It is not a 
material part for next year, but I imagine it could be a growth 

 
it 
will be growing over the next several years. It's been 

 
it's an area viewing 
that people around the world in joy. The content travels well. It is efficient to 
produce. The current source
s of second window unscripted programming are 
under a great deal of pressure from the cable operators not to sell their 
content off of their own universe because many of the episodes seemed to 
be interchangeable.
 
So being able to have a good steady flow of
 
high
-
quality unscripted program 
is something we want to focus on because I think we can do it well and 
efficiently and may be elevated in a way that it would travel even more than 
it does today.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
And just if I can follow up quickly on unscrip
ted. It would seem to be not 
obvious for the on
-
demand binging consumption model. But maybe you've 
had some experience so far with some your talk stuff or your comedies that 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
The
re is certainly some benefits from the scale off of those shows, but our 
ability to producing maybe we have a lot of data and a lot of not a lot of data 
and a lot of content that gets watched and what travels and what doesn't, 
what gets repeated and what d
oesn't and it gives us a higher degree of 
confidence today than we had a couple of years ago and our ability or even 
desire to produce at the space, but it is a segmented programming.
 
We keep opening up new segments of programming, the way we did with 
talk
 
shows last year. The way we will in the first quarter with Ultimate 
BeastMaster, our first competition show. So we're pressing into some new 
areas of the business all the time to bring new, unique, elevated and 
differentiated program into our members.
 
Ben
 
Swinburne
 
Thank you.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Reed, investors get caught up a lot in the 60 million to 90 million household 
number in the U.S. and as an indicator or predictor for success in 
international markets, overtime, if you can do it in the U.S., you can do it 
internationally, and if you can't,
 
you can't. You're running a little north of 4 
million subscribers in 2016 from 5 million in 2015. How do you think about 
that business in terms of the trajectory in over say, the next 1, 3, 5 years in 
terms of how many subs that you can put on the busines
s in the U.S. on an 
annual basis?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You know we have to take it year
-
by
-
year. It depends on how well we 
execute. Do we have more Stranger Things where it breaks through and 
everyone feels like they got to get in, Luke Cage, Get Down, Narcos. We
 
have a show coming The Crown that some of our most impressive television 
I have ever seen and so I think November 4, when you ask yourself about 
60 million to 90 million, when you watch that show, it's going to seem quite 
achievable. But it's all hangs on
 
how well we execute and we're just going to 
work really hard on that front.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And following along those lines in terms of the relevance of content to drive 
subscribers given that that's why subscribers watch the shows on Netflix, on 
a P&L basis
 
anyway, the growth in content spend has begun to very much 

wondering, as we look at that in 2017 over 2016, and then 2018, 2019 and 
2020, is that something that we can expect to c
ontinue into the future? Is 
there a point in time at some level of spend at which you think you've built a 
complete enough portfolio that, that leverage actually significantly 
accelerates?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, we'll keep investing in growing the content spend
 
even domestically for 
quite a long time. We see an ability to continue to please consumers with a 
wide range of content. And so I think if you're trying to model the business 
long
-
term, you should think of content and how it's viewed and brand love 
always
 
continuing up in the U.S. and internationally for a long time. I mean, 
I'll take two more questions, one from each of you.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Great, I know we beat un
-
grandfathering to death last quarter, but if I can 
come back one more time before I sign off.
 
David, you had talked last 
quarter about elevated churn even among members that were not seeing a 
price increase. And I think this quarter you talked about churn being 
generally in line with expectations. I just want to see if you had any color on 
that pi
ece the un
-
grandfathering noise continued to elevate churn?
 
And then I'll just ask my followup. On the fourth quarter, just want to 
confirm the only un
-
grandfathering that we have left is the $1cohort is that 

 
is that accurate?
 
David Wells
 
It's accurate o
n the last one. We have some sort of older generation devices 
that are difficult to message as well, so I think that defines sort of the last 
few cohorts the people left. And then back to your sort of primarily question 
in terms of what did we see in the q
uarter relative to our expectations and 
relative to prior quarters and actuals? I would say, I mentioned earlier in the 
interview, that we still see some effect from the un
-
grandfathering. So there 
is a bit of an overhang from the price change. It's starti
ng to fade, and we 
expect that to continue to fade but we do think there's opportunity to 
improve that going forward in terms of next year.
 
Ben Swinburne
 
Thank you.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Reed, last one an open
-
ended question. You've talked a lot 
historically about 
the opportunities in Internet TV and have been very right in terms of the 
direction that the industry has gone with where you're business is now, I 
was wondering if you can just share some updated views in terms of the way 
you think the 
industry progresses over the next 5, 10, 20 years in terms of 
what wins and what loses?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well we generally think of the growth of Internet TV like the growth of the 
mobile phone, that is fixed line telephony was an amazing invention, 100 
years
 
of development and brought incredible benefits to society and the 
same thing is true with linear TV. It's been an amazing innovation, but the 
age of linear is starting to fade and it's going to be replaced by Internet. And 
those firms like the BBC or CBS,
 
that's doing all access that's invest heavily, 
I think will move into the future on Internet consumption. I think you'll see 
Internet growth generally more broadband kind of fiber optic to every village 
and town.
 
Those general trend lines, the growth both
 
of YouTube
-
type advertising 
supported services, Facebook video, Snapchat. So you're just going to see 
these new scenarios everywhere. And eventually, movies and TV shows will 
be global, ubiquitous, some amazing budgets. So I think you have to think 
big ab
out the future. We're closing in on 100 million members, but I remind 
everyone at Netflix that Facebook and YouTube have 1 billion daily actives. 
And so, in many parts, we are just so small compared to those other 
Internet video firms and we have a lot of 
catch
-
up to do and that's again 
investing in our content and making it globally interesting and compelling 
which we're working on.
 
So there's a lot out there. But we only just have to take it year by year, and 
it's tremendous fun inventing the future.

1/21/15,Netflix,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2020 Earnings Interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
Co
-
CEOs, Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos; COO, Greg Peters; and CFO, 
Spence Neumann. Our 
interviewer this quarter is Kannan Venkateshwar 
from Barclays Capital.
 
As a reminder, we'll be making forward
-
looking statements and actual 
results may vary. Now let me turn it over to Kannan for his first question.
 
Question

Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Thank you, Spencer, and you nailed my last name. So congratulations for 
that.
 
Spencer Wang
 
I practiced.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
So thanks for having me here. And I guess the best place to start here is 
Ted and Greg, congratulations on your 
new role; and Reed, you too, I guess 
you can relax a little bit more. So maybe we could just start off with your 
priorities, Ted, and maybe followed by Greg, just in terms of how you see 
the world evolving, what your priorities are. And of course, we are i
n the 
middle of a lot of change, so how you see the world. So maybe you could 
just start there.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, we should start by saying that the chances that Reed's going to relax a 
little more are very low, whereas I'm just 
--
 
everyone should kn
ow that 
Reed and I have worked together for more than 20 years. He's been an 
unbelievable role model and source of inspiration for me. We've navigated 
some of the toughest decisions the company has made over those years, 
from mailing DVDs around the U.S. t
o streaming around the world. And my 
focus is to continue the successful train we've been on for the next 200 
million subs around the world. And Greg, I'm thrilled to throw it over to you.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Thank you, Ted. From my perspective, when I think ab
out what our future is 
and I think it's just a tremendous next stage of growth that we will see 
mostly coming from outside the United States. So think of more and more 
employees outside the United States, more productions, more operations 
happening outside
 
the U.S. and hopefully, many, many more members 
outside the U.S. This is an opportunity to lean in just a little bit more, be 
proactive and drive a little bit more alignment across those activities where 
we think alignment will benefit the business and pu
sh the optimization of 
those activities a little bit more.
 
And Kannan, you might not know, but many years ago now it feels, I was 
able to spend a couple of years in Japan, launching the service there. And I 
got a chance to work with the local teams that we
 
were hiring and growing 
there as well as our global teams to really look at every aspect of the service 
and try and improve it for our Japanese members and grow our membership 
base there. So I think of that as sort of like a mini version or a trial or a t
est 
out for what I anticipate I'll be doing more in this role.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And just as a small little fun fact for our listeners and shareholders who may 
not know, but Greg actually speaks 5 languages. So I think as we become 
more global service, that ski
ll set will really benefit the company.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Notice how ...
 
Reed Hastings
 
Are you talking Java, C++? So you mean like [indiscernible]. How do you 
find time, Greg, to do all that? It's pretty amazing. We are so excited about 
the next decade of Net
flix growth. We've definitely got a good start, but the 
opportunity across the next decade is just amazing for us. It's a lot 
international, as Greg was referring, but I couldn't be more excited about it, 
and it will be great to have some help as we span t
he globe, and I'm looking 
forward to that. And to be totally clear, I'm in for a decade. So let me be 
really clear on that. I'm in for a decade, okay. And as Co
-
CEO, it's two of us 
full time. It's not like a part
-
time deal. So it's definitely broadening th
e 
management team and helping us grow even faster over the next 10 years.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And so maybe, Reed, from your perspective, now that you 
have a relatively new setup, is there any kind of growth plans maybe that's 
out of the ordin
ary that you might be thinking about? I mean is Netflix in the 
next 10 years the same that 
--
 
compared to the Netflix in the last 10 years? 
So if you could just help us think through what your priorities are potentially 
now that you're sharing a job with T
ed.
 
Reed Hastings
 
The three of us have been working together so long. There's essentially no 
difference next quarter. I mean, Ted's got some increased external stature, 
and he can put bigger deals together for us, and that's really cool. And Greg 
will star
t to spend more time around the world for us. But think of it as much 
more consistent with the past than different.
 
And then the beautiful thing about the next 10 years is we've got a good 
model. We just need to make it better. Every day, we work on making
 
our 
service better, trying to make it so the billboard on the front of the UI, you 
could just click it and watch it and just like trust that result and then, of 
course, having amazing breadth of content, which we've been expanding. A 
couple of years ago, 
we only had a premium TV. And now to be really good 
in movies, to be really good in unscripted, emerging in animation, very 
strong in local language shows and series, I mean it's just 
--
 
it's incredible 
the expansion that Ted's pulled off over the last 5 y
ears. So think of it as 
just us doing more of that at higher scale and pleasing more people, so no 
change in the focus or the execution and preparing for greater scale.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I feel like we have to make the shows and the films that people love 
and the 
stars that they want to spend more time with and being able to launch those 
brands, whatever your taste is all around the world, is such a monumental 
job, and I'm just thrilled that we have such a strong team to do it together.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And maybe we could just start with the environment we are in 
the middle of right now. Things seem to be 
--
 
seemed to be opening up but 
now, it looks like things might go back again a little bit. So when you think 
about the environment around 
you, a lot around us has changed, the way 
we work, the workflows around different organizations. So when you think 
about your plans for Netflix going forward, how has COVID impacted your 
plans? In what instances are these planned changes permanent? And can
 
you actually benefit either from a cost perspective or a workflow perspective 
in some ways that might be here to stay for much longer?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Do you want to start, Spence?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Sure. I mean generally, Kannan, it doesn't change too much. 
I mean what 
we've learned is that the Internet, as Reed said even last quarter, we know 
that's a more important part of our lives and that's kind of here to stay, and 
also that people love film and television shows. So that 
--
 
our strategy is 
just to get b
etter and better every day with that content, with that product, 
as we talked about. You can see in the business and we can talk about it 
here at some point. Obviously, we've seen some pull forward in our member 
growth, if you will, but frankly, our strate
gy hasn't fundamentally changed. 
There's things on the margin in terms of things around real estate strategy 
and how much content we acquire or commission in certain parts of the 
world. But fundamentally, our strategy remains the same and the growth 
opport
unities as big as ever.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I could jump in on the production side. I mean it's been remarkable how 
nimble the teams have been to going from full
-
blown production to 
completely shut down to ramping back up all over the world in the space of 
a
 
few months. I think some of the things, like the safety protocols that we're 
putting into place around the world, will become a permanent part of 
production, which is a good thing. I think this time in between the shutdown 
and ramping back up, the extra t
ime that was spent on scripts and 
development and preparedness will make the shoots actually more efficient, 
which I think will stick around.
 
I think when it comes down to releasing the programming and the content to 
the world and working with the press on
 
how we do that, we've done this 
remarkable virtual press junkets with our publicity teams that have put 
talent in front of the best writers in the world, almost uninterrupted just 
from their living room instead of a hotel room. And it's been 
--
 
the pickup
 
and the efficiency of that, there's been some parts of that, I think, will 
probably last a long time. The different marketing functions, how you backfill 
not being able to host a screening, all of those things are being learned. And 
I think some of those 
things are going to be appropriate for certain content 
from today on and 
--
 
but I think we'll just be better and smarter, the way 
that we've come out of many tragic things in our history.
 
Gregory Peters
 
And just to pile on to that, I think it's been an opp
ortunity to accelerate 
things that we were already excited about. One, I think, great example is 
creating a sort of technical infrastructure that allows distributed content 
creators, artists, think about visual effects artists, animating artists to be 
effe
ctive when they're at home and collaborate collectively on assets. We 
think that was in the plans before this all happened. But it's the opportunity 
to accelerate that and make sure that we're incrementally more effective 
during this period has been great 
and we'll learn a bunch from it that I think 
will serve us quite well as we go back to a more normal working pattern.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And when we look at the first half in terms of the subscriber 
numbers, obviously, you guys did close to 
the numbers that all of 2019 did. 
And so when you think about your guidance in that context, it does seem to 
embed an expectation of a lot of pull forward of growth. But over this period, 
we've also seen cord
-
cutting reach record levels, and that doesn't s
eem to 
be slowing down. And some parts of the world, again, seem to be shutting 
down right now. So if you could just help us think through the framework for 
growth for the next quarter and the guidance, that would be great.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Sure. Let me tak
e that one. I'll take it. So Kannan, you really nailed it. I 
mean when we think about the guidance for Q3, we're not thinking about Q3 
just in and of itself. We have to look at it in the context of what just 
happened in Q2. And we just added 10 million mem
bers, which is the largest 
growth we've ever had in a second quarter. And if you look at the 
--
 
so we 
kind of look at the totality across the Q2 and Q3 period. And if we look at 
that quarterly period, two quarters in a row, the best we've ever done in 
that
 
period is actually two years ago in 2018, where we grew by 11.5 million 
members. So if we, this year, deliver on that Q3 guidance, that means we're 
growing 12.5 million members in that same time period, which is 1 million 
more than we've ever done, which 
is we think big growth on top of what was 
already a very big Q1.
 
So the nice thing is that those newer members are actually highly engaged. 
They're sticking around with us actually as well or better than pre
-
COVID. 
And our service keeps getting better. So 
Netflix 2021 is going to be a much 
better service than Netflix 2020, which gives those newer members and 
existing members even more reason to stay highly engaged and stick around 
and also to entice future members to join. So we think that the growth 
opport
unity is as big as ever. There's just that kind of near
-
term pull forward 
that you're seeing.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Okay. And when you think about other components of guidance, obviously, 
what stands out is the margin and the marketing spend as a proportion 
of 
revenues is 7%, which is obviously extraordinary new low. So when you 
think about 
--
 
and also the guidance with respect to content being more 
back
-
ended next year versus this year, that would suggest that as you go 
into the second half of this year and 
first half of next year, your marketing 
spend should continue to be lower than usual. So first of all, is that the right 
way to read it? And structurally, does this also mean that the amount you 
need to spend on marketing as a result of the kind of engagem
ent growth is 
lower going forward?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, one of the things that's unique about our services, our members spend 
a lot of time on Netflix every day. So it turns out the best place to talk to 
them about Netflix is on Netflix. And our investm
ent in time, energy and 
dollars goes into kind of building the conversation, the zeitgeist, the buzz 
around our shows and our stars and how do we make sure we amplify that 
even when you're not on Netflix. But in terms of the march towards less 
traditional 
media, we've been on that for some time, meaning that it's just a 
more efficient, more impactful and more global way to talk to our members 
is not through always through the most traditional channels. So yes, you're 
spending less but doing more to attract 
buzz and attention to our shows, 
trying to cut through a world where there's a lot of choices.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
And maybe the only thing I'd just add is a little bit of what Ted touched on 
earlier, which is we assume marketing, in general, would be about fl
at this 
year, which is still about $2 billion of spend, which is a tremendous amount 
of spend across our marketing channels. But it does look like it will be lower 
because of some of those things we're seeing in this kind of new world in 
terms of more virt
ual junkets and PR and actually not doing as much 
awards, marketing and those sorts of things. Now some of that is temporary 
in nature. Some of that is permanent learnings as to how we can be more 
effective going forward. But I think you're right that as a
 
result, it's 
--
 
most 
of this is just consistent with our strategic shift, and some of it is some near
-
term, I guess, cost/benefit from what's happening in the world.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Okay. And so when we think about...
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're seeing, Kanna
n, that the service has just been able to generate 
amazing viewing. And so as the service gets better and better, we're able to 
take advantage of that.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Right. And when we think about your margin guidance for next year in that 
context, y
ou have been improving margins about 300 basis points every 
year, but it looks like there is incremental opportunity now, but the guidance 
for next year is consistent more or less with the broader framework. So is 
that just conservativeness? Or is there so
mething else guiding that as we go 
into next year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Let's call it tamping down the expectations. This is a great growth 
opportunity for us. So any revenue upside, we would tend to put into more 
content for our members, which generates more 
growth over time. So we've 
been pretty good about that, which is taking that upside and then converting 
it into more and more growth through service quality. So that would be the 
plan.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes. And I would just say that we 
--
 
to Reed's point, w
e're always looking to 
spend strategically and invest strategically in the service. But we did signal 
that in the very near term, there may be some margin upside this year in 
2020, but we're really kind of trying to manage to that multiyear, continuing 
to 
increase our margins, which is why I wanted to let folks know that we're, 
at this point, managing still to another 300 basis points increase next year, 
which would get us to that 19% margin.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
And worth reiterating in an environment where N
etflix 2021 is better than 
Netflix '20.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And so Ted, just to follow up on that comment, when you say 
it's better in '21 versus '20, are we talking about subscribers? Are we talking 
about the amount of c
ontent? So how should we frame that?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
I'm talking about the forward trajectory of the releasing of the content that's 
coming your way. I mean think about it right now at a time where most of 
the world is at a standstill. The rest of this m
onth, you're going to see from 
Netflix a brand
-
new series starring Katherine Langford from 13 Reasons Why 
called Cursed, a big, large
-
scale movie that kind of reimagines the King 
Arthur legend. We have a sequel to one of our biggest movies, Kissing Booth 
2
, the original that kind of birthed the rom
-
com movement on Netflix with 
Joey King and Jacob Elordi. We have a new season of Umbrella Academy, 
one of our most global and most successful series on Netflix that was a big 
hit for us when it came out in its fi
rst season in '19 and go rolling right into a 
big, high
-
octane action thriller named Project Power with Jamie Foxx and 
Joseph Gordon
-
Levitt.
 
So it's that kind of ongoing beat of content and programming. Think about 
this. Last year, we had barely dabbled in
 
competition and reality 
programming. This quarter alone, with Floor is Lava and Too Hot to Handle, 
we had two of our biggest hits ever in that 
--
 
not just in that genre but in 
our 
--
 
all of our programming. Too Hot to Handle, as a percentage of 
watching, 
was as big in Japan as it was in the U.S., which is a wild 
phenomenon. So that, to me, is all those learnings, they keep compounding 
and keep compounding and expanding across programming genres that 
make it a great value for consumers.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. So I guess sticking on that theme for a bit. When we think 
about the content mix, obviously, that's changed quite a bit over the last few 
years with reality shows and now animation and so on. So when you think 
about this particular mix, reali
ty shows do seem to be a better return on 
investment in some ways because a lot of them have shown up, like Too Hot 
to Handle is in the top 10 list, was there for some time. So when you think 
about this mix, is it fair to think about reality shows or maybe
 
documentary 
programming as being slightly better return and, therefore, the mix is 
shifting slightly more in favor of that? And is this even a framework that you 
consider, which is when you invest in something, what the returns are 
versus the engagement?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
The big motivation to invest in reality and unscripted is not the cost savings 
of production, but the love that people have for this programming and how 
important it becomes in people's lives. So if we're trying to be more and 
more your g
o
-
to destination for entertainment, not to ignore an area of 
programming that kind of dominates broadcast, it would be silly of us. So 
we've been dabbling in unscripted reality. We kind of got very, very 
accomplished in the documentary space and then have 
moved that over and 
--
 
to expand that to unscripted. And then now the competition space, which 
--
 
this is only our 
--
 
it was only our third or fourth show really in the 
competition space that we've dabbled into. But the motivation really is 
consumer love f
or the programming, not the marginal cost savings.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Okay. Got it. And Greg, just to think about the world from a distribution 
perspective, there's a lot going on right now in terms of disputes, the 
Peacock and HBO not getting carried on 
Roku. And of course, they're having 
problems with Amazon as well. And notably, when you think about this, I 
mean it almost feels like the legacy cable network MVPD disputes of the past 
where the aggregators are essentially becoming gatekeepers. How do you 
see this playing out? And is this a risk in the future for Netflix?
 
Gregory Peters
 
First of all, I think it's just really unfortunate when those negotiations 
between a device manufacturer and an entertainment service provider get to 
this point where it rea
lly impacts consumers and they can't watch the shows 
that they're thrilled to watch on the device that they have. We've been lucky 
to be working, investing alongside, collaborating with a wide, wide range of 
device manufacturing partners around the world a
nd really working together 
to create better Netflix experiences on those devices. And that's really a very 
positive model. It's really 
--
 
it's a win
-
win
-
win, right? It's great for us. We 
get to reach more of our members with better experiences. It's great 
for the 
device manufacturers because those experiences make those devices more 
valuable, more attractive. And most importantly and ultimately, it's a win for 
consumers to 
--
 
sort of the benefactors of those better experiences.
 
So we're going to keep invest
ing in that model. We have whole teams that 
basically do nothing but work to make that whole process better, to make it 
easier for our manufacturing partners, to ingest the technology that we 
produce for those better experiences, to think about how do we l
everage the 
qualities and features of the devices that those manufacturers are investing 
in their side to really show up those benefits. And I think we're hopeful and 
we expect that, that positive model will be able to continue.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Okay. A
nd then I guess the other model for distribution is just your deals 
with MVPDs as well as wireless companies, and you have a number of these 
deals globally. So when you think about mature markets like the U.S. versus 
the rest of the world, your guidance fo
r next quarter as well as the broader 
growth framework would suggest that marginally, these become a bit more 
important than the organic growth channels. So how are you thinking about 
these wholesale distribution deals? What kind of role do they have going
 
forward? And what's the objective you're trying to solve for when you get 
into a deal with these guys?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. I think you have it right, which is that we think that these will grow in 
importance, but I think it's also important to note that t
hey remain a 
relatively small percentage of our total acquisition and really what we call 
the organic channel. People signing up with us directly is still very much the 
dominant mode. But we sort of think about the criteria, which we sort of are 
evaluating
 
these partnerships on 2 fronts. Obviously, we're looking at it as 
how much growth acceleration, how much membership acceleration do we 
get by adding a channel like that but then wanting to understand sort of 
what 
--
 
large are the revenue impacts, right? T
here's some cannibalization. 
There might be different economics involved. So we want to evaluate that 
and make sure that we're doing these on a positive revenue basis.
 
And then the other very important lens is we actually sort of look at it from 
what's the
 
consumer experience, what's the member experience. And so 
we're looking at it qualitatively to sort of understanding what that member 
journey is and working with those partners to make sure that that's as 
positive, as friction
-
free as we possibly can. And
 
then we all obviously back 
it up with the metrics, too, right? So we're looking at engagement and how 
frequently people use the service, churn characteristics to really make sure 
that we're delivering a high
-
quality experience to our members through 
those
 
channels. And I would say that we're very positive on both of those 
fronts. And so to your point, we expect to continue to do these deals to 
expand these deals. We're working with multiple partners both in, to your 
point, territories that we're sort of fu
rther penetrated in, but it's also a great 
accelerant to territories that we're still in an earlier phase. And so we think 
both are great places to do that kind of partnership.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And then I guess looking at pricing, which is
 
also slightly linked 
to the distribution discussion to some extent, but when you think about the 
pricing algorithm we've come to expect, it's been in that mid
-
single
-
digit 
growth range over time for Netflix. But more recently, I think when you strip 
out t
he effect of the price increases, it's trending a little bit lower than that 
because of some of the newer plans. So when you think about the pricing 
algorithm, how are you thinking about that going forward? Is it still the 
same mid
-
single
-
digit kind of a g
rowth profile that you're thinking about? Or 
has that equation changed?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. I think it's important to start with just reiterating what we mentioned 
last time that really, for the last several months, we've been principally 
focused on 
just making sure that the service has been there for our 
members when they turn to us for a moment of escape and entertainment. 
And so we're very much enthusiastic about being able to serve in that role. 
And actually, we've invested in making the service m
ore valuable to that 
period of time, adding more content, adding more service features to that 
period as well.
 
But when we look forward, I would say every country is in a different mode. 
And so we're going to sort of continue to assess a bunch of different
 
factors 
over time. We'll look at macro factors country by country. We'll also look 
very closely at 
--
 
on our specific metrics, and it's metrics like engagement, 
like churn. And those are the signals that we have for indicating when we 
have created more va
lue for our members, so back to your plan. And it's not 
so much sort of an all priority plan that we have but really more using those 
signs that we've done a good job at building more value for our members, 
which indicate to us, hey, it might be time to go
 
back to them and ask them 
for a little bit more so that we can then invest that further into amazing 
stories, great content, better product experiences and create even more 
value for them.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And Kannan, just to remind you, we don't narrowly man
age towards an 
ARPU number or an ARPU growth number. Our orientation is really on 
optimizing for revenue.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Great. And so when we think about the way you manage this whole dynamic 
on yield, which is revenue maximization, obviously, units 
are a part of it, 
pricing is a part of it, but the other important component of this is churn. 
And that 
--
 
and given the scale that you have right now, even small 
movements in churn can have a massive impact broadly on the entire 
income statement. And so w
hen you think about churn, given the COVID 
period and the increase in engagement, is that structurally leading to a 
better churn performance in cohorts that are potentially newer versus 
cohorts that came in earlier? If you could just help us think through 
consumer behavior across this period as engagement has gone up, that 
would be great.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. Spence, do you want to take that one?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Sure, I can start. I mean the short story, Kannan, is that these newer 
members look very much 
like the members that are pre
-
existing members 
of the business. So it's very broad
-
based, and you can see that these 
members are coming in from everywhere in the world, a few million each in 
APAC and EMEA and U.K. and then a couple of million in Lat Am. Th
ey're 
highly engaged. Actually, the retention across every cohort is as good or 
better than pre
-
COVID. So 
--
 
and not surprisingly, the 
--
 
this membership 
base, both new and older, loves film and TV content, as we said, and they 
look pretty similar. But I d
on't know, Greg or Ted or others, if you'd add to 
that.
 
Gregory Peters
 
I think maybe the one thing other than this sort of big structural 
engagement change which was sort of really a result of people being in 
lockdown and quarantine and turning to us for s
ome escape, I would say, to 
Spence's point, backing up the high
-
level churn pieces, when we look at 
other sort of metrics that inform how they're engaging with the service, we 
see it being very, very similar to members we added pre
-
COVID.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And
 
I was going to say, Kannan, it's a little oversimplified, but I think of it as 
when someone churns, it's always temporary. They're going to come back. 
It's just a matter of timing as our service gets better, as maybe their income 
increases, as the Interne
t gets faster. So we'd love people to get a taste of 
Netflix. We hope they stay for 50 years. But if they drop out, we think of it 
as always temporary and we're going to work hard to improve the service 
enough that they want to spend money with us.
 
Theodor
e Sarandos
 
It's been interesting to see the evolution of our relationship with that 
member, where they used to think of us as the place to watch the reruns of 
the shows that they missed on other networks all the way to now to where 
they come to us to be th
eir favorite show and now for Friday night at the 
movies, where you have Netflix premiering the biggest movies in the world 
on Netflix. So it's an evolving relationship constantly but nothing unique in 
this subset of folks in terms of their watching and th
eir churn behavior. So 
it's exciting.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And then I guess when you think about the product itself, one 
of the big discussion points has been content discovery because there's an 
enormous amount of content and there are an eno
rmous number of 
streaming services now. And so we've got to sort through all of that in order 
to figure out what to watch. So when you think about content discovery, I 
mean, Greg, I know you run a lot of A/B tests all through the year, you run 
hundreds of 
them. So what are the kind of things you're thinking about in 
terms of improving the experience? You have the top 10 list. How has that 
done? If you could just give us some sense of how you're sort of looking at 
that issue.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes. Well, I'll j
ust 
--
 
I'll talk about the top 10 list and then get to the big 
macro question, which is one of my favorite questions, of course. So thanks 
for asking that one. But top 10 is an example of a nice, little positive lift in 
overall engagement. It's not game ch
anging. But more importantly, it 
actually speaks to what we think is a real member need that some of our 
members not all have, where they want to know what shows are popular so 
they can watch those easily and then participate in the broader social 
conversa
tion that's happening around those shows. But I think it's indicative 
of the kind of work that we need to go do, right? And I think that we have 
created literally the most incredible collection of entertainment options that 
has ever existed available to a 
consumer at a click of a button. And Ted's 
team is off producing more and more fantastic content at an accelerating 
rate. And that is, for our members, simply wonderful. It creates both 
challenges and opportunities for us as a product team to think about t
he 
experiences that we evolve to make the process of choosing and finding a 
great story in that as delightful and as easy as we possibly can.
 
And the way we think about it is actually that we have to make almost every 
aspect of that experience better. And 
it's not going to be one thing that's 
going to be sort of like suddenly make a perfect choosing experience. So we 
have teams that think about exactly how do we pick what titles are perfect 
for each member, how do we pick those recommendations to make those
 
better every single day, how do we present those titles in a more compelling 
way, a way that's specific to what we think the member's interest is. We're 
thinking about how our user experiences work and the features that are 
included in there. And we want 
those to adapt and evolve so that they can 
be responsive to the specific needs of a growing number of members around 
the world that have growing and diverse needs from our experiences.
 
So the perhaps sort of unhelpful answer is there's going to be like lit
erally 
hundreds of things that are going to have to change, but when you 
aggregate all those changes, they're transformative. And I would invite you 
to go back and sort of look at a Netflix experience from 5 years ago 
compared to today, and it's just stunn
ing how much progress we can make 
through that process. And we are committed to making even more progress 
sort of in the next 5 years to come to make that wealth of content a joy for 
our members around the world.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
And so Reed, I guess on
e of the questions that this raises is given the 
amount of content, I mean a comment that you had made 
--
 
I think this was 
in 2017, was that Ted was not feeling enough when it came to the success 
rate of shows and he was not feeling much. Do you think you'
re at a point 
where there is enough balance in the portfolio of content that you have? Or 
do you feel like Netflix has to take more risk in terms of the portfolio? Where 
are we in terms of that mix in content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I feel excellent about the numbe
r of big bets that Ted has coming up. I'm 
privy to stuff that we're doing now that will come out in 2 or 3 years. And it's 
a little 
--
 
amazing, I mean. And some of it will turn out truly great and I'll be 
so proud of it. So I'm excited that we're taking th
ose risks. And we want to 
have so many hits that when you come to Netflix, you can just go from hit to 
hit to hit and never have to think about any of those other services, right? 
We want to be like your primary, your best friend, the one you turn to. And 
of course, occasionally, there's Hamilton and you're going to go to someone 
else's service for an extraordinary film. But for the most part, we want to be 
the one that just always please you with the convenience, simple and easy 
choice.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And Ted, from your perspective, when you think about 
production worldwide, obviously, we are still in a shutdown mode and there 
are still issues around the world. And while things are getting better in Q3, it 
seems like there would be 
some impact to the '21 slate given your 
comments about it being more back
-
end
-
weighted. But then on the other 
side, you also have content that the studios are not able to release quite 
quickly, right? So when you think about this, does it make you think ab
out 
the mix slightly differently? Maybe do we get a bit more movie
-
heavy 
initially compared to originals maybe later in the year? And what else can we 
expect because of the kind of disruption going on right now?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, I mentioned last qua
rter, one of the benefits of releasing our series all 
at once is that we work very far ahead of our release cycle. So that's how 
we're able to continue to release this ongoing steady flow. So even during 
the shutdown, we're partially shot on a lot of shows
. So when we pick them 
back up, it's not like starting from scratch again. So 
--
 
and outside of North 
America, parts of India and Brazil, we're running pretty much in a normal 
fashion in terms of our volume around the world, and it's ramping up in 
differen
t various stages of preproduction. And we've got a couple of shooting 
days in Los Angeles this week that we're really excited about. Now that's 
coming back around. So I do think that our ability to keep up with that has a 
lot to do with our kind of unique 
offer to the consumer that turned out to be 
a hidden benefit at a time when things would be shut down.
 
And the other one was the kind of nimble nature of our creatives who could, 
on a dime, pick up post
-
production remotely on shows that we're already 
runni
ng. And as far as film to TV, they both require a lot of prep work, a lot 
of creative at the beginning, the production and then a big, long post
-
production cycle very similar in terms of the work cycle. So I don't see us 
pivoting to that. I do see that the
re's opportunities. We did a few with the 
studios to pick up some movies that they were having a hard time releasing. 
And then we've also picked up a couple of nearly finished seasons of 
television with a brand
-
new show called Emily in Paris that we've got
 
coming 
up later this year with Lily Collins who we really love; and Cobra Kai that we 
picked up from YouTube, not just the first 2 seasons, but a brand
-
new, yet
-
to
-
air third season that we're finishing right now. And that, by the way, was 
a show that was 
super competitive 3 years ago when they brought it to 
market and we were devastated not to get it for good to start with. So we're 
excited to have Cobra Kai in the Netflix family.
 
So there's all kinds of adjustments. Our ability to license and produce, cre
ate 
very long lead and very fast, like you saw us do with the Tiger King finale 
episode a couple of months ago, I think it's our ability to do all those things 
that make me really excited to jump out of bed and come to work in Netflix 
in the morning.
 
Kanna
n Venkateshwar
 
That's great. And when you think about different pieces of content, movies 
versus TV shows or even within TV shows' different genres, is there any 
difference in origination versus retention characteristics of different pieces of 
content? Do 
movies originate better or retain better versus TV shows? I 
mean is there anything you can tell us about that?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Both films and TV can have the same, exact attraction to consumers in 
terms of what gets them excited, how they behave after, h
ow they retain 
afterwards, how they tell friends, all those things. A really great experience 
is what they're looking for. And if 
--
 
the chances that they're going to have 
that are higher on Netflix than anywhere in the world, going to the thing you 
cited 
about earlier about having so many great choices to make. But I think 
a film, when it's usually successful, can be very acquisitive, can be attention, 
it could be retention
-
driving and also could be 
--
 
bring a lot of joy to our 
members. And series can do t
hat as well. So it just depends on what you're 
in the mood for.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Kannan, we have time for 1 or 2 more questions.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
Sure. So maybe, Spencer, a couple of questions in terms of the guidance 
and the financials. I mean one of the t
hings that came out was the free cash 
flow margin was 15%, and your EBITDA 
--
 
I mean operating income margin 
was obviously 22%. So could you just help us bridge the gap? And how do 
we think about cash flows going forward?
 
Spencer Wang
 
Sure. Thanks for noti
cing the positive free cash flow margin, Kannan. I'd say 
2 things explain that variance. Number one is obviously CapEx. So that was 
about 200 basis points of the difference between the free cash flow margin 
and the operating margin. The second expense item
 
was interest expense, 
which obviously falls below operating income but obviously reduces free cash 
flow. And there, just keep in mind that while we accrue our interest expense 
quarterly, we pay cash interest primarily semiannually. So you actually have 
ab
out 
--
 
roughly 2 quarters of cash interest expense in Q2.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Yes. I'd just add. That's great, Spencer. And I'd just add to Spencer's point. 
When you think about cash flow going forward, it was sort of a bit of a 
unique window into that forward
-
looking cash generation opportunity or 
potential for our business because of the pandemic. So we generally are 
forward
-
investing into the growth of our business and into content. So our 
content cash spend is in excess of our content expense in a given yea
r. But 
because of the pause in productions, you can see that basically, that cash 
spend and expense in content were the same this quarter, essentially at a 
1:1 ratio. And as a result 
--
 
as we said in the letter, resulted in a 15% cash 
flow 
--
 
free cash flo
w margin. Going forward, we do expect to turn cash flow 
negative again in 2021 and as our business and our production ramps up, 
but we're still on that multiyear path to being cash flow positive. And when 
we are sustaining cash flow positive, we expect to 
be a much bigger and 
more profitable business. So hopefully, that 15% cash flow margin is just 
the start.
 
Kannan Venkateshwar
 
That's great. So I guess since we have time for maybe one last question, we 
could just think about the world going forward, longer
 
term. Reed, from your 
perspective, a lot of the franchises that are getting created in today's world 
seem to be coming from the video gaming side. A lot of shows that you 
have, which have been very successful, have been from that side. And 
obviously, some
 
of your shows have become video games in some instances. 
So when you think about the 
--
 
and even the interactivity of some of your 
shows makes them feel like video games. So when you think about the way 
the world is evolving, it just seems like these 2 si
des of the world are 
starting to converge to some extent, both in terms of the kind of content as 
well as the experiences. So why not think about video games as an 
extension of where Netflix is today? If you could just help us think through 
that framework 
and how you consider that going forward.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. If you'll think about franchise IP development and Harry Potter and 
then these hundreds of enormous franchises that come out of full
-
length 
books, then there's Marvel and our own, The Old Guard, 
that come out of a 
comic book world, and then there might be a few coming out of video games 
but that's like pretty small. So really, think of it as the big franchises have 
come out of books and comic books. Now video games, a great and 
interesting area, i
t's got a number of aspects in terms of multiplayer that are 
changing, e
-
sports that are changing, PC
-
based gaming. So it remains a 
very interesting area. But Ted's got big plans to spend future billions in our 
movies, in series, in animation. And so we've
 
got lots of places to put the 
money, and we're definitely focused on creating franchises. And maybe, Ted, 
in your Co
-
CEO role, maybe you can wrap us up here with final comments 
and about building franchises.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. Look, I think franchise 
is the active, successfully 
--
 
successful world
-
building. And video games obviously have world
-
building aspect to them, but 
so do books and so do graphic novels and so do comic books and so does 
original IP. And really, this is a matter of how well it's ex
ecuted. We were 
really unbelievably encouraged by the first attempt at it here with The Old 
Guard, which is kind of a new flavor of that kind of storytelling that I think 
has got a world and stories to be told for some time to come. I look to other 
things 
that were more original IP, like La Casa de Papel, which in this 
quarter, La Casa de Papel was the most watched new season of television on 
Netflix, hard stop, not just non
-
English, English. And that's in its fourth 
season, and it's become an incredible wo
rld that we're going to keep building 
on and keep building on. So IP is a great place to start, but it's 
--
 
like 
everything else in the world, it's hugely execution
-
dependent. And if you do 
it well, people want to come back for more. And you don't disappoi
nt them. 
You can keep doing it. So we're really thrilled about it and thrilled about 
doing it from a variety of sources.

10/16/14,Netflix,"Welcome to the Netflix Q1 2016 earnings call. I'm David Wells, CFO. I'm 
joined today by Reed Hastings, CEO, and Ted Sarandos, Chief Content 
Officer. Interviewing us today will once again be Ben Swinburne with Morgan 
Stanley and Peter Kafka with 
Re/code.
 
Just a warning before we begin that we will be making forward
-
looking 
statements, actual results may vary. I think, Ben, you have the first 
question, so over to you.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne

Morgan Stanley & Co. 
LLC
 
Sure, thank you. Maybe you can start out by just reflecting on the quarterly 
results you guys just delivered relative to your expectations. And maybe you 
could start out in the new markets you launched at the beginning of the year 
and how those perform
ed relative to your expectations.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
Sure. We were incredibly excited to grow to over 81 million subscribers. It's 
an enormous quarter for us that way. Some of it was from our expansion 
around the world. It's 130 countri
es. So there's quite a bit of variety. And 
remember that most of those countries we haven't yet seen the full potential 
of, because we're only in English and only with international credit cards. So 
over the next couple of years, as we further localize, we
'll be able to see 
more opportunity. But by going so broad, we've increased our rate of 
learning, and so, we're really excited about the approach and looking 
forward to the rest of the year.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And how did 
you feel the U.S. markets behave this quarter versus your 
expectations? You had noted in the letter a lot of strength from the originals 
that came in ahead of expectations. I'm guessing that's on gross connects, 
but how do the originals perform even relati
ve to what I'm sure where your 
fairly bullish expectation is in the U.S. market.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
Well, in the U.S. market, we did about 2.25 million net adds, which is nearly 
identical, not only to last year, but to the year before. 
So what you see is 
this continued growth and we're thrilled to keep that growth steady, 
between 5 million and 6 million net additions. And the content just keeps 
improving and that keeps the word of mouth growing. So we're very excited 
about that formula a
nd what we saw in Q1.
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re/code
 
Reed, you guys have been watching Amazon for a long time. You compete 
with them at least on content for quite some time. Four years ago, you 
predicted they'd come out with a standalone servers priced under yours.
 
They announced that yesterday. What's your view of them now, and in 
particular, with the announcement they made yesterday, do you think 
they're trying to compete head
-
to
-
head with you for subscriber dollars, or 
are they trying to underscore the value of P
rime overall.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
Hulu is doing some great work. Amazon is, HBO, Showtime. There are so 
many competitors, and everyone is working hard to build the best content. 
And so, we're seeing growth in the overall Internet TV mark
et. Of course, 
that's displacing linear TV, and it's natural that everybody is coming in as 
they realize that the future is Internet TV. And in terms of our shows, we're 
very excited about what we're doing. Not only are we expanding the number 
of original 
series we're doing, but we're also expanding into original movies.
 
So again, this is all part of the natural evolution from linear TV to Internet 
TV.
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re/code
 
Amazon has been talking with programmers for a while about adding linear 
channels. S
o you're looking at a scenario where they might have an offering 
that's similar to yours for the on
-
demand stuff, with a mix of originals and 
older movies and TV shows, plus current content live. What does that look 
like to you in terms of the prospects of
 
competing against that head
-
to
-
head?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
We're very focused on global competition. Obviously, around the world, it's 
very fast growing for us. We're coming towards 50/50 International, 
Domestic revenue. And so, we're foc
used on content that we can have 
around the world, which is why we're investing in original movies, original 
series so that we can have that content and also producing around the world 
like our French series Marseille or Spanish in Narcos.
 
And that's very 
different from carrying other people's single nation networks. 
So that's just a very different business. It's not one we focus on a lot. We 
know what we want to be, which is a great global producer and distributor of 
content, and other people will do other
 
things and that's fine. They may be 
very successful.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Let me throw a question out for David and/or Ted about 

 
thinking about the 
second quarter guidance internationally, there's a lot to chew on there. 
The 
number you laid out is probably below where most people were expecting. 
I'm wondering if you could talk, David, about how you thought through 
putting the second quarter guide together around the seasonality, some of 
the comp issues you talked about in 
the letter and whether we're seeing a 
more earlier than expected level of seasonality in some of these markets 
that are still one year or two years old.
 
And Ted, there's a narrative out of Europe, in particular, that the incumbents 
are sort of teaming up a
gainst you from a content perspective, and you've 
got a lot of stuff coming down the pike on originals. So if you could talk 
about your relationship with suppliers overseas since that's probably an area 
people have spent less time thinking through.
 
Theodor
e A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Sure, I let David kick it off there to go first.
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
So, Ben, in terms of thinking about the guide, just a reminder that we put in 
the letter that absent the strong performance that
 
we saw last year from a 
very recently launched Australia/New Zealand market, our guide would have 
been up. So I think you haven't yet seen sort of a normalized pattern of 
growth from us, in terms of a year
-
on
-
year growth expectation across our 
internation
al markets, because we've been layering on new markets as we 
go.
 
So I think, from our perspective, we were super happy with the results of 
Q1. And we wanted, in Q2, that to continue and it is, but we're mindful of 
the fact that we've got these large 
blooms of launches last year, and then, in 
Q1 this year with the rest of world markets, the Netflix global launch that 
are going to continue forward, because they're addressing pent
-
up demand.
 
So for us, we're focused on continued growth in those markets a
nd that's 
what we're seeing. And we're focused on continued improvement from an 
economic sense of reducing those losses and this year, you're seeing us 
continue to invest, but the U.S. is growing. So overall, operating profit is 
improving as we go and into
 
next year.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
I just say the reaction from the broadcasters across Europe is not different 
than it's been anywhere else. There's always uncertainty when we come to 
the new market, what role we're going to play, ho
w complementary we're 
going to be versus competitive, and I think everyone just likes to weigh all 
their options in terms of their competitive strength. We're buying a lot of 
pan
-
European rights as part of our global acquisitions, which I think 
probably ma
kes them a bit nervous too while they're trying to figure out 
what their next moves will be. But again, I don't think it's that unusual, even 
here in the U.S., where three of our largest suppliers teamed up to create 
Hulu, with probably much of the same mo
tivation.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And just as a follow
-
up, there's I don't think any mention of VPN changes in 
the letter, but that obviously has happened. Is that impacting at all the 
second quarter guidance at all?
 
Wilmot Ree
d Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
No, that change was in the first quarter. It's a very small but quite vocal 
minority. So it's really inconsequential to us, as you could see in the Q1 
results.
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And the only thing I'd add
 
to that, Ben, is we were able to grow. In the first 
quarter, we had very strong U.S. growth. At the same time, we had a very 
robust Netflix global launch. So I think it validates the fact that we're seeing 
new demand for Netflix in those markets.
 
Benjamin
 
Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Sure.
 
Peter Kafka

Re/code
 
This is for Reed. You keep getting asked this, but I want to keep asking 
because the question keeps coming up. Any interest in live sports in any 
capacity?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Foun
der and CEO
 
Any interest in what?
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re/code
 
Live sports.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
Live sports. Ted, I'll let you handle that question. It worked so well for us 
last time. We knew this.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Exactly, there's no interest in live sports currently.
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re/code
 
Currently. What about live in general? There's a lot of interest, Twitter, 
YouTube, Facebook in particular, and the idea of broadcasting live video over 
the Internet. You guys hav
e tweaked your model a little bit or will be 
tweaking a bit with Chelsea Handler where you're going to move away from 
the dumping out all the stuff in one go and staggering it. So if you're not 
doing live 

 
if you don't plan to do live now, why not conside
r it down the 
pike?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
So just to correct you, we have never dumped anything. We have given it a 
proper platform with all of the great content that it deserves.
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re/code
 
A full release.
 
Theodore A. 
Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
So Chelsea is near live in that we're going to be putting it up to our 
subscribers just a couple hours after it's recorded live in front of an 
audience. There's not a technological reason we wouldn't want to go to live. 
But
 
you should think about our brand proposition is very much about on
-
demand. So to the extent that watching on
-
demand is better than watching 
live would bring a ton of value to it. And other people doing live, I think it's 
great. It's about a further expans
ion of Internet television to include live. We 
don't have to do everything to be part of that expansion.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
And rather than invest in things like live sports, we're investing in things like 
The Crown, which is just an ep
ic production. And maybe you could talk a 
little bit about that, Ted.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
It's being shot right now in the UK. We have previewed some footage of it to 
the European press last week. They just loved it. It's a massive
 
cast, a 
massive production that will tell the life of Queen Elizabeth, starring Claire 
Foy as the Queen and will follow her life through her relationships with the 
Prime Ministers all the way through to current times. So it's a very 

 
it's 
those kind of t
hings that we think are massively global that we can produce 
on a larger scale than anybody else that we really think we can win the day 
on.
 
Peter Kafka

David, coming back to the second
 
quarter guidance again but on the U.S. 
market, why did you decide to delay or spread the un
-
grandfathering 
through the remainder of the year? You mentioned you don't expect much of 
an impact, but you decided to spread it out. And if you could, just walk u
s 
through what you've learned in your testing so far and the thought process 
around that.
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
I think we've always been a testing company. So perhaps there should have 
been an expectation that this would be a gradual th
ing in terms of layering 
that out. We've got a number of markets that are coming off un
-
grandfathering, not just the U.S. And some of those are timed three to four 
months as we go. So I think it's just about messaging it. It was important to 
us to make sur
e that subscribers knew that this was happening and to put it 
in front of them, and that's what we're going to do. And we want to do that, 
do right by the consumer and do right by Netflix as we go. So I think we're 
just taking our time to do that.

And, Ted, what are you seeing in terms of the efficiency of your spend as 
you continue to build on originals? And I'm curious. You've had more data 
points around film results, and you'll have more coming up. How
 
are the 
films performing relative to your expectations, and relatively maybe to the 
spending on TV series?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
The efficiencies are a little hard to match because you've got a couple of 
hours of viewing versus 10 t
o 13 hours of viewing on a series. But relative to 
how we license other movies, we've been pretty happy with the direction 
that it's going. Remember, we have a few films under our belt. Where I'm 
really looking at is how broadly people engage with them, ho
w do they play 
around the world. All those data points have been really positive. And as we 
keep going, I think that content can be as efficient as the series relative to 
other films. So we're still learning as we go though.

Can you guys talk about your M&A strategy? Are you looking at Paramount, 
which may be partly for sale? What about Starz, which is unofficially for 
sale? And if you don't want to comment on those in par
ticular, what do you 
think you might as you consider larger acquisitions?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
It's been 15 years we've been public and 20 years existing, and we've done 
no M&A. So I think that probably speaks for itself.
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re
/code
 
And as you guys push into the studio film business, making your own movie, 
does it make sense to at least do a smaller acquisition that would help you 
get some of those competencies in
-
house?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Peter, what y
ou're seeing not just on the films, but also on several of our 
series where Netflix is increasingly the studio and the network on those 
shows. So we are building that efficiency in
-
house. The Ranch that just 
premiered a few weeks ago is a Netflix
-
produced 
show, and we'll be doing a 
lot more of those coming up.
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re/code
 
So you can build that without buying it.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
We're building it versus buying it.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
We'll just 
hire the people that we want and build it and that could in principle 
be a constraint on our rate of growth, but Ted's been able to attract an 
incredible team in LA. And so, when you look at the growth in our originals, 
you can see that we can deliver on t
hat on this organic hiring basis, which of 
course is much stronger for the long term than if you tried to juice it with 
M&A.
 
Peter Kafka

Re/code
 
Thanks.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Reed, can you talk a little bit about how invest
ors and shareholders should 
look at various opportunities internationally? For example, Brazil is a market 
that maybe at first blush wouldn't appear to be ripe for Netflix, given sort of 
low paid TV penetration, lower household income, lower broadband spee
ds 
and yet you've described that as a rocketship, you've done really well there. 
And yet maybe other more sort of developed markets in Europe have been 
slower.
 
What are the characteristics and things that are outside of Netflix's control 
that drive success
? And what are the things you're doing that you maybe 
didn't do a year ago to make sure you capture the opportunity?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
One of the major things I think is eCommerce and payment systems to the 
degree that there's a conven
ient way to pay for airline tickets, for example, 
online. That's really helpful. But we're continuing to work with all the 
different ISPs, phone billing solutions, other things, and we'll grow as the 
payment infrastructure or the eCommerce infrastructure g
rows.
 
So when you think about it in the long term, everybody around the world is 
going to be watching Internet video, and we want to be well
-
positioned, so 
as all of these countries evolve towards Internet video that we grow with 
them. In some cases, that 
will be 10 years, 15 years, in other cases, it will 
be in the next two years or three years. But it's a long
-
term investment, and 
country by country, it's worked out extremely well for us. So that's why 
we're so invested in international expansion. We're v
ery confident that in the 
long
-
term, everybody is going to be watching TV shows and movies over the 
Internet. And we hope to be one of the leading brands for that around the 
world.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And let me just ask yo
u 

 
go ahead, David.
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
The only thing I would add to that too and I think Reed would say is you 
can't anticipate everything. And I think five years ago when we were first 
launching the markets, we thought maybe we cou
ld anticipate most things. 
But every time we've launched, there's been one or two things that we 
haven't anticipated. What we have gotten good at as a company is fast 
learning and fast improvement. And so, I think that gives us some 
confidence as well that
 
as things come up, we'll be able to address them 
quickly.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
And remember, when you look at Facebook and YouTube, which are ad 
supported, but viewing and consumption is generally 80% International, 
20% Domestic. And we'
ve got a lot of International growth to go before we 
can aspire to that point.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And let me just pick up on a question Peter asked earlier that sort of talks 
about where Amazon's taking the bundle and take
 
it from the perspective of 
incumbent MVPDs. You saw I'm sure, Reed, that Dish built another sling or is 
building another sling offer, sort of a low price point IP
-
delivered bundle of 
networks, DIRECTV is going to have three cheaper OTT launches later this
 
year. You're starting to see these things proliferate more. Does that change 
sort of your competitive position as you think about sort of this big pricing 
umbrella getting smaller over the next year plus and becoming more IP?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founde
r and CEO
 
No, those are all single nation solutions and we're really focused on global 
content and expanding globally. And so, I don't see really that much nexus 
between them. Again, as we said in the letter, when you think about your 
own experience of wha
t do you do some night if you're not watching Netflix? 
Once in a while, it's cable television. Once in a while, it's video gaming, it's 
browsing Facebook, killing time on the web generally. There's so much out 
there. So the only inhibitor in our growth is 
how great is our service, could 
we make it so there's never buffering so it always starts up instantly. So the 
recommendations are incredible, and the content is exciting. And if we can 
do all that, we'll continue to grow globally, even though HBO or Dish 
or 
others are also growing. So their growth doesn't take away from us.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne

Reed, can you explain, just for the record, why you guys went ahead and 
sort of reduced the quality
 
of streams on certain wireless carriers, and how 
that's different than the complaints you lodged against people like Comcast 
in the last couple of years?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
Sure, mobile generally has small data caps and very expensive 
per gigabyte 
charges, like $10 to $20 per gigabyte supplemental. And so, we wanted to 
save data for our users by using very tight and small encodes, especially 
when it's being watched on a 4
-
inch or 5
-
inch screen. And what we'll be 
adding going forward is 
an option so consumer can set, they want to do 
extreme data saving, moderate data saving, or no data saving at all. And so, 
we'll evolve to let the users just do it. But the advantage of doing it for 
people in the past was to save on 

 
to avoid those data 
plan overages that 
are pretty unique to mobile.

No, we've added lots of options over time to allow more customization. If

Ted, I want to ask you a little bit about your relationship with your major 
suppliers. You I'm sure see the 

 
or hear the rhetoric as we do growing out 
of Hollywood. Maybe start with Di
sney. How is that relationship today? 
They've obviously come under some pressure around ESPN and cord 
shaving. But is your relationship with Disney as strong as it's been? And 
should we expect that you may be able to expand your Marvel TV 
relationship in p
articular? I'd love to hear any sense for how Daredevil 
Season Two is performing and performed relative to the first season with 
that audience built.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
Sure, so I mean these have always been relatively complex rel
ationships 
where you are both supplier and sometimes competitor. So in the case of 
Disney, they're a major supplier and they're a producing partner where they 
produce our Marvel Defenders series. We just kicked off our fifth season of 
production on the sho
w. It's a very lucrative piece of business for Disney, 
obviously and a great partnership in that way. And there's no way to kind of 
isolate the two sets of businesses completely.
 
So while 

 
they're a great producing partner, they're a great licensing 
suppl
ier, and we're always trying to figure out ways that we don't bump into 
one another competitively, but sometimes, it's inevitable.
 
Daredevil Season Two was fantastic. The critics loved it. The viewing 
numbers have really grown. And we've added an enormous 
number of 
people to Daredevil Season One, both because of the excitement around 
Season Two and that we're in additional territories that didn't have the 
opportunity to see this show in the first go around. So it's been a real 
success and we're really excit
ed to be in business with them. And all of our 
suppliers either produced for us or licensed to us and probably compete with 
us on some level, and we're just always trying to navigate those waters, 
very similar to the way networks deal with one another and 
produce for one 
another.

And did the changes you're seeing out there impact the timing with which 
you may get to your 50/50 split of original spending and acquired? You 
throw out in the letter 5% of your
 
spending I think today is on films. How 
would you fit film spending inside of that 50/50 mix long
-
term?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos

Chief Content Officer
 
Well, right now, we're trying to compliment our film selection between 
aggressively ramping up our global 
originals, which some of the people want 
to see everywhere in the world. Plus licensing, we're opportunistic. We've 
been doing pickups of films at film festivals, particularly ones that have 
broader commercial appeal, like next month, we've a film called T
he 
Fundamentals of Caring with Paul Rudd that I think fans are going to really 
love when we launch that around the world.
 
And then, regionally, we're also doing some opportunistic licensing. As you 
know, we pick up the Disney Pay One output later this year
. And we also like 

 
just in this quarter, we'll have the Minions. We'll have Goosebumps. We'll 
have Hotel Transylvania 2. And we'll have the film that won the Academy 
Award for Best Picture, Spotlight, exclusively on Netflix in the U.S. So it will 
be hard
 
to comp against those kind of numbers as we're ramping up films 
because we still have a great selection of other films as well, but we're going 
to keep pushing it. There's no mandate or no initiative to how quickly we 
want to get there. And success, we ju
st want to keep pushing it forward.

I think it's mostly going to be an intense gaming format for a couple years 
due to the price of the consoles. So think of it li
ke the PlayStation 5 or the 
Xbox 2 or something. Its heritage to console gaming will be a lot of that 
market. And then everybody hopes that it matures into something that's 
lower cost and more ubiquitous. So I don't think it will have a direct effect 
on us
 
in the next couple years because I think the center point for VR will be 
other sorts of things than watching a TV show in a VR headset. I don't think 
that will be very popular.

David, turning to some of the financials, you gave some color for the year 
around contribution losses internationally, I think looking for something 
around $370 million for the year now, which is less than at least you had 
articulated and we had thoug
ht previously. What's driving that 
improvement? And it sounds like that's a focus for you as you head into next 
year. If you could, spend a little bit of time talking about what's moving the 
international losses lower and how that may trend into 2017.
 
Davi
d B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
It's nothing more than growing revenue faster than your content spend. So I 
think it's just the fact that we've got multiple markets now that are 
improving year on year in terms of growth and economics, and you stack 
th
em together and you got a picture where collectively they're covering any 
of the new markets that we could have launched this year and then next 
year or the year after. Depending on the size of that market, they could be 
covering them all. I think we're gi
ving ourselves a little bit of flexibility 
because the more of an opportunity we see, the more we may put back into 
the business in terms of additional investments and content.
 
But we feel like today that we can do all of that and still grow operating 
prof
it, which is why we can continue to make the statements about 
meaningful operating profit next year, but we feel like we can do both. So I 
don't think internally there isn't a different plan perhaps versus 
expectations. People felt like there might be high
er losses internationally, 
but it's been fairly consistent I'd say over the last three to six months.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings

Founder and CEO
 
And do you want to talk about the weakening of the dollar and how that 
affects us?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial
 
Officer
 
Sure. So we did highlight this in the letter. And you live by the currency, die 
by the currency in terms of the fluctuations. Last year we had a lot of 
headwinds, especially on the international revenue line. We had to explain 
why our internationa
l average subscription price was flat in certain quarters 
when it still was growing. This year we're seeing the reverse of that with the 
weakening of the dollar at least in the first part of the year here where our 
international contribution margin is bene
fiting from that. So we did highlight 
that for you in the letter. Thanks for pointing that out.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And, David, as a follow
-
up, you're doing more and more global deals. Can 
you just remind us how you're allo
cating licensing costs and whether that's 
having an impact on the quarterly movements in margin? You guys guided 
to I think a sequential margin step down in the U.S. How much is the 
allocation issues or allocation thought process impacting those moves?
 
Dav
id B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
Part of that, the U.S. P&L or the U.S. contribution margin, we've said this 
before, I'll reiterate it, is definitely benefiting from the fact that we're 
launching more in international markets. So the cost of that glob
al original 
that Ted talks about is being spread by more markets. There's some relief to 
the U.S. P&L.
 
And in terms of the allocation mechanism, it's really by media market value. 
In the early days, we were doing it by broadband households. That was 
overcharging certain markets where if you had a very knowledgeable, 
experienced media buyer in the market, they would say there's no way that 
anyone would pay for this particular title at this amount in the market. So 
we refined that to a media market valu
e that's validated by some third
-
party 
market survey information. I would say in general, it's vetted by our own 
buying team internally as to what would be paid for that particular title in 
the market.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
And then margin
 
being tight in Q2 is really related to the large amount of 
content and associated marketing for launching those content that we're 
very fortunate to have.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

You guys 
are moving people towards a $10 a month price point in the U.S. 
For the folks who have the $12 plan, what are they using that for? Are they 
using it to get high

def or are they using it for four streams. What's the 
usage pattern for those customers?
 
Wilmot
 
Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
Ultra high def 4K is becoming quite popular. We're the leading source of 
ultra high def content now. Ultra high def televisions are for sale at Best Buy 
and Costco. So we're seeing that ecosystem development. And then if yo
u 
pay $1,000 or $2,000 for a 4K TV, it's pretty natural to bump your Netflix to 
the $12 plan in the U.S. and about equal internationally to be able to get 
access to that 4K screens and see what your TV can really do.
 
Peter Kafka 
-
 
Re/code
 
And so that's the
 
majority of the people who are paying you $12 are using it 
for the ultra high def?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
That's right. The video quality is really the big driver. And similarly, our 
standard def plan, which is DVD quality, is great for pe
ople, $7.99, and so 
that's a really strong option too. So we're not trying to bias people. We're 
trying to help them make a choice that they feel great about and that they'll 
stay with. So think of us as really investing at both ends, the $7.99, $9.99, 
and
 
$11.99.
 
Peter Kafka

You spell out in your letter that the price hikes that are coming this month,

always the direction you were going?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings

That's always what we thought. It's a little bit cautious, but it won't hurt. We

spread it out.

David, just coming back, a couple more on the numbers. The contractual 
obligations were up to I think $12.3 billion at the end of the quarter, which 
was a bit of a jump from the e
nd of last year. Is that the Disney Pay One 
deal kicking in, or any other color you'd add as to why that number inflated 
a bit?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
It's really the Netflix global launch. So you got to think about it as we're 
adding mor
e content now for the rest of the world. It's our newer markets as 
we add more content, those markets are growing in content spend more 
quickly than some of our more established markets. So you combine those 
and I think what you'll find is if you take that
 
obligations number over our 
average membership for the quarter, it's still in that band of about $150, 
$160, and it really has only popped up this quarter because of that new 
launch, basically, of Netflix global.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
And
 
remember, on Disney we have Pay One today in Canada and then we'll 
be adding it this fall in the U.S.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Right. And just on the cash flow outlook, should we still be thinking about $1 
billion burn this yea
r and any color for next year, and when might Netflix 
generate substantial free cash flow?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
So no change on the outlook on either this year or next year. I would say $1 
billion is a pretty good guide for both 
this year and next year. And really, on 
free cash flow positive, it really depends on the size of the business. It 
depends on how much more we'll continue to grow the content, which does 
depend on the size of the business. So in that way, I will turn the q
uestion 
around and say, how big will we be? And then I'll tell you when we'll be free 
cash flow positive.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
It's how big we'll be, and then how crazy does Ted go on these productions. 
And what we found is that these rea
lly big productions, like The Crown are 
just terrific for us in global brand building. And so, we're very excited about 
being able to deploy the cash to create shows like that and like The Get 
Down that's coming this fall also.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief
 
Content Officer
 
Yeah, you should kind of think about it, though, that those big productions 
play a much more like a big blockbuster film in the fact that not only do they 
get more watching in the US, but they travel much better too. So you see in 
all thes
e non
-
English speaking territories, these series perform very well.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Well, Reed, I was going to ask you, because I think you were quoted in The 
Guardian talking about or predicting spectacular budgets for
 
TV series. Are 
your comments just now reflecting that expectation, and does that suggest 
any reduction in the return on spending that Ted's doing?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
No, I'd suggest an increase in return on spending if anything. That i
s when 
you spend on the big items, they go much, much further than a whole lot of 
substitutable content. So we're interested in both spectacular content and 
spectacular membership growth.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
Good answer.
 
Da
vid B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
And what we've found is that people globally love high production quality 
content.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
It's why U.S. content has traveled the world historically so well because of 
the producti
on value that you're seeing. So when you see things like, next 
month, we'll have our fourth season of Orange Is the New Black, that was 
kind of a surprise to most people in that it didn't have any of the established 
movie star talent that some of our other
 
shows have. But it had built up just 
on the quality of Jenji's storytelling. And then the spectacular cast and the 
ability to get to know them better, and then, as we enter its fourth season 
now, it's got tens of millions of fans around the world that can
't wait for that 
show.
 
Sometimes you can get that built
-
in excitement with somebody who brings 
their own draw and their own star power, like a Will Smith movie or a Brad 
Pitt movie that comes out, or Naomi Watts starring in a TV series for Netflix, 
or Drew
 
Barrymore starring in a TV series for Netflix. This is a way that 
people can more quickly get to know some of our newer IP.

Does that bigger better super

Theodore A. Sarandos

You should look at our original films as similar to a slate of studio films. And 
that's Fox did have Star Wars distributors, they also had Brook
lyn. And they 
had a lot of things in between. And that's what we're looking at too.
 
Whether or not a movie at the Star Wars level makes sense yet, we'll see, 
but we're ramping up. You saw recently that we announced that we're doing 
the next Will Smith movi
e called Bright, with David Ayer directing, which is a 
big budget summer movie. In fact, it will be David and Will as soon as 
they've come up of Suicide Squad. That's their next film. And it will premiere 
on Netflix in 2017, included in your subscription c
osts. So while we're all

that mean anything to y
ou? Is that something you guys could participate in?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
No, like I said, we wouldn't mind having our films available on that product 
to the extent that people want to see it. Our focus is on movie lovers and 
movie 
fans, and trying to get them the content that they want at reasonable 
prices in great windows. So for us, being able to produce our own films gives 
us more control over those windows and the quality of the films themselves. 
So Screening Room to me would be
 
a great way to get content in front of 
consumers if they're willing to pay for it.

Reed, you've talked historically about a 60 million to 90 million subscriber 
opportunity 
in the U.S. And I'm just wondering as you sit here today, if you 
can update us on your expectations long term in the U.S. market. Is there 
anything that you think needs to happen that isn't happening today to get 
you there? For example, whether MVPD set
-
to
p broad distribution in the U.S. 
from, say, a new Charter or Comcast would really help accelerate the growth 
in the United States?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
It helps a little bit. We are integrated with Suddenlink in the U.S., which is 
about 1
 
million subscribers. And of course, in Europe we're integrated in 
many platforms. But think of it as the fundamental draw of Internet TV. You 
can get it on a Smart TV, you can get it on an Apple TV. So there's a lot of 
ways around it where we don't have t
hat distribution on cable. But it's one 
more platform, and all platforms are good. It's not something we need to 
say get to 60 million to 90 million subscribers. And we're continuing to see 
just that steady growth. To have 2.25 million net additions in the
 
U.S. in Q1, 
basically the same as the prior two years, it just felt great. So we're really 
excited about what the new content as it builds is able to do for us.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And, Ted, one of the things we hear from 
particularly investors in Europe is 
just that there's a limit to how far U.S. exports can get you. I don't know 
whether you agree or disagree with that, but I'm just wondering if you think, 
particularly in markets like Europe and France who might have let'
s say 
unique content tastes, that you need to go more local with your spending in 
those markets than maybe some of the early international markets, for 
example.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
I do think that what's popular in a market is much
 
more a reflection on 
what's been available to that market over long periods of time. So what 
we've been really encouraged by is just how international our original series 
have been. So you take non
-
English speaking territory, you spoke about 
Brazil earlie
r, and not only is it non
-
English speaking, it's a non
-
Spanish 
speaking Latin American territory. And in the last 30 days, eight of the top 
10 most watched things in Brazil have been Netflix original series. So these 
shows play very well, throughout Europe
 
as well.
 
Now that being said, we think it's worth it to complement the selection by 
focusing on some local productions in those territories throughout Europe 
and throughout Latin America. So where Reed had mentioned, but on May 5, 
we'll launch Marseilles,
 
which is our first French language show filmed in 
France, starring Gérard Depardieu. We're also filming original series in 
Spain, in Brazil, in Italy. So we are definitely investing in local language 
content, particularly in those markets that have shown 
some desire for more 
local programming, but as a complement to our global offering.
 
Benjamin Daniel Swinburne 
-
 
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
 
And, David, does that mean by default those markets may be lower margin 
than the U.S. market long term?
 
David B. Wells 
-
 
Chief Financial Officer
 
No, I don't think that's what Ted's saying. I don't think you can equate the 
two. Even when we're looking for a local original like Marseilles, we're 
considering the economics of that production based on the total French 
diaspora,
 
so not just people in France, but people outside of France that are 
interested in French language content. So I don't think you can 

 
you can't 
necessarily equate those two. And we preference the content when we're 
developing those local originals for thi
ngs that have potential demand 
outside of the original market that it's produced in.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings 
-
 
Founder and CEO
 
And our Japanese original, Hibana, for example, we're launching this 
quarter. And that will be available globally, so think of all t
hat content where 
we're developing it locally, distributing it globally, and connecting the world 
through that. And we think that's a very powerful formulation that will help 
us grow for many years ahead.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos

Chief Content Officer
 
The Ma
rseilles example, Gérard Depardieu is the biggest star in France and 
one of the biggest stars in the world. And we have about 2 million people in 
the U.S. who watch French language television regularly on Netflix. So that's 
where we're talking about the sc
ale that we could bring to a production like 
that for France and Europe, but really for the world.

Showtime, Starz, you guys, Amazon. Crackle is getting into it. Verizon is 
spending a lot of money. CBS All Access, I've got a list. And that's just in the 
U.S. Does that number continue to get bigg
er in perpetuity, or does it 
retract at some point? People say all right, we've overdone it, we're going to 
pull back on this matter.

It's hard to tell. People talk about the growing content spend. But what 
we're able
 
to do is find the shows and get the shows that we want, and we 
do have to pay a lot for them. But coming back to the phrase earlier, they're 
really spectacular, what we're doing. And I think when you see Orange, 
when you see The Get Down, when you see The
 
Crown, you'll know why 
we're investing what we do.

Peter, I think it's a debate around how to best monetize your content. And if 
you believe you can, over the long haul, best monet
ize your content with 
your own app, then you'll go that path. If you believe you can best monetize 
it by licensing it to Netflix, go that path.

What's been the feedback init
ially from members around your price points in 
the rest of world markets you launched in January? Obviously, relatively 
expensive versus existing sort of Pay TV or entertainment options, any 
thought about changing your sort of global price point approach i
n those 
markets?
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings

Founder and CEO
 
We really haven't seen price be much of an issue. But then today, we're 
serving English language speaking elites around in these countries. So in the 
model of what we're doing, in targeting the high e
nd, the price is fine. We'll 
see over the coming years and we expand, and we may need some flexibility 
eventuality, but nothing in the short term. Why don't we do the last two 
questions here?

I was 
just going to quickly follow up on that topic, and I'll hand it back to 
Peter for the last one. David, you guys are working on more local language 
offerings, better payment processes, other kind of operational improvements 
in those rest of world markets. W
hat's the timing there? Should we be 
thinking about that through the remainder of this year, or is it a longer term 
timeframe?
 
David B. Wells

It's both. So you'll see some this year, but really it's about the next two 
years to thr
ee years in terms of improvement. We've only just started 
skimming these markets. So we'll be looking at them opportunity by 
opportunity, and you'll see some this year, but you'll see some continued 
into next year and even into 2018 I think. But we have a 
big opportunity in 
front of us, as Reed pointed out. Many of our Internet peers have a 
dramatically larger business outside of the U.S. versus inside the U.S. So 
we're pretty excited about that opportunity.
 
Theodore A. Sarandos

And 
I think one of the really exciting parts about being in all these countries 
is being able to discover the next great storyteller for the world. So because 
we're more focused thinking about India where we weren't thinking about 
that at all a couple of years
 
ago, we acquired this great film at Braham 
Naman at Sundance this year that we will be premiering around the world in 
June, and it really is a discovery of a great Indian director named Q who I 
think everyone is going to be talking about over the next few
 
years and 
having that kind of global sensibility increasingly is going to help 
programming for everybody, not just the subscribers in those countries.
 
Wilmot Reed Hastings

Founder and CEO
 
And so in a movie like Braham Naman, it's an English show, it's a
ccessible to 
many people. But YouTube has over 50 languages, we only have about 20. 
So that scales for you roughly how far we've got to go.

You guys are moving into more 
and more kids' content. Does it make sense 
for you eventually own the IP yourself, instead of licensing it through Disney 
or Dreamworks so you can create ancillary revenue streams?
 
Theodore A. Sarandos 
-
 
Chief Content Officer
 
We do a lot of both. The consu
mer products addition to those projects 
relative to the content value itself is pretty small. We can look to optimize 
that stuff down the road. In Q2, we're launching nine seasons of original 
kids' content, including a new season of All Hail King Julien, w
hich is 
nominated for a Daytime Emmy. This year, we have 33 Daytime Emmy 
nominations for our kids' content across seven of our different shows. So 
we're really focused on building up the quality of that programming that's 
exclusive and original to Netflix.

So to wrap up here, I want to thank Peter Ka
fka who's been with us these 
last few calls and is retiring from this side job. And thank you for your 
involvement in this. And to all the investors, thank you for your support. We 
had just a great quarter with 6.5 million net adds over 81 million 
subscrib
ers. We cannot wait to breakthrough 100 million subscribers 
sometime next year. It's going to be a big celebration. We're looking forward 
to it. So thank you very much.

Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO, Reed Hastings; our new CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, 
Ted Sarandos; and our Chief 
Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer 
this quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS. As a reminder, we will be making

looking statements and actual results may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to you, Eric, for the first question.

Eric Sheridan
 
Thanks so much Spencer. And since, Spence, you are new to the Netflix 

congratulations on the role as the new CFO of Netflix. Maybe give us
 
your 
perception of why the role intrigued you in terms of moving to Netflix? What 
your first perceptions are? And some of the things you plan on making a 
focus for your tenure as the CFO at Netflix?
 
Spence Neumann
 

 
excited to be here. A part of what 

to the high ended product quality and ambition, and Netflix has all of that 



lot of listening and learning, really planning to do that for probably the first 
60 days or so for sure.
 

ation and 
collaboration across this company, all aspects of the company, combined 
with speed of decision
-
making and moving forward has been really unique to 

the team, not just my d
irect team, but across the board again, and their 
passion and commitment to continue to innovate and improve, improving 
the content offering, elevating the level of the 

 
and quality of service we 
deliver to our members and not just our existing members, b
ut our new 
members and really driving that positive flywheel for our members and 
ultimately for our business.
 

all of the folks around the company for being patient and helping m
e with 
my onboarding. And really one just a quick special shout out to David Wells. 


friend, a collea
gue and a resource for me.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Great. Maybe since we are at the end of one year and the beginning of 

What were the big learnings of 2018? What were the things that that 
you felt 
the company really attacked in the marketplace in 2018? And as you look 
out to 2019 and beyond, what are those big opportunities? What are those 
big challenges? What are you trying to focus the entire management team 
around in terms of executing a
gainst the plan looking forward for Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings

Eric Sheridan
 
Fair enough. Ob
viously, I think almost every conversation each quarter 
starts with performance of the business. We saw strong subscribers in the 
quarter, strong comments about the way subscribers should continue to 
start the year in 2019. Throwing and open to the broader
 
team maybe 
starting with Reed, but what did you see on the subscriber landscape as you 
look down to what 

 
the way the business performed in Q4, and what kind of 

2019?
 
Reed Hast
ings
 
When you look at the chart we put in our earnings letter, which has the 



ainment market is just growing, so 

 
Spence Neumann
 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Do you want add anything?
 
Spence Neumann
 

would say the oth
er facet I would highlight is that the strength in 
membership growth was really broad based geographically. So, really thrilled 



 
any one single territory or any one sin
gle country, but really 
broad based and I think that reflects the global nature of the secular drivers 
that we have, which is adoption of broadband globally and the adoption of 
on
-
demand entertainment globally.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
And maybe following up on that 
is there anything, and maybe this is for a 
combination of Reed and Ted, was there anything on the local language 

about how local language content is driving adoption of the prod
uct on a 
global scale. Anything to call out there you saw in the quarter that should 
portend well for 2019?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

things that are playing out and you see the numbers of 

you 
see a big 
number like Bird Box and You, these shows are playing incredibly globally. 

is something, which gets me very excited about the potential scale of the 
content business 
when the world is excited about something.
 
And then on the local language side, it shows like Elite that can play very, 
very strong in their home country, like in Spain, but also play 

 
play really 
well throughout the Spanish speaking world and ultimately 
through the 

stars from anywhere in the world for the rest of the world is something that 

the results i

 
Eric Sheridan
 


Q1 in the U.S. market. Always curious what goes into the thought process 
around raising price on the serv
ice, how confident you are that customers 
are ready to absorb a higher price for the service when you look out? So, 
maybe, Reed, I could start with your perspective on how you think about 
pricing the product in the marketplace and what it means for subscri
ber 
momentum going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Greg Peters
 

our job is to effectively invest the money that our subscribers give us every 
month, so that we can g
ive them incredible content in a better and better 
product experience. And if we do that well, we create more value for our 

little bit more money, so that we can actually start that 
next cycle of 
investment.
 

engagement levels and a bunch of other things to try and understand what 

accurate and the price 

 
Eric Sheridan
 
Well, I want to follow up with you Greg on this, because if you look versus a 
year ago, tremendous level of push on the personalization side and the 
service, more focus on mobile on the pro

the last 12 months. Were those some of the things you saw that that 
allowed you to see either higher engagement, new use cases emerging along 
the subscriber base? What did you see in some of those product 
developments th
at that fed into maybe a pricing discussion?
 
Greg Peters
 

trying to think about every way we can make the product experience better 

hanges, where we give 
them a higher quality experience. We also do things like we give them 
previews and the ability to sort of like do some sampling of content ahead of 

mentioned l
ike increasing. Well, we think about is more like how do we tell a 
story about each of the story.
 
So when we have a new show coming on how do we effectively 
communicate what we think is going to be relevant to each of our 
subscribers in a strong way. So, t
hey can get excited about those shows as 
well. So, those dimensions and really many, many others, where we just 

so we can increase price. Within those things, we can just creat
e more fun 

be able to invest more in content and making more product experience 
benefits.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe just one more for you, Greg, before moving on, one of the things we 
noti
ced in the quarter was Netflix moved up the app download charts with 
respect to mobile smartphones in the iOS world. Always been a very 
downloaded app on the iPad front and the tablet front and smart TVs. Was 
there anything you guys did in terms of either 
pivoting the business more 
towards phone in the quarter and to start 2019? Is there anything on the 
product side you want to call out, because it seems like a pretty pronounced 

 
Greg Peters
 
Yes. nothing re
ally specific and I think it really speaks more to just the 
general relevance that the application has and as you see us sort of 
accelerate in terms of subscriber additions and more members around the 
worlds using the service. Those members are using it on
 
mobile in large part 

we think is happening there.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Okay, Ted, following up on what Greg just said there, with the price increase 
going through and there has been other 
jurisdictions when you put price 
increases through and talking around similar frameworks, margins and free 
cash flow than you had talked about previously. I think the natural 
conclusion some of us have is the incremental investment dollar is going into 
con

being generated by the business going into on the content side, and how 
should we think about content investments in 2019 versus 2018?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

ore of the same, but on a continued larger 

it definitely changes the economics in terms of licensing films and later 
windows versus producing films, which is a more kind of fron
t
-
loaded cash 
activity, but has a much better payback for us. And when you have 
something like Bird Box, the ability to invest in the next one is just all about 

 
all the greater. And I think in local language content investments improved 

 
continuing to i
mprove the markets that are emerging for us both in the 
markets at scale around everyone kind of like some of the same things and 
other markets that are more unique content tastes like in Korea and Japan 

-
tun

offering those markets as well.
 
Greg Peters
 
And Eric, just to add on specifically to narrowly answer your question on 


 
expense 
line item guidance, but I will say that it 
was $7.5 billion in content 
amortization in 2018. And I think you can obviously expect that to grow and 
the trajectory should be pretty similar. But the other thing to bear in mind is 

9 
by about 300 basis points year
-
over
-
year to 13%. So, those will work 

well.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And then we do see that payback Eric, as Greg mentioned earlier, an 
increased engagement, s
o which again continuing the virtuous cycle, where 


 

are finding content that they love and the more they have value in the 
service.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Well, speaking to higher engagement, I
 
think in reading the release, I was 
legitimately stunned that there was more viewership data in this release, 

lot of content that outperformed maybe expectations, but what d
rove some 
of the new sort of qualitative and quantitative commentary in this 
shareholder letter around engagement and viewership around key pieces of 
property?
 
Spence Neumann
 
I would look at it like these are less financial metrics as they are cultural 
met
ric. So that what does it mean when 80 million households watch Bird 
Box? Well, culturally it means exactly the same thing as 80 million plus 
people buying a movie ticket to seeing it or 80 million households watching a 

fully out there. People talking about it, 
tweeting about it, posting about it, challenging each other, do different 
things, which we want people to be very careful when they do. But really 




 
you get 

 



 
so we gave you some 
numbers out to give you some sense of the scale and the scope of it. I think 

or artists to understand 

 
to have the audience also 

ramping up a little bit more and more and giving out, sharing a little more of 
that information.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And then, 
Eric, we also included this analysis of the total TV entertainment 
market in the United States. Just to point out how large a market that is 
about a billion hours a day enjoying television, against gaming platforms, 
linear, DVD, Netflix, everything. And we


broad uses. And we did it on television, because television is 100% 
entertainment time, whereas mobile phones and laptops are some percent 
enterta
inment and some percent work and communication activities. So that 

 


 


is a great mark for us.
 
Greg Peters
 
Eri





 
at a time whe

the box office by way of example, the North American box office has grown 
in the fourth quarter. So 

 


ve you some idea 
of the scale of that and how to put it in context.
 
Reed Hastings
 
No doubt driven by the theatrical revisions of ROMA.
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes, yes.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe going back to the product side and Greg, when you hear about the 
engagement you

understand a little bit of how the product might evolve. I mean, I think, one 
of the most unique things in the quarter was the interactivity of the Black 
Mirror product. Would love to talk about b
oth the product side within Netflix 
and then on the content creation side as Ted talks to content partners about 
how that interactivity is something new, interesting and might spur 
engagement, product development and content relationships.
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes.
 

and the flexibility of our distribution platform and trying to figure out how do 
we use those things to innovate on storytelling in a storytelling format. And 

 
be able to do that in a way, which to your point drives 

Bandersnatch. But also sort of extends the pallet and the portfolio, the 

ng with in the years 



talk about 
from a content perspective.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

storytelling in the last couple of decades. And I would tell you that this one 

en talking to 



 


al
l kinds of storytelling and some of the greatest storytellers in the world are 



s that they could go and end up with. And 
that is an incredible challenge and of usually exciting thing that differentiates 
Netflix for creators.
 
Greg Peters
 

to bring technolo
gy to bear, to create a toolset for creators to make that 
process easier and more effective.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Right.
 
Reed Hastings
 

percentage of people chose Frosties versus Sugar Pu
ffs. The answer is 73% 
for Frosties.
 
Greg Peters
 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
It was critical data point of the quarter.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Completely anecdotal, but the Sheridan House picked Frosties multi
ple 



turn to you when say, when yo
u think about the free cash flow profile of the 
business, some of the commentary in the letter around improving free cash 
flow from 2019 and beyond, how do you think about funding the business, 
the approach the business has always taken to the capital mark
ets? Any 
perspective you have that you think might be different than in the past? Or 

sort of the funding in the capital structure side of the equation albeit new to 
the role?
 
Spenc
e Neumann
 
Sure. So, well, first, we feel great about our content investment. It really is 
investment that is as even as you 

 
as we talked about those viewing 
numbers and characteristics that speaks to at some degree the return on 
those content 
investments, the return on that capital. We feel really good 
about that as obviously the move to more owned content and production has 
pulled forward some of that spend relative to the former operating model or 
predominantly licensed model.
 
So that has put pressure on the cash flows of the business and cash needs 
of the business over the past few years, but when you saw on the letters 
that we 

 
the negative cash flow in the business of roughly $3 billion in 

lar levels in 2019 and then to meaningfully 
improve that trajectory going forward. So that comes with driving the 
subscribers in the business, driving the revenues, driving the 

 
scaling the 

le of 
years ago to 10% last year and committing to 13% operating margins in 
2019 and beyond.
 
So, this is a business with characteristics that that certainly allow for very 
healthy operating margins going forward. You can look at almost any 
benchmark of a c
omparable type of company. And so, we feel very good 
about the operating leverage in the business long
-
term, ultimately turning 
that into a much more positive contributor and conversion into cash flow. 
And ultimately, our aspiration is to be self
-
funding. 
And we believe we will 
do that over time with these content investments.
 


accessed the debt markets to do that a

that that is the optimal cost of financing and funding to
-

continue to pursue that path.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Great. too back on the price increase and the subscriber forecast for Q1, just 
want to make sure there
 
is a clarification point. Number one, in the 
shareholder letter, you talked about the price increase going into effect 
during Q1 and Q2, if I remember correctly, the last time there was a price 
increase, it went into effect over a 12
-
month period. Maybe j
ust to 
understand a little bit, what the mechanics are of the price increase, so 
people can understand some of the decision process behind that, maybe how 
it flows through the numbers in the first half of 2019?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. I can take that Eric. So,
 
with respect to the price changes, in the U.S., 
the new pricing goes into effect for new members, existing members will be 

course of the year and what that means is that will obvi
ously impact the rate 
of net addition growth in the first half of the year. But commensurately, you 

what we think will drive an acceleration in revenue growth over the course of 
2019.
 

sequentially over the course of the year to enable us to hit that 13% target 
for the full year.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe one followup that that came through from investors just thinking 
through the 
price increases, it was reported in 

 
or speculated in the press 
over the last couple of days was how it might inform forward subscriber 

similar level in Q1 versus Q4 and yet 
you are putting a price increase in 
place. The last time you did that, there was a fair bit of conservatism in the 
forward guide. How should we reconcile maybe the framework for guidance 
versus the price increase going into the marketplace? How should inve
stors 
interpret that?
 
Reed Hastings
 

philosophy. And as we write every quarter, our approach is to strive for 
accuracy and our guidance forecast. And to do that, we take into account all 
the
 



the color I provide you with
 
respect to that question.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Great. 2018, which we talked about in the last interview and it has been a 
topic through the year was the year you framed as a company of testing and 
learning on the marketing front, possibly pivoting away from fewe
r 
subscriber acquisition, pivoting more towards spending money on the 
marketing side against your brand, individual pieces of content. What did 
you, as a company, learned this year as you went through that process 
about the way to allocate marketing dollar
s on a global scale to arrive at the 
most optimum outcome of subscriber additions, promoting brand, promoting 
content, driving engagement, and how should we apply those lessons as we 
think out to the way marketing might be a sort of trajectory through 2019
 
and beyond?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Almost all of our investments are promoting these incredible new titles we 


some straight
 
acquisition targeted marketing that we also spend, but the 
bulk of it is around promoting the incredible new titles and getting them 
broadly launched.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Great. And Greg maybe following up with you when not just when you think 
about marketing d
ollars, but also when you think about distributing the 
product broadly, I think this was a year 2018, where you struck a lot of 
partnerships to help on the distribution front, love to start with Greg, but 
love to have anyone chime in that feels they should
 
on what some of those 
partnerships brought to the platform in 2018. How you think some of those 
partnerships are set up to aid platform awareness and distribution in 2019 
and beyond, and how you think about the scalability for more of those 
partnerships w
hen you look out over the next couple of years?
 
Greg Peters
 

that long thread of increasingly using partners in different ways to promote 
the service and to make it easier for memb
ers and members to be to sign 

March from integration on devices and just makes that a point to engage 
with the service to doing things like billing, on behalf of or we do billi
ng 



because we beli
eve it allows us to access a segment of consumers, who are 

or early adopters.
 

a set
-
top box, which ar
e using to access a bunch of other video content and 
by including the Netflix subscription in a package of either their mobile 
subscription or pay
-
TV subscription, we can make it just super, super simple 
for those folks to get to know Netflix and to enjoy 
the kind of big shows that 

 





the total organic subscriber acquisition that we have.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I could add back to your last question, Eric. Those distribution p
artners 
turned out to be great promoters of our content brands as well.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
And maybe, one followup, when you do those partnerships, has there been 

home broadband space, pa
rtnering with infrastructure companies or on the 
multiple telephony front in promoting mobile usage and mobile engagement 

the type of partner?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I would say every mark
et is different and every partner is different in terms 


 

their subscribers and how we can link that message with the Netflix message 
as well. but so nothing stands out thematically 
or sort of a general trend that 
I would say, but each one is incremental and so we look to do more of all 
kinds.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe going back to the shareholder letter, one phrase in the shareholder 
letter that Ted, I wanted to ask you about, the 
phrase less focused on 
second run programming. I think one of the big investor debates and 
questions around Netflix becomes what happens to licensed content that 
may come off the platform in 2019 and beyond. How you plan for that 
content coming off the pla
tform? What it means for investments? What it 
means for engagement? Maybe reflect upon that statement in the 
shareholder letter and how it informs maybe the mix shift or the planning 
process for content as you look out to 2019 and beyond.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well
, most of those licensing deals are multiyear. So, it gets 

 
that gets 
caught up in our long
-

that content. remember our early investment in doing original content more 
than six years ago was betting that t
his would be, there would come a day 
when the studios and networks may opt not to license us content in favor of 
maybe creating their own services, which was 

 

we saw around a few years ago.
 

y of the content that is watched on Netflix 
are our original content brands. We do license a lot of second run content 


 
of 
watching, but that if you stack all those, all of that viewing, sort of like a top 

primarily by our original content brands. We are still a buyer in that second 
run market. We bo
th are pre
-
buyer, been buying it before the shows come 
out and sometimes an aftermarket buyer, but it really is up to the sellers 
whether or not they want to continue to sell.
 
Reed Hastings
 

riginals 

where a majority of the viewing is a branded original, in the other categories 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
And two years ago,
 


 
Reed Hastings
 

of content as well. So, the viewing is quite diverse
 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
Next, through our originals as well.
 
Spence Neumann
 


 
Eric Sheridan
 
Waterfa
ll and cliff, right?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I am on a roll.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Go ahead.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe following up one more piece of the content side, one question that 
came into me as the moderator of this quarter in a couple of different ways 
was how to think 
about ownership of content versus co
-
production of 
content, what the right mix shift of that is medium
-
to
-

some of the pros or cons are of the approach of either doing co
-
production 
versus outright ownership and how we should think about
 
that developing 
over the next couple of years?
 
Reed Hastings
 

said 

 

different business models depending on wh

going to do is make the best show and not be stuck on the business model, 

spend any time thinking about it.
 
So by way of example, last year, we had 140 dif
ferent shows around the 
world that premiered on A network somewhere and on Netflix everywhere 

combination of co
-
producing with local producers in other countries; it shows 
that then ai
r on a network in that country and then premier on Netflix. But 
when I say co
-
production, I mean, we come in at the script stage, we come 

that show.
 
Bodyguard is a good example o
f that, that we produced with ITV that the 
BBC premiered in the UK and that at the same time. we released it on 
Netflix around the world, and we produced it together at the script stage. 

it is a 
netflix original show and in the UK, we follow a broadcast window from the 

One additional data point, we have over 23 million households have watched 
bodyguard in Netflix in 

a show from anywhere in the world to the rest of the world. And we do other 
ones where we just are whereby territories. There use to be a tradition in 
television, where the network would make one show 
and then the 

 
they 
take it to MACE 

 
to the MACE screenings and try to sell market after market 

producers and networks now to pre

buy or co
-
produce for the rest of the 
world. A similar e
volution to the old studio film business, where the studios 
used to carry the international rights until they sold them and then they 
more frequently now go out and do international co
-
productions.

Eric, I think we have time for one more que
stion please.

Sure. And maybe turning it back to Reed, I think one of the more interesting 
sections in the shareholder letter, Reed, was you talked about the 
competitive landscape, big question, big debate. We get a lot from 
investors. 
You talked about it a lot of ways all ships rising, but talk a little bit about the 
landscape. What do you see out there on the landscape to attract user 
retention, user engagement, monetization, attract content creators, and how 
you think that 
competitive landscape will evolve and how do you think about 
navigating it from not only just 2019, but for the longer
-
term, Reed?
 
Reed Hastings
 
All ships rising as a little Pollyanna, optimistic, I think about it really is as 
winning time away, entertainm
ent time from other activities. So, instead of 
doing Xbox or Fortnite or youTube or HBO or a long list, we want to win and 
provide a better experience. No advertising on demand. Incredible content. 
And so when you think of just the U.S. terms as an example


about 10% of it.
 

their launch and maybe they grow over a couple of years to 50 million hours 
a day

these different providers that any one provider entering, only makes a 

on any one competitor and really thi
nk our best way is to win more time by 



nd so to wrap up

Surprise guest. So, Reed and the group was great to give me this sort of last 

1



confidence in Spence. We spent
 

great for the next phase of Netflix growth so 

 
and just really thanks. 
Thanks to all the investors. Thank you.

4/22/14,Netflix,"This is David Wells. I am the CFO of Netflix, and I am welcoming you to the 
2014 Q4 Earnings Interview. Joining me today is Reed Hastings, our CEO; 
and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer is joining us from Miami at the 
National Association of 
Television Executives Meeting. Also at that meeting is 
Michael Nathanson and with too many conflicts. So reprising his role as 
interviewer today is Rich Greenfield, analyst from BTIG and joining him is 
Mark Mahaney from RBC.
 
We will be making forward
-
looki
ng statements today. Actual results may 
vary. I am going to turn you over to Mark who has our first question.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Thanks David. Question to start off for Reed. You talked about an S curve 
and the ability to get to 
60 million to 90 million subs in the U.S. you beat the 
sub
-
numbers for the quarter but there is a year
-
over
-
year reduction in net 
sub adds. So, walk us through what your latest thinking is on the ability to 
Netflix to reach 60 million to 90 million U.S. su
bs?
 
Reed Hastings
 

million a year. So the trajectory is great. And if you step back and you say is 

pretty 

just continuing to improve our service.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
This is a question for Reed. When you think about the international growth 
profile, the comments that you made in terms of the caden
ce of market 
launch is basically saying that every single market would be launched over 
the course of the next two years was a pretty big move from what I think we 
were expecting and what I think investors were expecting. Was there 
something that happened 
when you looked at the success you were having 

happen? How fast you planned on rolling out the rest of the world to get you 
over the next two years?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes Rich, there is two
 

Argentina, the Finland to have all of our first wave of markets from Canada, 
Latin America, Nordics, Netherlands, UK and Ireland, be profitable together 

 
And that the growth rate 


to figure out how to start to get global rights for some of the cont
ent by 


across 200 countries but instead can provide to produce our upfront money, 
guaranteed money and get g
reat access. And so Ted do you want to add to 
that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I mean, I think our success this year with Better Call Saul and Gotham 
where we had moved up the process, license for all of our operating 
territories at our future operating territories
 
directly with the producers for 
those shows. So Better Call Saul directly with Sony and Gotham directly with 
Warner Television instead of having to go country
-
by
-
country and piling up 
those deals and lining up windows, this enables us to make the service,
 
the 
selection, far more global for viewers around the world who increasingly 
know exactly when these shows began and are hungry to see them as soon 
as they can.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Question for Reed or David on the international sub numbers, they came in 
materia

higher than expected numbers for the March quarter. Can you give us any 
color on which markets and which countries did better than expected? Or is 
this just a case of the European launch 
being a little more delayed than 

from?
 
David Wells
 

talk specifically about individual markets for competitiv
e reasons. But I 


fourth quarter and carrying into the first quarter.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
And if I can just foll
ow up David on that question on Latin America though, 
you did give out a 5 million subscriber, that you would reach 5 million 
subscribers during the quarter in Latin America. Could you give us any other 
feel or are there any other milestones to think about
 
as you think about 


without more detail overseas?
 
David Wells
 

ng our milestones as we hit 

consumers in Latin America because it validates the quality, the breadth and 

he 
market. So we weigh between the investment community and the consumer 

 
Rich Greenfield
 
Like what change that actually accelerated because it was an area that you 
talked about as a prob
lem historically on these calls. Why is Latin America 
now accelerating to the point where you are now really getting excited about 
the growth potential.
 
David Wells
 
Well nothing changed, so we knew we would hit 5 million in the quarter and 
we did. What cha
nged? Maybe, that we gave you incremental information. I 
think what we said all along in terms of Latin America it was a challenging 

-

wrestled with and improved over the last three to 

growing all along, I think folks may not have taken us at our word for that 


mil
lion broadband households. So if you take that 5 million number that we 
talked about and 65 million in terms of addressable, we think we got a lot of 
room for growth in the market.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
David I am going to follow
-
up on the global expansion little b
it. Two things 
you bolded in this press release was this line about completing global 
expansion over the next two years. I noticed bolded stuff. And so I guess 
the question is I know you talked about this a little before. It sounds like you 
may be buying i
nternational content or getting content for international 
markets more efficiently. But there are other learnings from some of the 
international markets, the launch as you have had to date that have allowed 
you to be more efficient and rolling out new mark

pretty big statement to make and fairly big change just over the last 90 
days.
 
David Wells
 
Sure Mark. I think, one thing that I would add to what Reed and Ted talked 
about in terms of our incremental confidence in 
international is that our 
originals programming continues to be highly engaged across markets 
outside the U.S. We thought it might be based on the type of content that 

another year of e
xperience in Originals, we see that the Originals are in the 
top list of content watched in all those markets. So it gives us more 
confidence that when we make something we produce, we incur those 
production costs. But it will be an asset that can be enjoy
ed across markets 
and across a bigger and bigger set of international markets.
 
I would say the incremental lessons for us have been the payments lessons 

separately because they all se
em to have different challenges. The types of 


license upfront? What to add in terms of licensing over 12, 24 mont
hs to 
make the content better and better.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
A follow
-
up and just bring the question back to Reed then. So Reed is the 
point that Netflix is really selling two universal goods. One is streaming and 
the second is streaming of this content that has
 
universal appeal, a lot of 
which is U.S. content, but not all of it but the most popular shows in one 
market pretty much largely transferred to be the pretty top content in other 
markets as well. Is that the kind of the secret sauce?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well ce
rtainly first part of what you said which is the magic of streaming is 
on demand the control being able to binge on episodes, watch a movie in the 
middle of the night. And that is a very universal truth which is even stronger 
in developing markets where te
levision is not as advanced as it might be say 
in the U.S. or France. And so the more that we expand out of that foot print 

 

ex
perience in Western Europe and Latin America. There is some content like 


piece of content will carry equally
 

on how there is a segment at the market in every country that follows 


o our 

-
thirds impact. And Ted may be you can add some color on how we look at 
the markets beyond Western Europe?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, this has been so encouraging how truly global th
ese brands have been. 
So when we set out our original program for the beginning, obviously our 
markets were pretty limited and we were thinking about them mostly as 

been really enthused
 
to see particular in our Western European launches 
shows like Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, even in later 

seeing them yet and we could get the brand out there and push 
it out there. 
And then Marco Polo was kind of global phenomenon as well.
 
So for us it was very encouraging that what the world really wants is high 
quality, great production values, great story telling and that can be truly 
universal. It might be that ther
e are some cultural barriers to U.S. content 

continue to see our original programming travel and carry the Netflix brand 
around the world.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
There is a question for Ted, 
because you bring up Marco Polo. I think the 
impact on the fourth quarter is really important to own in on. We got a lot of 
questions mailed into us basically with the sentiment of how much of a drag 
was Marco Polo and the negative reaction on Q4 subscribe
r metrics. The 
negative press impacted negatively gross additions. And then tied to that as 

much of your guidance for Q1 benefits from season 3 of House of Cards 
globally? I think last yea
r you made a comment that season 2 had a much 
bigger impact on gross additions then the prior year. Did that follow through 
again for season three?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

that people have
 
been heard before even if they get excited about it or 

Polo had some negative reactions in the press. Viewers have loved it and the 
volume of viewing has been phenomenal. The rate
 
at which people are 
completing the show is comparable to our other big ten original shows, so 


big anticipat
ion before subscriber impact. House of Cards season two, 
Orange is the New Black season two and Arrested Development have been 

growth with their launches. And I think as we go forw
ard with season three 
of House of Cards and season three of Orange is the New Black. Daredevil 
has a built in fan base for Marvel. Our feature film Crouching Tiger, Hidden 

thos
e kind of impacts that we saw from season twos in the past.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
Because part of the fear is that the marketing benefit that came along with 
the originals that have good reviews, had a big impact on just building the 
Netflix brand and obviously 
Marco Polo maybe is getting critical 
--
 

getting good consumer reviews, but the critical press for the media, the 
general entertainment media does seem to be excited about it the way have 
been about your prior originals?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I find it ha
rd to believe that. You can build sustainably on things that get 
well reviewed and not watched. So I am thrilled that this is getting watched 
and loved and I think that is a sustainable.
 
Reed Hastings
 

social media that 
comes out of that. So if you look at the commentary from people to their 


investor audience t
ends to be highly educated and that really skews towards 

marketing to me kind of things where House of Cards to the investor 

Marco Polo has 
been a great success and we renewed it for season two.
 
David Wells
 

that the investment community is hyper
-

100,000 or 200,000 of our gui

our guide for Q1 at 1.8 million domestic members in terms of growth the 
addition of even House of Cards season three is 100,000 or 150,000. So 



 
Mark Mahaney
 
Let me go back to Ted with two questions on the original content. Does the 
success spend of Marco Polo want to lead you to look to do even more of 
these kind of relatively blockbust
er type of productions? And then secondly 
in terms of the viewing of the seasons just to be clear are you seeing greater 
viewing of each of the original content House of Cards or Orange is the New 

 
successful series 
during the past. Are the audiences building up for each of those?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
The audience is definitely building season and season pre to the shows and I 
think if you see in our lineup of upcoming shows that we have some pretty 
epic an
d pretty spectacular shows upcoming like Daredevil like Sense8 that 

new original programming this year alone and there is a mix of big epic 
spectaculars, some smaller productions but 
probably think equally loved like 
teen comedy from Tina Fey or Robert Carlock, The Unbreakable Kimmy 
Schmidt and some another shows as well like Grace And Frankie with Jane 

type of 
show taste or super diverse, we have a big subscriber base and 

 
Rich Greenfield
 

slower growth or slower net ads that you look on an year
-
over
-
year 
basis, 
should investors just assume that a kind of 20% annual decline or is there 
the content that Ted talking about. Is there the potential to reaccelerate that 

to that you gave out
 
I think your first ever margin guidance for 2020 of 
40%, would that tie a specific subscriber number in your head or is there a 
pricing flexibility where you think pricing is notably higher. How do we think 
about how you get to that 40% contribution margi
n?
 
David Wells
 



saw in Q3 and Q4 extrapolated 
forward are down year
-
over
-
year in terms of 
net additions growth. We have a lot of content as Ted just talked about 
coming out in Q1 and then the rest of 2015. So we certainly could see a 

 
us right 

that was down year
-
over
-


actually guided 3
0% right in terms of setting a margin target out there, but 
we wanted to give investors some guidance in terms of long
-
term margin 
growth and what it's about for us is the steady march upward of about 200 
averaging 
--
 
about 200 basis points a year. We're g
oing to have some 
lumpiness with the content coming in, in terms of heavy quarters of content 
introduction. We have accelerated amortization on that original content 
which tends to pressure the P&L in this quarter so we launch a lot of 
content. But I think
 
for the 40% it's the continued steady growth of the 
business and we think that we have the flexibility and the model that doesn't 
require an 80 million subscriber or 90 million subscriber business to get 
there, we can get there with the growth that we see
 
layered in today.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
David can I ask about the pricing elasticity, you talked about that a fair 
amount in the press release. Two quarters ago it seemed like there was a lot 
of conviction in the pricing power over the last quarters, some question
s now 
it seems like there is greater conviction. Do you think you really have 
enough data points 
--
 
I know you mentioned Mexico it sounds like you did 
some additional research on some the newer subs coming in, do you have 
other markets that you have looked
 
at and you have seen the results from 
there that give you the confidence that you actually there is this pricing 
elasticity or pricing power 
--
 
do you think we could then going forward 
seeing the dollar price increase every other year or every two years a
nd 
maybe with year grandfathered?
 
David Wells
 
Well I don't think we're talking about a dollar to the consumer price increase 
every year. What we're talking about is using our tiers to provide value and 
choice for the consumers to grow 
--
 
steadily grow our 
average subscription 
price overtime that doesn't necessarily require the frequency of any annual 
price increase. I think what you should expect from us is a steady growth of 
that ASP and we will disconnect pricing I don't think there is any reason for 
us t
o have a global single event. We will look at pricing in each market and 
we will grow it accordingly to what we think and makes sense in each 
market.
 
In terms of evidence, sure we have seen growth persist through pricing 
introduction or raises through thos
e markets. So I think besides Mexico 
we've got some other examples. Ultimately, it will rest upon when those 
grandfathering's expire, so we still have that to come. But we think we have 
enough evidence today to look at it and say the growth that we saw tha
t 
slowed down in Q2 and Q3 wasn't really necessarily 
--
 
wasn't related to the 
pricing. We still scratch our heads a little bit in terms of explaining fully and 
as I've said before it takes several quarters for you to really get comfortable 
on the answer as
 
we look at every piece of information. But right now I think 
we've got enough information to say based on Mexico and other markets 
there is still plenty of pricing power for Netflix and not a reaction to the U.S 
facility.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
Just expanding on
 
that Reed, when you think about the way you price. You 
basically foreclosed on advertising as an incremental way to drive revenue. 
Are there forms appearing that could actually be interesting to generate 
more revenue for Netflix on a per subscriber basis?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. The biggest one is our $12 a month plan is our plan for Ultra HD. Now 
today there are variation television's that are Ultra HD and we only have a 
few titles. We have more than anybody else but we only have a few titles. 
But if you look
 
ahead two years, four years from now many of the TV's sold 
at Best Buy will be Ultra HD and lots of our content will be Ultra HD and it's 
a natural match. So I think what we are able to do is as the high end of the 
market spends $2,000 to get a Ultra HD t
elevision it's seems fair and natural 
for them that just like you pay for difference between standard def and HD 
that there is a difference between HD and Ultra HD. So that's the way that 
we got incremental revenue without making any changes ourselves by j
ust 
letting the tide come to us.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And Reed if I could add to that. I think what's exciting about this move is 
unlike other kind of format changes this one is led by a thin layer of content 
but the front end of the content. So we're shooting all
 
of our original series 
with a very few exceptions in Ultra HD, our Breaking Bad licenses are on 
Ultra HD, Blacklist I mean all the very frontline shows and then 
complimenting with more
-
and
-
more of the catalogue. But it's not a kind of a 
show off of weird 
quirky things that look good it's actually the program and 
the people who watch it.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Another question for Ted, you talked about your overall content was where 
you gain efficiencies in terms of your procurement of content. Can you tell if 
whethe
r the competitive landscape is changing at all. Amazon may be 
getting critical acclaim. It's hard to tell they are getting customer acclaim for 
their shows. Are you seeing anything in the market that suggests that your 
ability to acquire content get conten
t is getting easier or harder?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
On the original side it's a very competitive market and we're fortunately 
positioned ourselves as kind of a premier destination for the biggest and 
best projects. We don't say yes to all of them and we see them s
how up at 
other places but we do think that we're the first or second go
-
to for most of 
the projects that we're looking for. And I think in terms of the licensing side 
it's kind of the same thing which is as we increase our footprint our ability to 
compete
 
in that space really helps being able to get the most high profile 
shows but by doing that by being more
-
and
-
more confident at earlier stages. 
So being able to license that content with much greater confidence 
sometimes a pretty pilot gives us the ability
 
to find those efficiencies.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
But Ted just to follow on that, stacking license become a real issue for U.S 
studios. They are now looking at your requirements for limiting stacking and 
also the global buying I mean you don't want to buy thing

that global license attached to it, is that making it harder for you to buy 
content from some of the big TV producers as you look out over the course 

is that a n
on
-
issue?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I think really the truth about it is that they 
--
 

because it actually makes it more attractive as Studios kind of streamline 

th



withhold the right for stack


this year.
 
Rich Greenfield
 


 
agree to sell their content to you, is that fair?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
In what way?
 
Rich Greenfield
 


-

other markets overtime, if they basically limit the stacking they obviously 

 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
Mark Mahaney
 
Question for 
Reed, Reed couple of months ago I think HBO talked about 
plans to launch a standalone streaming service in sometime in 2015, any 
thoughts you have on what kind of impact that can have on your businesses 
and specifically do you think that there is a probabi
lity that there would be a 
broad streaming solution that would come out at price point lower than 
Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 


price for HBO, then 


softly in terms of not being too disruptive using the existing partnerships 
that would 
tend to imply a little bit higher price point. In the Nordics, they 
did choose which is the first place that they competed over the top, to be 

think even if they were to match
 
us in pricing, it just going to be a lot of 
people subscribing to both and I think that over the years last five years 
with HBO and Showtime, when Showtime has a great run with Homeland 

ase HBO. 

work, people will additionally subscribe to them because that cost is pretty 
small per month, hours are small per month relative to all their other 
entertainment options, so i

 
Mark Mahaney
 
I guess both Reed and David on the next question as it relates to DISH and 
Sling TV. MVPD integration in this country has been really a challenge for 

g deals outside of United 
States. What does the DISH deal mean initially in terms of the willingness of 
others in the U.S. and will we ever see you on the X1 integrated into the 
platform and then to the extent that DISH is actually creating subscribers. 
Th
is is the part for David, curious how you get compensated or 
--
 
sorry how 

additions?
 
David Wells
 

financial details
 
with DISH. And then to the degree DISH has always been 
maverick doing some things first to the degree that they enjoy great success 
like Virgin in the UK with platform and it helps the Hopper get more popular 


competitors would want to co
-
op that benefit and integrate with us, but right 


Sl
ing TV, so those are two different things.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
What do you think of Sling TV I mean a lot of people how downplayed it, 
what do you think of the offering and its impact on your business 
specifically?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 

Ergen has been a great entrepreneur and I think he sees the future that its 


dible entrepreneur in 
terms of starting with something small like early DISH and building it in to 


our unique and exclusive shows.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
Reed on the MVPD integrations in Europe. Are any of those material enough 
to have called some of the upside we saw in this to your guidance in the 
December quarter or in the guide for the March quarter?
 
Reed 
Hastings
 
There deals that we work on for a long time, so they were all built into the 
Q4 guidance.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Reed you have not updated us on streaming metrics in a long time I think 
Neil Hunt gave the last statistic almost a year ago in terms of where y
ou are 
now on a monthly or quarterly global basis some color there and then just 
tied to that we got a lot of questions emailed
-
in in terms of just split where it 
stands today in terms of devices given the rollout of better wireless networks 
how big is non
-
in
-
home usage on tablets and smartphones. And is there any 
color you could provide on movies versus TV in terms of absolute amount or 
absolute volume of streaming?
 
Reed Hastings
 

th

phone that varies by market some sort of 30%
-
40% of viewing and TV 
based viewing being the large green share doing being the majority of it. No 
particular change in those metrics. In 
terms of mobile networks, consumers 
are still in most countries quite conservative because of the data caps 
typically 2 gigabytes or 5 gigabytes in terms of watching video on. So we 
see a lot of tablet and smartphone usage but almost always on WiFi 
network

because of the caps and the fear of [overages].
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And then total hours?
 
Reed Hastings
 


make an event about which is when we tend to do those 

median hours continued to climb in every market as we make the 

e track 

as the UI gets more personalized, as the content gets better. We see it 
directly reflected in the number of median hours and then that is the closest 
correlater with r


friends.
 
Mark Mahaney
 


onsistently on a median basis?
 
Reed Hastings
 

there is a fair amount of seasonality. So, we might hit numbers like that in 
peak times like holiday period but not 
necessarily sustain that over the 
whole year.
 
David Wells
 

anyway.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
David let me bring you back in the conversation, you talked about the 
generating material global profits
 
earlier than expected but you also talked 
about $1 billion debt raise. So kind of square those comments a little bit and 
then the timing of the debt raise when you would expect that and why you 
would chose debt versus equity?
 
David Wells
 
Sure Mark. I thin

have clear line of sight in terms of rolling out the rest of our international 
expansion. So, we mentioned that we would have an couple of years of 

 
drive capital needs which then 
leads into the conversation around the capital. And we think right now is still 
a good time to secure a long
-
term low cost capital in the debt market and 

 

 
Mark Mahaney
 
And I think your points have been that purpose for the capital raise is largely 

secondly there is little commentary here about exp
anding in the China 
modestly. I am not sure what a modest expansion in the China is? Sounds 

that?
 
David Wells
 
It will be quite modest and I can let others speak to that as well.
 
Basically, 
the incremental cost to launch in the rest of the globe is smaller relative to 

-
date in these other 

talked about a

than the level of investment going forward, basically countries that we 

separate the cash. I mean when you have ca
pital in a business and you use 

sort of separate those things.
 
Both of those things right now are requiring cash for Netflix. The 
international, mainly because it reduces the dollar
 
profit that we would 

more of our own content and that means we have to fund the production 
which has slightly more upfront characteristics than a licensing model where 
we would pay a
 
little bit more out over the life of the deal.
 
Mark Mahaney
 

South Korea. Those seem like very expensive markets to enter from just a 
content build
-

 
R
eed Hastings
 



figuring that 
out. And what we said is that if we go it will be a modest 



 
is many other high GDP 
markets, GDP per capita, like South Korea and Japan and those are big 
investments just like we done in France and Germany and the UK.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
And just from a high level you had this bigger tree Reed out in, I think 
somewhere in
 
the Midwest last month. And just curious are there any kind of 
key takeaways that we should be thinking about that you learned or that 
were discussed that would be meaningful to investors?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think the key thing is that everyone sees that Int
ernet TV is really 
becoming substantial. So you saw this with CBS All Access 15 years of 
shows, any episode really lean forward move. We see this with ESPN both 
heavily investing in WatchESPN, and if you think about it from an ESPN 
perspective, as long as 
people are subscribing, whether a third of the time 
there are on WatchESPN and two
-
thirds of the time on a linear channel or 

 

in the DISH leve
l making sure that they stay accessible by every home in 
America. So just across the board you see this phenomena that we 
described a few years ago of channels becoming apps, people using them on 
their smartphone and smart TV just as easily and transparent
ly.
 

both on competition and its more consumers coming in the market, speeding 
up because Internet TV is becoming so mainstream.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Question for David on the streaming c
ontent obligations, those rose to 9.5 
billion in quarter. What levels are you comfortable with? Should these 
continue to rise as the sub base rises? Is there a natural level I which it 
would be appropriate ranges for those?
 
David Wells
 
There is no absolute
 
number but when I look at the streaming obligations in 
the table and even the ones that are sort of not estimable but you can out a 
range on those as well little bit lighter. I would say that the ratio has been 
fairly consistent in terms of its scaling wi
th our business. So you should 
expect them to continue to grow especially as we launch additional 
international territories. In the produced content side the more we license 
content the more that will grow in an obligation. The interesting thing about 
in t
he production world is when you produce content and you own it, 

as a content obligation.
 
So if you look at some of our peers and some of our suppliers in the 

have the same sort of accounting when it comes to an 
obligation. Even though you may say that there is a high probability of 
finishing or producing a full budget on a particular project. But I would say I 
think in terms of our revenue and our revenue per o


scale growth.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Sticking on financials, can we talk about interconnection a little bit? You 
signed deals with four of the large companies over the last several months. 
Curious how those interconnection fees add up? Is it the number and where 

 
10 million plus a 25? And then related to that 
maybe a question for Reed, in terms of do you expect the SEC order or the 
SEC policy on Internet regulations actually make the deals that you sign with 

 
interconnection 
going forward.
 
Reed Hastings
 
That would be upside Rich that we would not expect that they would trump 

Internet as a utility open to all not for discriminatory
 
use, as it really take 

perceptions Title II is amazing to see, just 12 months. And we appear to be 
on the edge of an acting Title II and generally codifying the idea that at least 
in the 
U.S. the Internet is a utility for broad social good and wide open 
access. And that over time if it happens will significantly insulate us from 
any accelerating tax for interconnections.
 


our plan.
 
David Wells
 

specifics of the deal but we continue to be very happy with the shift to 

streaming 
delivery continues to be quite modest relative to content.
 
Reed Hastings
 

up.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Let me throw one to Ted then. Ted just give us an update on the Disney 
content. I now some D
isney content will be streaming into that key Canadian 
market of this year. But going forward I think there is a very large library 
Disney content that will be coming on. Just some color about how big that 
opportunity is? How much content that is? And what
 
kind of impact you 
think that could have in terms of filling out the pallet or whatever offerings 
to families in Netflix?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

with Disney because those movies are not just 

family content that get flexed over and over again forms great loyalty with 

been expanding our relationship with Disney even in the Pay 1 window which 
I had been really dismissive with other studios. And coming in Canada this 

long
-
term relationship as global as you get in terms of success of Frozen this 
year all over the planet. So
 

and more global at our programming.
 
Rich Greenfield
 
Last question from us that would be a two part question. The first piece 
coming the DVD front. Obviously DVD still supplies a lot of profit David to 
your f
inancials, just curious given the comments that Outerwall had today 
that their DVD business seems to be falling pretty precipitously as they look 

those profits? And then just a fin

vocal on the Comcast Time Warner merger and the danger it poses, are you 
increasingly confident that this deal gets blocked?
 
David Wells
 
Well, Rich, let me take you question first. On the DVD, I continue to think 

1.2 million of our DVDs subscribers. In 2014, we lost 1.1 million so slightly 
less. And the margin is held steady for two years if you look at the 
contribution margins for the D


people in rural areas another cinefiles where the DVD makes sense for them 

-

l just to continue 
provide great service for those folks that really want it.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Rich, the key difference with Outerwall is; Outerwall or Redbox is 

-
per
-
view substitution 
whereas a broad s
election renter like our self on the stable business is much 
less sensitive to that.
 

would be presented to U.S. society if there is one ISP that initially would be 
40% of broadband h
ouseholds and that DSL phase pretty quickly would be 

power in one company, so we think it would be wise policy for the U.S. to 

 
happens or 

advocate for what we think is great policy and see what happens.
 
Mark Mahaney
 
Do you agree with the FCC moving 
--
 
what is broadband definition up to 25 
megs, does that make s
ense to you?
 
Reed Hastings
 



 
monitoring of your home, these kinds of things on video. So 25 megs is kind 
of baseline for the next five years as opposed to the past five years. So with 
that let me thank everyone for joining us on this call and thanks to Rich and 
Mark for conducting th
e interview. Thank you all.

1/23/14,Netflix,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q1 2020 Earnings Interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted 
Sarandos; and Chief Product 
Officer, Greg Peters. Our Interviewer this 
quarter is Mike Morris from Guggenheim.
 
As a reminder, we'll be making forward
-
looking statements, and actual 
results may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike for his first question.

Michael Morris
 
Thank you, Spencer, and good afternoon. Glad to see you all safe and 
healthy and take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to our viewers. 
Your letter had a lot of detail about the impact of the environment, but I'd 
like to 
hear directly from you some key thoughts, and then we can dig in 
more deeply into a few topics. So if we'd just start with the impact of 
COVID, the changing consumer behavior. Reed, your thoughts on both the 
sort of sustained, strategic impact of the chang
e and change of behavior. 
And then maybe for each of you, if you could highlight the most significant 
thing that's changed for you, how you're thinking about permanence or how 
to work through that in the coming weeks and months.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure, Mike. I
 
mean it's an incredible tragedy for the world. Everyone is 
wrestling with the implications, both on health, on hunger, poverty. And we, 
too, are really unsure of what the future brings. It's super hard to say if 
there's strategic long
-
term implications be
cause we've just been scrambling 
to keep our servers running well, keep the content, get our postproduction 
done. Our small contribution in these difficult times is to make home 
confinement a little more bearable. And where you take that seriously, we're 
w
orking super hard on that. And in a couple of months, we'll all be able to 
grapple with the long
-
term implications. But right now, we're just focused on 
getting our content out, getting it dubbed, and I'll let the other team 
members talk.
 
Michael Morris
 
Su
re. I don't know if 
--
 
maybe we'll go to Greg first and then to Ted, just 
hear your high
-
level thoughts, please?
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes. It's been humbling to be a place that people around the world in a time 
like this turn to for some entertainment for escape. A
nd I think just 
reiterating what Reed was saying, our real focus at this point in time has just 
been to keep our service operating at as high a quality as possible and 
available when our members need us and turn to us.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes. Echoing the same, w
hich is the 
--
 
what's been really amazing is the role 
that Netflix has played in all of this, which is to keep people connected. Keep 
people 
--
 
some people around the world who are incredibly lonely connected 
through storytelling on Netflix, certainly a di
straction and certainly a big 

work, mostly getting a lot of folks doing work they've never done before 
from places they've never done it before. So our productions, our 
postproductio
ns, our offices are now distributed into people's living rooms 
and bedrooms and kitchens around the world. And it's just an incredible 
testimony to the innovation that within a few 
--
 
literally within a few hours, 
but within 
--
 
certainly within a few days 
of the shutdowns, we had 
production up and running remotely, postproduction up and running 
remotely, animation up and running remotely, pitch meetings happening 
virtually, writers' rooms assembling virtually. It's been really a remarkable 
thing to watch th
e creative community come together to entertain the world 
through Netflix.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. And Spencer, from the financial side, anything significant right now, 
that's top of mind for you relative to where we were this time last quarter?
 
Spencer Neum
ann
 
Yes. I think I'd echo what Reed and Greg and Ted said, in that so much of 
what we're focused on right now is just taking care of our business, ensuring 
that it runs smoothly, being fortunate that it is running smoothly and making 
sure as best we can th
at our employees and production crews are safe and 
healthy and taken care of. So that's been our primary focus. I think the long 
term is impossible to predict in terms of what this 
--
 
what the impact of this 
to our business, but we suspect that the long
-
te
rm trends we've sort of 
talked about for many quarters now in terms of the shift from linear to 
streaming on
-
demand entertainment is consistent. So there may be some 
timing impacts here. But overall, that long
-
term trend is really unchanged.
 
So what we're 
really trying to do is, as Ted and others said, is trying to 
make something that looks relatively easy and smooth operating. But in 
reality, it's a really hard work for a lot of folks, thousands of employees and 
a lot of challenges throughout our company t
hat we're doing our best to do 
that well for our members and for our community.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And for me, Mike, speaking specifically for the finance department, I'd say 
we're just trying to work hard to really support the other business units like 
Ted's or
ganization, Greg's organization, the marketing team, to get through 
this process as easily as possible.
 
Michael Morris
 
And understanding that it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen. I 
am curious, Reed, if you could share anything that you lo
ok at as sort of key 
indicators externally as you try to plan for the business going forward. And 
also, I'm curious if there are any internal data points given that you do have 
that relationship with your consumers that could help you with the planning 
pro
cess and how to progress from here.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think have a planning model, you have to have a model of COVID and 
when are certain treatments coming online, how broadly are they 
distributed, when are vaccines coming online, how quickly can they be 
man
ufactured. And we don't know any more than anybody else on those big 
elements, and that is the most significant aspect. So think about it as we're 
in the same uncertainty that everyone else is.
 
The things we are certain of is the Internet is growing. It's 
a bigger part of 
people's lives, thankfully. And people want entertainment. They want to be 
able to escape and connect, whether times are difficult or joyous. That's 
pulling up. We've had an increase in subscriber growth in March. It's 
essentially a pull f
orward of the rest of the year. So our guess is that subs 
will be light in Q3 and Q4 relative to prior years because of that. But we 
don't use the words guess and guesswork lightly. We use them because it's 
a bunch of us feeling the wind, and it's hard to 
say. But again, will Internet 
entertainment be more and more important over the next 5 years? Nothing 
has changed in that.
 
Michael Morris
 
Great. So we have had a number of questions about the member growth and 
the topic of pull forward that you just refere
nced, Reed. And I guess to the 
extent we could understand anything about the composition of that influx of 
subscribers that came, or we can see the geographic split, which is of course 
very helpful, and I think there's a pretty fair conclusion that I'd be 
interested 
and you're sort of addressing, which is that clearly the hardest hit markets 
by COVID were those that saw the greatest change in subscribers. Beyond 
that, I'm curious if you could talk at all about the sort of composition, even 
in the UCAN regio
n, of whether it's a multiperson households or whether it's 
a different income strata or anything like that, that you feel that could give 
some insight into who's part of that ramp in members.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. It's really more of the same. 
There's nothing that separates the people 
just joining from anybody else. And then our job is to do the same things 
we've been doing to retain them, that is have incredible shows, make it very 
easy to choose, help the recommendations, all the things we do 
that make 
the experience so wonderful. So again, in terms of usage, in terms of 
viewing patterns, it's all pretty consistent with the families that have been 
members for a long or short time.
 
Michael Morris
 
And there are some questions on the pricing side 
that, well, sort of predate 
this, right? This is all intertwined at this point. But we have lapped or we're 
getting close to lapping some of the significant prices you did, especially in 
the U.S. market last year. We had subscriber impact. So I guess I'll 
put this 
question to Greg, but also more broadly, number one, how do you feel, in 
the absence of the COVID situation, with the way that process played out? I 
know we saw some elevated churn. How was that progressing? And if you 
look at the sort of end resu
lt, are there things that you would have tweaked 
about it? And then I think there's a follow
-
up question just about the 
economic sensitivity perhaps going forward, but let's just start with that 
pricing question.
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes. I would say just one comme
nt, which is in January and February, we 
were seeing in UCAN a return to pretty much normal pre
-
price change churn 
levels. But really, at this point, we're not even thinking about price 
increases. Obviously, what's going on around the world is dominating o
ur 
thoughts and our considerations. And we just want to stay super focused at 
this point in time, making sure that we're continuing to be there, have a 
great service, make sure that we're able to provide entertainment and 
escape for our members around the 
world. So we'll really just focus on that 
for this period.
 
Michael Morris
 
This has the potential to be the first time we've seen a more significant 
global economic impact, similar to what we saw 12 years ago perhaps. I'm 
not an economist per se, but there 
is some sensitivity there. And I guess my 
question is, when you think about pricing and pricing levers and packages, 
how do you think about approaching perhaps a weaker global consumer 
spend environment? Where do you see your price point and your value 
pro
position as very attractive in a potentially softer consumer environment?
 
Greg Peters
 
Spencer, do you want to take that one?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
I mean it really builds on what Greg said. Right now, we're really not 
thinking about 
--
 
it's not really a time for
 
us to be thinking about price 
changes. So when we think about recessionary impact, it's so hard to 
--
 
Reed even said it. I mean this is a little bit of guesswork right now in terms 
of what the future looks like. Obviously, past recessions, folks tend to s
pend 
more time at home and with home entertainment. It's why they watch their 
budget in those times, and pay
-
TV over decades has been more resilient and 
a bit countercyclical in that way. And even Netflix in recent history has been 
more resilient. But this
 
is very different. We haven't lived through anything 
like this. So it's so hard to tell. And the one thing we can control, which we 
talk about here, is we can control the quality of the service that we provide 
to our members. And so we're just 
--
 
we're re
ally just prioritizing that, 
number one, is improving the product, improving the content, making sure 
we have a steady stream of titles. And we don't take it for granted that we 
are providing this entertainment in people's homes and they're choosing us. 
We
 
want to lead with that value. And we have price points that start at $9 in 
the U.S., as you know, and in other parts of the world as low as $3 for 
mobile. So we're focused on maintaining that accessibility, but really 
delivering value.
 
Michael Morris
 
That
's a good segue on the content side into some of the things that are 
happening on the pipeline. You spoke 
--
 
Ted, you gave us a little bit of an 
overview. You also spoke in the letter, but maybe can you talk about how 
the production stoppage will impact th
e release schedule? Let's just start 
that. And within that is how much content is in the pipeline? That's a lot of 
the question, and how you might strategize spacing that or not spacing that 
in the future.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes. Well, the one thing that's maybe
 
not widely understood is we work 
really far out relative to the industry because we launch our shows all 
episodes at once. And we're working far out all over the world. So our 2020 
slate of series and films are largely shot and are in postproduction remot
ely 
in locations all over the world. So 
--
 
and we're actually pretty deep into our 
2021 slate. So we're not 
--
 
we aren't anticipating any moving 
--
 
moving 
things around. And to give you some examples, The Crown, in its fourth 
season; our big fourth quarter
 
animated release, Over the Moon. These are 
shot productions in our 
--
 
in the finishing stages right now to release later 
this year as planned. So we don't anticipate moving the schedule around 
much and certainly not in 2020.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. I think t
hat answers this question, but we did have it come back up. I 
asked it a couple of quarters ago, whether this impacts your interest in 
revisiting perhaps a more spacing of releases versus a pretty consistent 
stacked
-
at
-
once strategy that you've employed so
 
far here?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
You mean the episode spacing?
 
Michael Morris
 
Correct.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
We've experimented and we continue to experiment with all kinds of 
different release strategies. And our 
--
 
by way of example, on our 
competition shows, we had an en
ormous success last quarter with Love is 
Blind with staggered release. And then we just released Too Hot to Handle, 
which are on track to be probably our biggest competition show ever, and it 
was released all at once. So I think it's 
--
 
consumers, I think,
 
are 
--
 
we're 
trying to 
--
 
we believe that consumers like the control of all
-
at
-
once, and 
they could watch at their own pace. But we keep testing it to see how people 
--
 
if it impacts the viewing one way or another or, more importantly, the 
satisfaction on
e way or another. And customers have spoken loud and clear 
that they really like the options of the all
-
at
-
once model for us. So I don't 
see us moving away from that meaningfully.
 
Michael Morris
 
And so the process of getting back to production 
--
 
it's very
 
helpful to 
understand what your pipeline looks like right now. What are some of the 
key milestones in getting back to production? And the different genres or 
different sort of intensities of productions, are they going to vary as we look 
forward?
 
Ted Sara
ndos
 
Yes. It will vary by geography. It will vary by type of production certainly. 
First and foremost, we want to make sure that it is an unbelievably safe 
working environment. We've always been focused on workplace safety on 
our sets and our offices, and 
we definitely want to 
--
 
we will definitely keep 
focused on that. A series of things have to happen before we get into 
production anywhere, including the kind of the shelter
-
at
-
home orders being 
relaxed. But even in that environment, we're going to make su
re that there's 
testing that has to be able to be done. We have to be able to look our 
employees and our cast and crews in the eye and say that this is a safe 
place to work before we do that. And we're going to be working very closely 
with our production p
artners, with local governments to make sure that we 
can do that.
 
We're currently in production in Iceland and in Korea, and we're taking some 
of those key learnings about how we run those productions today and 
applying that to our plans to start our 
productions around the world.
 
Michael Morris
 
Any specific highlights of those two markets that you could share?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Not, not very much. It's very fluid. So we're just taking 
--
 
we're taking the 
learnings as learnings and on face value now and seei
ng how they scale out. 
But it's very important, those are two countries that were very aggressive 
about testing and tracking early. So I think it probably lays out a good 
framework for future rollouts.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. I definitely want to talk about u
nscripted, which is a big story in the 
quarter. But before we do, Spence, I want to ask you about the financial 
implications of what's going on with the production process right now, how 
to think about sort of the cash flow. You talked about it in the lett
er, but 
maybe if you could lay that out for us a bit. And then also, if 
--
 
the 
amortization schedule, does that change at all as a result of more viewing 
and more consumption? Or should we think of that as a pretty consistent 
process?
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Sure.
 
So in terms of cash flow, first, as you saw, we are positive free cash 
flow in the quarter. That wasn't COVID
-
related. To be clear, I mean, we 
would have been positive free cash flow without the recent COVID events. 
So there was some cushioning of spend i
n Q1, but most of what we talk 
about in terms of the impact of kind of slower kind of cash spend in the 
year, some push content spending is really kind of a full year impact than a 
Q1 impact. When we think about the full year, there is 
--
 
as you've heard, 
because of paused productions, there's going to be some pushing of that 
spend. It's 
--
 
we talked about the fact that we planned previously to have 
about negative $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the year. And now we've said 
it's less than $1 billion. So y
ou can do the math on that. But I think it's 
important to highlight that on a roughly $15 billion cash content spend, 
that's a minority of our spend. It's also a minority of our titles, a small 
minority of our titles that's pushing. So we'll actually have 
more branded 
Netflix Originals on our service this year than we had last year, even with 
what's planned for push spend.
 
So we will be, obviously, a much improved free cash flow profile this year. 
As productions ramp, that cash spend will increase again. So
 
as we talked 
about in the letter, it's still a multiyear path to sustained free cash flow 
positive. It's just going to be a little bit choppier getting there. And 2019 will 
still be our maximum negative year.
 
Michael Morris
 
That's very helpful. So Ted, co
ming back to the topic of unscripted, we've 
talked about film a lot over the last several years actually, and that's been 
really the key incremental topic. But unscripted hit a huge stride here, I 
think, at least in the public view. So Tiger King, can I ju
st first ask about 
that? I mean were you surprised by the public reception of Tiger King? Like 
at what point did you know that, that was the hit that it ended up being?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
We've had a lot of kind of buzzy unscripted and nonfiction shows on Netfli
x. 
And they feel like it's kind of building on the heat that started way back with, 
no pun intended, with the Fyre documentary that kind of exploded at the 
level that we've seen with Tiger King. And we knew kind of right out of the 
gate, and you could feel
 
it in the social media excitement. And it turned out 
just to be such an unbelievably well
-
timed distraction for what was 
happening in the world that gave some 
--
 
people something to talk about 
that wasn't necessarily in the headlines, which was really gre
at. And I think 
that team has just been exceptional at tapping into the zeitgeist and coming 
--
 
and making shows like Tiger King.
 
Michael Morris
 
And as you look at where you've kind of cut through the clutter, I think, 
really, really excel, we've had these
 
competition shows, as you refer to 
them, we've had some of these true crime shows. I think those are 2 of the 
areas that really kind of stand out in people's minds.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Underhand most recently and the true crime space was phenomenal as well, 
yes.
 
Michael Morris
 
Exactly. Are there other 
--
 
as you think about that progress, there are other 
--
 
when you think about unscripted, there is some actual breadth to the type 
--
 
the different genres, subgenres within there. Are there other areas that 
you feel 
that are important to push into? I don't know if there's like more 
lifestyle, travel, those types of things. There's sports, and I want to talk 
about The Last Dance in a moment. But how are you thinking about sort of 
the breadth of push into that area?
 
Ted
 
Sarandos
 
Our goal is that we want to make your favorite show. For some people, 
that's high 
--
 
that's big pedigree drama. And for other people, that's home 
improvement shows. And we want to make your favorite version of that. So 
we've been pushing out into
 
each of those verticals beyond the true crime 
space and the competition space. We've done cooking shows like with Nailed 
It and Chef's Table, and we're now pushing into more of the kind of into the 
home improvement and real estate space, which is also qui
te popular with 
our members, and continue to push out that as well.
 
So I think you should think about the full complement of unscripted 
programming as we keep expanding into it. And similarly, how we pushed 
out into film and previously into animated series
 
and animated feature film 
as well, just as a continuing expansion of trying to get to your favorite show. 
And if your house is anything like mine, it is not the same show for any two 
people, let alone, the whole world. So it does keep us on our toes, and 
it 
keeps it kind of a 
--
 
we kind of feel like we're in a state of perpetual 
improvement in each of these new content areas, and we've been really 
happy with the progress.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. I want to ask you about The Last Dance, which is Michael Jordan,
 
Chicago Bulls documentary that came out on ESPN over the weekend, 
started with the first two episodes, very well received from a linear ratings 
perspective. I know it's something that you have partnered or have 
partnered with them on. So can you remind us
 
what your relationship is 
there in terms of ownership and rights? And kind of how you think about 
--
 
I 
think that, that was established several years ago when perhaps your 
business models were a bit more complementary versus competitive. So 
maybe you can 
address that as well.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes. There's still 
--
 
it was the 
--
 
Michael Jordan and the creative team behind 
the film were very excited for it to have Netflix involved in it and encouraged 
ESPN to open those conversations up with us, which we were ha
ppy to do. 
ESPN has been a great partner on this project. We've been working on it for 
years. In fact, it was 2 years ago at the All
-
Star Game that Jimmy and I got 
up with Adam Silver and introduced the first look at the doc together. And so 
they premiered
 
the film over the weekend on ESPN, and we premiered the 
film on Netflix, the same 2 episodes. And we similarly saw enormous viewing 
around the world on the first 2 episodes of The Last Dance. So it's been a 
win
-
win for us and ESPN and a great win for bask
etball fans who've been 
very hungry for new programming. And the show, the doc itself is just 
phenomenal. And because of the unique connection between the NBA and 
ESPN and the complexity of the rights and the footage, it would have been 
very difficult for 
either of us to do without each other.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. A question for either Greg or you, Ted, with respect to the top 10 list, 
which really kind of took hold this quarter. And how 
--
 
again, I know 
everything is a little bit upside down because of 
circumstances, but how 
impactful or influential do you think that has been in sort of keeping 
members on board, keeping members streaming and that sort of thing? Can 
you talk about that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Look, I feel like we're constantly trying to help people
 
find things they're 
going to love. Greg and his team do an amazing job doing that on the site. 
One of the things that people use as 
--
 
to pick what to watch is popularity. 
We don't think it's the only thing, and we don't 
--
 
and we give them lots of 
tools 
to choose with. But one of them is popularity. So it's very helpful for 
people to want to be part of the conversation or part of the zeitgeist, again, 
with what are the things that other people are watching and using that as a 
thing to help them make decis
ions. So we looked at it, the top 10 list, as 
adding a new decision
-
making tool for people who are looking for something 
great to watch. And Greg, would you add anything?
 
Greg Peters
 
I think that covers it well. I mean just it's 
--
 
some folks are very, ver
y 
interested in being part of that social conversation that happens around 
these titles. And this is just a really nice shortcut to help people choose what 
to watch based on what's buzzing in the social conversation.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. A couple more on c
ontent, just it's such a huge focus, and I'll throw 
that to either Reed or Ted here, and that's really about how you're viewing 
third
-
party content, where clearly we had seen a shift, as you've been very 
clear about, in terms of your focus on your owned co
ntent versus license. 
But in the current environment, there are a number of factors that could 
perhaps play into that dynamic changing, right? One being the ability to 
acquire more content if production is shut down on a prolonged period. Also, 
some of the
 
studio companies perhaps are struggling themselves under the 
same circumstances and would be more willing to be sellers of content. I'm 
curious if you could talk about what you're seeing in that environment and 
whether your view there has changed at all.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, actually, one of the things you mentioned in the top 10, which kind of 
gives you the first kind of snapshot into how prevalent our original
-
branded 
programming has become on Netflix, and so that's continuing to push into 
that, both becau
se we believe that our core suppliers will increasingly 
become competitors and not be as anxious to sell us content as they used to 
be long term. But to your point, there are some things in the short
-
term 
dynamics. But when we look at that and look at our 
2020 and our 2021 
slate, and we're really happy and thrilled with it. And we can look to work 
with some of our partners to enhance that a little bit with things like, we put 
in the letter, licensing Lovebirds and Enola Holmes and this big film from 
Korea c
alled Time to Hunt, that's coming out this week. That we're 
--
 
so 
we've been able to do that and enhance that in the short term. In the long 
term, we think our push into the programming that people love is what 
we're trying to do, and we're trying to make 
that more frequently than we 
buy it. And so that's kind of an ongoing trajectory towards owned original. 
But at the same time, we're still doing a lot of license 
--
 
third
-
party 
licensing, which you see pop up in the top 10 list, things this week, like the 
Green Hornet, Despicable Me, both pop up in the U.S. top 10 list.
 
Michael Morris
 
And my last question on this has to do with the feature film side, especially 
given the disruption in the theatrical part of the business. At the risk of 
something opportunist
ic on the situation, but still understanding that there 
has been a secular shift in terms of people's behavior, is this something you 
can lean into a bit more in terms of your own spending and investment in 
films, just given that this might accelerate that
 
consumer behavior and just 
sort of capital flow?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Just to reiterate, Mike, we're really thrilled with our slate in this year. So 
what's the things that are coming up, we're looking at them, every one of 
them, but we're looking at it with the s
ame discipline that we do all of our 
other licensing and original opportunities.
 
Michael Morris
 
Okay. Great. I want to talk a bit about some of the product and distribution 
strategy. And Greg, a couple of changes, I believe, took place in the quarter 
havin
g to do with both free trials in particular markets, how you're 
onboarding folks and maybe reducing the number of markets you have free 
trials available, and also your mobile plan, which I think expanded to a 
couple of new markets during the quarter as wel
l. So can you talk about 
both of those decisions? And again, trying to isolate maybe the core trend 
versus the COVID
-
driven trend, if that's at all possible, to understand how 
that's impacting the business.
 
Greg Peters
 
Sure. On your first point, we have a 
whole range of marketing promotions 
that we sort of use in different ways, in different countries, in different 
times. And like most things we do on the service, we're constantly trying to 
improve those and figure out new and better ways to introduce the s
ervice 
to new members, to give them an easy on
-
ramp. And we're just going to 
continue to seek to test and refine and improve that range of sort of 
promotional strategies.
 
And then on mobile, it's a plan that we've tested for a while. We've rolled it 
out no
w in a bunch of countries, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, 
Philippines. And it's consistent with sort of this broad theme and a broad 
goal that we have, which is we're seeking effective ways to make the Netflix 
service more accessible to more and mor
e people around the world. And it 
certainly has been performing the way that we've sort of seen and expected, 
which is that it is a significant increase and acceleration and being able to 
add new members, which is great. But also that it's doing it at a wa
y which 
is, from a revenue perspective, neutral to positive, which we think is a really 
great position to be in the long term for the business.
 
Michael Morris
 
You referenced India. We talked about that a bit on every call because of the 
size of the market,
 
of course. And I guess 2 questions there was just, one, 
can you speak at all about whether that market has behaved perhaps 
typically, if you will, and 
--
 
with respect to the unique situation we're in right 
now? And then secondly, Disney+ did launch in the
 
market, and their 
partnership with Hotstar clearly gave them a great advantage in ramping the 
business. Can you talk about the competition there with that service and 
their ability to partner with a service that's already established, has a live 
offering?
 
How does that competitive dynamic play out for you?
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes. I would say, first of all, I wouldn't draw any strong contrast between 
India and other countries around the world. So fairly similar in that regard. 
And we have been working really, real
ly hard to do a lot to try and make our 
offering in India more competitive, more attractive to members and 
members
-
to
-
be, and there's a bunch of different product features we've 
been doing, partnerships and payments integrations. And obviously, this 
mobile
 
plan is a recent one. And I think, Ted, I'll throw to you too on a 
bunch of work we've been doing on the content side there as well.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes. We've been 
--
 
we've seen big growth in viewing in India and have had 
great success on our local original
s there as well, most recently with She and 
Guilty and a few others, that have really been driving a lot of engagement in 
local content on our India service. And they also are big fans of our global 
original content. La Casa de Papel was a huge hit in Indi
a for us as well as 
most of our other originals out of the U.S. So we're growing the business, 
licensed, original, international, domestic, across the board in terms of 
content and content taste.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Mike, we have time for 1 or 2 more questions, p
lease.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Okay. Let's hit two more questions then. I'd like to go back to the topic of 
competition, which has clearly taken a backseat during this quarter. But I do 
want to bring it back up again, I think it's important. So I'd direct it to Re
ed, 
a fairly open
-
ended question, right, but this concept of streaming wars, is at 
all
-
time high intensity, especially in the U.S. But what have you learned sort 
of over the last 3 to 6 months, if anything, and perhaps it's as you expected, 
but 
--
 
and what
 
would you point to, if anything, that should be more evident 
to investors and the public about how this process of migration to streaming 
consumption is playing out?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. I've been so impressed with the Disney+ execution. Over 20 years of 
watching different businesses, incumbents, like Blockbuster and Walmart 
and all these companies, I've never seen such a good execution of the 
incumbent learning the new way and mastering it. And then to have them 
achieve over 50 million in 6 months, it's s
tunning. So to see both the 
execution and the numbers line up, my hats off to them. Are we taking up 
our kids and family content and animation? You bet. And we're both going to 
do great work. But it's awesome to see. We have a bunch of 
--
 
so I would 
say th
e lesson out of that is great execution, clarity around brand and focus 
really makes a difference.
 
And then there's a bunch more services coming to market. I think it's great, 
obviously, for the consumer to be able to have all these options. There's 
nothin
g we can do about any of them nor about video gaming nor about 
YouTube or any of the other competitors for time. So what we do is just try 
to figure out how do we have the best service we can kind of steady every 
day, solid execution, and then we'll get pa
rt of consumers' viewing. No one's 
going to get it all. And it's working out very well for us. So honestly, 
internally, we mostly say don't focus on the competitors, focus on our 
service, how do we make it better and better. And that served us very well.
 
M
ichael Morris
 
Great. So let's wrap it up, as I'd like to do, asking each of you a question. At 
this time, I really want to focus on the content coming out given that many 
of us are doing a lot more streaming, and we always love recommendations. 
So we're go
ing to come to the fore, and so I'd like up to 2 recommendations, 
one would be something new coming out. I'd love to hear what you are most 
excited to seeing and having me and the rest of the world see that we 
haven't seen yet. And the second would be some
thing already on the service 
that you've really enjoyed that maybe hasn't quite hit that popularity graphs 
that you think it deserves that we should be diving back into. So I'll start 
with Spencer, as I'd like to do, and then Spence, you've been grandfathe
red 
into going second.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Awesome. Well, I would say for me, I'll take 2 shots at this. Number one, 
I've had a chance to get an early preview of Extraction, which is our new 
action film coming out later this week with Chris Hemsworth, and I think
 
it 
really delivers for people who love that genre, super exciting with great 
action sequences. Number two, I will say, I have really enjoyed the first 3 
episodes of Too Hot to Handle. So that would be my second 
recommendation.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Oh, boy. Oka
y. Me next. Let's see. So I will say in terms of things that I've 
watched recently, I thought Unorthodox was a terrific story and one that I 
really enjoyed and just shed light on a whole kind of culture that I didn't 
really have a whole lot of visibility i
nto. So thought that was a real treat and 
special. And I'd say, in terms of things I'm looking forward to, there's a 
whole bunch. I just started watching #blackAF, which I just think is just 
brilliant and fresh and new. And then I'm really looking forward 
to the end of 
the year with things like Over the Moon and just the next big chapter in our 
kind of animation journey.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, this shows why Spence and I get along so well, is Unorthodox and 
#blackAF were also my picks. But an obscure little on
e is our Indian film Yeh 
Ballet, that's just a great little film with some street dancers at Mumbai 
trying to make it into the world of ballet.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I can't allow you to hold me to two. It has all kinds of relationship 
implications if I pick two. S
o I'm going to give you a longish list since people 
are looking for things to watch of things that are coming up in the quarter. 
Spence mentioned Extraction. It's a phenomenal action movie with Chris 
Hemsworth. The writer, director, producing, stunt coordi
nation team from 
the Avengers movies and Deadpool 2 and 
--
 
have come together with this 
move, that really, really delivers. This week, we have a big animated feature 
for the whole family called The Willoughbys. We have a movie for Adam 
Sandler's production
 
company called The Wrong Missy coming up, starring 
David Spade. It's really fun. The big Korean movie called Time to Hunt; and 
then Greg Daniels', from The Office, new show, Space Force with Steve 
Carell; the second season of After Life; the second season
 
of Dead to Me; 
new season of 13 Reasons Why; a third season of Dark from Germany; the 
finale of Cable Girls from Spain; and Ghost in the Shell from Japan, a new 
anime series launching next week.
 
Spencer Neumann
 
Greg, good luck having anything to talk abou
t.
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes. I mean you guys have stolen everything. I would say I'll just double it 
on 
--
 
I'm super excited about Extraction. Ghost in the Shell, amazing 
definitely that for lovers of anime, you got to check that out. And then I 
would say Unorthodo
x, I was blown away by just an incredible story. And 
the one that hasn't been mentioned, which is certainly known, but I was, 
again, just really impressive storytelling is Ozark, and man, that last 
episode, wow. I don't even know what to say.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And if you're thinking of 1 tonight, Outer Banks is 
--
 
as you see how it's 
tearing up the top 10 list, it's a nice breakout this quarter.

10/22/13,Netflix,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q1 2018 earnings interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO Reed Hastings; CFO David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; 
and Chief Product Officer, Greg 
Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Ben 
Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.
 
Before we begin, a reminder that we will be making forward
-
looking 
statements and actual results may vary.
 
With that, let me turn it over to Ben for his first question.
 
Question

and

Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Thank you. Reed, I want to ask you, given the strong results again this 
quarter, talk a little bit about what the company is doing today that may be 
different to what it did 1, two years ago. You can hit a
 
scale of the business, 
particularly as you're moving into markets that are maybe quite a bit 
different from the developed markets that you've scaled already.
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
It's a lot more similar than it is different. We're continuing to invest in 
conte
nt, marketing, product, all of the things we've been doing. There's 
certainly some secular shift towards Internet viewing. And then we're seeing 
just the breadth of content that we've got going is really remarkable. And 
maybe, Ted, you want to talk about s
ome of the local shows that we've been 
doing around the world that our U.S. investor base may know less of.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. We've been able to launch original series in local language with local 
producers all over the world who've shot in 17 differe
nt countries original 
programming to date, and we expect that to continue to grow. And it's 
content that is for the country or for the region, but we've actually found 
great global success. This quarter, we have a new season of 3% coming up, 
by way of exam
ple, which is a Brazilian sci
-
fi show that really scored well 
around the world for us, and people are super excited about the new season 
even though we've made it in Portuguese for Brazil, and maybe one of the 
first examples of local
-
language Brazilian tel
evision working around the 
world. So it's 
--
 
we're really thrilled to be part of that.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And Reed, how might the go
-
to
-
market strategy look in a market like India 
or some of these emerging markets where you might partner earlier in the 
lif
e cycle of Netflix than, say, what we've seen in other markets where, you 
look at the U.S., you're now really working with Comcast quite a bit but 
you've scaled this market. Could you move towards a distribution model with 
partners faster in emerging marke
ts? And what does that mean, maybe for 
David, financially for the numbers we look at?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
Greg, I'll let you take that.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Sure. Our partnering strategy, I'd say, is on an evolving trajectory across all 
the markets that we serve in.
 
And it started with rich history with television 
manufacturers, CE manufacturers where we've integrated on their products, 
and that's been hugely successful for us. But a new wave that you've started 
to see over the last several years is starting to partn
er up now with 
operators, sort of MVPDs, Internet service providers, mobile operators, and 
we've evolved those partnerships. And based on what we've seen with these 
new bundle models that we referred to with both Comcast and Sky 
announcing in the last quar
ter, we've seen the economics of those, if you 
take in the retention, the acquisition characteristics to be very, very 
beneficial. And we love the fact that we can work with these partners to 
access whole new groups of consumers, make it easy for them to f
ind out 
about Netflix, to sign up and have a great way to access the service and 
watch more and more. So you'll see us leverage that sort of evolving 
strategy not only in the markets that we've been in for many years, but also 
in these new markets. But it'
s a consistent shift across all of our markets.
 
David Wells
 
And then, Ben, financially or economically for Netflix, we wrote in the letter 
about international ASP prospectively that might actually start occurring, 
where this is affecting where we're adding
 
subscribers on a net revenue 
basis. I would say that's all about perspective growth forward. To date, 
Netflix has always 
--
 
outside of gift cards, has added always on a gross 
revenue basis. And I would say, a technical point for investors just around 
GAAP
 
revenue accounting, is we're always in the principal position versus 
the agent position. But for some of these deals prospectively going forward 
where there's not a price visible to the consumer discreetly on Netflix and it 
meets a couple of other conditi
ons, we may book these on a net revenue 
basis. But they're very immaterial today. If they grow, we'll call these out for 
you going forward.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And maybe, Ben, if I could just add on that front. In terms of the underlying 
economics, they're pretty
 
consistent with our past partnerships. And 
obviously, what David is talking about is really more of a financial 
presentation difference. So from an operating income perspective, it's really 
quite similar, the impact.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Yes. What about tak
ing a more aggressive approach in emerging markets 
with lower price points, either on a retail level or with wholesale partners? If 
you think about the mobile opportunity in a market like India, again, it's a 
lot larger than perhaps the pay
-
TV TAMs. So if 
you think about attacking 
that market differently from a pricing and distribution perspective. And then, 
for Greg, what do you do from a product perspective to make sure mobile is 
a place that Netflix can really thrive on?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
On pricing, we've
 
been very happy with the results on our INR 500 to INR 
800 in India, our pricing in the different countries. So no near
-
term plans. Of 
course, we are always trying to learn more over time. And Greg, over to you 
on mobile.
 
Gregory Peters
 
Yes, and then we d
efinitely want to have a mobile experience which allows 
us to access more of that market and access a group of consumers who 
basically only want to have their relationship with Netflix on a mobile device. 
And so whether that is making sure that our apps ar
e lightweight enough so 
they load really quickly and have a great experience there, to making sure 
that our encoding is very, very efficient, so that even if you have a less
-
than
-
great network connection, you can still get a really incredible video 
experie
nce on that mobile phone. And it's something that we have been able 
to drive down to, in my mind, remarkable efficiency where you can stream 
incredible video quality on even very, very suboptimal network connections. 
But ultimately, even 
--
 
we want to do t
hings like the download capability 
that we launched, where if you have no connection or it's a spotty 
connection or you just want to save your data plan, save that 
--
 
those 
--
 
that data bits for something else, we allow you to download some shows and 
enjoy
 
that even when you're offline. And I think it's a great example of, 
we're investing in a feature which is used differentially more in these 
emerging markets that you've mentioned, but it also fits our global product 
model, where our members around the wor
ld are getting a benefit, whether 
that's hopping on the plane or in other various ways.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And what's next, Greg, on the top product pipeline that we should be excited 
about?
 
Gregory Peters
 
There's a bunch of different stuff that we're 
working on, but maybe a few to 
call out. One is 
--
 
relatively new area for investment for us is building 
technology to support our content side. So the programming choices that we 
make, how we can produce content efficiently. And obviously, as that 
amount 
grows and grows and grows, that's a super high leverage point for 
us to bring and relatively, I think, a greenfield opportunity for us to bring 
technology to influence those outcomes even more. But then we bring this 
amazing library of content. And what we
 
think almost every day about is, 
how do we do an even better job innovating so that we can bring our 
members the perfect piece of content to watch whenever they access 
Netflix? And so you're going to see us do a lot more to innovate around that. 
How do we
 
launch new shows? How do we make them accessible to our 
members around the world, whatever language they're speaking, whatever 
territory they're in? And we're excited about all of those components.
 
David Wells
 
And Ben, before you go. Greg, you'd say the t
hird area that is related to 
some of the G&A growth that investors see is our investments in studios as 
well, Ben. So it's 
--
 
we're saying, calling out that we're also investing on the 
technical side in our studio buildout.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Let me come b
ack to the quarter and the sort of financial commentary in the 
letter. David, for you, you've taken up the OI guidance a little bit for the 
year. Maybe you could just talk about what's changed in the budget or 
--
 
and what you're thinking about presenting t
o us relative to where we were, 
say, in January.
 
David Wells
 
Well, really, what's changed is we've outperformed the business in a way 
that we didn't predict. So if you look at sort of our outperformance over the 
last 3 quarters, the business has grown fast
er than we've expected. We're 
able to redeploy that and reinvest some of that in content, but there's a long 
lead time to that and, to some degree, some of that goes into marketing of 
that associated content. But I think investors are benefiting from just 
the 
overall growth of the business. We're able to redeploy some of that towards 
it, and some of it, it just shows up in higher operating margin. So I think we 
posted 12%, and 12%, and we've got a lot of content and marketing sort of 
back
-
end
-
loaded to this
 
second half of this year, but it's somewhat the 
acknowledgment that the business is growing so well.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Marketing in the back half of the year, or back
-
half weighting, I guess a 
better way to put it, is that just a function of the timing o
f content? Why is 
marketing particularly back
-
end
-
weighted?
 
David Wells
 
It's mostly just the timing of content. So we've got a lot of great releases 
that I'm sure Ted can talk about coming up in Q3 and Q4.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Yes, let's move to Ted, then. T
alk about what is ahead of you from a content 
perspective that you think we should be focused on. And also, I'd love to 
hear how you think sort of the news category or news
-
like programming 
may be impacting either the business today or your strategy going 
forward, 
because it just seems like you guys are actually spending a little more time 
thinking about and executing on some of those type programs.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, as you know, we've been pretty successful with documentary 
--
 
feature
-
length document
aries, both with great (inaudible) audiences. But our 
move into news has been misreported for 
--
 
over and over again, and we're 
not looking to expand into news beyond the work that we're doing in short
-
form and long
-
form feature documentary. The upcoming t
hings that I think 
are particularly exciting in the quarter, we have a new season of 13 Reasons 
Why coming out this quarter. The first season of 13 Reasons Why was one of 
the most watched television shows of the year last year around the world, so 
we're re
ally thrilled about that. And new season 
--
 
returning seasons of our 
hits like Luke Cage and GLOW, Dear White People, Unbreakable Kimmy 
Schmidt. We have a great comedy feature film coming up with Adam 
Sandler and Chris Rock, called The Week Of. And we've a
lready started this 
quarter with new seasons of Santa Clarita Diet, Series of Unfortunate Events 
and a lot of real fan favorites. And then we've got 3%, which I mentioned 
earlier from Brazil, for a new season, but also a brand
-
new, original series 
from Den
mark, called The Rain, that we think is going to play really well all 
over the world.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And Ted, there's been some discussion about Netflix and the Obamas 
working together on a product that maybe is not real live news, [possibly] 
topical. 
I look at the Letterman programming also as an example of stuff 
that's sort of moving in that direction. Do you see that playing a bigger role 
in the content slate over time?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
The topical interview shows like that are 
--
 
absolutely, but mo
stly, you keep 
in mind that they're entertainment. Those are a form of entertainment. 
David Letterman is a great talk show host, not a newscaster. So we'll 
definitely do more of that. And I can't comment on the Obamas or any other 
deals that would be in va
rious states of negotiations right now.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Okay. I've got to ask you also about some of the controversy on the film 
festival side. You've been pretty outspoken as it relates to the Cannes 
situation. Can you talk about where this is all head
ed? Do you think it 
impacts Netflix's ability to attract talent, source, film, content, given there 
seems to be some industry pushback around the lack of theatrical releases 
in awards?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, we've addressed Cannes in the letter, so that k
ind of speaks for itself. 
And I'd say, generally, we are 
--
 
we released 33 films in theaters last year, 
just we released them day in day with Netflix. And I think it's be 
--
 
become 
more and more accepted and 
--
 
as part of the distribution norm. And 
definin
g distribution by what room you see it in is not the business we want 
to be in. We want to be about making great films that people love.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
So no thought about wider releases in order to make sure that your talent 
gets a shot at an 
--
 
award
s that might be important to them?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, keep in mind we had five projects nominated for the Oscars last year. 
We all released in this model, so.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Okay. David, back to you, just coming back to the financials. I think the cash 
burn in the first quarter was, what, maybe $250 million, something along 
those lines. You're still guiding to $3 billion to $4 billion. Is that something 
that you still think is
 
the right range? Could you come in at the lower end of 
that?
 
David Wells
 
Of course, we could. We're not projecting that we are, and I think it is 
related to the back
-
end content loading that we just talked about. So cash 
was modest in terms of relative to
 
the content in Q1, but we anticipate the 
timing to be a little heavier in the back end, and that shows you 
--
 
or points 
to the range still being $3 billion to $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Okay. And on the content obligations front, or co
ntractual obligation, I think 
it was 17, I believe, nine at the end of the quarter. So we are seeing a little 
bit of a second derivative slowdown there. As you move towards more 
original as a percentage of the total spend, that number, I believe, should 
st
art to plateau, maybe even decline. Are we there yet? Is that what we're 
starting to see in the numbers when you look at that obligations off balance 
sheet liability?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think most people, Ben, I think, want to incorporate the component 
th
at we're shifting our mix to more produced assets or [owned] assets for 
Netflix. I look at 2 components 
--
 
or 2 easily externally verifiable 
components. One is that streaming content obligation, but the other is the 
film assets, the produced asset value on
 
our balance sheet. And so even 
though 
--
 
even taking both into account on a per
-
member basis, what you 
saw is a lower per
-
member year
-
over
-
year. And I think that you are starting 
to see some of the second derivative take hold, but I don't want to hold us 
to that. It's not like we aim the business towards that or we try to grow the 
business towards that.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And just to add, Ben, to narrowly answer your question. The shift to self
-
produced will likely result in slower growth in the total obligation
s. However, 
there are components of self
-
produced content that also impact the content 
obligations [like] participation.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Multiple
-
season commitments in [inaudible], yes.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Sure.
 
David Wells
 
It's a technical point, Ben. I would 
just annotate Spencer, meaning that 
those are modest relative to the whole and some of the other bigger 
components. But that's right.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Makes sense. Reed, any updates on your thinking on the China opportunity? 
I know you have a partner the
re, but that market is evolving rapidly. It's 
quite a dynamic market. Have you thought about shifting strategies at all in 
that 
--
 
in China?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
You mean, now that IT is public, we should enter late? No. We're very 
comfortable with our China st
rategy of licensing our shows in the way HBO 
does, and so that's the strategy.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Okay. Makes sense. Coming back to the market like the U.S., just to take it 
as an example, the market's pretty far along the OTT path, to some extent. 
Roku's 
got 5000 channels on the platform. OTT is not new, Internet TV is not 
new here. Reed, do you have a view on sort of how many OTT services or 
television services these consumers are going to have as this spot business 
starts to mature? Do you think we have 
this 
--
 
sort of the equivalent of a 
fully distributed Internet TV network long term, the way we've had in the 
pay
-
TV model? Or do you think fragmentation and choice will lead to a much 
more sort of fragmented marketplace?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
Well, the 
great thing now is it's easier to create a television network called 
an app, and I think they'll be as 
--
 
think of all apps on your phone will have 
some form of video, or most apps will. And so you just see a very wide 
spread of entertainment options, some
 
of which are movies and TV shows, 
some are more interactive. And all of that mobile phone energy will spread 
to the television with operating systems like Rokus. So I think you'll see a 
very long tail. And of course, we want to be one of the apps that nea
rly 
everybody has on their home screen, whether that's on the phone or on the 
television. But again, if you look at the mobile phone ecosystem, it's very 
rich, and we see television getting close to that.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And what happens to engagement o
ver the longer term in that scenario? 
Because what we saw on TV, you started with 3 large broadcast networks 
pre
-
pay
-
TV, and then we just sort of fragmented our way through over the 
next kind of 40 to 50 years. Is Netflix sort of the NBC or CBS in 2017 of 
those networks in 1950 before the market started to evolve? Or do you think 
engagement continues to grow and it consolidates around the bigger 
players?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
Well, it's all up to us and execution. You're right that there are so many 
competitors, 
especially around the world, some of which are really focused 
on a particular culture. Others are, like Sky or in many different cultures. So 
the consumer has a lot of entertainment options. And then whether our 
share of that grows or shrinks is really up 
to, do we produce great content, 
market it well, serve it up beautifully? And if we do that really well, if we 
earn more of consumers' time, then we continue to grow. And if we get lazy 
or slow, we'll be run over, just like anybody else.
 
Benjamin 
Swinburne
 
So what is the biggest challenge ahead for the company, Reed? I think you 
look at the stock, up 60% year
-
to
-
date, and I'm sure and then some as we 
speak, there's probably a view out there that you guys have got it all figured 
out. What 
--
 
how do 
you keep the organization from getting complacent, 
staying motivated, and maybe throwing over to Ted, for managing the size 
of the output?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
We're a fraction of the hours of viewing of YouTube. We're a fraction of the 
hours of viewing of line
ar TV. We've got some great momentum, and we're 
very excited about that, but we have a long way to go in terms of earning all 
of the viewing that we want to.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes. And I think, in terms of scaling the original production and the licensing 
of content around the world, it's mostly about picking great people, giving 
them a great place to work, trusting their 
--
 
trusting them and empowering 
them to continue to make great choices, which we've really been focused on, 
both producing original conte
nt in the U.S. and in, like I've mentioned 
earlier, 17 countries around the world. And just figuring out what people 
like, and really, at the end of the day, I think the winners will be those who 
pick up their shows that people can't live without, and they
 
become 
associated with that kind of intense fandom that we can keep bringing to 
them day in and day out.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And then, Greg, when you look at the $1.3 billion or so in tech and dev book 
spend that you guys have this year, where is that mone
y going from a 
priority perspective to make the product the best it can be for members 
around the world?
 
Gregory Peters
 
Again, as I mentioned before, we're looking at it from a global product 
perspective. So we think that there's significant leverage that 
we get by 
trying to provide one solution against what we see as a pretty consistent set 
of consumer needs around the world. Now we're obviously trying to be 
mindful to these different use cases, how consumers in different markets 
react to our product, and 
learn things like downloads that we say, how 
there's a specific need in those markets but they prompt, in many cases, a 
general solution that we, again, get that high leverage. So we're really 
looking at the opportunity globally. The world is a place to le
arn, to 
understand from consumers, listen to them, but then react in a way that's 
scalable.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Maybe going over to Spencer. There's been a lot of press reports, anyway, 
about potential M&A, variety of areas and studio assets, I think, over 
in 
Europe, Outdoor's assets here in the States. I'm sure you can't comment 
specifically, but it does seem like Netflix may be more acquisitive looking 
forward than it's been in the past. Can you just talk about your philosophy 
on M&A and what might make se
nse, what might not, as you guys think 
about growing the company?
 
Spencer Wang
 
Sure. So if we look at the path, that bar is quite low since we've done very 
few transactions. We've only done one in our 20
-
year history. So based on 
that track record, I think
 
the takeaway for investors is that we have a strong 
bias to build over buy. That being said, we do see M&A as a perfectly fine 
tool for us to help find interesting assets to help grow the business. So from 
our perspective, we continue to be on the lookout
 
for new IP or other related 
assets that can help improve the service and help us grow faster.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Right. And Spencer, I'd just add by way of example, that the Millarworld 
acquisition, we're already in production on our first production with 
Umbrella 
Academy and we just released our first comic book. So in terms of using 
M&A to acquire a meaningful IP, this could be a very useful tool.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Maybe sticking with you, Ted, can you talk a little bit about the market for 
licensed prod
uct, and whether as Disney and others move closer to bringing 
their own product to market, the supply is drying up or you're thinking 
differently about acquiring third
-
party content?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Well, you've seen us move pretty aggressively into our 
own original 
programming, which means we're doing less licensing in that same way. It's 
--
 
we're moving both dollars up as 
--
 
in absolute, but as a percentage of our 
investment, we're investing more and more in original. And that's both a 
product of it's b
een working for us, it's been helping us grow the business, 
grow view hours, but also the ecosystem that produces that content that 
we're buying in second windows and sometimes third windows isn't 
producing content at the level of demand and quality that i
t had been over 
the years. So the things that we're engaged in bidding on are more 
selective, and there's less of them. So we are 
--
 
when there's 
--
 
when 
something shows up, though, that is great, like The People v. O.J., by way of 
example, we're in the mi
x and still licensing a lot of that content and 
certainly license a lot of great movies around the world and television 
content from around the world for the 
--
 
our other territories. You should 
expect us to be moving more and more into license and produce
d original 
programming versus fishing in the secondary market.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And I think you guys just renewed or ordered a new season of Jessica Jones 
from Marvel. Is there any change in how you think about continuing the 
sourced content on the Marve
l side, given all the changes that are happening 
and their strategy at Disney?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
No. We're thrilled with The Defenders universe and Jessica and, I said we 
have Luke Cage coming up this quarter for a new season. And those will 
continue as lo
ng as we want to keep making them, and it could be a quite 
wonderfully expanding universe and we would try not to let the business 
models get in the way of great 
--
 
making great programming for our 
customers.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Any impact from Hulu, which 
has been more and more aggressive acquiring 
prior
-
season content? I don't know if you're getting a look at that stuff or if 
it's just being kind of kept away from you for maybe obvious reasons?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
No, I mean, we've been in the mix on some of
 
them. Not many, but the 
ones that 
--
 
where there has been 
--
 
they've been in the mix, too, and I 
think that's closer to what they're doing on their business model, going after 
the broadcast with a select few originals, where we've gone much more the 
other
 
way.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Yes. And for you, and also for David, you guys are continuing to push into 
local originals. I think you had 30 on this slate for this year, I believe, local 
originals. Talk about where you source all that from locally. Is it 
hard to find 
local talent to develop that content? And from an efficiency perspective, for 
you and/or David, how do you think about the financial returns of those 
shows which are obviously not 
--
 
typically not an English native?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
What's be
en really great is the things that we'll 
--
 
we can bring our 
technology know
-
how to bring a great story from anywhere in the world to 
the rest of the world. And using our ability to subtitle and dub, and getting 
better and better at doing that quickly and 
accurately and artfully, has 
--
 
can 
make a very local show at least pan
-
regional and, at best, global. And we've 
seen that, like I mentioned, with 3% earlier. We just saw it with Dark from 
Germany, which played really well. I mean, those numbers 
--
 
those U
.S. 
numbers for us on those foreign
-
language shows would be big hits on cable 
with those numbers in the U.S. We've been particularly pleased to see a 
show like Casa De Papel or Money Heist, as those were released in the U.S., 
so successful for us all aroun
d the word that we've bought the series IP, and 
we'll be producing sequels and spinoffs of Casa De Papel as original content 
for years to come. So it's 
--
 
the scale on it has been, if it connects in the 
country, that's what it's built for it. And if it get
s viewing outside of the 
country, that's great. And if it's a global viewing, like we've seen with Dark 
and 3% recently and Chicas del Cable from Spain, we're thrilled and it scales 
wonderfully.
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
And Ben, we're also investing to support that
 
work on the dubbing and 
subtitling quality. So investors should check out The Rain, which is our 
Swedish, Danish film coming out 
--
 
sorry, series coming out in a few weeks, 
and just to look at the quality of what the dubbing could be, because we're 
really
 
making a big investment there that we think will pay off in 
approachability of all these titles from the world to the world.
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Yes, and I think, too, if you see it, one of the nice things is we're not trading 
off 
--
 
we're not watering down
 
the local aspect of the show at all to make it 
travel. These are local storytellers telling stories for local audiences that are 
so good, they travel globally. So there's nothing less German about Dark, 
and there's nothing less Danish about Rain. And Braz
il, like I said, in 
Portuguese, with a full Brazilian cast. And these are, you mentioned earlier, 
is not hard to find. I mean, there's incredible storytellers and producers 
around the world that just have not had access to a global audience before, 
and we'
ve been able to find them pretty effectively.
 
David Wells
 
So Ben, just to connect on that last one for financially. Like just what Ted 
and Reed have teed up is, we're drafting off a world that's becoming more 
global and more connected. And so we're able to
 
tell stories in non
-
English 
from local storytellers that are gripping for audiences outside their local 
market. And in many ways, we're elevating the storytelling which translates 
to increased cost but still, relative to a TV production in the U.S. or som
e 
other expensive developed market, it's quite a 
--
 
it's a fraction of the cost. 
And so it doesn't necessarily translate that more local television for Netflix 
equal lower margin for Netflix. We've made that point a couple of times, but 
I'll make it again 
in the sense that we're really excited about the 
transportability of some of this content because it's really opening up new 
stories across the world and in a way that doesn't sacrifice margin.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And maybe connecting those two points again
. Ted, if the local original does 
connect locally, is popular locally, is that a fairly high correlation that it's 
going to connect globally?
 
Theodore Sarandos
 
Not particularly, not particularly. It's interesting some shows, because 
they're just 
--
 
they're
 
hyper
-
local in the topic that don't travel but do 
incredibly well, 40%, 50% penetration in a market that don't particularly 
travel. But for the most part, what we found is, on the large
-
scale production 
shows, that they do travel quite well.
 
Benjamin Swin
burne
 
David, how are you thinking about marketing versus content spend in terms 
of the incremental dollar? You guys have clearly pivoted 
--
 
not pivoted, 
that's not right, but you've leaned in to the marketing budget this year. 
There's a phrase in the lette
r, density of viewing, which I think is new for 
you. What does that mean and how are you thinking about marketing 
--
 
investing behind your marketing ahead 
--
 
relative to your content spend 
over the next couple of years?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think that, in r
elation to density, I'll let Reed speak to it because I 
think it equates to public joy, but it's 
--
 
may be a little bit more of a precise 
term, in terms of you don't need a title that 75% of the world is watching. 
You may love a title that 75% of a particu
lar population of people is 
watching, and that speaks to density. But you're correct. We have definitely 
leaned more into marketing, and I think some of it is very sort of common 
sense, in the sense of, as we create more and more of these titles that no 
on
e has heard of, we're going to need to lean a little bit more on promotion, 
and the website can't do it all. So I think you're seeing some of that in terms 
of a nod towards maybe increasing that ratio of marketing spend to content 
spend. We don't know wher
e the perfect point is, in that we're a company 
that leans on experimentation. We try things. We turn them over, and then 
we'll increase or decrease based on the results as we see going forward, and 
I think that's the approach that you should expect from u
s.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
Does that lead maybe to a slower growth in content spend? Because if 
you're throwing a lot of marketing, there's only so much that you could 
really support for a given population. I would assume we all have this idea of 
a somewhat lim
ited attention span.
 
David Wells
 
Well, you're definitely seeing revenue grow faster than content already, and 
that's where operating margin is coming from. I can't say for sure where 
--
 
does it mean that marketing will go faster than content or content fas
ter 
than marketing? I'm not sure. I think we're trying to feel our way along to 
the right point going forward. But I don't know if, Ted or Reed, if you have a 
sort of annotation on that or not.
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
We have big plans for content growth, and you 
should expect that to 
continue. We're also, as David said, trying to learn, hey, if we put in more 
marketing versus less in different countries, what are the results? And so 
that's part of what you're seeing is this realization, this new opening, and 
how i
t increases the value and the viewing of our new original franchises.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
And David, do you have a view 
--
 
I mean, now that your 
--
 
the business has 
over 100 million members, the 
--
 
your contribution profit positive 
internationally and in th
e U.S., we already talked about marketing, do you 
have a view as to where long
-
term margins shake out for this business as 
you think about a ""steady state""?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think we're 
--
 
you asked a question earlier about our only 
opportunities being 
in Asia. That presupposes and sort of puts in the bag all 
this other growth in Latin America and Europe that, I can 
--
 
I could speak 
confidently on behalf of the team, that we don't take for granted. So we 
have a lot of opportunity and growth still in our 
core markets. The markets 
that we've been in for 5, 6, 7 years. I would say we're targeting 10 to 11 
this year. We've been putting on a pace of about 300 basis points. It's hard 
to know for sure where that goes. It really depends on the scale of the 
busine
ss that we are in 5 or 10 years. We think we're after a big 
opportunity, and the bigger the business we are, the higher that margin 
could be. We're certainly not down. You've heard me say in the past that 
we're not bound by international growth being at a 
lower margin. It's 
somewhat dependent on the competition within that territory. It's somewhat 
dependent on the size and scale of the business as we grow, and we think 
we've got a big market opportunity. So I would leave it there.
 
Benjamin 
Swinburne
 
Makes sense. And Reed, how do you think about ASP growth over time? You 
guys have implemented a number of, what I would call, successful price 
adjustments or price increases. Is the way to think about ASP growth going 
forward sort of what we've s
een over the last several years?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
Well, it really depends on the offering, the quality of our offering relative to 
others. So you have to earn it first by doing spectacular content that 
everybody wants to see. But if you do that, you can get
 
people to pay a little 
bit more because then we're able to invest more and further improve. But 
we always approach it on a ""have we earned more viewing from people"" 
basis first rather than a price
-
first basis.
 
Benjamin Swinburne
 
The letter talks about the
 
strength in the quarter coming from, I think, 
higher additions or gross adds. So maybe, David, just coming back to the 
business on churn, is there an opportunity you can hit to work churn lower 
from here? Or do you think you guys have hit, at least in som
e of your older 
markets, a retention level that's probably going to be tough to materially 
change?
 
David Wells
 
Well, it's hard. Again, we've made this point before, but the noise in terms of 
who comes in and who stays and all that, we're mostly focused on 
having a 
member that we 
--
 
that pays us or feels good about paying us over time. We 
break it out in order to give some color commentary. I would say, in these 
established markets, we're getting pretty close to asymptotic churn. We 
think we've got mild impr
ovements, but we're so big that even a 10 or 20 
basis point improvement can be meaningful. In the newer markets, it's really 
about increasing engagement because we do feel like that there is a tight 
relationship between engagement and churn up to a certain
 
point, obviously 
with diminishing marginal return, but we're still young enough in many of 
the newer markets that we're focused on that and growing that engagement 
to improve retention.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Ben, I think we have about time for one last question.
 
B
enjamin Swinburne
 
Sure. I didn't want to let this end, Reed, without going back to you. And 
given what's happened over the last couple of months in the tech industry, 
just get a sense from you and how you think 
--
 
what you think the 
implications are for Ne
tflix, if any, from all of the focus by regulators, by 
consumers on data, privacy, the use of data to drive your business, GDPR. 
What does this all mean for Netflix? If anything are you making any 
changes?
 
Wilmot Hastings
 
Well, I'm very glad that we built 
the business not to be ad
-
supported but to 
be subscription. We're very different from the ad
-
supported businesses, and 
we've always been very big on protecting all of our members' viewing. We 
don't sell advertising. So I think we're substantially inoculate
d from the 
other issues that are happening in the industry, and that's great. And then, 
second, I'd point out that we'll spend over $10 billion on content and 
marketing and $1.3 billion on tech. So just objectively, we're much more of 
a media company in th
at way than pure tech. Now of course, we want to be 
great at both, but again, we're really pretty different from the pure tech 
companies.

7/23/13,Netflix,"Welcome to the Netflix Q4 2016 Earnings Call. I am David Wells, the CFO. 
Joining me today from the company is Reed Hastings, our CEO and Ted 
Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.
 
Interviewing us on today's call, or interview, is Doug Mitchelson from UBS 
and Scott Devitt from Stifel Nicolaus. A cautionary note that we will be 
making forward
-
looking statements, actual results may vary. Scott, I think 
you have the first question, so over to Scott.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Scott Devitt
 
Yes, 
thanks, David. First question for Reed. Just an outstanding quarter, 
both domestically and internationally, relative to expectation from a 
subscriber standpoint. And there is so much focus on international given the 
opportunity there to grow the business, 
as well as the way you've built out 
the international business with some more mature markets that you've been 
in for quite some time. Some newer markets like France and Germany that 
are starting to kick in, and the 130 that were added at the beginning of 
2
016. So, I was wondering if you could frame, potentially, the over
-
performance in the quarter and where you saw strength regionally.
 
Reed Hastings
 
You describe it as over
-
performance in the quarter, but if you look at it on a 
longer term basis like over th
e last couple years, it smooths it out. So, we 
are seeing some lumpiness in the quarters depending on when we launched 
certain content, but the big picture is remarkably steady and so we have a 

so think of it really 
as this big adoption of Internet TV. It's in somewhat influenced by the 
content in the short
-
term.
 
And then you asked about the international expansion which has been 
remarkably steady. Again if you don't look at it by the quarter, bu
t you look 
at by the year, what was seen Latin America's steady growth, Europe as a 
whole has been really picking up momentum for us, and Asia, we're just 
getting started.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then secondly, possibly for David, you got the first quarter U.S. 
c
ontribution margin above the longer term I think target. Understanding that 
there is lumpiness in that you're going to continue to invest in their 
business. Is there any update on that longer term target in terms of the 
contribution margin for the U.S. mar
ket?
 
David Wells
 
No, no Scott we did, as you correctly asked me that there's two pieces one is 
the U.S. contribution margin pops up in the first quarter and we're indicating 
that that's 
--
 
we're going to continue to reinvest.
 
And then on the international 
line, we actually broke through into 
profitability for our consolidated international segment and we will continue 
to invest 
--
 
take that back down through the year.
 
So, I think that we don't talk about long
-
term targets other than an 
operating margin targ
et. We had mentioned before that we would produce 
meaningful operating profit in 2017 and beyond, so we fleshed that out a 
little bit for you, the investor now targeting at 7% operating margin for this 
year and steady growth afterward.
 
And then we don't th
ink anything structurally is at hand than in terms of our 
international businesses. It really depends on the competitiveness of each 
market, but we think we can continue to grow the overall profitability. So, 
we'll grow operating profit by continuing to gr
ow U.S. margin and also 
reduce international losses with respect to adding on more investment.
 
So, I think long
-
term we'll reduce those losses and grow international 

 
Scott Devitt
 
Thank you.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I think on the fourth quarter results, so I'm curious, in the U.S. what content 
specifically drove the strong performance relative to budgets?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, we had a pretty powerful releases in Q4. So, you see particularly 
shows like Luke Cage, Narco
s 
--
 
new series of Narcos that travel really well 
around the world and we know that they are exciting here as consumers of 
television in America, but it's been fantastic to see how these shows are 
adopted around the world.
 
David Wells
 
Yes, Doug, I would ju
st add to that that we're 
--
 
you're now seeing the 
benefit of Netflix having sort of its third, fourth year of original slates. So, 
we're now getting 
--
 
as Ted mentioned Narcos season two comes out, but 
we've got new seasons as well. So, you're getting the
 
benefit of shows that 
might take hold in their second or third season, but some new shows as 
well, like Stranger Things did for us in the third quarter and continue to be 
popular through the fourth quarter as well.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And a nice upside surprise 
us something like Gilmore Girls where you think 
would be incredibly domestic in its popularity, but we found it to be 
incredibly internationally popular as well, particularly from performing grade 
in Europe.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And this might seem relatively o
bvious given the comment so far that 
content is drive to subscriber, but in terms of your ability to measure how 
content is driving subscribers, and you talked last quarter about including 
new content into your subscriber growth guidance and you see the st
rong 
result this quarter, is it tangible title
-
by
-
title, are you making just an overall 
estimate based on spending or number of release [ph]?
 
Reed Hastings
 

because of a 
single title. But there's a tipping point. We have one more title 
that has great excitement, you're hearing a lot about and that triggers you 
to finally sign up for Netflix.
 
So, it's a cumulative effect of all of these and you can 
--
 
you see some 
frontload
ing whole forward, but the basic demand creation is increasing as 
people get more comfortable and more aware of the idea of Internet 
television where you don't get the commercial interruptions, where you just 
get to watch when and where you want. So, those
 
are the big drivers.
 
And then the things that capture the demand are really these big launches 
that we're doing particular title franchises.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Just to feed off Doug's question, there is commentary in the letter regarding 
content being a driver 
for subscribers in the second half of 2017. Is that

just looking at the slate in that period as a driver for their business, or is 
there something else to that comment?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
You should look at, we have multiple seasons of our shows and we see th
at 
the audience continues to build cumulatively and therefore the excitement 
for the upcoming season builds as well.
 
So, in Q2 of this year, we have new seasons of a lot of our very popular 
shows, like Orange Is The New Black, Kimmy Schmidt, Bloodline, Sen
se8, 
Master of None, and we think that they should have a pretty nice impact on 
our subscriber growth as well.
 
David Wells
 
Yes, and Doug if I 
--
 
and Scott if I can knit these comments together, Reed's 
comments, Ted's comments and your questions, there's a 
difference 
between 
--
 
so the baseline demand as Reed said is just the transition to 
Internet TV and the overwhelming convenience of it.
 
We get 
--
 
talking a lot about that sort of quarter, inter
-
quarter whether we 
hit above we expected or not based on some 
of how these shows perform. 
And if their brand new shows, they don't tend to 
--
 
if they are having to 
punch into the consciousness of the consumer, they don't tend to draw new 
subscribers in as great of numbers as some of our existing shows. So what 
we wer
e saying is in the first quarter, we have some great new shows 
[Indiscernible] that are doing well, but they don't tend to draw numbers like 
House of Cards did last year in terms of we're lapping House of Cards and 
for us, it was a surprise of Making a Mur
derer as well.
 
So, I think 
--
 
what Ted thinks, we have all these great shows coming in the 
back half of the year and more of them are second season, they tend to 
draw in more subscribers because they are better
-
known shows.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Second, third, four
th, and this seasons even.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And sorry to be so myopic around the more near
-
term subs, but one final 
question on that for me. There was a 
--
 
I think a comment, as well, in terms 
of potentially being a pull
-
forward in subscribers into Q4 from one
 
as part of 
the explanation for the 1Q sub guidance. And can you flesh that just a bit 
and what gives you that type of visibility?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. Reed or I could do that, but I'll take a stab at it. I think what we saw 
in 2016 around our un
-
grandfatheri
ng our price change was a lot of 
lumpiness in our subscribers in terms of 
--
 
we grew strongly in the first 
quarter, second and third more modestly, and then building into the fourth 
quarter.
 
And what we found was we found a lot of rejoins coming back. So, 
yes, 
there was a reaction to the price, but we got 
--
 
many of those subscribers 

--
 
or the 
fourth quarter we got many of them back that may have come in the first 
quarter, we may have seen s
ome of those folks in the first quarter. So, we 
tend to look less at a specific quarter's performance and we look sort of over 
a six or nine or 12
-
month period in terms of what is the real trend here, not 
focusing too much on any specific quarter because t
hey do seem to have 
bleeds in terms of some folks joining in a quarter that they would've joined 
the former quarter.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Got it. Thank you.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Two more questions from me on near
-
term subscribers. First Reed you said 
that Europe is rea
lly picking up and I think when you launch those markets, 
you indicated we take some time for them to work Latin America now that's 
happening, but investors are still wondering, something specific that you 
have done differently or done recently that's driv
e improvements, 
particularly in Germany and France?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, there's no specific like pricing, marketing tactic. It's the cumulative 
effect of show
-
after
-
show being end market, just the steady work that we've 
done and this is what we also saw in L
atin American as there was no step 
function, there was just steady discipline of staying on our game of great 
shows, great movies, and enjoyment continues to increase. There's slightly 
incremental more partners that we have, but there's is no real step fun
ction. 
Again it's really the continue buildup of momentum.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, we're seeing as we're adding more and more global shows that it's 
rising all boats [ph] across the world.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And I think we talked about acquisition a lot in 
near
-
term, when you think 
about churn management, I think investors are curious both on did X1 
integration have any [Indiscernible] in the quarter, did other bundling deals 
throughout the world 
--
 
you certainly have done quite of them, have any 
influence a
nd as you think about churn trends, is there anything noticeable 
for investors' assessment and how should we think about that in a flow basis 
going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
All the partnership deals we really believe and that's why we're doing more 
of them, 
but you can see we had been outperformance in international and 
in domestic. So, it wasn't just a Comcast story, in which case, it would have 
been domestic only.
 
It's fundamentally a story of the broad acceptance of Internet TV and the 
content. And then on
 
the margin, those partnership deals are good for the 
customers, good for us and good for the partner.
 
Scott Devitt
 
The cable set
-
top box deals, the 
--
 
I think John Malone was quoted recently 
at Lionsgate Analyst Day as saying that you had approached some 
operators 
in terms of being bundled into service, where carriers would cover. And just 
interested in terms of the accuracy of the statement, is that something you 
are interested in and what you think the benefit of that would be of such?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We w

world, we've done extremely well focusing on our service as a discrete 
service, $7.99 a month and incredible content. And so we're just going to 
keep pounding that drum as we expand aroun
d the world and also here in 
the U.S.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And the X1 interface, which is outstanding by the way, we have it at our 
house, are there 
--
 
I assume that there is interest in doing more integrations 
like that. Is there any reason other than simply bein
g able to cut those 
deals, technology restriction standpoint with other providers that would limit 
the ability to do deals with others?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, X1s are very advanced set
-
top, so not all MSOs in the U.S. have such 
advanced, so they basically can'
t do Internet apps or can't do Netflix. So, X1 
is very strong in that way, so is the dish receiver, so we're able operate on 
ones that are relatively modern and have other IT apps also.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Reed, I think you've had advantage just because of the
 
technology 
investment you've made over time, the scale that you have deployed, any 
concerns longer term to the extent more and more of your competitors are 
bundled in on the same aggregating performs like X1 that you could lose a 
bit of a technology, cons
umers access your content all through the same 
interface that they are accessing [Indiscernible]?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, when the consumer finds in the Comcast UI some Netflix show, they 
click on that and it opens the Netflix app and then the consumers in the
 
Netflix app, they enjoy the show and then we control after the show, the 
post
-
play experience which guides them into another show, another show.
 
So, we look at it as entry ramp onto our application and we're 
--
 
we feel that 
our application really is the b
est way to enjoy Netflix content, but that 

Comcast user interface because that's very effective for customers.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
And 
--
 
so I was circling back to some of the subscriber an
d I'm curious any 
learnings now that the global rollover is full year behind you when you look 
back anything that's far and different than expected and when can we 
expect the next round of taking some of those skin markets like Poland and 
Turkey and turnin
g them into market launches?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We'll continue with more Poland and Turkey like launches this year with 
several countries. So, that will just be a steady process we're going through. 
We'd really like what we saw once we localized Poland and Turk
ey in terms 
of increased viewing, increased membership growth. So, we'll just keep on 
that pattern.
 
Think of it 
--
 
from a near
-

influence compared to the big established markets in Europe, LatAm and 
North Americ
a. And then of course over time they should be quite 
substantial. But they are long
-
term place.
 
David Wells
 
And Doug from a financial standpoint, just keep in mind that when we talk 
about the investments in international, content is the big piece of that. 
Localization is relatively modest compared to the content.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Ted, I think the last time that you spoke publicly this topic; you were doing 
local language content in 10 different countries. And I was wondering if you 
could talk about success or c
hallenges of that, and that was tied to original 
comp.
 
And then also more broadly, local language in newer markets as well as 
marketing campaigns, which was identified in 2016 as something that 
needed to be put in place to get some of the newer markets to 
begin to 
progress [Indiscernible]?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, so far we've really happy with the success of our local language 
productions in France and Mexico and Brazil and as I mentioned last time, 
we've rolled it out to Germany, to Spain, to Italy. We're 
deep in production. 
We're entering into a couple of new productions in Asia. What we find is a 
--
 
it creates a lot of great excitement for Netflix in the market because it's a 
really elevated form of television relative to what else is available in the 
mar
ket.
 
And we love that we're working with local storytellers, local producers to 
make that content and even more importantly making its available around 
the world has been a huge differentiator for us.
 
So when I mentioned earlier about the Gilmore Girls bei
ng so popular 
globally, so it was a little softer anywhere, it might have been in Brazil and 
about the same time, we're launching a really great little science fiction 
show called the 3%, a local Portuguese language show that we shot in 
Brazil. It was enor
mously popular in Brazil and played to millions of 
subscribers around the world including the U.S. So, it's been a great way to 
find new global storytellers and make Netflix feel a lot more local in those 
countries.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then I think you also q
uoted as saying that 1,000 hours of content in 
2017 seemed to be pretty conservative. Can you speak to that in terms of 
--
 
it was local language as a contributor to that, but also as genres and 
geographies, and what actually is going to be the makeup of th
ose 1,000 
hours?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I would like to focus you a little less on the 1,000 hours and more on the 
quality of those 1,000 hours. About half of the most searched for shows on 
television around the world this year were Netflix Original shows and that's
 
the kind of thing we're really proud of. A little bit 
--
 
even more so than the 
volume of it all, it's interesting and it's an artifact of a fast growth and 
commitment that is so many hours, but the rest of this quarter, we still have 
42 Original launches 
to lunch rest of this quarter including shows like Santa 
Clarita Diet with Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, a second season of 
Love, Iron Fist, our latest Marvel series we'll be launching this quarter.
 

of volume, but it's also a ton 
of quality that consumers are falling in love with.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Shifting over to 
--
 
strategies I'm just curious reflecting back on the last year 
where you had said your price increases flowing through from the Un
-
grandfat
hering, Reed, David, did you learn anything about the pricing power 
of Netflix and can you bid about what investors should expect your pricing 
strategies in 2017 and beyond please?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You should expect us to continue to invest in the 
consumer experience, 
making the content incredible and we don't have any plans for any near
-
term changes. So, I would just continue to look at as a model us as 
expanding the membership base at these terrific rates.
 
David Wells
 
I also think Doug in terms of
 
--
 
nothing has changed in terms of our long
-
term view of our ability 
--
 
of our belief ability to continue to add great value 
and slowly, steadily assume that value overtime. So, I don't think anything 
has changed in that respect.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I think a
long the lines of similar things you've been saying Reed, one of the 
questions that we get from investors is why focus on earnings at all it 
Netflix? I mean shareholders have clearly rewarded the [Indiscernible] for 
subscriber growth and revenue growth or 
leadership position in the market, 
while Ted is ramping content pretty aggressively, I'm sure he is always 
asking for more money. Why the philosophy around trying [ph] growth with 
delivering earnings?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, we don't really believe in hockey
-
st
ick kind of businesses, like suddenly 
we'll turn significantly profitable at 200 million members. We think it's much 
smarter to grow into that bit
-
by
-
bit. So, expect us to modestly move up 
operating income and operating margins as we have from 4% to 7% and
 
continue a slow and growing into that as we grow larger.
 
We'll keep an eye on the investment levels that are necessary to protect the 
advantages that we have. So, don't worry about that, but I would say, in 
general, you grow into the profitability as oppo
sed to postponement forever 
and then hope that you can change the business model to deliver on the 
profitability front leader.
 
David Wells
 
And the only thing I'd add to that, and Ted probably has his own answer, 
there's a little bit of scarcity that goes a
long way in terms of efficiency and I 
just making sure that we continue to focus on the quality.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Well said.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Ted, how did The Crown do? And did it 
--
 
seemed like it would perform well 
in the U.K. How did it travel throughout 
--
 
perform in the U.S. and other 
regions?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
We're incredibly proud of it, both for the reasons you just mentioned which 
is that it's been incredibly popular globally, there's an enormous interest in 
the royal family around the world, so in the U.K.
, it was really celebrated as 
something that only the BBC could do just a couple of years ago and really 
loved in the U.K., in the U.S., but also even in countries throughout Asia, 
throughout Europe obviously where people just love that story, and more 
imp
ortantly, they loved how it was told and we were thrilled that it won at 
the Golden Globes for Best Drama. It was our first Best Drama Award there 
and we're excited, we're deep into season two now and excited to tell the 
rest of the story.
 
Scott 
Devitt
 
Great. Thank you. And Reed, in the test market, you are one quarter away; 
I think you are going to be approaching 50 million U.S. paying subscribers at 
the end of the first quarter. There's over 100 million households in the U.S. 
that subscribe to c
able and satellite cable. The price point and the value 
proposition, it really does not seem like there's any reason why, over time, 
with broadband speeds, that you should be able to address all households. 
When you look at the next 50 million in the U.S.,
 
where do you incur the 
friction points that are limiting you right now to getting to those numbers 
faster?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think it's really this fusion to the society as more and more people use 
Netflix. We have better and better shows and more of them 
-
-
 
you just get 
the word of mouth, which is how you grow from nearly 50 million to 60 
million and hopefully we keep going.
 
In terms of getting to a full 1:1 tie ratio with today's cable that includes a lot 
of sports which we don't have and don't have plans 
for. So, you want to wait 
that a little bit. But in terms of the next couple of years, again, I think if you 
look back four or five years, it's been really pretty steady growth overall and 
it's following this formula of just improving the value, improving 
the content, 
improving the service like adding our offline viewing. It's really creating a big 
wave of customer joy, the video merchandising that you'll see where you get 
to choose content by looking at content. So, we're continuing to innovate on 
multiple
 
fronts to just make it a better experience.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
Two questions from me for David just on some of the financial commentary. 
In the letter, I think you gave 7% was the guidance for full year 2017. I 
think would helpful for investors just to under
stand on the cost category 
[Indiscernible], what the outlook might be for 2017, so when you look at 
G&A, and tech and dev, and marketing, if you could give us a sense of what 
the dynamics for each of those are this year that will be helpful?
 
David Wells
 
Su
re Doug and we updated our long
-
term letter a little bit in this respect as 
well. So, think about 6 billion in content, a billion in tech and dev, 
somewhere around a billion in G&A to sort of round out the operating profit 
expense lines and that should get
 
you there.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
That work. And then also notable free cash flow burn $2 billion for this 
--
 
that was a bit higher than I believe you suggested a few months ago. So, 
what's changed?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think what we put in the October letter was
 
that free cash flow might 
be similar to Q3, it was more than that. We do think it's going to come down 
this quarter in Q1, but we wanted to give an indication, it's pretty lumpy 
right now. Even my team has 
--
 
we don't really focus on trying to optimize a 
single quarter, we're looking at sort of across four and eight quarters and we 
think the run rate is around 500 million right now in terms of the quarter as 
we continue to expand content.
 
It's not too different from 2016. I mean we moved up to 1.7 billion 
in 2016 
and so we're indicating that might be around 2 billion this year and we'll go 
from there. I mean I think what you'll find is we will organically fund more 
and more of our own content expansion with the growth of our operating 
profit and so more and
 
more as we transition over the next few years, our 
debt will be about content expansion, but it also transition to being about 
optimization of cost to capital.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And I think you said at one point in time or possibly it was Reed that 
--
 
if 
conte
nt is available, you would be willing to take on more leverage or take 
on versus first otherwise letting it go because it does fit into the P&L 
currently.
 
So, with 
--
 
and I'm paraphrasing there, but with 
--
 
where you're now in the 
$2 billion drag, but wher
e content spend see it's beginning to normalize in 
terms of the outweigh versus the P&L spend. Is there visibility to when the 
business becomes self
-
fund based on the current trajectory?
 
David Wells
 
We haven't provided that guidance Scott. It really depend
s on how much we 
want to continue to expand content and the growth of the business itself. 
So, we're little bit guarded in terms of providing specific because there's 
interdependences there.
 
What I think 
--
 
and this back to Doug's question prior is part of
 
the reason 
that our working capital needs have gone up a little bit is because we're 
owning more and more of our content and I think that's a good thing for the 
investor and the shareholder. We control more of the rights, more of the sort 
of global advant
ages for being a platform that is increasingly having 90 
million and beyond global subscribers will be advantageous for us to own 
that content.
 
So, I think the step
-
up 
--
 
the slight step
-
up from years past 
--
 
a couple of 
years to the 2 billion that we're t
alking about this year is inclusive of more 
owned content and increasingly more content categories. I think you get 
both of those in there.
 
Scott Devitt
 
And then secondly as investors begin to look the U.S. market as a template 
for rest of world as happens
 
with businesses in the Internet when you grow 
globally, can you just talk about the takes in terms of what could lead to 
similar margin profile of markets out of U.S. versus higher or lower as the 
churn?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. I'll pitch it to Reed. I'll say s
omething and then Reed can follow
-
on. 
But I would say there's competitiveness in those markets. Generally, overall 
I would say there's nothing fundamental that we can get to margins equal or 
better in some places of the U.S. So then you think about an aver
age across 
the globe and it really is about determined somewhat by competitiveness, 
it's determined by the cost of that content.
 
But the more we can grow and provide sort of spread the cost of popular 
content that is engaging to a large portion of the worl
d, the more advantage 
and scale advantage we see there in terms of being able to do that.
 
So, I would provide those comments and then see if Reed has anything that 
he might want to add to that.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think that's perfect David. Our North Star 
is providing an incredible value 
to consumer because upon that you can build a very large and very 
profitable franchise. But it starts with an amazing value for consumers which 
is a great service and amazing content behind that.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Thanks.
 
Doug M
itchelson
 
Two questions for Ted. Ted, anything new in terms of ROIs on your 
investment in content? You look at acquired versus originals, are the lines 
starting to cross in any way? And as part of that, are you willing to give us 
an update in hours consume

you in a while.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, stay tuned for those numbers. We don't have anything to report today, 
but I'll tell you I think the 
--
 
as David had mentioned while it is a bit more 
cash consumptive, owning ou
r own content and including our original 
productions has a lot of big scale advantages to the business, probably the 
most meaningful one is removing the studio markup and overhead on those 
productions and being able to put more of that on the screen, ownin
g the IP 
as we expand into multiple seasons, having control over the windows.
 
And so I lean into both original programming and owned original 
programming, but we're still very active buyer of second
-
window content 
from our studio partners. We are increasin
gly coproducing some of the 
programming with networks and studios around the world. We'll take one 
country and we'll premiere the show globally at the same time which takes 
off some of that risk and also enhances our partnerships with those 
networks and st
udios.
 
But I do think there's a lot of value in owning the IP and a lot of value in 
creating new content. But we need to have great programming for our 
members and sometimes, we don't have that. So, we will have to go out and 
we're buying it elsewhere to e
nhance what we are doing.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I think along those lines, any suggestions as to where the emphasis will be 
going forward? I think there's still a feeling that this could use more movie 
content. You made huge investments on the comedy side, which
 
they 
--
 
if 
you want to talk about that. Particular genres that we should expect you to 
focus ongoing forward?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, you could look at those comedy investments as a good example of 
taking a category that we primarily bought second window from 
other people 
just a few years ago and now are producing original programming that takes 
it from being just something people watch to something people really value 
Netflix for differentially. The rest of this quarter you're going to see standup 
shows from A
my Schumer, Dave Chappelle, Trevor Noah, Jim Norton, like 
some of the top names in comedy.
 
And as you are 
--
 
going out, we've already talked about Chris Rock and Jerry 
Seinfeld's recent deals. But that's a category we took it from being kind of 
cheap secon
d window programming to something that really becomes an 
event and a subscriber acquisition driver for Netflix.
 
Same thing with unscripted programming with shows that will be launching 
even this quarter like Ultimate Beastmaster and Abstract, which is a va
riant 
on Chef's Table, but about design. And it's all that programming that we 
used to license in second window that we're finding to be much more 
valuable to go ahead and produce originally for Netflix.
 
David Wells
 
Scott, Doug, I think we got time for may
be one final question from either 
one of you or one each.
 
Scott Devitt
 
I'll go first. The question that I had is 
--
 
squeeze in net neutrality edits, it's 
commented on the letter, but we could just the assumption of the new 
administration entitled to that n
eutrality is rolled back, what are the 
implications for Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think we addressed that in the letter. I don't have really anything to add to 
that.
 
Scott Devitt
 
Okay.
 
Doug Mitchelson
 
I think from my end last question, we're just curious th
e ultimate vision at 
this point, we're turning the new calendar year. I think we've had a 
conversation in the past where you talked about to satisfy consumers you 
have to give them all the television shows they want for $25. I'm just 
curious as you talk ab
out the letter, your decade 
--
 
next decade is going to 
be pretty exciting, what's your ultimate vision at this point for the services?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You never want to characterize something as an ultimate vision because 
when you get there, there's always m
ore that you want to do. And so we're 
taking it year
-
by
-
year, we're growing around the world, we're thrilled with 
our global expansion, ex
-
China we're really focused on all the different 
markets, Asia still doing work, in Europe we're building up our conte
nt 
production, muscle, we're able to produce shows now in many countries 
around the world.
 
So, think of us just continuing to iterate on the basic cycle of more content, 
better product that combines as a great service with a great price and 
hopefully with 
that, we can attract many more people to join Netflix and 
then that fuels the whole cycle.
 
So, we're just going to lather, rinse, repeat again and again for the next 
couple years and expand that. We have a long way to go. When you think 
about how many 
movies and TV shows we don't have. We want to be able to 
just think about the great range of content that we have and we're very 
ambitious about what we can do, especially around the world.
 
So, there's a lot for us to work on. And then just the next six we
eks in 
Brazil, Europe, Asia, we're having a blast just spreading and evangelizing 
this vision of Internet TV where you get to control what you watch and you 
get incredible quality content.
 
And we hope to land this quarter in 99 million subscribers, which w
ill be 
quite an achievement. And thank you very much all for your support and 
look forward to talking to again in the quarter.

4/23/13,Netflix,"Great. Hi. I am David Wells, CFO of Netflix, and I would like to welcome 
everyone to today's Q1 2014 earnings interview. I am joined today on the 
company side by Reed Hastings, CEO; and Ted Sarandos, Chief Content 
Officer. Interviewing us will be Rich 
Greenfield of BTIG Research and Doug 
Anmuth of JPMorgan.
 
We will be making forward
-
looking statements in today's earnings interview. 
Actual results may vary.
 
At this point, I would like to turn it over to Rich Greenfield for our first 
question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Thanks, David, and thank you to Reed and Ted as well for having both Doug 
and myself co
-
moderate your Q1 earnings conference call. I think we are 
going to go back and forth and switch between Doug
 
and myself asking 
questions.
 
The first question we would like to address to Reed Hastings. The question I 
think is on everyone's mind right now is why is now the right time for a price 
increase? I know a few years ago, you had talked about the need to wai
t a 
few years to raise pricing. Is it merely that a few years has passed? Or is 
there something else driving the need to raise pricing?
 
And then attached to that, how should people think about the flow through 
of the revenue you are going to generate from 
that higher price increase? 
Will that be reinvested in content? Or should we expect all of that to drop to 
the bottom line?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Rich, over the last couple of years, we have been improving the content 
selection on Netflix and broadening it, most r
ecently with the addition of the 
amazing shows like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, and if we 
want to continue to expand to do more great original content, more series, 
more movies, we have to eventually increase prices a little bit. We are not
 
doing much. We are doing $1 or $2, depending on the country and all the 
existing subscribers keep their current price. They don't get it increased. So 
therefore the revenue increase to Netflix will be quite modest in the short
-
term and eventually as new m
embers come in, they pay a little bit more and 
with that we will be able to license much more content and deliver a very 
high quality video.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And Reed, would you still think about tiering going forward? Or has this 
potentially removed
 
that possibility over time?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, that's definitely a possibility. We are continuing to look at that. So the 
big focus is on this increase and we want to get this done well and make 
sure we grandfather people cleanly and it is something we're 
definitely 
looking at.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
But you still believe that through a tiered structure over time, it's possible. 
What are the things that you could potentially tier on? Concurrent streams, 
standard def, high def, number of devices, content? Ho
w do you think about 
that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we have tiering now. We have two plans. We have the two stream at a 
time that's $7.99 and we have the four stream at a time which is $11.99. So 
we have tiering today, and it is definitely something we are thin
king about in 
terms of expanding the options that consumers have. Some of that being on 
the criteria that you referred to.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Is the two
-
year, Reed, that you talked about in Ireland for grandfathering, is 
that what you deem gen
erous as you think about how to properly support 
the current subscriber base that you have with the price increase? And how 
will you actually communicate the risk to a consumer of dropping out and 
then being tagged with a higher price, if they choose to co
me back?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, you are talking about $1 or $2 difference per month. So I don't think 
it's a huge difference, and then yes, the two years very generous. We will do 
between a year and two. We are still looking at what's come of that. So we 
will
 
be able to announce more details later.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And David, how would you think about how you would reinvest the dollars 
from the price increase into additional content or allowing that to fall more 
down to the bottom line?
 
David Wells
 
Well,
 
Doug, we said before that mostly it is going to be towards content. It is 
about improving our service and if you think about generous grandfathering, 
that is going to bleed in over time in terms of the average subscription price. 
It will take a while. I t
hink it will be gradual. At the point where we reach 
30% where we think it is coming up, we will look at the business and make 
the right long
-
term choices for both profitability as well as a long
-
term 
profitability, which you get from a very strong consume
r offering, which 
means content as well.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
David. I think actually on the last conference call, Reed had talked about as 
you get to the 30% domestic contribution margin, it would get tougher to 
expand by 400 basis points a qua
rter. Does the price increase doing it now 
actually change that forecast? Is it easier to add 400 basis points to margins 
domestically in both 2015, 2016 and beyond?
 
David Wells
 
So adding revenue makes it, by nature, easier but what he is 
referring to is 
the fact that the numbers get larger, right. That margin is a percent of 
revenue. So as that number gets larger and larger it gets harder and harder 
to add 100 basis points or 400 year
-
on
-
year. So I don't think it changes 
anything in the ca
lculus when we say that when we reach 30% we will look 
at the situation, we will look at the company and make the right smart long
-
term choices, including how much we put to content, how much we put in 
terms of streaming delivery and product, how much to m
arketing and then 
how much to profit.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Ted, do you want to talk for a minute about the new content and some 
of the things, at least in general, that we will be able to do post the price 
increase?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I mean we are rapidly exp
anding our original production. We have 
several productions in running today all around the world and I think when 
you look at the size and scope and the ambition level of some of these 
projects, you will see that this is a great time for consumers because
 
people 
who were never working in television before are thrilled to be working in 
television today and doing some of the best work of their life. At higher 
budgets, sure, but that's a good thing for everybody, including us because 
we are in the position to
 
be able to bring that kind of production level to our 
store members.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
David, the comment about international profitability from existing markets 
expected by the end of the year. Is it fair to assume that the U.K. is 
profitable now wi
th Latin America still experiencing losses?
 
David Wells
 
We didn't say anything specifically about individual markets. I think what we 
have said and we had reiterated that each market has gotten better. Both 
has been growing and has been improving in terms 
of a loss but we didn't 
give any specifics about it. We wanted to give that comment about our 
overall profitability of all of our existing markets to demonstrate that before 
we launch another substantial expansion that we are pretty confident in our 
existi
ng performance in the markets we have today.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Doug, I would add that we are very confident of our success in Latin 
America as well as the U.K. So we are making great progress in every 
country, which is giving us a big ambition for this nex
t round of European 
expansion.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
A question for David on a follow
-
up. When you look at that $300 million to 
$400 million, I think that you kind of got hit by as you launched both the 
U.K. and Latin America, should we expect a 
similar type negative impact on 
profitability internationally as you get into markets like France and 
Germany?
 
David Wells
 
Well, we didn't give specific guidance, Rich, in terms of an actual number, 
but I would say that if you think about the U.K. and look
ing at our financials 
at the time we launched the U.K., that was a substantial market for us. If 
you look at what our financials would be today and into 2015, given the 
comment about our international profit, starting to be profitable starting in 
2015, the
n you would have to assume that those investments will be of that 
size.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Just moving over to profitability on the U.S. side. I think in the quarter, you 
saw about 460 basis points of year
-
over
-
year increase in contribution 
margin, Dav
id. Where do you feel like you generated the most upside here?
 
David Wells
 
You mean in terms of the year
-
on
-
year growth, Doug? Or are you talking 
about versus forecast?
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Versus the 400 basis points?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. Year
-
on
-
year grow
th really is about growing our members faster than 
we are growing our content spend. So I don't think there is any one 
particular leverage point other than a managed level of content growth. We 
continue to get more efficient across other parts of our busin
ess, but the 
content spend is the largest piece of that. So it's about managed growth.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
A question for Ted. When you look at House of Cards, I think you are getting 
a lot of focus on the fact that, you already even said befor
e, that season two 
would have a bigger impact on your overall subscriber growth and net 
additions than season one because people have become comfortable with 
the show. When you look at what happened in Q1 did that actually bear 
itself? Or is there a way to
 
actually show or tell that season two of House of 
Cards actually had a greater impact than season one?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I mean we are getting more sophisticated about how we measure it as 
well, Rich and I think that what we see is a hungry audience for s
eason two 
versus a curious audience in season one. So in season one, Netflix 
subscribers had no idea what a Netflix original series would be like. So there 
was some curiosity, but certainly not a lot of excitement going in and then 
season two, there was a 
lot of pent
-
up demand. We saw a lot of very early 
front weighted viewing for the launch, which kind of told us that America 
was ready for more and dug in right away. And as we mentioned in the 
letter, we have been actually thrilled so far with the show fro
m the early 
launch relative to how you would measure television on any show on basic 
cable or premium cable, and I only give you that information, by the way, to 
help you understand the class of viewing to think about a show like House of 
Cards.
 
Rich 
Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
And do you think are shows become more 
-
 
are shows becoming more 
expensive, prompting you to need to raise pricing to afford the shows that 
you want to create, just because the cost of the individual episode is rising 
throughout 
the industry?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, it's partially, Rich. I think what's happening is that we are committing to 
larger budget shows not that the same show is more expensive to make 
year
-
on
-
year. We are looking at kind of shows that we are competing with. 
We ar
e still only competing with kind of the top end of cable for those 
shows. So when I think about it like a sports team where the bidding gets 
quite high on a couple of key pieces of talent, but the overall salaries, they 
are kind of in check.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And Ted, do you feel like you are seeing a similar dynamic play out as you 
head towards the second season of Orange as well here, in terms of the way 
the viewer base builds?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I mean we have said before, Orange Is the New Black has
 
been our 
most
-
watched show. So we are pretty excited to see what an even bigger 
mob looks like when who is hungry for season two starting June 6.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
And Ted, when you look at HBO, they had a big hit this last quarter with 
True
 
Detective and I think it was a show that Netflix was bidding on and 
actually wanted and thought would work well for Netflix. Curious they still 
rolled it out on a week
-
by
-
week basis and seemed to build a lot of 
excitement and social media buzz around thei
r releasing strategy. Do you 
ever look at kind of what is happening at HBO and say maybe there are 
other ways of doing things in the U.S. the way you even experimented with 
some doing it overseas?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I mean we look at it all the time. I thin
k that works well for them. I 
think this works well with us or for us. I think the promise for our members 
is that we are going to stay focused on what they like and what they like is 
to watch more than one at a time and we don't know the exact magic 
numbe
r of how many at a time, but giving people the option to watch as 
much as the entire season, I think works well and fits well with our brand 
promise. And by the way, it may be that in the future, we could roll out 
shows in different release models the way 
we did with the Turbo cartoons 
and like to your point, we are in other countries with other American, U.S. 
TV shows that we premiere outside of the U.S. like we will with Breaking Bad 
spin up, Better Call Saul, as we did recently with From Dusk till Dawn a
nd 
we will with Fargo.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
A question for Ted and for David. Are you still on track when you stated 
double your investment in originals in 2014, but still keep it below the 10% 
of total content spending level?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, it had be
en in our previous and that's what is still trending.
 
David Wells
 
Yes, and this is David. I would say, Doug, that we sort of migrated away 
from the 10% number just because that number is going to grow. It is going 
to get bigger and bigger and bigger. But y
es, it is still accurate to say that 
we have doubled year
-
on
-
year, but it still, as a percent of our overall 
content spend, is less than 10%.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
I guess this is a question for Reed, although it could 
-
 
probably could be 
address
ed to a few of you. When you think about the amount of money you 
are going to be investing in content in 2015, especially with the firepower 
you are going to get from the price increase, how do you think about your 
total addressable market in the U.S.? Is 
it starting to move towards higher 
levels than you had thought before just given the amount of content you are 
actually going to be producing?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Rich, about three years ago we identified the model, that we think in the 
fullness of time we can b
e two to three times larger than domestic HBO, 
linear HBO which would be 60 to 90 million subscribers in the U.S. and that 
model anticipated that as we got to 40, we would get better, as we get to 50 
we would get better. So I would say all of those improve
ments in the model 
that we think of our built
-
in to our 60 to 90 million member projection for 
the domestic market and so we stand by that. Every year that we add 
another five or six million members, makes us feel a little bit more confident 
of getting int
o that range which is great. And then, with that we are able to 
add more content and continue to make the service better.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And just following up on that question, Reed can you comment on whether 
the recent subscriber growth performanc
e is coming were from gross adds or 
from lower churn? And in particular, can you give us some more detail on 
what has been happening to churn in the U.S. over the past year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think most of the growth, Doug, is coming from member satisfaction
. When 
members are really satisfied they tell their friends about the service and 
they retain better. So it is really driven from member side and when we 
have great shows coming and unique exclusive and things that make people 
so passionate about Netflix, 
then they are again more likely to tell their 
friends and more likely to stay. And so it's a mix of both of those things. But 
fundamentally, it's member satisfaction. Without member satisfaction, you 
can't get much growth and of course you don't have good 
retention. But with 
it, you get both aspects are very good. And that's what we have been really 
focused on. In the letter we talked about our advertising strategy evolving 
towards more emotive and brand and content and away from direct 
response and we real
ized through testing that we don't need to be running 
around saying Netflix free trial nearly as much. That's very commercial and 
reductionist. And that by focusing on the core elements of member 
satisfaction and the content that you get if you join Netfli
x we can get to a 
much bigger market share and a better connection with members and then 
when they come to our website and see that they get a free trial, they are 
doubly happy, but that's not the core reason to come to Netflix.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
If I could jus
t elaborate on it going back to Rich's earlier question about 
satisfaction. The all
-
at
-
once model, for one thing, that sure generates is a lot 
of satisfaction. So if you are stuck in Washington DC and New York in the 
middle of a snowstorm and you want to s
pend the weekend watching House 
of Cards, it's something not only that brings people a lot of joy, it's 
something you can't do anywhere else. So that's why we invest in that 
model as well.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Reed, it sort of seems like you 
are looking at HBO where they never talk 
about, hey HBO is $15. They just talk about the value that HBO brings to the 
consumer from the content standpoint. Is that fair to think about?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, I wouldn't say it's because of HBO. I think of it as
 
you know, many 
great services talk about how they are great and then the pricing is fair and 
you have to pay to get the thing, but if you want to talk about the great 
aspect of the service and bring that to the fore that's generally great 
marketing and HB
O is an example of that great marketing. But we are not 
trying to copy them specifically. We are learning and doing best practices as 
they have been doing for a while.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Reed, just another question, little bit related to the competitiv
e landscape. 
Amazon has seen some strong growth recently in terms of Prime 
subscribers, saying that they are basically north of 20 million at this point, 
and also rolling out Fire TV. How is all that impacting Netflix and what are 
your thoughts on the rece
nt Prime price increase and whether that has any 
impact to you?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Prime is a great service. I am a Prime member and most Netflix 
employees are Prime numbers and it's coming across to most people in our 
society is, it is very complementary
 
to Netflix. People look at them as 
multiple channels. You saw that Amazon included us on the Fire TV and of 
course we been before on the Kindle Fires and it's a great relationship all 
around where we have got unique content, they have got some unique 
cont
ent. They are also doing originals. There are multiple networks out 
there. It's a very much not a zero
-
sum game and we are building this 
ecosystem together that's about Internet video and the more players there 
are in Internet video, the bigger that ecosys
tem gets. In the big theme is 
Internet video is taking share away from linear video. So we are all 
participating in that transformation.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
When you look at net neutrality peering interconnection, Reed, you wrote a 
letter that 
basically made it sound like you thought that peering and 
interconnection was a direct net neutrality violation or at least violated the 
principles. FCC Chairman Wheeler said they are more cousins than they 
actually are the same thing. You had said, I thin
k two calls ago, that you 
would not need to pay distribution, meaning ISPs for the amount of content 
you were serving. You reversed that this quarter. I guess, just kind of from 
an overall standpoint, can you just address what happened this quarter with 
Co
mcast and how you think about the future of the Internet?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. The Internet is in constant evolution in terms of the relationships and 
interconnection that we see. So we did end up choosing to pay Comcast to 
improve the video quality 
that our members experience. We don't think we 
should have to, but in the short
-
term we felt like we had no choice. So we 
have got that deal in place. In addition, more lobbying for this idea that we 
think is very natural, which is interconnect as part of 
net neutrality, it's a 
stronger form of net neutrality and now we are in opposition to the Comcast, 
Time Warner merger because we are really concerned about what happens 
when the combined entity, if the merger were to go through, would have 
with over 60% o
f U.S. homes passed and eventually over 50% of U.S. 
homes subscribing to cable Internet and that's a worrisome factor. So we 
think it's more in the public interest to either not have them merge or if the 
government goes ahead with it, to at least put some 
significant merger 
agreements, settlements in there.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And Reed, just as a follow
-
up, when you say that you had no choice, I am 
assuming that is coming from a member satisfaction perspective. Did you 
see a change in relation to churn o
r just overall member satisfaction in the 
Comcast footprint and then can you also talk about since that deal was 
signed and you are obviously seeing big pickups in speeds since then, but 
are you seeing the corresponding lift in member satisfaction as well?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not that I know of. I don't think we have surveyed member satisfaction 
differentially between Comcast. I imagine it is very much true, but we had 
years of a good experience on Comcast broadband for our members and 
then it was only in the pri
or six months when it started declining rapidly. So 
it's a fairly short term thing. We are glad we have got that now fixed. I think 
it will just work out over time if we can get to no
-
fee interconnects not only 
for Netflix but for Cogent, for Level 3, for 
Akamai. We are going to have a 
bigger, stronger Internet if everyone can agree that that's a better model 
than say, retrans. It started off with a very small fee and then escalated into 
this blackout type model that has been a real problem for the industry
 
and 
for consumers. So we are trying to avoid that by seeing if we can move 
everyone to no
-
fee interconnect.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
But I assume if we had, Reed, if we had Brian Roberts sitting on this panel, 
he would basically look at what you ha
ve just said and say, I spend billions 
of dollars to dig trenches to get the Internet, meaning to get Netflix, from 
your offices all the way out to consumers all across the country. If you are 
going to take up so much of that capacity and force me to actua
lly spend 
even more money to reach that end consumer, that's not all going to be on 
me. You are going to have to pay for some of that. What's wrong with that, I 
guess, in terms of you sharing the burden and the reality is there's always 
been paying on the 
Internet whether it's been Level 3 or Cogent. It's not like 
the concept of peering and interconnection being paid peering is a new 
concept.
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, actually it is. So in the original days of the Internet, it was the opposite, 
which is the ISP pai
d Level 3 for interconnect and it's only the very large 
ISPs that now are able first to demand they are not paying and now to 
demand payment from the transits. So there's been a real shift in the last 
five years, but Brian Roberts is incredibly thoughtful.
 
I mean I would say, if 
there is anyone that you wanted to trust with controlling half of the U.S. 
internet, you might pick Brian Roberts. He is very thoughtful, very long
-
term 
about it and very reasonable. But I don't know that we want anybody to 
control 
half of the U.S. internet and that's the real basis of our objection to 
the merger.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
And Reed, how do you think about the likelihood that you would potentially 
do similar interconnect deals with other providers, with telcos, for examp
le?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we have got peering agreements and interconnect agreements with 
probably 100 ISPs around the world, including many very large ones. So 
that's an ongoing, say that was only in the case of Comcast when it got to 
such a bad state and t
hen recovered very quickly, thankfully, that it was so 
visible.

Then just a question for David, I guess tied to all of this. Could you give us 
any sense on how these deals are structured? Meaning, is there any way to 
think a
bout what the cost of interconnection is going to be to Netflix from a 
provider like Comcast? Does it account for 4K? Or when you launch 4K, do 
you have to pay Comcast substantially more, et cetera?
 
David Wells
 
Well, Rich, we don't talk about the exact spe
cifics of the deal, but as you 
might imagine, we have been thoughtful about what might be important 
down the road in the future, including those items that would be important 
for us to provide our consumers. Comcast and the interconnect fees that we 
might 
have to pay are a portion of the expenses that we borne including 
increased content as we have added more and more content. I would say its 
part of the pattern. Content continues to be our largest piece of expense on 
our P&L.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
And 
Reed just a follow
-
up there, when you think about the amount of 
bandwidth capacity that Netflix is utilizing as well as other just large Internet 
companies, is there a longer term capacity problem in the U.S., just in terms 
of bandwidth, especially as you 
push more towards 4K TVs?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Doug, you can think of it as Netflix is using this bandwidth, but I think it's 
more correct to think of it as consumers are paying for 20 megabit or a 50 
megabit package from an ISP, and then they deserve to be able 
to use that 
speeds that they have paid for [AUDIO GAP]

and the importance of IPTV boxes to your business. We went to the

David Wells
 
Sorry, I am being told that we are going to interrupt for a second. And just

Hi, Reed, we attended the Amazon Fire TV launch recently and when we 
wer
e using the device, we noticed that if you said the words Downtown 
Abbey, it immediately brought up all of the content that was available as 
part of your Amazon Prime subscription, but yet when you said something 
like House of Cards, it immediately did bri
ng up the content. However, it was 
only for Amazon's paid service. You had to actually buy each individual 
episode and when we asked why it didn't actually direct you to the Netflix 
app which is a featured app, it said because they don't have access to you
r 
API unless you want them to have access to your API. And I guess that 
brings to the question of how do you think about how you work with an IPTV 
box like the Fire TV which is also a competitor in Amazon Prime for video?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Amazon has bee
n very straightforward about treating that platform as 
an open platform and we definitely want to be in voice search and we will be 
in voice search. We are just still working on the mechanics of it. So there's 
no fundamental issue. There's just some timing
 
and scheduling things that 
came together. I wish we could have made the initial launch date, but it's 
definitely something that will come out this year.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
So you don't mind the overarching search being driven by Amazon's sear
ch 
versus your recommendation engine?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We have that capability also on different MVP docks, boxes, also on the Roku 
where there's an overall search for titles. So we recognize that. Now when 
you are in the Netflix app, you get a more custom ta
ilored search experience 
with various suggestions, but it's up to us to continue to improve that and 
Amazon has been extremely straightforward and open about allowing us to 
use that voice search and that's something we are working on.

Reed, in your letter you mentioned MVPD integrations coming in the U.S. 
this quarter. Is it fair to assume that you will continue to maintain that 
billing and customer relationship going forward? Will they look like the initial 
MVPD set
-
top box deals tha
t you have done in Europe?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Definitely, that's a way to start. It can also look like the Apple TV where 
that's billed through iTunes. I mean whether it's iTunes, PayPal or Virgin 
doing the billing, it doesn't make that much difference. So you 
will always 
have, as a consumer, multiple options and how that's integrated. As long as 
it's a separate line item on the bill, whatever the price of Netflix is in that 
territory.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
And Reed, given the peering 
interconnection deal you signed with Comcast, 
is it fair to believe that at some point this year you will actually be on the X1 
box, which I know is something that you have talked about wanting to be 
on?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, we are definitely staying in the 
state of we want to be on it, but I don't 
have anything more to announce today.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Ted, just in terms of content, we get a lot of questions about House of Cards 
season three and what's going on in Maryland in terms of production and 
Ree
d is smiling now. Can you just give us a little more color in terms of the 
status there? Is there any concern here for Netflix customers or investors 
going forward around that third season?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
No. Keep in mind, the relationship is fairly complica
ted there, where you 
have the production company who receives the benefit of a tax incentive 
from the State of Maryland to keep the show in Maryland. There have been 
ongoing negotiations between MRC who produces the show for us and the 
State of Maryland. B
ut I would anticipate that these are overcome
-
able 
issues and it's a very competitive world out there in terms of attracting 
production. The tax incentives in place for House of Cards in Maryland have 
resulted in hundreds and hundreds of jobs and not just 
for actors, but for 
carpenters and waitresses and hotel workers. The amount of hotel nights 
and meals that the production of a television series brings to a state is 
staggering. So I think this has been one of those really interesting kind of 
political vol
leyballs in Maryland, but Maryland has been really great to the 
show and we love being there and we are hoping that MRC and the state 
work that out. The investors and fans are not at risk in any way.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Ted, as a follow
-
up on c
ontent, have you started to see leverage from your 
international distribution footprint in terms of getting the rights to a series, 
meaning now that you are in X number of countries outside the U.S., is it 
becoming easier? Is that an advantage to actually 
buying series? Or is that 
still on the coming until you launch more major countries in Europe and 
Asia?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It's helpful. That's where I think we will see a lot more meaningful 
measurement of it, as we expand more aggressively, but I think even se
eing 
things like doing licensing North America together, you see it and we are 
premiering shows that premier on U.S. networks on Netflix around the 
world. Being a single buyer for multiple territories puts us in a unique class 
of buying. And we hope to rea
lize some economic advantage of that, but 
also just then being able to coordinate a massive marketing relationship with 
the studios and networks that produce those shows that we can then take 
and be a one
-
stop for them in a world that's pretty fragmented t
oday. So I 
think we could bring a lot of efficiencies as a global buyer. Just today the 
studios and networks aren't setup to be global sellers yet.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Ted, just following up on that. Do you want to move more toward owning 
original conte
nt directly, more end
-
to
-
end and the effect giving you sort of 
greater control over international rights distribution going forward? How do 
you think about that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Doug, I think we see it as what we wanted to do is we want to be able to 
make tho
se decisions for how the content is exploited and the more 
ownership you have, the more likely you can do that, but you can also do 
that through negotiations in very long
-
term license deals as well. So I don't 
have any religion around ownership versus lice
nsing as long as we get that 
suite of rights that we are looking for and you will see us going forward 
doing a mix of both because once you decide you only get new programming 
that you own, I think that you forgo a lot of great programming. I think we 
have
 
actually seen that in the kind of weakening of the programming on 
networks today that lean more to like almost 85% ownership that the quality 
of the programming suffers for it. We want to put the quality of the 
programming first and then set deals second.
 
But all along, what we want to 
do is be able to have much more control over the way the content is 
exploited on and off of Netflix.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
And Ted, are deals that you are not getting purely based on price? Meaning, 
you just don't 
have enough dollars that you can allocate to original 
programming and so you couldn't bid to win something like True Detective? 
Or are there still shows that want to be on one of the existing linear 
traditional television net outlets?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
No, I wo
uld say that a lot of the programing that we are seeing premier are 
shows that have passed through these doors and it's not that we couldn't 
afford them. It's just that relative to what we believe the audience is, the 
deal didn't make sense. So you either 
want to make a deal at the price that 
you want or one that you will be happy to see your competitor pay. So a lot 
of that is at play. But I don't think there was any, we would rather by on one 
versus the other, I think the Netflix is a number one or number
 
two spot 
destination for these shows almost across the board these days. We are very 
proud of that and happy with that.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And Ted, where do you stand with rights to recent originals like House of 
Cards and Orange in international mark
ets? Would you launch in certain 
markets, for example, France and Germany if you did not have all your 
original content there?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, sure we would, because we are going to have a lot of new original 
shows that will launch between now and then. 
And we will also have shows 
that we are premiering in France and Germany and other markets around 
Europe that we won't necessarily have in the United States. It's like we 
talked about earlier with Dusk till Dawn, the Breaking Bad spin
-
off, Better 
Call Saul
 
as examples. So there's a lot of ways that the original offering may 
be slightly different outside of the U.S. in multiple territories and some of 
those original shows as we launch in other territories around Europe and 
around the world. We will go back a
nd renegotiate and pull some of those 
rights back.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
Maybe that's a good segue to talk about international. Reed, when you look 
at international markets, a lot has been made of France and Germany being 
the next two markets tha
t Netflix targets. I guess, as you think about those 
markets, how do you think about the competitive landscape in continental 
Europe as well as the appetite for U.S. content relative to where you have 
launched previously, which are generally more English s
peaking markets?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we have seen tremendous success in the Netherlands, where we 
launched six months ago, and that, I think, encourages us about being able 
to figure out the right programming formula in each nation. We have had 
success in 
Argentina. We have had success in Mexico, in the U.K. and in the 
Nordics and now Netherlands. We are going to get into a broad set of 
markets. We are going to learn as we go. If we are very fortunate, we will 
have programmed it completely correctly from da
y one. More likely we will 
figure out some stuff's working, some stuff's not. We will adjust the formula, 
but what we have become really convinced about is around the world, 
people want the convenience of Internet on
-
demand video and that that 
really is a 
very big and broad need. So we are stepping up on the 
international expansion and we are just going to be pushing ahead market
-
by
-
market.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And keep in mind, our original shows like House of Cards and Orange Is the 
New Black have become 
enormous successes in all of those territories. In 
France, as an example, the most popular television show in France is The 
Mentalist from CBS. So I don't think that there's some unique hindrance 
because it's not a primarily English speaking territory for 
Netflix.
 
David Wells
 
Yes, Ted, this is David. I was going to make the same point in terms of 
Brazil being a very non
-
English speaking market and lots of demand for 
Western or Hollywood produced content. So Doug and Rich, I think we have 
got time for one qu
estion from each of you.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
All right, one more each. Pressure is on. In your letter Reed, when you are 
talking about the 2Q guidance or the outlook there, you basically talk about, 
you use the words even in a year with full
-
year growth
 
in terms of 
subscribers. So I guess, what gives you that confidence this year in 2014 
that you can deliver more net adds than you did in 2013?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we always hope to grow net adds both on a year
-
over
-
year basis and 
quarter
-
over
-
quarter. We 
are making good progress on that, but I don't 
think that we have specific guidance. We don't have specific guidance for the 
year. So what we are saying there is really a mathematical point, which is 
even in a year where you are up year
-
over
-
year, you can h
ave Q2 be down 
year
-
over
-
year because of the increased seasonality. So you wouldn't want 
to interpret that or misinterpret it as a backhanded way of sliding in full
-
year 
guidance. We are just sticking with our quarterly guidance model at this 
point and thi
ngs are looking good.
 
Rich Greenfield

BTIG Research
 
Reed, when you think about international expansion, one of the things that I 
think a lot of investors have emailed us about is pay TV penetration and 
obviously you are a broadband, or your service rides
 
on broadband, but a lot 
of people look at the relative pay TV penetrations in several of these 
overseas markets. Do you look at that as a key driver of where you decide 
to launch? Or is it all about broadband penetration, meaning what are the 
key things y
ou are looking at to figure out where to launch next and what 
the total addressable market is in each of these countries?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think we are going to turn out to see that the total addressable 
market over time are human beings that enjoy TV
 
shows and movies, 
because everybody is going to be on the internet. In terms of pay TV 
penetration, its relative low in the U.K., about 60% and we have been very 
successful there. So when we look at that, we just see there is an unmet 
need and whether som
ething is a relatively small broadband, or sorry small 
pay TV penetration or already large like Canada at 90%, we have been 
successful in both of those kinds of markets. Again it comes back to the 
fundamentals of people wanting to have the convenience and 
simplicity that 
the internet enables, whether that's on a smartphone, on a tablet or a smart 
TV. So that's what's making us optimistic about the long
-
term in 
international. Each quarter, we will have some real work to do to figure 
things out, but I think w
e are going to find that it's a very big opportunity. 
Go ahead.

BTIG Research
 
Are you seeing wireless become a bigger part of your story in terms of 
actual time spent watching, especially overseas?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There is a funny dichotomy
. So there is a good amount of watching on a 
mobile phone, but unusually when it's on Wi
-
Fi, because of the data caps. So 
wireless plan, cellular plans generally have data caps between two and five 
gigabytes, which you can use up pretty quickly and consume
rs are very 
aware of whether they are on Wi
-
Fi or not, and so they are using their 
mobile phones and tablets, but mostly on Wi
-
Fi rather than on cellular. Now 
if with 4G, we see more competition and lowering prices and eventually 
uncapped plans as they try
 
to compete with wired, then we could see more 
of that but right now, that's not what we are seeing in wireless. Go ahead.
 
Rich Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG Research
 
I was going to say, so if the FCC seems focused on encouraging intermodal 
competition, if 
Sprint and TMO were to actually merge, that could actually 
create more competition for Comcast and be good for Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's a long way till 4G. They first have to be competitive with Verizon and 
AT&T Wireless and that's quite a challenge tha
t they are focused on. So I am 
afraid that that, as a realistic alternative, is very speculative at this point 
that they would be able to compete for residential broadband with cable. So 
at this point, cable is the dominant technology. So with that, let me
 
thank 
you guys for being on and interviewing us. David, did you want to close?
 
David Wells
 
No, I was just giving you the heads up that we are out of time. So please 
conclude comments and go ahead.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Great. Okay. Thank you everyone. With that, 
we will sign off.

1/24/13,Netflix,"Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix Q2 2018 earnings interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO Reed Hastings; CFO David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; 
and Chief Product Officer, Greg 
Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Todd 
Juenger from Bernstein.
 
As a reminder, we will be making forward
-
looking statements and actual 
results may vary.
 
With that, over to you Todd, for your first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Todd 
Juenger
 
All right, thanks Spencer. So let's start with the obvious. So for the first time 
in I think five quarters net additions came in below your own forecast, both 
in U.S. and internationally, so whoever wants to, maybe you could help us 
walk through wh
ere was the source of that shortfall and what do you 
attribute it to? David, you want to hit that?
 
David Wells
 
Yes sure, Todd. So, in general I would say acquisition which is up year
-
on
-

t was 

And as you pointed out, after four consecutive quarters of under
-
forecasting 
the business we over
-
forecasted the business.
 
And you know, we strive for accuracy, we clearly di

but we think based on the rolling 12 months of growth that we've had 
compared to the prior rolling 12 months of growth the U.S. up slightly, 
internationally up significantly that the background and underlying 
characteristics of the bu

 

those 90 days of actuals. And in general we think that the conversion and 
growth to internet enabled entertainment is intact and people are loving it. 
People 
are adopting Netflix around the world increasingly more in our newer 
markets as well. And so I think we're still on track for a strong growth year 
this year and maybe it's going to come in a little bit differently than we 
expected and others expected.
 
Reed
 
Hastings
 
And Todd, you noticed probably that paid net adds are up compared to year 
ago and forecast to be up on year
-
over
-
year in Q3. And the fundamentals 
have never been stronger. Our viewing is setting year
-
over
-
year records 
that shows that we have comi
ng, so we are feeling very strong about the 
business.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Terrific, I'll stay on this for just a couple more follow
-
ups and then we'll 
move on to broader things. Just wonder over the course of the winter there 
were some well publicized essentially
 
global pricing increases, I wonder if 
you think that had any impact on either retention or gross adds relative to 
your forecast?
 
Reed Hastings
 

had rolling increases in various dif
ferent parts of the world we were able to 

contributing to the strength.
 
David Wells
 
And Todd, we've seen this movie of Q2 shortfall before about two years ago 
in 2016 and we never d
id find the explanation of that other than there is 
some lumpiness in the business and continued to perform after that.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Great. Let me hit on Q3 really fast or else I wouldn't be doing my job, so you 
are kind enough to always give us a forecast
 
for that and it just stood out to 
me that I think it's slightly below net added from year ago, I only had a 

 
David Wells
 
It's all total Todd. So as we pointed out, paid net adds a
re actually up year 
on year, but again we try not to focus too narrowly on like a couple of 
hundred thousand, right, around any one particular quarter. If you kind of 
look at Q2 and Q3, it's essentially kind of flat with last year and last year we 
had sort
 
of 5 million, about 5 million global net adds in Q1, 5 million Q2 and 
5 million Q3 and then 8 million in Q4.
 
Years prior we've always had very strong growth in sort of Q1 and Q4 
relative to Q2 and Q3 and we think that pattern is going to happen again 
this
 
year and so again we tend to focus on 12
-
month rolling over 12
-
month 
rolling not only in particular quarter because as we pointed out we've seen 
this movie before and we've been through these cycles of growth and we 
think the sort of background fact of pe
ople adopting internet entertainment 
including increasingly more international adoption is going to drive really 
strong year
-
on
-
year growth in international with U.S. hanging out in that 4 
million to 5 million net additions band that has been for the last 
four to five 
years.
 
Todd Juenger
 
All right, one final sort of segue on to bigger things, so has the results or any 
learnings from this quarter caused you guys to change at all your internal 
forecast longer term for either sub growth or revenue growth or fr
ee cash 
flow?
 
David Wells
 
No, you know, as Reed indicated, I'm David, I'll take it again and others can 
chime in, but the business fundamentals the on track for 10% operating 
margin we indicated we do not support exchange headwinds, they kind of 
push us to
wards the bottom end of that range, but everything else is sort of 
tracking according to our target and plan. And so again we feel pretty good 
about it.
 
I mean obviously when you have sort of a million net adds we are going to 
manage within the band of mar
keting spend and other things to protect that 
operating margin growth in the short
-
term, but long
-
term nothing has really 
changed.
 
Todd Juenger
 

the other elephants that was 
already in the room, and just checking a bit on 
the competitive landscape, obviously a lot going on between Disney and 
Comcast and Fox and Sky. So I need to check in and hear what you are 
thinking in terms of what impact on Netflix. However, that result tu
rns out 
and is there any particular results better or worse for your own competitive 
fortunes?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, there's a lot of new and strengthening competition with Disney entering 
the market, HBO getting additional funding, the different French 
broad
casters coming together, so that's all normal and expected. So it is 
what it is, we're not going to be able to change it and then our focus is on 
doing the best content we've ever done, having the best user interface, the 
best recommendations, the best mar
keting, all of the things that we've been 
doing for many years in the past and we'll keep doing for many years in the 
future.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And the other thing I would add to that Todd is, the market for 
entertainment is so big that there can be multiple fi
rms that are successful, 
so you've heard us talk in the past about how we've been able to grow 
dramatically in the U.S. in HBO and other networks have also similarly been 
able to growth at the same time, so it's a very large market.
 
Greg Peters
 
And in our 
programming we've always been focused on keeping people 
entertained and satisfied on an absolute basis, not relative to any consumer. 
So we're just trying to 
--
 
or any competitor, so really by keeping an eye on 
our members and our consumers we're better se
rved than hyper focusing on 
competition.
 
Todd Juenger
 
So one of the most frequent sort of investor questions related to this topic is 
access to content, licensed content, particularly from Disney and Fox. Let me 
start with this very specific one, there is 
a wide, wide, variance in degree of 
opinion on how much content on Netflix comes from off network licensing of 
Disney and Fox content, care to narrow that down for investors and give us 
some sense of just both from a availability perspective and from a dif
ferent 
viewership perspective how much is there?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

that it's been a number that's been on the decline for several years. You 
should think about it the way we looked at t
his long
-
term is that our 
competitors will want that content on their own services. That was a bet we 
made a long time ago when we go into original programming and every year 
since that we've been doing less and less off net business with Disney and 
Fox. A
nd our bet is long term, that they'll want all their content on their 
service. In the short to medium term, we're still licensing content off net 
from them and they're also producing original content for us like Nurse 
Ratched from Fox or the Marvel series 
from Disney.
 
Todd Juenger
 
I know you've answered this question Ted, I think the last two or three 
quarters consecutively, but I've got to ask again, any reason to expect those 
types of 
--
 
sort of original shows that you get from Disney and Fox to 
change gi
ven the new information that from what they are doing?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
No, those shows are for us to cancel and we're super happy with the 
performance of them so far, so and the Nurse Ratched and some other Fox 
original titles are still upcoming.
 
Todd Juenger
 
So speaking of your own originals, I want to touch on a couple of sort of 
relatively newer areas of focus for you and just check and see how it's going, 
so one is unscripted, right and it seems, and you talked about this last 
quarter, it's been a sort of 
recent elevated higher priority for you guys, how 
is that going, what's your experience been, is it being enjoyed by your 
members as much as you thought?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, and we're super excited about the variety of the shows and how they 
are landing with
 
consumers. Similarly we thought a long time ago that the 
unscripted networks are also going to want to keep their own content for 
their own services and we started investing our own unscripted 
programming and have had some really great out
-
of
-
the
-
box hits
 
with Nailed 
It and Fastest Car and Queer Eye that are doing great with our watchers 
relative to building an audience and also you saw Queer Eye did quite well at 
the Emmys, the nominations announced last week. So we're really excited 
with the progress and
 
the speed to market and we've been able to do our 
unscripted shows at really high
-
quality.
 
Todd Juenger
 
On the original movie side, another not quite
-
so
-
new area of focus, but still 
more recent, what is your assessment of your progress versus where you'd 
hope to be on that front?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
We're moving as quick as we can with and still delivering what have been 
movies that people want to watch. So we saw on the letter, we talked a little 
bit about the results of our romantic comedy, Kissing Booth and th
ere was 
much made in the press this summer about our romantic comedies have all 
been pretty successful, Set It Up just after Kissing Booth.
 
And so these are movies that are not really being made in the market much 
and we're doing and moving into those, but
 
we're also doing a lot of the big 
event films with A list directors and these are long lead production times and 
we're really excited with the way they've been delivering in terms of 
viewership and we think that we'll see similar trends that we saw in 
tel
evision, but it will take another year or so as we get into it.
 
Todd Juenger
 
And one final one I wanted to check in on which will allow us to move 
forward here with what I'll call non
-
English language for lack of a better 
word. It seems like you're making 
more stuff in other places of the world, it 
seems like that's having success all around the globe. I wonder if you could 
confirm that and talk about your own assessment of the returns you're 
getting on those sorts of program investments?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, similarly fast ramp up an early success. So we've been producing shows 
that are incredibly relevant in their home territories and the nice windfall is 
they get viewed all over the world. So we saw that recently with Reign and 
Dark. We certainly, in In
dia we saw great success recently with Sacred 
Games, that really people 
-
 
really excite the market and these are places 
where our global business play well too.
 
So it's really I think accelerating the brand perception of Netflix as not just 
an out
-
of
-
towne
r, but someone who is producing content you care about in 
every part of the world. Upcoming this year we have new seasons of Chicas 
Del Cable from Spain, Ingobernable from Mexico, we have initial from Spain 
called Elite coming out in Q3, Ghoul in India com
ing out in August and these 
are shows that are produced at a level that are really high that consumers 
get really excited about and it helps them get really excited about Netflix if 
they are not quite sure who we are yet.
 
Todd Juenger
 
All right, so now tha
t we've moved on outside of U.S. I think we should 
-
 
Western World, can I check in just a little bit, specifically on Asia and carve 
out India for a second, so I'm going to come to India specifically later, but 
just 

 
so Asia is a huge reason generally I t
hink we've talked in the past how 
the content tastes there are a little different, the business model you are 
hoping to find the exact right formula. How is your growth going in Asia, 
generally what is driving it, is it at a similar pace at the same stage 
other 
markets in the world, any deeper info you can give us on that part of the 
world anybody?
 
David Wells
 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure, you know I'd say Todd, we're starting to turn the corner in many other 
nations where our viewing is 
climbing up as we're continuing to improve the 
programming and when we get high viewing in every other market that has 
brought in a fast growth. And so we've see that, it's varied country
-
by
-
country, I'll include India in the description and say we are rea
lly pleased 
with our progress and tracking we're making since we launched two and a 
half years ago. And we just have a lot of work and a lot of opportunity 
ahead.
 
David Wells
 
And Todd, the only annotation I would say is, look it's still early. We 
launched 
with a very sort of a skim model approach and we've out 
augmented that, right. We're adding payment methods, we're adding more 
content. We are working on all the playbooks that has been successful for us 
in other markets of the world and you see that throu
gh increased investment 
and so that sort of last wave of expansion for Netflix is still relatively early 
and that's affecting our growth numbers, it's affecting our levels of 
investment as well where other marketers are sort of growing in profit, that 
actu
ally those markets collectively are growing in loss and we have more 
growth in the profitable markets than we do in the loss markets and that's 
what's growing the overall margin.
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes, and we've been very thrilled with our original production of
 
anime that's 
being viewed quite and regionally throughout Asia and of course in Japan, 
our scripted series and our unscripted series like Busted! from Korea or 
Terrace House from Japan are viewed throughout the region which are 
building brands bigger and 
bigger.
 
Todd Juenger
 
So thank you for sort of carving out India separately only because 
-
 
for a 
number reasons right? As such a place with huge potential, I think numerous 
executives have been quoted into various places recently talking about the 
potential
 
there. You've got some new original shows there. So specifically in 
India, if you could dive a little deeper into where you are on the growth 
curve there. How you see the path to success and how big that could be for 
you in the next many years?
 
Greg Peter
s
 

on the internet. And there is so much TV viewing at Linear TV that could be 
internet viewing. And the advantages are tremendous in India for internet 

 

of the other platforms.
 
So Netflix is having great success getting established, getting a reputation 
going and with this triplet of Lust Stories, Sacred Games and Ghoul, we're 
really getting some nice momentu
m in our India growth. Now it still 

 


languages and many other aspects to able to cover 

 
be a broad Indian 


been doing.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Greg, there seems like there is some maybe seemingly obviously particulars 
about the Indian market from a product perspective that might be peculiar. 
How much of that is, just from the infrastructure that exists and the 
afford

your sleeve to try and make Netflix easy for everybody in India to enjoy it?
 
Greg Peters
 

payments and how sign
-
up
 
has to happen. We just rolled out some 
improvements on the sign
-
up flow on TVs. So we are making that easier for 
non
-
members to become members in that dimension. But actually a lot of 
the work that we do that helps our members in India is actually applica
ble in 

the viewing process higher quality, start faster that obviously is great for our 

 
Downloads is another great exam
ple where now we've rolled out downloads 


smart download so we can make that process even more fun a
nd easy by 
having episodes you watched, automatically delete and get replaced by new 
episodes whenever you come back on our Wi
-

both India specific and just globally relevant.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Yes, I know you talked about payments a

question that comes up a lot with me with investors is just a thought about 
the affordability of the products relative to relative incomes, that comes up a 
lot in India. I'm going to broaden the question to just various pl
aces in the 
emerging world. How much room do you guys feel you have there in India 
and other places, are you 

 
do you sense you're reaching a limit in any 
sense in terms of the utility of the product compared to alternatives and 

hat would affect retail ARPUs anytime over the 
near horizon?
 
Greg Peters
 

market given the pricing structures we have right now, we've got a lot of 
room to grow in a reasonably affluent
 
part of the society in India and other 
markets around the world. So much more runway, but having said that 

for our members around the world and trying to find what features, wha
t 
tiers we can add to make that 

 
a both a revenue positive but also a 
consumer friendly and consumer fair kind of approach.
 
David Wells
 

little bit as homogenous, but breaking t
his apart, Reed has mentioned it, 
Greg has mentioned it. We may have an issue where there's three or four 
different sort of growth patterns within India in terms of different 
demographics, different segment and groups as we address one segment 
and then we 
start addressing another and so forth and so forth. And each 

of that first segment. So yes, expect more from us in terms of getting into 
segments two, three, and four.
 
Greg Peters
 

Our Indian consumer is finding a lot to watch on Netflix and having a great 
time doing it and if there are that price point becomes more of a value 
proposition than
 
a premium proposition.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Yes, just picking up on that, once statistic that you guys sometimes mention 

of engagement as one good perhaps indicator of value received by your 
members. Any comments on where 
engagement I guess defined as hours 
streamed, hours streams per member, so this quarter, is it still growing in 
line with content growth any thoughts?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
It is indeed still growing Todd on a year
-
over
-
year basis our viewing and 
actually mostly me



 
Todd Juenger
 
Got it, one more on pricing, just because I know 

know that, but one of your tests got picked up in the press we actually 
stumbled across it, is this idea of an ultra plan seems to be a test for HDR 

on
 
the theory behind that and the marketplace acceptancy you think might 
exist for that type of a plan?
 
Greg Peters
 
I'd say more generally rather than speaking specifically to end results 

ds of 
the spectrum here and try and figure out ways to add more value for those 

accessibility how we can create a way to access Netflix for a broader group 
of people. But a test that

point.
 
Todd Juenger
 

seems is with these partner deals and maybe there is a better internal word 
for them and they were menti
oned again in the shareholder letter, I'd love 
to check in on a couple of things on that. So first of all is anybody willing to 
tell us roughly how important these are to your net add growth to your 
overall subscriber base. Any sense of proportionality the
re other than what 
you said in the letter which is basically a supplemental channel, but the 
majority is still direct?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think I had to reiterate that the vast majority of our acquisitions still comes 
by consumer signing up directly with us. 
You were fairly new when it comes 


excited about is actually allows us to sort of more efficiently addre
ss 
different consumer segments.
 

in by doing a deal like with Comcast allows us to put the application on the 
setup box where consumers that might be less early adopters or more lat
e 
adopters are already watching traditional television by being included in a 
bundle we get to remove a separate purchase decision. We get to eliminate 
the sign
-
up flow which just makes it super simple and easy for consumers to 
sign
-
up via that mechanism.
 
David Wells
 
And Todd just to be consistent with what we said in prior quarters it is a 
growing element of our acquisition right. As Greg said, as we penetrate into 
demographics in established markets that may not be on the early part of 
that as of adoption
 
and also our newer emerging markets where 
partnerships may allow us to do things like partner billing and tap into 

ourselves.
 
Todd Juenger
 

position to share from the partners 
themselves in terms of how these programs are working for them? Not a 
single 
--
 
T
-
Mobile comes to mind just because they have been added in the 
States the longest, but any place in the world you characterized their 
feedb
ack to you?
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes I think, it is something that's very important to us because obviously we 
want a sustainable model around this where it's adding 

 

partners, perceived as valuable by them n supporting their business so that 
they want to continue to invest in it and expand it. And again market
-
by
-
market its different, but it's either a differentiation strategy where our 
partner is seeking to position themselves slightly differently, but oftentimes 
it just actually a way of the
m communicating to the consumer the value that 
they are investing in their network or the quality of service and like that and 
having Netflix, an amazing content that we have and having a really high 
quality experience with that is a great way of just tell
ing that story to their 
customers and their customers to be.
 
Todd Juenger
 


system right?
 
Greg Peters
 
Especiall

video quality and audio quality all those things that you unlock by having a 
great network and a great service.
 
David Wells
 

tners for 

our different partners. So as Greg said we want to be sustainable and 
because we have had these for many years, I think you can extrapolate from 
that that they are very succ
essful for both parties.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
And Todd it's not a radical thing, NVPDs bundling another network, that's 
pretty [well tried] territory on their side.
 
Todd Juenger
 
One of the things that these partnerships gives to you is also some 
marketing 
investment which is done on your behalf by them. Coming into 
the year, one of the themes that seems to that I interpreted from you guys 
was a little bit relative increase in the emphasis of your own marketing 
investment behind your content and your service
, just checking and had so 
and I guess we've see that in financials too. So just how is that going? Are 
you seeing the returns that you hoped for? And any specifics? Can you may 
be help give us some examples of specific types of marketing programs and 
how 
you measure your investment of that where you're spending these 
incremental dollars?

title brands and seeing how do we help title brands really maximize their 
pote
ntial within the overall system and we're doing lots of tests trying 

ways to build demand for a title. So there's tremendous amounts of learning 
going on there and then we're also
 
doing acquisition marketing and learning 
on that side. David, did you want to add to that?
 
David Wells
 
No, I think that's great. Just to remind Todd it's been a while we've been out 
of the sort of, we spend this much on marketing, we grew this much direct
ly 
in a quarter. We 
-
 
only a fraction of our spend is oriented around direct 
acquisition. What Reed is saying is like the majority of the marketing spend 
call it 80%, 85% is oriented around building title brands and we've got good 
evidence that we can do t
hat. We're just parsing through what the most 
efficient mechanism is to market those titles and also where the right 
amount of spend is as well as we grow our content library.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And what we see a lot is that the channels themselves vary by the 
top 
-
 
around the content itself too, so learning more about how to get more and 
more refined about which channel is for which content, get the best results 
are the things that we're learning right now.
 
Todd Juenger
 
And Ted, were you pleased with the Emmy n
omination campaigns?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I was thrilled. So we took the record obviously it was the most, but the thing 
I was most proud of is we had 40 different shows nominated, to kind of give 
you an idea of the kind of different variety of things that we're d
oing, 
scripted, unscripted, comedy, drama, talk shows, everything across the 
board, everyone was represented, it was 40 shows we were the very happy 
people last week and millions of fans around the world too.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Well, here comes the world's most 
inelegant segue, but being respectful to 
your shareholders, the single most popular question I got in prep for this, so 
I'm going to share it with you out of duty to that. I'm sorry was it revolving 
net neutrality and so I guess we have a new administratio
n relatively here, 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
Around the world the net neutrality has won as a consumer expectation and 
some countries have net neutrality laws, other countries don't. But broadly 
around the world consumers h
ave the expectation and ISPs are delivering it. 
So I would say the net neutrality advocates have won the day in terms of 
those expectations. So we don't see any changes of that in the U.S. or other 
countries. So it's quite a positive outcome for changing c
ultural expectations 
in a positive way.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Okay, flipping back in elegant way to my more core line of questioning and 
speaking of big investments Ted, I didn't give you a chance yet to talk 
--
 
you've got some big new partners in terms for your pr
oducers on overall 
deals, it caught the attention of investors obviously, your Ryan Murphys and 
your Shonda Rhimes and your Jenji Kohan not to leave out anybody. Can 
you help us think through are there more of those to come? A as one 
question and more deal
s like that and more people like that? And sort of 
secondly related what's the timeline, when 
-
 
has development started from 
any of these resources and how long before we see the output of their work 
on 
--
 
starts to show up on Netflix?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
That's 
a great question and they are 
-
 
you should think about it's a pretty 
rare creator who has an ownable sensibility who produces a lot of content 
prolific and successful. People like Shonda and Ryan and Jenji and Jason, 
they have a brand and they care about t
he brand and they want to create on 
that brand, they want to be 
-
 
and they want to create a lot. So we could give 
them an infrastructure to do that at Netflix because we have a great history 
of finding 
--
 
connecting an audience for all those different show
s.
 

doing so far and we're looking and we will probably do more, but it is a 
pretty rare breed of creator. And then we just physically moved Shonda into 
her new home here at Netfl
ix and we're thrilled. She has a couple of shows 
percolating now that we can't announce yet, but we're really thrilled with the 
direction she's going. Ryan's finishing up his work at Fox and then he will be 
full steam ahead. Remember his last two shows at 
Fox are going to be our 

the Ryan Murphy business in a big way. And then Jenji going from Weeds to 
Orange Is The New Black, and to GLOW was exactly I'm talking about being 
prolific 

 
Todd Juenger
 
All right. Moving David to your very specific world and then a popular 
question I received. So and you answer this every quarter. Just regarding 
your continued use of debt to finance your current free 
cash flow deficits 
especially in an era of rising rate or current environment of rising rates, just 
need to check in and make sure we understand your logic and your 
continued ability or plan to finance the company and the future deficits for 
next [year]?
 
D
avid Wells
 
We continue to see debt as the most optimal choice, the most cost effective 
use of capital or sorry source of capital for the company. Obviously we'd love 
to get to that point where we're organically and self
-
funding content and we 
do see a poin
t where we can't get there, but until we do, we see debt as the 
right choice in terms of cost to capital.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Another popular question, I am getting through as many as I can before 
Spencer tells me time is up, so here is another one and probably f
or either 
Ted or Reed, you guys get this a lot. Investors still want to know your desire 
or appetite for sports type of content rights, for news oriented type of 
content rights or for other expansions of your platform, you either get into 
audio or gaming o
r selling other people's products any of those sorts of new 
genres or potential expansion theories where you are on those?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
No change in our long
-
term views that have been as you referred to 
expressed over and over, we have such an 
opportunity in movies and TV 
shows of many types around the world that it's consuming every bit of 
energy and excitement that we have.
 
Todd Juenger
 
Got it. Let me if I can move to what I think might be sort of the seminal 
question, two questions, for long
-
term Netflix shareholders which is really 
you've got about 130 million global members now. How long is it going to 
take you to get the next 130 million and if you double your members, are 
you going to need to double your spend in content and marketing to a
ttract 
and retain them?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

we go. We've been very attentive to all the key factors which is we want to 
invest enough on content to make our subscribers incredibly hap
py because 
that's how we grow. So you know it's a really smart investment for us on the 
content side. We want to invest in product and marketing to make the whole 
service better, to make the shows be more aware.
 
We also want to steadily increase operating 
margin over the next several 
years, and so as an example, we've got some adjustments to make because 
of foreign exchange rates and we know we'll make those adjustments and 
we'll grow into that. So I think of ourselves continuing every year to figure 
out ho
w we make certain adjustments to keep the operating margins 
growing, the subscriber base and revenue growing, and that's been a basic 
way we've been operating over the last several years.
 
So it was more of the same, and in terms of the dartboard as you kno
w 
several years out on when we double, the answer is not soon enough. We're 
always pushing hard to figure out how can we get even more growth, but 
we're awfully pleased with what we've got to.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Todd, I think we have time for one more question.
 
Todd Juenger
 
All right. So I guess I'll use that just to expound on the big dartboard I just 
asked and maybe start with Greg and then anyone else who wants to come 
in. When you think about the product itself which is the underpinning of the 
belief you have
 
in the growth, what's on your short
-
term and long
-
term list 
of things that you think your members most desire would move the needle 
most from a product perspective, from a content perspective, from a overall 
pricing and value perspective and therefore dri
ves your agenda I guess each 
of you over the rest of this year and into the coming decade?
 
Greg Peters
 


ri
ght now. We talked about sort of improvements in the mobile UI and smart 


 

eve
n testing and researching, how do we make that TV experience faster, 

actually going to roll some improvements out to that experience and make 
that better starting tomorrow. So start


make that experience even greater for finding the stories that you love.
 
David Wells
 

leasure of 

seasons coming up the second half of this year of Orange Is The New Black, 
Ozark, Iron Fist, Daredevil, Narcos, the finale of House of Cards, the 
followup series for Making a M
urderer and we have some brand new IP 
coming up with new shows like Insatiable, Maniac with Emma Stone and 
Jonah Hill, Disenchantment from Matt Groening, the creator of the Simpsons 
doing animated comedy for us, a new show from Greg Berlanti's company, 
the
 
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina a spinoff of Riverdale that's been hugely 
popular for us.
 
And that all ramps up to bigger and better feature films too for our fans 
around the world starting with the Christmas chronicles from Chris Columbus 
later this year 
and Bird Box from Sandra Bullock with the great Susanne Bier 
directing. That will lead us into next year we have movies from Martin 
Scorsese and Alfonso Cuarón and all these fantastic directors and the 
opportunities are just limitless.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And the
n for me and Reed have the honor of going there and wrapping this 
up, but I would say we've got 130 million members and the prospect of 
adding, wherever that is 104 million the next 130 million, all of those folks 
enjoy connectedness and as we grow to enjo
y more stories that are sourced 
from wherever in the world I think the ability for all those folks are a great 
portion of those folks to enjoy and see a story and discuss that story, in the 
same moment is great and Netflix being an enabler of that will con
tinue to 
do that and I look forward to the 8 billion of content growing from here. We 
think we can grow operating margin, but we're also going to grow content 
spend which will enable more of that content.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And Todd for me it's about connecting
 
the world and sharing the stories all 
around the world. I think we've got so much more we can do with that as we 
learn the various arts of dubbing and style and I think that will make a really 
profound contribution to the world in addition to just enterta
ining everyone 
which is very joyful to work on.
 
With that, let me thank everyone for participating in the call and look 
forward to spending time with you guys investors over the quarter. Thank 
you very much.

10/24/12,Netflix,"Welcome to the Netflix Q2 2014 Earnings Interview. I am David Wells, CFO. 
I am joined today on the Company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted 
Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer. Interviewing us today will once again be 
Doug Anmuth from 
JPMorgan and joining us today for the first time will be 
Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson who receives the baton from Rich 
Greenfield.
 
We will be making forward
-
looking statements today. Actual results may 
vary.
 
Our first question comes from Doug. S

Great, thanks, David. Welcome, everybody, and thank you to Netflix for 
having Michael and me host today's conference call. So our first question, 
just on 
international strength, Reed, if you could talk about what drove the 
international strength in subscribers in Q2? You called out a couple things in 
particular, in terms of the Virgin deal, in terms of a set top box integration, 
and then also smart TV viewi
ng in Latin America, so was hoping you could 
add a little bit more color on those, as well.
 
Reed Hastings
 

-
demand viewing 


s been really quite consistent. So there are some accelerators that we 
talked about with the Smart TV. But there is probably no better symbol of 
how strong is on
-
demand phenomena that to tell you that during the World 
Cup we were concerned that we would se
e a drop off around the world, 

drop off in net adds and growth and what was incredible is just how straight 
our line of net addictions were in Brazil during the World Cup. And that


demand for control and for the consumer be able to click and watch what 

expansion just because we really se
e that this is an enormous moment in 
history as on
-
demand Internet services are coming to the floor around the 
world.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
David, can I ask you one on incremental margins. If we look at your margins 
in the first half of the 


margins can continue growing at the 400 basis point range that you saw and 
why did you identify different levels the 100, 200 and 400
 
basis point level 
of improvement. What control those potential margin levels?
 
David Wells
 

that margins will stop growing or will shift to 200. What we said is when we 
get to 30%
 
we want to give ourselves a little bit of leeway to reevaluate. 

competitive set what we want to spend on content, how we want to grow 
that, how our average subscription price is grow
ing with the recent price 

will balance out. And we want to give ourselves a leeway to back
-
off a little 

-
off to make in terms of spinning mo
re on 

create a little bit of room for ourselves especially with all of these unknowns 
as we get closer to next year.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay, thanks. And Reed, in the letter, you
 
talked about the price changes 
having a minimal impact on growth overall, but can you just provide a little 
bit more color? Do you think, in terms of the nuances, did it impact churn, or 
help reduce churn in any way during the quarter? And what's your vie
w on 
the way the price change could impact going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 


becomes a little bit harder because 
of the roughly $1 higher prices, or in 



y improving 
the content and the growth in the word of mouth and that when we make a 
small change in price and handle it appropriately it really makes no 

outcome.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
Okay. David, I wondered if looking your guidance for 3Q, would you have 

new market launches and as we think about the growth rate and cost in the 
third quarter a
s sustainable into the fourth quarter internationally.
 
David Wells
 
So in terms of our international guide I think you can see that most of that is 
our new markets. So yes we would be pretty close to breakeven if not a 
breakeven for Q3 in our existing marke
ts. And then the second part of your 
question was again, could you repeat that?
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 

guiding to. Should we assume that continues to the fourth quar
ter, it seems 

 
David Wells
 

saying are in the back half of the third quarter, so they are not a full quarter 
of content spending. L
et me get that full quarter of content spending for the 
first time in Q4. So our typical pattern has been to grow content spend from 
the launch quarter. Marketing, it balloons a little bit in that first quarter of 
growth as we launch a brand new brand in t
hose markets. Then it tends to 
settle down into a run rate and that should give you some trending on our 
international costs.
 
Doug Anmuth
 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Great, and Ted, just perhaps one more question just related to Q2, and then 
we'll move on. Can you comment 
on Orange Is the New Black? You talked 
about in the letter how it became the most watched show in every country 
during Q2. Are there any other updates that you can provide around usage 
metrics, and then maybe talk about what you saw in Orange in Q2 perhaps
 
versus the second season of House of Cards a quarter earlier?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well I think it continued the positive that we saw from House Of Cards, 
meaning that the excitement from the second season is amplified from like 

 
know a lot about yet or in the case of 
House of Cards before we launched that no one even knew what a Netflix 
original series was going to be like. So here you have had a large pool of 
people around the world anxious for that second season. It starred in 
the 
Social Media Buzz that was really phenomenal for that launch. It gives us a 
lot of confidence for the outline seasons, the original series as well.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
I have one for Ted and for Reed together. So last week FOX 
announced 
interest in acquiring Time Warner, two companies you know a lot about. If a 
merger were to occur, I think that would affect your negotiating leverage to 
get acquired and original programming. And this is a deal that you would 
block, Reed given th
e scale of the TV and film output from both companies.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

today, particularly in the area of original production for television and film. 

 
in terms of coming together. 

there is a lot more to do with cable negotiations in sports than consolidating 
power reproduction. This is very difficult to corner the market on cre
ativity 

days.
 
David Wells
 


comes, but
 

the less vulnerable we are to aggregation in the big content suppliers.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
And just following up there in terms of content and on studio related. Do you 
feel
 
like you have the need to own your own studio production capabilities to 
protect yourself from some of the risks potentially associated with fewer 
production houses to buy from? Would you create your own studio from 
scratch perhaps would have made sense t
o the acquisitive in this area?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I think a lot of it is tactical in terms of how you go about the production cost. 

make those decisions as you go. There are probably som
e advantages, the 

production as we go forward. But think about it as the difference between 
renting sound stage time or owning the stage itself, it really depends on the 
volume of prod

 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
Reed can I shift you to the net new debate which I know you shared a lot 

U.S.? And should the FCC regulate the
 
broadband industry as entitled to 
service. So I want to know if you could effect change of regulatory view, how 
would you do it.
 
David Wells
 
Well I think the most practical thing would be for the FCC to make it a 
merger condition policy of strong net new 
trial including no fee interconnect, 


be much chance that the Congress will pass a new law and so then y

got some imperfect instruments in title 2 and section 706. So the 
fundamentals though is really for the FCC has the power in merger 
conditions and clearly there are going to be a lot of mergers to be able to 
institute our strong net trial. So we thin

approach.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
And just following up there Reed, last week in your comment letter to the 
FCC. You said that the Internet has had a cross roads and there is a risk of 
going down the path toward cab
le TV. Can you talk about what you mean 
there and a little bit more detail then and why you think the other road is 
better for the industry.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure in cable industry there has been constant conflict between the 
networks and the cable distributo
rs leading to black outs and brown outs 
trying to figure out pricing. And we would hate to see ISPs brownout or 
blackout certain Internet sites in while they tried to extract payments. That 
just ruins the consumer experience this idea that when you sign up
 
the 

works for everybody, that allow there to be great investment and super high 
speed broadband but also a stable understood interconnect structure that 
then makes it able so tha
t consumers can get all the services they want and 
those doing content services like ourselves and Hulu and others can innovate 

interconnect.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
Ree
d, its Michael. Following up on that is the media analyst here. I would 
say if you look at the power retrans is the content owner that has the power 

making more investments in original c
ontent and exclusive content you are 

think you only have the power to force the pipes into putting the line 
wherever you want because you are the content to what I am subscribing 
to
?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. There is a lot of ways to think about and we do get asked in the cable 
business so for example HBO is our peer in the cable business they actually 
charge the distributor rather than pay the distributor. And so the question 
comes up, s
hould we over time be charging ISVs for the privilege of carrying 

I think the Internet really has this different much more open architecture 
than classic cable where we need in 
the middle we bring the bits to where 

open structure and I think then you get more competitors for Netflix frankly. 
But what you get is this open vibrant system. The Internet has b
een so 

to see carry forward. And I am optimistic about it frankly.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
And Reed, actually for David let me switch gears a little bit, but sticking with 
net neut
rality. If the condition in the case arises where we don't have strong 
net neutrality going forward, how do investors get assurances that the 
business is protected, in terms of cost, perhaps interconnection costs over 
time? And really thinking about it bot
h on a short
-
term basis, and then over 
the long term.
 
David Wells
 
On a short term basis I think there is great assurances in the sense that 

achieve our margin targets. And when ou
r guidance implies these costs are 

go from here in terms of years. I think for Netflix content is our largest cost. 

t margin at that 
point and in terms of how much margin goes to a delivery cost versus other 
cost in our business, we would rather spend it on content.

Reed just to be our last unless my after net neutrality, you referen
ced the 
Virgin relationship in the UK as being helpful. Can you give us any more 
specifics on the rates of growth you get when you become closer to the 
distributor or the MSO? So anything you could talk about maybe growth 
rates in UK pre and post the Virgi
n relationship.

David, a question just around free cash flow. As you're ramping
 
up originals 
here fairly aggressively, and you obviously mention a number of titles that 
are in production, and as that ramps up into 2015, can you just help us 
understand how we should think about the impact in terms of working 
capital around originals, 
and how we should think about that future 
trajectory of free cash flow versus EPS going forward? Thanks.
 
David Wells
 

that are pressuring cash use, our content expansion predominan
tly our 


of at flat to slightly up in terms of free cash flow if we expand more 
aggressively international
ly obviously that will pressure a little bit. And as we 
continue to expand original content and produced content, that will expand. 
So investors should expect to see a little bit of dip in Q4 and Q1, and it will 
be tied to that expansion of content. And in
 
the future it really depends on 
how fast we expand internationally.
 
Michael Nathanson

MoffettNathanson
 
Ted, following on that answer how does the content offerings defer 
domestically and internationally, how is the local language factor play in due 
to s
ource more locally than we probably would expecting France and 
Germany versus Canada and the UK, so any update on your strategies about 
sourcing content internationally.
 
Ted Sarandos
 

 
all 
of the international territories and France and Germany, appear to be that 

rest of the international product, mostly Hollywood product that people want 
to see around world.
 
So we 
do have a heavy focus on accessing the local content that matters, 
and establishing local relationships with local producers. In every market we 
imagine when we get out to some more exotic parts of the world that that 
may skew a little more local but today
 
it has been well within that 20% local 
range.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
So a question on international expansion, perhaps for Reed. So if we think 
about the six markets that are coming here over the next few months, it 
feels like there are some specific nuan
ces to some of them, perhaps 
Germany, which is more of a debit card than a credit card market for 
example, France, which has some protections around its own local content. 
Can you talk about some of those nuances, and how they are likely to 
impact your bus
iness?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well I think Doug in every market around the world there are new answers. 
Just to give you an example in Brazil there is a tremendous payment 
complexity plus the leadership of TV Global. In Canada, there is the CRTC; in 
the UK the BBC 
is quite unique in its role in society. So think of us as 
adapting to the local conditions in each case. As you point out in Germany 

going to see this as we continue to expand beyo
nd France and Germany and 
other countries that their unique conditions in every market. And our 
challenge and excitement around company is becoming a great global 
company where we really understand the new each of these markets and do 
a great job for consu
mers around the world. So there are some challenges 

pick up the pieces. Like with payments in the beginning of Lat
-
Am three 
years ago.
 

 
to figure out the issues once 

should get in the market, we should figure things out and then figure out 
those issues again around payments or other things in Germany and France.
 
Davi
d Wells
 
Following on the answer to France for Reed. There is a government policy in 

a certain number first local productions and also pay taxes to authority. So 
how did you get a
round that issue, where in France is very protectionist 
about the content that could be shown in?
 
Reed Hastings
 

society and French contact. And we want to give an avenue for French
 
content to get out around world. There is some amazing French story tellers 

do some investments in France with production that we can do, we could 
joke about it the House of Cards Ho



licensing again fresh content.
 

ing to do is connecting the world as some of the 

motivating for Ted for me for all the people at Netflix. And so we definitely 
got to work with French society and with the assumptions 
and beliefs that 
they have and we want to be loved in France by French consumers because 
we understand French content because we give it a bigger home and 

historically have been u
nder distributed. Ted do you want to add to that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes I would just say for all of that protectionism and all of the cultural favors 
that the Mentalist is the most popular television show in France. So the taste 

get down to the consumer. But I am really 
excited to have France look at us as somebody who brings opportunity to 
the market not there to harm the market in anyway. And that we will 
employ French production employees and create great content in France but 
as Reed said for around the world. And we currently even have Gaumont is a 
French company that produces Hemlock Grove 1 now and is about to go into 
production with Narcos. A lot of our animation projects are co
-
productions 
with French production companies.
 

really excited about it.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Ted, just following up there, can you give us an update on certain content 
that you have as originals in the US and other parts of the world, but that 
you don't curren
tly own on a first run basis in Germany and France? I 
believe such as House of Cards and your thoughts just on how material that 
is to the service?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

necessarily detri
mental, we love to have House of Cards in the first window 


territories and all of our going forward series will
 

back filling by having some other first run content like from From Dusk Till 
Dawn and other series that will premier in France and Germany for the first 
time on Netflix as well.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
Ted do you 
have to change the way you source content? Would it be more 
efficient for the company to buy media going forward? So do you think about 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
The more we expend the more that you reach 
those tipping points of the 
economics makes sense to buy out the rest of the world for different 
projects. When we first got in remember we were taking a pretty big bet on 

some o
f those other territories on the table and as we have gotten more and 
more international and more and more original, we are picking up those 
territories today.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
David, a question just about the overall addressable market international
ly, 
and I think you go into a little bit of detail in the letter, but you mentioned 
700 million broadband households, I believe, globally. We know the 90 
million or so in the US, and adding 
--
 
expanding international here to 180 
million. How are you thinki
ng basically about the rest of the TAM, and the 
ability for that to grow here over time?
 
David Wells
 


are today is broadband households. In all of these territories, mainly outside 
the U.S. in most of the develo
p markets in Europe are growing at a much 
faster pace. So those numbers are going to grow and grow. For us if you 


successful.
 

widespread adoption and join in Netflix as a product, beyond demand and 

aspects of us as a global distrib
ution platform are being able to bring great 
content to markets in the U.S. to markets in Europe and Asia we like the 
prospects of our opportunities there.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
David just mentioned China is a large source potential broadban
d household, 

the China expansion.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, let David address that.
 
David Wells
 

I think it

it's conspicuously large, and it's conspicuously a growing and very strong 
economy. So look for the future, in terms of an answer from us in China.

Great, just s
hifting gears into the US streaming business. As you approach 
40 million streaming subs in the US toward the end of this year, and you're 
looking toward that lower end of 60 million to 90 million that you talk about, 
how do you think the mix of net adds ch
anges between gross adds and 
churn going forward, and does lower churn really become an even stronger 
driver of the business?
 
David Wells
 

be growth in reducing term or improving o
ur retention and in bringing more 
and more people into the market I mean all originals have the potential as 
we produce more and more contact to sort of bring more people into Netflix 
and new types of subscribers into Netflix.
 
So I think overtime Netflix w
ill set more and more to people who are coming 
back and people who are staying longer just as we penetrate deeper into the 
U.S. but we still think we got some room to grow on both side.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
Ted when you figure that your U.S
. mix what you think the mix of expenses 
would be between originals, acquired, TV acquired film and what the right 
balance of spending across three buckets.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Overtime Michael I love if you think about it most of that because we have a 
lot of pr


out of that so big into our margin guidance is our content spend and we 
want to move a lot of it to original

given us new brand strength as those shows have been successful and they 
continue to prove to be successful and let them move down that further.
 
But there is a lot of times where we will premiere the sequel to Breakin
g 
Bad, Better Call Saul; we're going to premiere that everywhere outside the 

for us in terms of how we treat it.
 
So really if you want to think about it is total content expense 
and we want 

that area and we want to keep pushing down that path. So there is no 
optimal mix in that way.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Ted, can you walk us through what the release schedu
le looks like for 
originals just through the rest of 2014 and then into 2015? And I realize it's 
tough maybe to choose between your kids here, but what new shows are 
you particularly excited about?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

premiere dates. The ones coming up in August, 
where we have BoJack Horseman, which is our first foray into adult 


ginals 

coming out in the couple of weeks and we're also really excited about in 
August.
 

thrilled with how 



difficult to do on conventional television Marco Polo
 
is a very ambitious 

that for Q4.
 
Michael Nathanson

MoffettNathanson
 
I wonder from when you first started you basically built a service on library 
acquired content. You've evolv
ed to exclusives and originals. I wonder when 
you look at usage trends today. How important are the library achieve shows 
that you have won the first round of negotiations with studios persons I 
thinks are buying out so to talk a bit about the heavy usage 
trends among 

 
Ted Sarandos
 
The great thing about this time that we are in right now Michael is that 
content is still great and there is so much are being produced you can barely 
watch it all in our life
time. So, the library becomes important because most 

bringing out original programming and about as fastest basis we can and 
maintain in the kind of quality that we have been able to. So,
 
we are going 
to continue pushing on that path and originals is going to be a important 
component of that all the time but we will also I think we would always be a 
very valuable ultimate buyer for networks because so much of that content 
is never been see
n by the public.
 
So we are excited that we will to continue to play in that space where pretty 
popular at May screenings, we commit when they are showing those projects 
for us to potentially be a first window partner for those shows outside of the 
U.S. and
 
because we are not lead to we are only going to put on the shows 
that we produce that gives us the opportunity to put a lot of content part of 
consumers that they love regardless of the business model.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Ted, I just wanted to follow
-
u
p on a point that you said earlier, just around 
contracts. And I guess I'm curious how the initial kind of contracts around 
House of Cards and Orange may differ from what you're signing for new 
original series now, and is it fair to think that you are gett
ing all of the 
international or global rights basically for these new originals that are 
coming out?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
The key for us that is we are trying to make sure we have we can control the 
exploitation in those territories particularly the ones that we a
re heading to. 
So, you can either get through that by owning the show outright or by 
negotiating to control of those rights with the content owners and have them 

controls to that wh
en we open a new markets we can launch those titles 
with us, if they are coming up at a time that makes sense, given them that 
we put so much branding power behind those shows leading up to the 
launch.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
Reed, can I ask y
ou about international competition? You really enjoyed a 
first mover advantage in your first markets you went in to but now you see a 

say in Germany and France, trying to do what yo
u are doing, how do you 
think you would be able to differentiate yourself in the competition levels in 
terms of those markets where someone like a Sky, Sky Deutschland is 
already trying to achieve the same type of service?
 
David Wells
 

sionist history, Michael because to say that we were first 
mover, because if you think about the UK, LOVEFiLM had been there for 
seven years, developed 2 million subscriber base, bought by Amazon infused 
with sustaining content was a tremendous significant
 
competitor to us two 
and a half years ago when we launched. But what we did is we focused on 
television content, they focused on movies, we focused on incredible 
streaming performance that you never got buffering, working with all the 
integrators. And fun

us whereas this was a project for someone within a larger company and then 
now two and a half years later of course LOVEFiLM has folded up as a brand 
so we are tremendously excited about the oppo
rtunity to continue to move 
forward.
 
We have also had Sky from the beginning in the U.K. we are very aggressive 

out is that we can grow very substantially in the U.K. and Sky is 
untouched 
similar to here in the U.S. how we are growing rapidly but MVPD as a total is 
untouched. So I think, the big MVPD is recognizing them you know Netflix is 

material way and we
 
have again great focus, global R&D and those are the 
things that we look forward to. But in the end of the day there may well be 
room for several of these services in the market with different types of 
content that each have a exclusive content, if you th
ink historically in the 
U.S. like HBO and Showtime, they are not really competing against each 

entertainment budget and in the same way we are like that in the new 

eed to beat some new competitors, we just need to 
create an incredible service that all of that all of the citizens in each country 
that we serve want to be part of Netflix.
 
Doug Anmuth

JPMorgan
 
Great. Ted, can you talk more about your plans for Chelsea 
Handler's new 
show coming up, and does this signal more of a move into live streaming, 
and now that you're moving more into late night talk, is there more of a 
strategy potentially around sports content over the long term?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I think Chelsea is g
oing to be a kind of great representative of the kind of 
concept the programming on Netflix because her show is a lot about the 
entertainment world, movies and television and culture and we think that it 
will be a great addition to Netflix in 2016. We just
 
filmed her comedy special 
in Chicago and as you are going to do four more in 2015 and the show itself 
you should think about it is the way that people are not watching scripted 
programming the way they used to but also not watching these late night 
talk s
hows the way they used to. I mean they are not watching them at 
11:30 they are watching in days, weeks sometimes in months later online or 
on stacked episodes on DVR. So what we are hoping to do with Chelsea and 

oser to the way people are going 
to watch it, the way we have done with serialized dramas where we to took 
out the commercial breaks and the cliffhangers and really produce it the way 
people watch. And we have got a lot of time between now and then to work
 
through all the format details and Chelsea is incredibly excited and we are 

in terms of your other question, I think about it as more of a continuum that 
this is not that insta


out for us.
 
Michael Nathanson

MoffettNathanson
 
David and Reed, this question on international margins, do you think that 
international margins in their end state will look like U.S. margins or 
anything structurally different about your international businesses or the 
scale versus the U.S. activities?
 
David Wells
 

gotten this 
question before. There is nothing really different about our international 

markets. It really is about the competition in those markets and in terms of 
what consumer al
ternatives are there and how much we are able to charge 
and the value that deliver to these consumers but there is nothing 

better.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
David, just a question on 
the balance sheet. Can you help us understand 
how you think about the right amount of cash to have on the balance sheet, 
just given international expansion and then current free cash flow 
generation? And as part of that, we see the streaming content obliga
tions 
move from $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion, which I think is one of the more 
significant moves that we've seen in recent quarters. And just how we 
should interpret that?
 
David Wells
 
The content obligations are a little bit lumpy, depending upon what we d
o on 
produced contents, so I would look at it sort of over a year
-
on
-
basis basis 
rather than a sequential basis. But you are right, they have gone up some, 
they will continue to go up as we expand and grow our produced content line 
and to some extent our i
nternational expenses as well as we signed up for 
multi
-
year deals, those obligations roll
-
on to the table as well. So, the right 
amount of cash, cash is not an inoculator in terms a prolonged competitive 
battle. It does help in terms of short
-
term that do
es help the business in 
terms of making producers and others feel good about our balance sheet 
position. I would say in general, I was a bit worried earlier on say two, three 

we w
ill be burning at faster than we actually did.
 
So, for a while there I was a bit of little in terms of saying, telling investors, 
we are going to start burning, we are going to start burning and we really 

for a while, so I think I am 
pretty solid on telling folks, look in Q4 and in Q1, we are going to start using 
cash a little bit more as we expand internationally and as we grow our 
content spend. And in the future, it will really depend on our internationa
l, 
on the pace of our international expansion, so I think I feel good about the 
level we are at now and it will really depend on our future plans.
 
Michael Nathanson

MoffettNathanson
 
Ted, just recently this week, I think you announced the pay one deal in 
Canada for Disney and I know you have done a couple of pay one deals 
elsewhere. Where do you think the potential is to really break the pay one 
window outside the U.S., so is that to know we can see more deals like that 
going forward?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
I made a
 
distinction before around the Disney relative to the other studios in 
that, for us the Disney output deal represents a pretty big chunk of kids 
viewing in general, so I think of it more like a kids programming move that 
also has a lot of movie component, 


really interesting about the Canadian deal is that Disney is now going to 
move that deal in U.S. and Canada to one supplier which has not been
 
the 
historic norm and we are also going to line up the window, so our Canadian 
subscribers can be seeing movies at the exact same time as U.S. 
subscribers. And we do have other pay one deals around the world including 
a Warner Brothers in the Nordic as an
 
example and a few others.
 

so we can get them to consumers sooner and sooner. To kind of deliver on 
the expectation that the Internet has set
-
up for what I want, when I want, 
w
here I want.
 
Reed Hastings
 

we will wrap it up.
 
Doug Anmuth 
-
 
JPMorgan
 
Okay, great. So I wanted to go back to something we touched on earlier, 
and I guess it's primarily for David. Ju
st trying to understand better, and 
hope you can drill down more on the 30%, why that's the right level to go to 
and then reassess the domestic streaming margins, and help us understand 
better how you think about these tradeoffs that you mentioned in the l
etter, 
the 400, 200, and then 100 basis points of margin improvement on an 
annual basis?
 
David Wells
 

for us to reassess and we think we will get there next year, so there is 
nothing
 
magical about that one 30% number. And then in terms of how we 
think about the next target whether we leave that at 400 basis point year
-
on
-

think that we can continue to expand our mark
et and solidify our 
competitive position with investments in content or do we think that we can 
continue to grow content at a moderate, slightly less aggressive pace and 
put more
 
to margin. As we grow what we have explained in terms of that 
margin number g
etting bigger and bigger, it just gets harder to deliver 400 

behind it. So it may not be the right thing to do to continue to press forward 
as aggressively on content or on profit gro
wth versus other things that we 
could spend money with content being the largest one.
 
Michael Nathanson 
-
 
MoffettNathanson
 
I would say following on that is for anything that you know today on the 
content cost side like the Disney deal that coming June 17 t
hat makes you 
say that, do you, have you looked at your 
--
 

looking forward and say hey, that is a hurdle that could change it?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, Michael, this is more about perspective opportunities spend on the 
content line. We f
orward plan our business, we foreword plan our content 
spending fully, knowing fully well that that Disney deal has been done over a 
year then we have projections, Disney could have 20 releases at $400 





con
tent is that the right decision versus profit growth and making a very 
smart decision as business owner long
-
term about the competitiveness and 
setting ourselves up competitively through the long
-
term.
 
David Wells
 
Thank you everyone for joining us for the 
call and that we look forward in 
October to be able to report to you on our initial success with our French and 
German launches. Thanks you very much.

Session
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 

the obvious question to ask is given though the miss in subscribers this 
quarter in the U.S. and the slightly slower growth next q
uarter in the U.S. 

-
curve and the s
-
curve, especially given the fact that you have a grandfather 
price increase couple of years down the road, so anything on that.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Su
re, Michael. We added 3 million net subscribers in Q3, so about a million a 



 


to feel our way along quarter
-
by
-
quarter as we improve the content.
 
And if you think about the general society, all moving to Internet TV
 
like 

there, not exactly sure the rate of transfer but Internet TV is going to be 
everything in a couple of years.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
And Reed, just to follow
-
up on that, w
hy is 60 million to 90 million still the 

looking at for the fourth quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 

society, not only
 
the U.S., but around the world is moving to Internet video 



 
we saw Starz a week ago announced that 
they are doing an Internet video service; we sa
w HBO; perhaps all the other 
providers over the coming weeks. And so think of all the big networks are 

 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
David, given that that revenues came in li
ne, subscribers came in lighter in 
the U.S. was there a mix
-
shift amongst your pricing tiers in the third 
quarter?
 
David Wells
 

the Safe Harbor statement. So we will be making for
ward
-
looking 



 
this is not a scripted interview.
 
So Michael, back to your question, in terms of really the revenue number, 
we sort of missed on the total subscri
ber line and there is a bit of a delay 
between the folks getting a 30
-
day free trial and the revenue coming in. So 
that would explain most of it. There is a little bit of a mix
-
shift in terms of 
ASP being slightly higher than we forecasted, but most of it 
was just 
because of the revenue having a little bit of a lag.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
Reed, can you talk about the strength of subscribers in the new Western 
European markets in 3Q, how they performed early on versus your 
expectations and then also how m
uch do you know here about conversion 

-
month free trials and how is that 
impacting your guidance for 4Q.

able to announce Orange and Deutsche Telekom, and these are all going live 
shortly or just turned live or going live over the next couple of months.

through to the Netherlands, so almost 40 countries, as a whole are now

Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Okay. I have a two
-
parter for Reed and Ted on HBO GO. Today, the big 
news out of the Time Warner Investo
r Day was the announcement of an 
over
-
the
-
top service to be launched next year in the U.S. Two questions 
would be for Reed. What do you think the impact on competition will be as 
they start really pushing that product?
 
And for Ted, the take
-
away was they m
ight start sourcing some of Time 


 

maybe on movies and TV shows, so talk about those two things.
 
Reed Hastings
 

consu
mers subscribed to us, and Hulu, and Amazon, and they do pay
-
per
-
view, and they do DVD, and they do cable. So there are so many great 

not much of a change in the direct competitive 
landscape.
 



 
Ted Sarandos
 

another buyer in the market if they do 
choose to start licensing from, even from their sister companies. And 
different companies have different views of how they look to vertically 

 
revenue model for that content, with buyers like Netflix and others that they 
will have to competitively bid in the market for.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
Reed, just following up on HBO GO and the competitive dynamic there, do 
you have a view on how it cou
ld be priced and distributed when it ultimately 
comes out?
 
Reed Hastings
 

Nordics and there they chose to price on top of our pricing. Now, that pricing 
is higher because the VAT and c


 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 

free subs in in
ternational markets missed our expectations and your 
expectations. What is going on there? How could free trial subs miss 
expectations?
 
David Wells
 

we were going to in terms of bring
ing folks in. So across a number of 
markets we were lighter versus our forecast than we expected. And you 
collect all of those markets together and you get to a point where you 
missed on the total number, but you made it on the paid number.
 
Reed Hastings
 
A


mid
-

every quarter.
 
Douglas Anmu
th 

 
JPMorgan
 
And David, you called out in the letter basically that the increase in pricing 
may have had some impact in 3Q and perhaps a greater impact than you 
saw in the second quarter, perhaps, because Orange Is the New Black offset 
that. Beside pricin
g, is there anything else that you can point to in the U.S. 
in particular?
 
David Wells
 

was our leading indicator or leading factor in the quarter. The Home Depot 
breach certainly b
rought down some of our 

 
put a number of people on 
payment
-
hold. But we felt like if we provided three or four more swing 

certainly other factors at play.
 
We had a strong com
p last year with releasing Orange in July versus in Q2 
of this year and we talked a little bit about that. We certainly saw some 

those that we could talk about, but they are minor com
pared to what we 
think is the major one.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Reed, we got a lot of questions about France versus Germany as markets. 
Can you 

 

what you are seeing on initial tak
e
-
up rates or excitement around 

 
in 
France and Germany for Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, absolutely. I mean France and Germany are unique markets and so is 
Brazil a unique market and so is Norway. And now, we are over 45 of these 
unique markets. And every m


they want control and they want Internet video, because they get to watch 
on any screen, they get to watch any time they want, they get 
to binge
-
watch.
 


looking forward to continue to expand next year.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
And just follow
ing up Reed and perhaps Ted here as we talked about the 
International business, what percentage of content in new international 
markets is local? How do you know what the right level is here, and do you 
feel like you have enough currently in France and Ger
many?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
So, Doug, I'll jump in there. The 

 

have been around 15% to 20% local and within others, with 80%, 85% 
being either Hollywood or other international content. We 

 
one of our first 
indicator is that
, we are getting the mix right is how many hours of viewing 
people are participating in? And in France and Germany, the viewing hours 
are quite healthy relative to all of our other launches. So we're finding 

 
consumers are finding the things they want.
 
Th
e tricky thing is figuring out is the local content something that people 
want in the long
-
term, because when we first get to a new market, I think 

before. So, Orange Is the New B
lack was by far the most watched show in 
both France and Germany and, in fact, all of the markets that we launched.
 
So it tells you that with all the differences in taste that they both 

 
they all 
rallied around that show. I do think too that we're offerin
g those markets 
unprecedented choice, not just in programming, but also in choice of 
language, where you can watch the show either in native language or 

available to consumers in tho
se markets before.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
David, in the press release today or the letter to shareholders, you 
mentioned that Canada is now at the same margin as the U.S. after four 
years. How different are the penetration rates 
between those markets, I 

rates there and is that the threshold for profitability in terms of U.S. level 
profitability around the world?
 
David Wells
 

 
into specifics. But the penetration 

 
the rate 
of growth in any given market can be different. So the rate of growth 
between Canada, between Europe, between Latin America can be very 
different. But just reiterating in terms of the financial performance an
d the 
return on investment, in 2012, we spent nearly $400 million in terms of 
contribution loss on international. And what we were telling you today is that 
is now a positive number.
 
So, in little less than two years, we've made great progress. We think th
e 
international is a very good investment. So, some markets are going to take 
longer than others, the content maybe priced lower in those markets. So, 
the economics are very different market to market.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
David, you mentioned in the 
letter a little bit about the changes in the VAT in 
Europe that go into effect in 2015. Can you talk here about how those new 
rules will impact Netflix in Europe, and how much profit is at risk here, can 
you just perhaps quantify things beyond just talking
 
qualitatively about?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. So Luxembourg had an arrangement with the EU, where if you were 
headquartered there, you could charge a 15% Luxembourg VAT rate. And 
VAT rates, they vary from Switzerland at 8% on the low end to the Nordic 
countries 
at 25% on the high end. So for us, we're talking about an internal 
cost change to Netflix, because we're not going to pass that along to the 
consumer of about 5% on average of Europe revenue. So some others rates 
are going from 15% to 25%, some of them are
 
going from 15% to 19%, but 
a weighted average that you can sort of ballpark is about 5% of European 
revenue.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
David or Reed, can you give us an update on 2015 international expansion 

e going to keep opening up new markets, 
how should investors think about the speed of those openings in investments 
in 2015?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're still sorting that out Michael, trying to figure out, which markets are 
most attractive and we'll have some ann
ouncements to make over the next 
year. If you look at our long
-
term strategy, we've been extremely consistent 
over the past three years, saying that, we're going to take all of our profits 
and put them into international expansion, because we see it as suc
h a big 
opportunity. So think of that as the base case if we can move quickly 
enough, then we can deploy all of those profits in highly productive ways.
 
David Wells
 
And I would say to give you some sense of the magnitude, we peaked out of 
international los
s at 105 million we guided in Q4 to a number that slightly 
lower than that. But in terms of the potential down the road, we certainly 
could see that level of investment.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Okay. Thank you.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
So fol
lowing up on that Reed and then perhaps Dave as well, Reed, you 
recorded about a month ago saying that it would take three to five years for 
single country to get to break
-
even. And then also that it could take Europe 
five to ten years overall to the break
-
even, and then also that you want to 
be fully global including China. Can you help us sort these out, and in 
particular, do you still believe that international contribution margins can be 
comparable to U.S. margins in a more mature state?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Y
es, we're making great progress on international. We gave you the proof 
point on Canada having gotten there; we're continuing to make progress in 
all those markets towards having a similar contribution to contribution profit 
to the U.S. and contribution ma
rgin, so feeling great about that. The three to 
five years is what we've seen in our experience, we'll see if future markets 
are slower or faster, there are some variations. And then overall, Europe 

 


 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 

timeframe for Europe overall cascading from the beginning?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Ted, as you start buying rights like Gotham worldwide, you start seeing 
some markets like Australia acknowledge that you have the rights to 
Gotham in those markets. How do you balanc
e the need to basically buy 
global rights with a desire to be more measured as you expand 
internationally?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

content, there is a lot of our content choices have proven to 
be extremely 
global starting with all of our original series that, Orange Is the New Black 
and House of Cards have been huge successes in not just in Australia, but in 
China, I mean, all over the world.
 
So these buys bode well I think for future expansion 
in all territories. And 
the 

 
right now, I believe we've hit kind of a financial tipping point, where 
we can move forward on buying up more territories than we're currently 
operating in versus playing catch
-
up, which we had been doing, licensing the 
territ
ory or creating original series, and then several years later having to go 

House of Cards in some of our current expansion territories.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
David, just on i
nternational expansion, what do you think the best way is for 
the street to think about and model your future international markets? So 

reasonable expectation for the number of new
 
broadband households that 
you would like to address over the next few years, obviously, there is big 
implications here for both subs and, of course, for the bottom line. And do 
you expect these international launches to continue to be more heavy in 3Q 
and
 
4Q, or more evenly spread out through the year?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I've given you some indication of sort of, at least, the financial 

target in mind when we think about the next wave of i
nternational 
expansion. There is a number of just execution elements that come into 
play, how many we think we can do successfully well at the same time or 
consecutively and certainly we're getting closer and closer as Ted talked 
about to a global right.
 
S
o in terms of the incremental cost associated with an international launch, 
we certainly are reflective in some of our produced content today of having a 

continue to rollout intern
ational. You've got some indication of magnitude on 

great investment so far.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
David, based on some of our analysis, I think other people fee
l the same 
way, it looks like you can add in new markets between 300 to 500 basis 
points of penetration in the first couple of years, is that consistent with your 

 
David Wells
 

t level of detail and specificity.
 
Reed Hastings
 
The one thing, David, that we said in as we do in the launch markets is that, 
it took in the U.S. seven years to get to about one
-
third of broadband 
households. And that in the developed markets, so not as m
uch LATAM, but 
for Western Europe that we're targeting those kind of numbers getting to a 
third of households over seven years. So that would be consistent with the 
trajectory that you've just outlined Michael.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Okay. Th
anks.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 

announcements recently certainly Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and then 
also the Adam Sandler deal, I'll just hit on the latter, but can you talk
 
more 
about how data influence the decision to do the four movie deal with Adam 
Sandler. Can you talk about his global appeal as well, and do you think there 
are other actors or actresses that could have similar appeal for Netflix going 
forward?
 
Ted Sarand
os
 
Sure, Doug, the Adam Sandler decision was driven on by following market 
after market seeing Adam's films either from his deepest catalogue to his 
newest releases performing 

 
outperforming not only performing their Box 
Office, but performing wonderfully
 
in every territory defying conventional 

 
And more importantly, he really performs well in the Box Office in our key 
markets like Brazil, like Germany, like the UK, and his last movie was 60% 
international. So Adam
 
is not only a proven 20
-
year star, I mean, he has a 
move that performs well in the Box Office every summer for 20 years. He is 
a real global superstar and we see that in the data and the more 
international we get, the more access we have to that data 

 
th
ose data 
points versus relying on conventional wisdom of generic thinking like that 

and we think that our subscribers are going to love having access to those 
movies immediately thr
ough this new deal.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 

you to buy movies this way than buying in your Pay 1 window. Can you talk 
more about that, because it seems to me 
that you are a successful film 
producer, you want to use the windows to monetize all your consumer touch 
point, so why is it more efficient to do it this way versus Pay 1?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, there is a couple of ways to think about it Michael, the main one
 
is 
access to content that people want to watch. And I think this long protracted 
window model was fine before On
-
Demand was possible like consumers now 
expect to see content sooner or have access to content earlier windows in 
the formats that they want to
 
watch. So in this case, we are talking about 

months to a year after theatrical and in some cases nine years after 
theatrical over sitting behind someone else's deal. So if you lo
ok at a 
successful film and you roll up all the license fee 

 
all the licensing fees in 
each territory, it is possible there is an economic trade off that you are 
paying less to produce the film than you are to license it, and this model to 
your point abou
t, you want to split those of the windows. For us this is 
programming cost, not an individual P&L on each film.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And the broad point here is especially with Adam Sandler multi
-
movie deal, 

d with Netflix, because 
I'm in the Adam Sandler I watch this and now the next movie and the next 
movie comes. So think of it with us playing with this idea of episodic and 
serialized, but now in the movie forum and seeing what kind of great brand 
allegianc


pioneered here.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
And on that note with the Adam Sandler deals, Ted, can you just talk to us
 
about how you would actually measure the success of these kind of 

Office to track here?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes, I would think about the same way we look at the successes around 
original series or any of our license series relative to what you are paying, do 
you get this kind of three legs of success, with the viewing, the brand halo, 
and net subscriber additions based on access to the content.
 
I think that particularly and this o
ne is, we try to be as consumer friendly as 
we can and I think the model here is telling us that consumers want access 

economically feasible to do it. But if the measure 

 
the measure 

 
you 
sh
ould think about measuring success the same way we do series and do 
people get excited about Netflix because of it. And I think as Reed pointed 
out, I'm as excited about this as I have been since we talked about House of 
Cards a couple of years ago, about 
the potential impact on the brand and 
the subscriber enthusiasm around it.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Ted, in the UK, we found some data that suggests that younger households 
are consuming a lot more Netflix than older households, penetration rat
es 
are higher. You mentioned in the letter that you had, I think 75 series, kids 
series with over 2 million views. Can you talk a little bit about what is that 
mean, is that over a week, is that over, what duration is that and is that 
globally. They're 

 
t
hose are active titles, titles that are currently being 


number for those and particularly in that kind of volume
. But those are 
domestic and you can think about the international and domestic split 
roughly similar to our subscriber base.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
And 

 
within what timeframe, is it on a monthly basis, is it qummed [ph] 
over time?
 
Reed Hast
ings
 
They are currently active titles and they are qummed for active titles.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Okay. Okay, thanks.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
And Ted, on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon some of the major theatre
-
chains here have responded 
pretty negatively early on in terms of the day
-
and
-
date IMAX release and Netflix streaming plans. What happens to the 
economics of your film strategy if some of those major chains prevent IMAX 
from exhibiting the film?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Very little economically
, I mean, I think the key to it is we would like to give 
the consumers the choice to see a big film on a big screen. And Crouching 
Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not a direct
-
to
-


ty to see it on the IMAX 
screens at the same time and IMAX has made arrangements with us for that 


 
as expected the theatre
-
chains reacted negatively 
publicly. But I think the really 

 
the real story will unfold on August 28 when 
th

 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Reed, in the past quarter, it looks like in Canada, a local tribunal, the CRTC 
was asking for some data regarding Netflix that you guys were not willing 
because
 
of privacy to share. Are you worried that governments and 
regulators will start asking for even more disclosure and try to enforce more 
traditional regulatory pressures upon your business?
 
Reed Hastings
 

ion with consumers for 
protecting privacy against a wide range of players. So you will see us be a 
really staunch ally of the consumer. Will there be conflict with certain 
government agencies that may over time; we are not seeking to have a 
fight. We are g
oing to try to work well with everyone and certainly as an 
example in France, I think we really turned around what could have been a 
difficult situation into one that was quite positive. So we are getting better 
and better at those governments relation ski

a battle.
 
Ted Sarandos
 


Canada for animation executives and there is 

 
I t
hink something on the 
magnitude of $140 million a year be important to the Canadian economy 

 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
David, can you talk about just how the amortization of these newer movie 
deals ar
e going to be recognized on the financial statements? And then just 
in particular, can you go into some detail? I know you talked about in the 
letter some, but just the dynamics around free cash flow and EPS as both a 
function of some of the heavier conten
t investments and then also the 
international expansion as well?
 
David Wells
 
Sure. So I'll take the amortization question. In terms of how the movies will 
be amortized, they will be accelerated like our large original series are. And 
until we have more dat
a to challenge that whether it should be faster or 

 
And then your second question was on free cash flow relative to net income. 
So we put the graph in there to illustrate the separation that ha
ppened in 
Q3. We've been saying this for quite some time in terms of the pressures on 
cash being the expansion of content, including produced content as well as 
the international expansion, because it forces the loss lower.
 

stent when we talked about 1.2 to 1.3 ratio of 
cash outlaid to content P&L expense is still consistent. And if we spend $3 
billion globally on content and growing, even taking the 1.2 or the 20% ratio 

d above the P&L 
expense. So we expect these trends to be persistent and I think that we 

continually look at this and if we continue to expand both content and 
international as w
e expect to do, then you should continue to see some 
pressure on the cash 

 
on the free cash flow.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Ted, can you talk a bit about off
-
network syndication? In the past quarter, 
you were able to license both Gotham and 
Blacklist a year after they aired 
on network television. Can you talk a bit about what changed in model and 
what's the cost of those types of purchases versus maybe library content?
 
David Wells
 
Yes, and there is other variants on the model like in January 
you will see a 
Better Call Saul, the Breaking Bad prequel that we will be licensing in all of 
our other territory. And a year after in the U.S. and Canada, and then in the 
first run every other territory we operate in. So we are super excited about 
that on
e too. And I look at it about as all these models are changing pretty 
rapidly there is multiple buyers in the market. So I think at any one piece of 
content, the bidding can get pretty intense, but overall, the content costs 
are pretty consistent on all th
ese new models.
 
And I think operating in 50 different countries and being willing to operate in 
multiple windows, gives us a real advantage in the market, so we're excited 
about that.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 

ess recently and I think 

agencies in selling to a streaming service. Back
-
ends of course are typically 
their foundation, but selling to a streaming with a perpetual deal they 

necessarily know where that back
-
end would come from if there 
may not be a second sale. Does that create a problem for you in buying 
content rights across all markets and do you see any push
-
back there?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
No, Doug. And just like every time you p
resent to a new market and a new 
window and a new paradigm, you got to figure out how to make it work in 
the old world too. So I think in 

 
these problems were contemplated back 
when HBO started doing original series before they had a DVD business, 
before 
they knew if they were going to syndicate, so I think those are all 

well.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Reed, a question on Internet net
-
neutrality, one of the things we sta
rted 
with looking at broadband investment is if the interconnect fee is capped or 
protected or kept zero, how do investors in broadband plant recoup their 

investor or the PIPE investo
r think about returns on their investment if they 

 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, the simple version is they collect revenue on the Internet from their 

our conte


 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
David, I think U.S. marketing spend was down about 5% year
-
over
-
year and 
more than 200 basis points as a percentage
 
of revenue. Why spend fewer 

forecast and could this have hindered sub
-
growth and how should we think 
about that marketing dollar trend going forward?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I think back si
x, eight years ago, there was a much more direct 
connection between our marketing spend and our net
-
additions in terms of 
bidding on bounties for people to sign
-
up via click
-
through on an online ad. I 

whether our marketing 
spend is up 10% or down 10%. There is an immediate direct connection felt 
on our net addition growth. So when we look at our marketing spend, we 
look at a number of factors. We look at what content, what opportunities we 
have to spend
 
against that in the quarter. We look at what our margin

Reed, over the past weekend, our home which uses FiOS had a trouble 
getting on to Netflix which is a good problem to have. But I wonder, what 
does your research tell you about satisfaction levels when there is a 
buffering or conne
ctivity issue and how does that get solved?
 
Reed Hastings
 



nterconnect so that the 
average speeds for Verizon are now some of the highest in the United 
States, still not as high as many of the speeds in Europe but some of the 
highest in the U.S. So it should be very rare and I have to follow

Reed, just i
n thinking about the U.S. versus international markets, can you 
compare and contrast some of the challenges with peering with 
interconnection and net

neutrality, especially in markets internationally 
where we may be seeing some consolidation? Do you see an
y elevated 
challenges in some of those new markets you might wish to go into in 2015 
and beyond?

free interconnect. The whole charging for interconnect is really an artifac
t of 
size. So Comcast is the biggest so they get to charge the most and then it

and you guys are growing internationally, but is your cost base denominated 
for most part in U.S. dollars and is revenue base 
denominated 
internationals? How does currency affect you guys next year?

Reed, or p

Western Europe may be relative to earlier deals a

David, you updated the U.S. margin outlook to the 200 basis points of 
expansion per year and getting up to 40% over five years, of c
ourse, after 
you hit 30% early next year. How do you get comfortable that you can still 
invest what you need to in content in the U.S. and also do that 40% longer 
term margin.
 
David Wells
 

given. 
But I think that even with the shift to the 200 it still allows for some pretty 
significant expansions of both licensed and produced content. So we feel 
pretty comfortable about the room for continued growth of the quality of the 
content. And I thin
k it provides a little bit of discipline in terms of making 

comfortable on both senses.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
And any chance you want to share more on what sub

number that 40% 
i
mplies five years down the line?
 
David Wells
 
It implies continued growth.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Michael and Doug, we should do one more question each and then we should 
wrap it up.
 
Michael Nathanson 

 
MoffettNathanson
 
Okay. Thanks, Reed. I have one for Ted. I beli
eve one of your content deals 
early on had a put option for a company to actually put shows to you. I 
wondered what do you think will happen to those 

 
to that agreement longer 
term and should we expect some more of the show 

 
a big bundle of shows 
put to 
you in the next one or two years?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

been in various stages of renegotiation and extension and redefining. So 

e remember they 
were mostly designed in the beginning to gain access to the content, not to 


 


that could just
 
looming out there.
 
Douglas Anmuth 

 
JPMorgan
 
And Reed, a question that we frequently get still is on pricing. We obviously 
saw the small, what we thought was a small pricing change in 2Q, but 
perhaps had a bigger impact in the third quarter. Does that 
mean really as 
we look out over the next couple of years that you may not do anything in, 

potentially, do things around tiering?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
closely to our members and then as we add 
more and more great original content than I think were more valuable to 

learning how to do that. But over the long time consumers pay for 
value and 


early December.
 
With that, let me thank everybody for joining us on this call and look
 
forward 
to catching up with all of you over the quarter. And special thanks to Doug

4/24/12,Netflix,"Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q3 2018 Earnings Interview. I'm 
Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are 
CEO, Reed Hastings; CFO, David Wells; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; 
and Chief Product Officer, Greg 
Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Eric 
Sheridan from UBS.
 
As a reminder, we will be making forward
-
looking statements and actual 
results may vary.
 
With that, over to you now Eric, for the first question.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Q 
-
 
Eric 
Sheridan
 
Thank you, Spencer. Maybe I'll kick off with what clearly is the headline from 
the earnings results, much better subscriber performance in Q3, and a fairly 
robust guide within Q4 in terms of looking out on the subscribers. I'll turn it 
to you guys
 
to sort of layout the framework you saw develop in Q3, what do 
you think might develop in Q4 that was different than what happened earlier 
in the year?
 
Reed Hastings
 

evolutio
n to paid net ads. So if you look at that paid net ad growth that we 
showed, you can see how remarkably steady. So I'm afraid the Q2, Q3 story 
is probably mostly an issue of forecasting as opposed to anything changing 
in the business, and you can see the n
oise that the free trials added into the 
paid, which gets you the total creates. So I think by focusing going forward 
on paid, we'll be able to be a little more accurate and focused on the 
fundamentals.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
So when you think about some of the dis
tribution deals you've done over the 
last couple of years, that's creating some noise that I think you're now trying 
to clear up with these new disclosures. But can you also talk a little bit about 
what those distribution deals maybe in terms of opening up
 
packets of the 
market that haven't been available to you before not only just this year, but 
as you think out longer
-
term about the business?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. Over to you Greg.
 
Greg Peters
 
And can you clarify, Eric, in distribution deals you mean the d
evice partners, 
et cetera.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Correct. Different ways of going to market via partner as opposed to direct.
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes. So I think what we are doing is, we are slowly learning more and more 
about how we can leverage partners. We've seen it s
ort of an evolution from 
just doing device integrations and to things like billing integrations, so we 
can make it that much easier for our members to sign up for the service. 

with
 
an Internet service provider or a mobile operator or pay
-
TV operator. 
We can make it even easier for people to just find Netflix and to try the 
service out.
 
And what we're seeing here is that this allows us to access a set of 
subscribers, a consumer demog
raphic which might be less technology early 
adopter than the folks that are signing us up 

 
with us directly, and so we're 
able to sort of accelerate our growth in a new segment via these deals. So 
we're learning more and more about that, we're trying to f
igure out which 
markets they work and how to optimize that bundle strategy.
 
David Wells
 
Eric, I would say these aren't new disclosures in a sense that that's pretty 
strong term. I would say this is an evolution of a partner strategy, and as 
Greg talked abo
ut, we've been doing many of these for a while. There's 
nothing sort of strategically different than what we've been doing for the last 
five years or so.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
And maybe following up on something that Greg said there, just where 
you're discovering 
growth and awareness of the product that didn't exist 
before. I'd like to separate that into domestic versus international. I think 
one of the questions we get from investors all the time are, where is the 
growth coming from in North America given the bran
ds awareness, given 
how long the brand has been around in the marketplace. Anything you could 
tell us about where those pockets of growth are and where you're 
discovering new awareness for the Company?
 
Greg Peters
 

ss is super high and the brand is 
well understood. There's still pockets of consumers who 

 
it's harder for 
them to get the activation energy to go directly to the website and sign up, 
but if we can actually put a Netflix application, a call to action and 
maybe 
even bundle that the service subscription as part of their pay
-
TV offering or 
the mobile offering, they can just click on something and then get right into 
the service.
 

effecti
ve for our folks to sign up. We see actual acceleration of ads there. 
Then obviously in markets where we're less well understood in terms of what 
the offering is, that simplifying, that making it less friction full provides other 
types of members maybe tha
t are even more technology adopters, simple 
way is just to try to experience out and we get the growth there as well.
 

remove friction and it works both in high
-
penetration and high
-
awa
reness 
markets as well as in lower
-
penetration and lower
-
awareness markets.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
One of the other things sticking with the domestic market for a minute, 
pricing power in the business model. You raised prices as we came out of 
last year and 
into this year. It's now been a couple of quarters and some of 
those pricing actions have worked through the marketplace. What have you 
learned about the value that consumers put on Netflix? And how much 
pricing power there might be in the business model e
specially when you look 
domestically?
 
Greg Peters
 


 
what we're seeing is just reinforcing this sort of core 
theory that we have, which is our job is to focus on, invest and providing our 
members incredible experiences, more great content
, great product 
experiences. And when we do that and we do it well, we earn the right to 
increase price a bit and then we take that new revenue, invested back into 
the model and that sort of continuous positive cycle we get to keep going, 
and we foresee th
at that will keep going for many years in the future.
 
Eric Sheridan
 

non
-
India. Within India, we saw a big push earlier this year into local 

tle bit about what local language 
content does in India to stimulate subscriber growth and then how you think 
about penetrating the India market from who you need to partner with and 
how you have to get pricing right over the medium to long
-

t
hrow that open maybe to probably touch the spot a little bit of everyone 
within the group?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
This is Ted. I'll talk to you about the incredible success with Sacred Games 
followed it up right away with Ghoul and prior to that with a movie called,
 
Love Per Square Foot. What it really was able to do was take this product 
that maybe was less known in India, when we launched and make it feel 
more local, more relevant. And what we saw was a 

 
all of that was 
following a nice steady increase in viewer e
ngagement prior to us launching 
those big original shows.
 
So what they had was a product that people understood more, talked to 
their friends more about that was written about more in the press and 
certainly talked about more by influencers, and then deliv
ered with content 

quality 

 
the production quality of Sacred Games by way of example.
 
Greg Peters
 
And then to the question on pricing what I would say is, we're just getting 
started 
in India and we feel like with the existing model that we have and 
the prices that we're at, we've got a long runway still ahead of us. And we've 
seen that in sort of the increasing traction that we're getting in that segment 
as we have the great content t
hat Ted was mentioning. We increased our 

 

around the world that allow us to sort of broaden access by providing a 
pricing tier that
 
sits below our current lowest tier and we'll see how that 
does in terms of being able to accelerate our growth and get more access. 
But even on the existing model, we feel like we have a long runway ahead of 
us in India.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
But maybe following 
up on something that Reed has talked about publicly in 
terms of the potential for growth in India longer
-
term, how does the model 
have to morph to maybe line up with longer
-
term goals of adding 100 million 
subscribers in a market like India?
 
Reed Hastings
 

then into many more languages, more pricing options, more bundling, all of 
those things are possible. There's over 300 million mobile phone 

twice that in mobile phone 
subscription. So there's a huge market and people in India like around the 

figure out how to expand the market as we grow.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
A couple hundred mi
llion people watching content through the Internet in 
India is a really exciting idea.
 
David Wells
 

million at a time, we're super encouraged with India and the growth that 
we've got e
arly on, but we know it's going to be somewhat of a tough 
market, right. So there's 

 
that notion is along 

 
is a million at a time, right. 
It's not going to be overnight where we're going to get to those higher 
numbers.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Is there any way to t
ease out when you see subscriber growth 
internationally like you just published for Q3, obviously in even bigger 
number as you forecast out to Q4 to tease out how much India is 
contributing to that versus non
-
India and are they any markets on either the 
co
ntent side or the subscriber side you'd like to call out ex
-
India?
 
Reed Hastings
 
For competitive reasons, we're not going to give you too much color on that. 
What's driving the P&L progress is doing shows that carry a multiple 
territories, creating a great
 
synergy around those great excitement, and 
that's what we really 

 
we hardly look at it U.S. and internationally, when we 
look at it internally almost all just globally.
 
Spencer Wang
 
And Eric, as you probably saw in the Investor Letter, we talked about th
e 
growth in our membership being very broad
-
based and very global. So I 
think you should read that as what we've said in the past, which is the 
phenomenon of Internet entertainment is really global phenomenon that 
we're benefiting from.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Fair 
enough. One of the things you're shifting a little bit further down, the 
P&L into revenue, international saw some headwinds from FX this quarter. 
Understand the translation issues around that, but wanted to understand if 
FX volatility is causing any headwi
nds or tailwind you're seeing in terms of 
end demand for the product or consumption of the product or is it truly a 
translation issue?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's mostly a translation issue. Absent foreign exchange or ASP, international 
ASP would have grown, and 
so I don't think we see any demand effect from 
foreign exchange.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Fair enough. Maybe two bigger picture questions. One, they came in a lot of 
formats from people ahead of the call competition. As you look out to 2019, 
I know not within the for
ecast period, but as you think about how the 
competitive landscape might shift? Where the market is going from a global 
standpoint on the competitive standpoint? How do you think about some of 
the friction points you're trying to solve for as a company whe
n you look out 
at that competitive landscape?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There are so many competitors, of course Disney is going to enter, AT&T is 
going to expand HBO, YouTube is just on fire growing around the world, 
video gaming like Fortnite. I mean there's so many
 
ways to have great 
entertainment on a screen.
 
So we don't focus that much in any one because no one seems to affect us 
that much. What affects us is can we produce the best content the world's 
ever seen? Can we get people excited about that content? Can w
e serve it 
up in ways that make it really fun and easy, again focusing on our 
fundamentals?
 
Someday there will have to be competition for wallet share, we're not naive 
about that, but it seems very far off from everything we've seen. So 

 
and 
we're continu
ing to work with many of those firms where it makes sense to 
for both of us and it's creating a big and vibrant industry.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe one follow
-
up to that, directed to Ted. When you think about the 
competitive landscape and what it might mean for 
either acquiring, sourcing 
or partnering on content with people globally. Ted, how is that changing the 
conversations maybe as you look out over the medium to long
-
term? Where 
might we see some of the pressure points that competition could play out on 
the 
content side?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, we've been a pretty dependable buyer and increasing the 

 
some of 
those sellers have been more complicated sellers, meaning there are 
conflicts within their companies of what they want to sell, when they want to 
sell, or wh
at Windows that would allow for. They allow flexibility to offer 
their own services, which is something we foresaw years ago when we 
started doing original programming.
 
But in the meantime, I think that they are the studios and who are always 
have been som
ewhat of potential competitors have to look at those things 
today and say what's the best way to get return on investment for creating 
great content. And so in some cases it's going to be launching it through 
their own direct
-
to
-
consumer initiatives, in ot
her cases it's going to be 
selling to Netflix which has proved to be very positive for them for many 
years.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Can you talk a little bit about 

 
maybe sticking with you Ted about some of 
the asks are coming from content creators. We continue to 
hear as we talk 
to people in the media industry about awards, campaigns or marketing 
budgets put behind content, people want their content seen who are content 
creators. How have some of those conversations changed? What might it 
mean for ways you go
-
to
-
ma
rket when you look out over the next couple 
years due to the taking content into the marketplace?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, I think what you said was perfect that people definitely want their 
content seen and the best chance of doing that is doing it with Netflix
. And 
you see in the long list of content brands and newly minted stars, out of 
Netflix just this quarter. You could see what we're talking about 

 
by putting 

be nominated and
 
win Emmys or Oscars. And those are really important to 
filmmakers and creators and we're super proud and happy for them when 
they win.
 
But in general, we want to do is try to make great content, elevate it to the 
right audience in the most efficient way p
ossible, so we can do more of it. 
And what we've seen more is that these shows that come out on Netflix are 
really piercing the culture, some of the most watched shows on television 
are on Netflix and the creators know that.
 
So when they 

 
the asks that ar
e coming into forms of marketing campaigns 
and awards campaigns, they're seeing that in very big numbers from us 
anyway. We had 40 shows nominated for Emmys this year and became the 

 
tied with HBO for the most Emmy wins this year. And that comes with 
grea
t content and great campaigns both marketing and awards campaigns.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe two follow
-
ups here. The first one on the products side, the team has 
talked before about lowering the friction to consumers finding product. That 
seems like a bit of a 
machine learning/product development issue that you 
have to solve for friction points as you look out over the next couple of 
years. How should investors think about lowering friction to consumers 
finding content? What are some of those key investments tha
t are being 
made? How those investments might change in the next couple of years?
 
Ted Sarandos
 


 
that list gave some very 
specific examples, people who went from being completely unknown to 
being global super
stars in the span of a few weeks or a few months of this 
quarter alone. So I think that it's evident that things are being found in 

 
at 
incredible pace on Netflix versus getting lost in the [sea] of things on Netflix.
 
Greg Peters
 
Our job is to make that e
ven more of the years to come and so we're 
investing a variety of different dimensions when you mentioned, but in 
terms of the design, the UX that we have the user experience. Just this 
quarter, we released an upgrade to our TV UI navigation that allows us
ers to 
be a little bit more specific in terms of the content that they are looking to 
browse through.
 
So imagine, it's Friday night, you what an engaging movie. You can tell us 
that, and then we will present the recommendations or suggestions that we 
have 
of some of our growing impressive film titles that you can really 
immerse yourself into. And that's just one of a line of multiple product 
updates that we anticipate having that we think will magnify that effect that 
Ted is talking about, about incredible 
content being discovered in the show 
and then becoming a big social phenomenon.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Bigger theme that maybe I wanted to talk about was alternative content. 
There was a partnership announced with Sirius XM. How you're thinking 
about new forms of c
ontent to be distributed on Netflix as you look out over 
the next couple of years? What are some of those things you think your 
consumer is asking for that reduces churn, gives you more pricing power, 
gives you higher ROI against some of the investments yo
u're making? We'd 
love to sort of tee that up broadly for the group.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, in the case of the Sirius XM that is a 

 
looking for a kind of a marketing 
synergy for a stand
-
up comedy initiative being able to have bites of our 
stand
-
up 
comedy specials that are otherwise only available on Netflix in their 
entire run as a way to entertain fans of stand
-
up comedy and discover new 
talent, and that's just some of the ongoing part of our overall initiatives.
 


 
it's a small test 
right now to see how that goes, putting up 
clips and interviews and interview shows featuring our talent and supporting 
our talent. So think about it as a different way of marketing, the existing 
program that we're doing when you're not on Netflix when you
're more likely 
on your car, when you shouldn't be on Netflix in your car.
 
Reed Hastings
 

those efforts. It's really around deepening the brand connection, which 
ultimately monetize
s as faster growth for us. So all of our auxiliary efforts 
are not around creating additional profit streams for now, they're really 
aimed around strengthening these mega titles because that's what drives 
the business. And a little bit incremental growth i
s much more profitable for 
us than creating separate businesses. So we're always evaluating them on, 
do they help the core? Did they help that love of the new stand
-
ups?
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe continuing to move through some of the costs in the business model
, 
marketing has been heavily debated topic with investors as we've gone 
through the last year. Saw a pretty big change from the 

 
over 90% growth 
in marketing you saw in Q2 to something much lower in Q3, I think prior 

marketing would be sort of in a 
tested learn mode this year, maybe pivoting away from just fewer subscriber 
acquisition.
 
So a couple questions; number one, what have you learned in some of the 
changes you made in marketing this year? And how do you think t
hat might 
inform how you go to market as a company going forward both for 
subscriber growth and then support on the content side?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Ted, do you want to take that?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

along. 
There was a time when we didn't market any of our content. We spent all of 
our marketing effort just talking about Netflix and how to use it. And today, 
we find is that selling house of cards in its final season is really all about 
selling Netflix.
 
So what we're learning more and more is that, yes, we can drive some 
viewing up and down. Yes, we could drive, but that's all mostly centered 

because it's a great thing for Netflix 
and how to sell the service.
 
So that gives us 

 
and we do it over many titles because people's tastes are 
very different. And being able to aggregate people to talk about the same 
things and watch the same things at roughly the same time has got a lot of 
v

 
Spencer Wang
 
And Eric just sort of on the financial aspect of the marketing spend, some of 
that as we call that on the letter was sort of timing related and shifted a bit 
into Q4, so that's sort of 

any sort of specific change in the strategy.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
And that would lead to maybe my next question, so Spencer, teed that one 
up for me. Thinking about the pace and cadence of investments in Q3 versu
s 
Q4, I thought there were some key learnings in the letter, but just want to 
give a little bit of an opportunity to frame what might have shifted out of Q3 
and into Q4? How investors should think about that again some of the 
longer
-
term investments you're
 
trying to make in the business?
 
David Wells
 

quarterly progression. I think we're balancing the steady growth of operating 
margin but allowing the business to have the flexibility to choose sort of 
optimal release timing an
d promotional timing and create that flexibility for 
them. So yes, next year, we see a little bit more steadier progression 
towards the 13% target that we have for the year, but I think we'll see some 
natural seasonality in terms of release, content releas
es and maybe that's a 
pitch to Ted now to take the next part.
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Yes. We've really been trying to optimize and when is the best time for the 
content creators and for the fans to release that content and sometimes 
they're regulated by outside forc
es and other times are just trying to line up 
that perfect viewing time. And they're trying to lead with that. We end up 
with very happy members and very happy creators.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Following up on that, the comment from the letter about less quarterly 
v
ariance, is that then just purely a function mostly of smoothed out 
marketing spend and I thought that you are such a scale of content that it 

actively to sort of create less seasonal
ity or less volatility in the cost 
structure of the companies as you look out into 2019 versus 2018?
 
David Wells
 

structure. We're just planning a little bit more in terms of the 
content and 
the associated promotion that goes with that, but it's a bit of a balance. We 
don't want to go too far with this either because we again want to create 
that flexibility for the business, right. We're not optimizing for marginal 
margin progressi
on by quarter, where optimizing for rolling 12
-
month 
growth of operating margin. But we're just indicating this year is a little bit 
unusual. We don't see as much pronounced lumpiness next year as we do 
this year.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
And maybe just one more on t
his probably for you, David, the 13% plus or 
minus keeps up with sort of the pace you guys have talked about over the 
last couple of years around 200 million to 300 basis points of margin 
expansion on a rolling forward basis. What are some of the things th
at could 
cause that number to arc upward or downward that you think people should 
keep in the front of their mind as the business continues to take investments 
you want?
 
David Wells
 
The biggest one is foreign exchange in terms of yes, on a 
mid
-
terms to 
longer
-
term, basis we use pricing to offset negative foreign exchange or 
dollar appreciation. But in the short
-
term, we don't immediately do that and 
so we can go through a couple quarters where you're seeing foreign 
exchange affect both just 
like this quarter, where we had it affect 
international ASP. But on a mid
-
 
to long
-
term basis, that's should even out 
as we use pricing. So foreign exchange is the big one. And then growth 

 
if 
we have more to growth than we expected, that's going to drive
 
more 
revenue and we'll get more of that in the back half of the year, but that 

 
Reed Hastings
 
If you think of our content cost as pretty big there's a little bit of flexibility 
quarter
-
to
-
quarter, but not much. The marketing kind o
f has flexibility, but 
you really want to launch the title. So it follows the content schedule and 

topline factors between FX and revenue growth, the cost structures, pretty 
stable
 
for next year.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
So following up on that Reed and maybe for anyone who wanted to take it, 
you talked a little bit off free cash flow in the letter, the lower end of the 
range, loss about $3 billion this year and then possibly replicating that 
a loss 
around $3 billion next year. One of the questions that came in to me in a 
variety of different forms was trying to size out either max free cash flow 
burn and where some of the variables in the model that people should be 
focused on and max leverage
 
that you be willing to take up in the business 
as you take out over the medium
-
 
to long
-
term as well.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Eric, you're using the word loss and I think you mean investment. We 
definitely hope that they're not turning into losses. A track record w
ould 
show that those investments have turned out to be very successful for us. 

 
David Wells
 
Reed took the immediate one that I was going to take, but so thanks on 
that. Yes, we're seeing those investments drive a lot
 
of growth. So there's a 
little bit of attention to that from us. Eric, the biggest thing is that we're 
approaching 

 
Netflix is approaching a point where the growth in operating 
profit is going to grow faster than our growth in content cash spend.
 
And tha
t's really going to drive the free cash flow towards improvement. It 
will eventually breakeven. I think what we said in the letter is flat with this 
year, and mainly that's because 12 to 18 months ago, we probably would 
have expected a little bit of a stee
per peak and then a reduction, which 
happened is content timing is kind of shifted back, we're growing faster so 
we're investing some more of that into content and so you get sort of a 
flattening of the trend forward.
 
But we expect material improvements in
 
2020. We still think it's going to be 
a few years towards breakeven because we're optimizing again for long
-
term 
cash flow and long
-
term profitability, and we think that's the right thing.
 
And then in terms of peak leverage, I think what you're going to s
ee is, at 
least electively funding our content that leverage ratio is going to start to 
improve, but we're also looking at optimal weighted average cost of capital, 
which we've already discussed and indicated that would be based on about a 
20%, 25% leverag
e to market cap ratios where we think the long
-
term 
optimal cost of capital ought to be, and so once we pushed past the point 
where we're more secure and it's less about funding the immediate working 
capital needs of the business will turn over a shift to 
thinking about long
-
term optimal cost of capital.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
One of the key themes in the shareholder letter was you bucketed three 
different forms of content, number one and number two were licensed and 
number three clearly was original owned and opera
ted with a theme I 
thought of preference for bucket three to be the driver for the business over 
the medium to long
-
term.
 
As you do think about some of your partners maybe pulling content off the 
platform in 2019 that's been talked a lot of publicly. How d
o you think about 
either replacing that content from a volume standpoint or just redoubling 
your efforts around marketing and increasing ROI around existing content 
and scaling against your own original content plans are rather than thinking 
about those li
cense buckets?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

our original programming, what we turned out is that our own original shows 
tend to be more valuable than licensing someone else's shows and later 
windows and the kind of shared window model versus that purely original 
model.
 
So when we invest in original show, we find that we're having a better 
payback its terms of people watching and appreciating Netflix and valuing 
their subscription, so that's wh
y we're leaning in that way.
 
We have a variety of models in which we used to get content, so really what 
we want to do is focus on what is the best programming, so we get to be a 
little business model agnostic about if we don't own the IP then we want to 
f
igure out how to make that deal with the people who do.
 
In some cases they produce that for us in the first window. In some case 
they produce that for their own networks and we license it in the second 
window and that will continue. But we are pointing out
 
in the letter is as has 
been a big 

 
we are driving a lot of programming to our owned and 
produced originals that we're producing in
-
house, some of our biggest 
brands like Stranger things, our owned and produced in
-
house and we're still 
licensing a lot of
 
original programming from our partners as well.
 
In terms of backfilling things that are coming off the site, one of the better 
examples we think of how it could work well for us has been in our 
unscripted initiative, which last year we had no unscripted o
riginal 
programming on Netflix and this year about half of our weighted watching of 
unscripted programming are Netflix originals, and therefore, the benefits of 

 
and about the same cash outlay, but with much more efficiency, meaning 
people are watching th
em in greater numbers for the same dollar spent.
 
So and with that we have much steadier access to programming, we're 
building brands that people associate with Netflix like Queer Eye and Fastest 
Car and Nailed It! and Sugar Rush. These are all the shows th
at people 
really love an enormous numbers around the world and we don't have to go 
through the gun to your head renegotiation every couple years from them.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Ted, you had some good examples before per region like Bodyguard and 
Sherlock. So mayb
e you can...?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
We announced yesterday our co
-
production on Sherlock. I'm sorry, not 
Sherlock, Dracula, from the makers of Sherlock with Steve Moffat. We would 
love to make more and more content with Steve Moffat. His deal is with the 
BBC and we
 
get to be partners with them to make this great show Dracula 
available around the world and in a fast follow model in the UK.
 
And we'll do a lot more of that. Bodyguard is coming up in a few weeks and 
it's been a tremendous hit in the UK. And we came in v
ery early on that 
financially and creatively, and we think they've made a much bigger and 
better show because of it, and we think we could be great partners with local 
public broadcasters and networks around the world.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe 
following up on that because that's both a local as well as a global 
content sort of comment. How do you think about the ROI of local content 
and what it can do when it goes global and act as stimulant for the platform 
in a much broader framework and maybe
 
it was originally planned for?
 
Ted Sarandos
 

shows have been incredibly relevant in their home country and then they 
work very well in their region, and then when they really connect,
 
they play 
multiregional and sometimes completely global. And we have enough 
subscribers in the different territories today that we can have a real global 
hit without much viewing in the U.S. or with a lot of viewing in Latin America 
and the U.S., but not 
in Europe.
 
So we're seeing a lot of those things that are benefit of scale obviously, but 
also picking great storytellers who tell stories that people want to hear 
around the world. And what we have found is that a good story well told 
works and it works i
n almost any language. So as long as we focus on the 
quality of production, those shows can be worked to drive local subscribers 
in country, but also drive global viewing when we do it right.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe one more follow
-
up on the content side for y
ou Ted, the film side, 
obviously been a big push for the company, there's now been multiple 
efforts that have gone out to the marketplace. What have you learned? What 
are some of the friction points you're still trying to solve for in terms of both 
go
-
to
-
m
arket and partnering with the right content creators on the film side, 
and how do you think about what that does for the platform again medium 
to long
-
term?
 
Ted Sarandos
 
Well, we've been thrilled just recently and we're releasing original films on 
Netflix 
from really A
-
list Directors like Alfonso Cuaron and Susanne Bier, the 
Coen Brothers, Tamara Jenkins, and these are film people who made movies 
directly just to the theater their entire careers and are now moving to 
producing more and more for Netflix, bec
ause what they're finding is to your 
point earlier they want their content to be seen. They want their film to be in 
the discussion and they're able to do that on Netflix in ways I've never seen 
before.
 
Paul Greengrass film 22 July just came out a few days
 
ago and millions of 
people are enjoying it all over the world and ways that he's never 
experienced for his films yet. And that'll roll into 2019 with big new films 
from Michael Bay and Martin Scorsese and we're finding is that people want 
their audience 

 
their films to find an audience and that they're in a better 
position to do that with us than without us, and that's a really exciting 
position to be in for film lovers.
 
Eric Sheridan
 
Maybe pivoting back to the product side of the equation, you've talked 
a lot 
in the last couple of calls about getting mobile right not only short
-
term, but 
as a stimulant for long
-
term growth. Reed referenced earlier there's a lot of 
people that want to consume content especially mobile
-
first as you think 
globally. What are 
some of those product developments we should be 
looking for that you are hearing that from consumers would either increased 

you think about where mobile viewing of media content gl
obally will go over 
the long
-
term.
 
Greg Peters
 
Yes, I think we see an opportunity to improve almost every aspect of that 
product experience, but I'll just throw out a couple interesting ones. One is 
as a method of acquisition, and again it's very consisten

talked about in terms of extending the partnerships, the kind of partnerships 
we have with mobile operators, whether that's a bundle model, like we just 
did our first bundle in Japan with mobile operator KDDI. We've done a bunch 
of preloa
ds with the Verizon or Android phones in the United States.
 
So in just all these different ways, which we can use that as a vehicle to 
bring more subscribers on to the service, but it's also a great sort of 
subscriber experience component of it too, which 
is something that we're 
exploring more and more as not only just a direct content enjoyment part of 
the experience, but things like previews and teasers and what's coming now 
and how can we sort of create a continuum of experience, which is not only 
that g
reat directly engage moment when you're watching that show you've 
been dying to watch.
 
But also things that sort of lead up to that which maybe don't take 30 or 45 
minute viewing session, but can you get five minutes you're waiting in line 
and you can catc
h a preview a show that you are excited to watch, maybe 
you watch that when you get home later tonight, and that's the kind of 
experience I think we really can invest and see good returns from in years to 
come.
 
Spencer Wang
 
Eric, I think we have time for o
ne last question please.
 
Eric Sheridan
 

think you've seen other technology platforms like 

 
some of the other 
companies I cover diversify more as they become more mature, enter new 
ar
eas. Netflix's team fairly focused on streaming media and pushing your 
message globally about adoption and creation of content, how do you think 
about staying focused on the business model you have today versus looking 
for areas for diversification as you 
go globally that can be put on top of the 
business model, especially the brand awareness and the technology platform 
you've built as you look out globally over the long
-
term?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, I think about it, if you've got five to 10 years more growth i
n your 
current market, you're probably optimizing value to stay in your current 
market and strengthen. Eventually, your market may not be able to hold 

DVD forever.
 
Of course, we diver
sified in a streaming, so we're open to those possibilities. 

entertainment. So we're just going to focus on that for a very long time. 
Unfortunately lots of other companies are also focus
ing on that, but that's 
going to make it exciting for us for the next few years, great for consumers, 
incredible for producers. I mean there's never been so much TV and movies 
being created around the world.
 
And so the game is on. We're super excited about
 
pleasing consumers as 
much as we possibly can. And someday, many, many years from now, we 

title brands. And when you look at the content, we have coming out this 
quarter and next
 
year, we couldn't be more excited, we couldn't be more 
busy.

Question

and
-
Answer Session
 
Ellie Mertz
 

r
eceived them this afternoon via e
-
mail. First topic, questions on the 
domestic streaming. To what extent would you attribute the growth in 
subscribers to mobile, particularly tablet adoption? How much of usage is 
over mobile devices, same question for conn
ected television.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Both the rise of tablets and phones and the rise of smart TVs are very 
helpful to us and they are really the beginning of a trend around Internet
-
connected ecosystems with devices. And certainly, the more convenient 
those de
vices get, the more people will be comfortable watching and 
enjoying content on a wide range of devices, someday including Google 
glasses, Internet watches all kinds of scenarios over the next five years and 
as well as a multi
-
screen scenarios where you us
e your tablets or phone to 
choose content on your TV. So, what we will see over the next couple of 
years, and we saw in this fall also was more and more consumer adoption of 
Internet
-
connected streamings which on both tablets and smart TVs.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Wha
t is the percentage likelihood that you increase the price of your 
streaming plan over the next 12 months or even over the next 24 months?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We are happy with $7.99 and not speculating on the future.
 
Ellie Mertz
 

 
in both voluntary and involuntary 
retentions. can you give us some color on where churn levels are relative to 
historical numbers? Are you back to pre
-
fall 2011 levels?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
going to focus on that comparative reference, but what we are doing is 


fundamental though is not to fo

really want to make it easy to quit. I know that sounds strange, but we 

and that makes you much more likely to come back in. And we t

the right way to build a long
-
term growth in paid ads but it does result in 
easy access.
 
David Wells
 
And I would say that regionally it continues to be a very strong channel for 

Q3, Q4, all 
the way through the quarter, and as a function of that, people flowing in and 


their lifestyl
e warrants signing up again.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How much confidence do you usually have at this point, going into Q1 
relative to other quarters, given all of the sub
-
ads that come in early 
January from holiday devices?
 
Reed Hastings
 

her quarters in terms of percentage of the 

-
F, but it is not hugely 
material.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
And then moving to questions about content, first, question is on the Disney 
deal. You made a bold and expensive move wit
h your output deal with 
Disney. Presumably, the magnitude of the Disney deal will result in 
your
 
devoting less content dollar repurchase elsewhere, even accounting for 
subscriber growth. What types of content are likely to be sacrificed as a 
result?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, the way pay one deals work is you pay for some and so the flow in 
2016 as it hit in the second half of 2016 are relatively small in total 



then, in terms of what generates the most viewing and satisfaction and a lot 
of flexibility to build the best service that we can by that point.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What changed the attractiveness of the Disney
 
content, which last year only 
accounted for 2% of your streaming hours, was it fully the ability to be 
exclusive? Was it the Lucasfilm acquisition?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It is pretty amazing that the Disney content, but it was on our service from 
Starz was only 2
%, and it just shows you how much incredible great content 
that we have that content as good as the Disney content could only be 2%. 
And going forward, in addition to the straight Disney content where the 
Disney Marvel content and the Lucasfilm. So it will
 
be bigger than it would 
have otherwise. But the rest of our content is growing. The big thing what 


mor
e interested in exclusive content until it hits that point of differentiation 

exclusivity allows us to have a differentiation in the long
-
term.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How are the terms and condit
ions of exclusive pay one deals such as the 
recent Disney deal similar to or different from typical content deals?
 
David Wells
 

deals like the Disney deal and other output style dea
ls tend to be more cash 
intensive upfront, but other than that are not remarkable anywhere.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And pay per film based upon the box
-
office performance.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Are there any material holes in your content library? So in terms of studios 
and c
ategories, do you feel you need to have?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I would say, not more than holes. There is vast amounts of additional 
contents that we want to acquire as we grow and the virtual cycle for us is 
to gain more subscribers and get more content, gain mor
e subscribers, get 
more content and what propels our growth is that continuing content. 


general, as we g

consumers.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Netflix described its library in terms of free groupings, movies, serialized TV 
and proprietary contents. The first two buckets are extremely large 
compared to proprietary conte
nts. Should we expect a large proprietary 
content that launches in the future? Does your hierarchy suggest that 

and serialized TV?
 
Reed Hastings
 

ietary original content. You will know a lot 


that point may make decisions about how much we want to invest
 
in it, do 
we want to increase the investment, keep it about the same to last and we 

months just focus on the current originals.
 
David Wells
 

fore this before, but which was 
articulating again, the bar on the originals in fact, it performs in similar to 
other third
-
party licensed content that is exclusive.
 
If the originals are 
exclusive for us than they are, we would look to do that better insid
e, if we 

PR effects that we get from it and those are very, very interactive. but that 
comes from the exclusivity as well.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
These are more questions on originals. this ye
ar you will have four new 
original series on Netflix plus Lilyhammer. What are your plans for 2014? 
Presumably, we have some idea now, given the long lead times on original 
programs. What percent of content cost do you envision for original 
programing next
 
year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Again, we have made the decisions for next year in terms of what percent of 

viewing and overall press attention, subscriber acquisition trends all of the 
factors before making those decisions.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Have you planned to market House of Cards? What is your approach to 
marketing the show different from how traditional cable networks market 
their shows? Do you envision creating a section for highlight ori
ginal 
programing within the Netflix service over time?
 
Reed Hastings
 

night tune in. We get to let people know about the show and they can watch 
it anytime at their leisure. And so 

our marketing and much, much focused on a specific date and time.
 

service by targeting the specific online ads on the service, the content fo
r 
the people who will be relevant for. so we get tremendous viewing from our 

attention in certain cities doing a highly concentrated, large scale promotion 
to be able to see what t
he effects of ours to stimulate the creative 
community awareness and generally build a lot of buzz around those shows. 

 
Ellie Mertz
 

spe
cific rights Netflix owns and the monetization strategies of the other right 
holders, which monetization channels, if any, does Netflix view as most 
complementary to its streaming business over time?
 
Reed Hastings
 

ed over time. If you look at HBO, 
they experimented and have had great success with DVD as a channel for 
their content. They did some syndication, but then they pulled back on some 

w
hat makes sense. The current originals mostly where our first window 
licenser and for example, on House of Cards, Media Rights Capital owns the 

different structures as we go forward
, but primarily a focus on monetization 
on our platform.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You said that Arrested Development could bump subscriber growth in Q2. 
can you point to any data
 
that supports this view? Expressions of interest by 
network subscribers, surveys that poin
t to interest or anything like that? 
How would you compare interest in Arrested Development to interest in 
other originals queued up this year, like House of Cards and Hemlock Grove.
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
In the case of Hemlock Grove, 

like House of Cards, and the same with Orange is the New Black. So that will 


-
loaded in its 
overall vie
wing and attention.
 


particularly built into our forecast. And then we will see what happens in Q2. 


 
be able to project going forward.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A question on accounting for originals. Over what period of time are you 
amortizing the upfront cash spend on important originals this year, 
particularly Arrested Developm
ent and House of Cards?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well the accounting for originals is similar to or is consistently the 
accounting for our whole library, which means we amortize in straight line 
over the license period. I would say, the question was asked about 
amort

that full title. And so when we have quarters like Q4 and you talked about 

deal, heavy upfront payments, eve
n upwards of 50% and then that content 



s as we go 
through the year and the expense starts to catch up.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
As you look at original Netflix content, what are your expectations or how it 
will perform in the U.S. and International market?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Very strong.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How do you d
ecide which original programming to invest in and stream? Do 
you look to reach certain segments of your sub
-
base or best available 
programming or other factors?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 
Ted 
Sarandos ha
s done a great job on different types of content; Hemlock Grove 



early for us to have any great 

program step
-
by
-
step.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A few questions on competition. Do consumers need to choose between 

to HBO and Netflix along 
the lines of baseball and football. Do you feel that way about Amazon too? 
As Netflix and Amazon both have exclusive content and original content, will 
it make sense for consumers to have both rather than choose between 
them? Do yo
u think the two services will take on different identities and be 
the two leading digital cable networks in the future?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, some of this is already happened in the UK, where LOVEFiLM, Sky, TV 
NOW and Netflix has nearly no 
overlapping content. And as the press tone is 

different channels, basically to surveys someone totally. of course, not 
everybody has infinite budgets ready, but his budget is tight as
 
real 
competition for choosing us, if you need to choose. But I do think that many 
people will choose to get multiple services like we compete with HBO, that is 

attention. But not have 
the same content.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you help us understand the methodology behind the top 200 title 
comparative analysis? Do you use ratings, actual viewings et cetera?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We used actual viewing hours and again, in Q4 on our Netflix service in 
U.S., 
those would be for each title in there, not just a season, but a title of an 

the methodology behind that?
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions on international. on previous calls, 
Reed has stated his 
intentions to continue to re
-
invest in international expansions or once to get 
back to profitability. Can you update us on your current thinking on this 
topic?
 
David Wells
 
I can reiterate what we said last quarter, which was these two g
ating items 

that we continue to demonstrate even with the modest launch in Q4, and the 

investments. So th
ose two conditions still hold.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Two quarters ago, Reed spoke about raising the content spending in the UK. 
Give a sense where the extended offerings in the UK have impacted 
subscriber growth or churn in any meaningful way?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah, ab

our territories in Canada, Latin America and the different nations in Europe 
to expand the content and expanding the content has definitely increased 
viewing, decreased this churn, made
 

ambitious to get more and more content on all of the services including the 
UK.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Has the competitive environment in the UK evolved over time? In the UK, 
are you seeing different levels of net ad, churns et c
etera given potentially 
more competitive environment?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The only change in the UK, and welcomes in there from our launch at the 


s active marketing going on 
between us. As far as we can tell, both services are doing well also. It comes 
back to us; it may not end up as some game, we want to get the biggest 
piece of the pie. But it may be that people subscribe to multiple services.
 
El
lie Mertz
 
Can you tell us if the procurement changes made in Latin America had a 
material impact on sub
-

 
Reed Hastings
 

got projects
 
to go.
 
David Wells
 
That was an incremental improvement.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What penetration of sublevels that you need in any given country in the 
Europe or Latin America to reach break
-
even, roughly what is the time to 
achieving that now?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It will 



-
even at 
lower overall household penetrations, 
because the Internet is at lower 
penetrations. So I would say each market is unique in this way.
 
Ellie Mertz
 

-
base 
2x to 3x out of HBO long
-
term. what are your expectations in the variou
s 
international markets that you have entered?
 
Reed Hastings
 

or broadband household penetration levels as we can in the U.S., but until 


it. So in principal, when we look at Internet usage or YouTube usage or 

these societies. so the notion that over 10 or 20 yea
rs, Internet TV is that 

 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you achieve long
-
term international contribution margins equivalent to 
U.S. without the same amount of scale in the single
-
digit?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah, I
 
think we would need the same amount of 

 
the contribution margin 

fairly competition, I mean I would just add, add
-
in competition. So those 
two things are the primary determin
ants of long
-
term margin.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You expect more modest quarter
-
over
-
quarter improvements in international 
losses beyond Q1? is that because of lower sub
-
ad expectation or an 
increase in spending relative to sub
-
growth?
 
Reed Hastings
 
A little bit of b
oth.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
And a question on the DVD business; you appear to be marketing DVD 
subscriptions to streaming only subscribers again. But now we see more e
-
mail promotions, offering a free month trial to the DVD program. You really 
want to push people bac

given your intense focus on streaming being the future of media 
consumption?
 
David Wells
 
I would say, this is David here. I would say it was a program that we did 
around the holidays and into January. I t


positive to our DVD subscription. And we gave a lot of credit to them, 12 to 

of the sales search opportunities on the DVD, on the website and so forth. 

-
mail programming 

test a lot of this, and usually when w

incrementally positive.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So a question on Open Connect. could Super HD and 3D streaming 
periodically be expanded to ISPs without Open Connect, without significant 
engineering investment? Ask another way, is Op
en Connect a prerequisite 
for technical reasons or more for strategic reasons?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 
available on 
iPhone 5, say 
or something like that. It both get people to adopt to new 
platform and allows you from an engineering side to concentrate on a 
simpler use case and being able to support on Super HD and 3D is 

t 
anticipate much of a problem. and I think what we find is by doing that we 
can be more efficient not going through middlemen?
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A question on change in delivery cost. Did Open Connect drive delivery cost 
down in Q1, or should it in Q4 or is it 
better pricing from suppliers?
 
Reed Hastings
 

say that our Open Connect program has investments that are front
-
loaded. 


little bit of expenses that are loaded into Q4 and into 2013, depending upon 
the pace of our rollout and that those flow should moderate going forward. I 
think the question is in reference to letter, we said that our U.S. contribution 
marg
inally better, because of just some delayed expenses that will show up 
and relative to planning in Q1 and Q4.
 
David Wells
 
Thank you the clarification. Yeah, some timing allowance expenses for Q4.
 
Reed Hastings
 

ively small percentage of our 

 
Ellie Mertz
 

media integration in international market? could you provide some c
ommon 
examples of how Netflix uses social media in international markets? how do 
you expect social integration to impact your U.S. business?
 
Reed Hastings
 

been huge for us 

of the group within each country that loves social and they are really into on 



aspect. And of course, over time, those ratios will shift. But for now, all of 
our social work really caters to a little specific, typically younger, but very 



to make progress on this front.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Some questions on the financials. how should we be thinking about 2013 in 
terms of profitability and margins, similar to
 
2012 as a heavy investment 

 
Reed Hastings
 

back half of the year on international expansions. Obviously, tha
t will matter 
as well.
 
David Wells
 
And we probably have 7 million reasons not to give full
-
year guidance right 

 
Ellie Mertz
 
We might also make a point that we thought, considering the leveraging in 
the model in 201
2, $106 million segment where we saw 700 basis points of 
margin expansion.
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Ellie Mertz
 
As profits overall are somewhat exceeding guidance, do you think you might 
increase investments 
in marketing, content and your additional country 
rollouts in the near to medium term?
 
Reed Hastings
 

good about those plans.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You talked about the goal of 100 basi
s points of contribution margin 


long
-
term i.e., multiple years out, domestic streaming contribution ma
rgins?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It will be a function of competition and how much of the market, the total 

target of expanding that routinely by growing faster basically in our content, 
but ex
panding our content expense.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So this is the size of the off balance sheet content liabilities.
 
Reed Hastings
 
So I think the question usually I get on is related to the contractual 
obligation table. The streaming obligations were $5 billion as o
f $930 million 
as of the end of Q3. That corresponds to a $5.6 billion number as of the end 

on the balance sheet.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Do you expect to be free cash flow positive for th
e full year?
 
Reed Hastings
 

-
year guidance on that.
 
David Wells
 
Can you give a sense of how much money you plan to raise in the debt 
offerings? Did you consider you being soft, with the potential new debt 
financing be straight debt or 
could it be convertible debt. When would it 
occur?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The no on stock, no on covert, I think the plans that we put in there are still 

year low that we see in the 

-
cost long
-

 
David Wells
 
Will additional financing be needed if you decide to open new international 
markets in like 2013 or early 2014?
 
Reed Ha
stings
 
No.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
The marketing cost in the Netflix streaming has fallen 24% year
-
over
-
year. 


in mar
keting?
 
David Wells
 
Very sustainable on the Q4 marketing spend and the second part of that, 
late efficiency; the late efficiency comes because most marketing is on 

And as we hav
e more and more members and as they are happier and 

much paid marketing.
 
Reed Hastings
 
I would say also 

 

expense and that ha
s benefits in terms of getting people excited about the 
sign of retaining better, all of that is a quasi marketing expenditure. So the 
rest are developmental marketing expense or content expense.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Will the company break out cost of subscriptions
 
versus fulfillment expenses 
for the quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not likely. Fulfillment has grown to be a pretty relatively small portion of our 
cost of revenues as our DVD business continues to scale down with small 
portion of content revenue.

And then one follow
-
up question, in terms of the content requirements or 
likes, the wants of your subscriber base, have you seen a noticeable change 
in the satisfaction level of your subscribers wi
th current content or do you 
still see 

 
there's always been a gap, but do you think that that gap has kind 
of narrowed a little bit over the course of the last three to six months?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah, that would be mostly what drives the 
improvement in voluntary 

for the user experience, how quickly and easy it is to chose, how well the 
personalization works, how well the streaming works. So, that all comes 
tog
ether and gives them the satisfaction.
 
David Wells
 
And Mark, I would say that the other contributor to that is people two to 
three years ago, when they first experienced a streaming offering had 
expectations of a DVD full content library. I would say those
 
people are 

channel and in an Internet network, offering like we have. So the 
expectations gap might be narrowing as well.

Great, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about content 
costs, sort o
f the outlook for 2013, if you could give us some sense of how 

did from 2011 to 2012. And then just secondly, can you give us more detail 
on how you improved that involuntary rete
ntion? You mentioned processing 
payments and recovery members better, so if you could give us more color 
there? Thanks.
 
David Wells
 
Yes, Doug. In terms of content cost, we continue to expand our content 
libraries and we expect that to continue to increase.
 

slower than revenue. So from that, you can infer that the year
-
over
-
year 
increase for 2013 would be less than the increase that we saw in 2012. And 
then the second piece of that question was around, how we improved the 
involuntary r
etention numbers and that we drew looking at a number of 
optimization in terms of how we handle folks that go on payment hold.

Hi, thanks. Reed, now that the U.S. business has gotten back to this level of 
strong growth, I was just wondering if you could revisit that U.S. market 
opportunity, how you're thinking about it, that $60 million to $90 million 
figure and the po
ints of friction that you're facing from here to grow that 
U.S. sub
-
base to a much larger level?
 
And then secondly for David, in the 1Q guide, I think you noted that you're 
not specifically attributing any subs to Arrested Development, but is that 
also the
 
same thing for House of Cards? Is there no specific attribution for 
House of Cards in 1Q? And are you planning any specific TV spend for either 
of those two shows? Thanks.
 
Reed Hastings
 

llion 
domestic now. So the question is do we have good enough content to say, 
get to $40 million. And then with that incremental content budget, can we 
improve the content, such that with that incrementally better service, we 
can get to $50 million. And th
en similarly, we got more money we can spend 
on more content.
 


numbers over last year, they doubled from
 
1.5 million to 3 million 
subscribers. So people around the world are interested in Internet television 


 
And 


tremendous, right now on iPhone 5. So if you think about 6 or 8 years from 

 
and how incredible will that be 
for not only viewing video, but maybe controlling video around all of your 
house and choosing and how immersive and all of that helps Internet video 
services like our own. So those are three big factors, the content growth 
as 
we grow, the general trend towards Internet TV and the consumer 
electronics ecosystem.
 
David Wells
 
And then Scott, on your second set of questions on House of Cards, we think 


 
over


those would be but overall pretty small benefit we think to subscriber 
editions. And then TV spend for House o
f Cards, there will be some media 
spends likely very little TV, like focus again on sort of influences in big 
markets.

about how you manage your working capital and swing that are logging from 

d of wondering if 

of free cash flow, not necessarily quarter to quarter. But as you think about 
some of the leverage that you might have, for example perhaps deferred 
revenues and 

about that, just kind of managing it to the P&L expense as opposed to 
something that kind of gives you a little bit more control, granted that the

not quite clear on your question. But if we looked into 
alternative methods in terms of joint ventures and other vehicles to reduce 
that cash consumption upfront might be the only av
ailable method to 
assume that. We prefer the simplicity and we may get there sometime down 
the road. But in terms of the present course, overall the content spend on a 


umpy up in the first couple of quarters.

how you think about managing the risk of 
your original content in terms of showing that you actually collaborate with

party producers versus showed that you actually own outright? And 
how does that factor into your calculations of cost per viewing hours in 
terms of your commitment to either kinds of shows? Thank you.

Thanks. Two questions, the first on streaming content spend; given the 
current level of streaming content spe
nd after several years of large step 
ups; is there a normalized longer term rate of growth or range of growth of 
that we should be considering or will we potentially see lumpiness on a year

out basis, depended on available content? And then for Dav
id, as we 
think about a potential debt raise, is there a certain level of cash on the 

 
Reed Hastings
 
In terms of the lumpiness, I presume there will be some quarters where it 
got a little bit lumpy, whe
re we signed a big deal, but generally any big deal, 
we would know about several quarters in advance, so we would have that 
visibility to build in and to let everybody know, and then return to the kind 

eling our way along as 

the 100 basis points a quarter versus some specific operating model, 
because we want to get the operating model to be better and better and 
better. And to do
 
that, we have to really feel our way along and make sure 


 
David Wells
 
And John, on the cash as long as the cost 
are low, more cash is better, but I 
would say this is again as the opportunity presented by the debt market, 
and the ability to get really low cost long

term capital, and for us to preserve 
the flexibility, if we feel massive success with original to prese

T
hank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Carlos Kirjner with 
Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Thank you. I have two questions; one on content, one on the market 
potential. First on content, 
when you lost Starz you said that it accounted for 
a small portion of viewership time and benefit slots that really impact on 
customer acquisition churn et cetera, suggesting that no specific content 
deal has material impact on the customer metrics. If you
 

specific content deal, which will immediately impact on the metrics. How do 


for exclusivity or e
ven how do you think about investments in original 
content?
 
On the market potential, if you grow your content offer as you described a 
few minutes ago and succeed in getting 50 million or 60 million households 
in the U.S., how do you think the cable compan
ies would do which changed 
their broadband pricing levels or structure? Thank you.
 
Reed Hastings
 

increasing the content about propelling our growth, but when we lose 
content, we sa

any specific piece of content, I think if we lost enough content that would 
definitely decrease viewing. And similarly, when we increase content, we 
have to increase it by a lot to make a diff
erence, adding just one movie here 

The general view, we have is sometimes the content additions are so small, 
1% of viewing that we are not to see a big difference, but that will inc
rease, 
and if we do a lot of that that will help.
 
And then second on in terms if we get to 50 million or 60 million how does 
the relations with cable networks change. I think we always were building 

done for Breaking Bad in 
terms of building a bigger audience for viewing on AMC, and if you look at 

-
win, where we are incredibly good at the prior 
season. They have got the current season and they get bigger and bigger 
audiences
.
 
And then second, if it's off air like ADC's lost, then I think it's pure 
incremental money for them, the fact that we will have to monetize it down. 
So we don't see a huge conflict there in that licensing dynamics.

Reed, do you think there is a conflict potentially with the cable companies 
like Comcast and Time Warner Cable in COGS? If you increase your 
subscriber levels and using their price to transmit the bids for the year, and 
it could increase the prici
ng of cable broadband access??
 
Reed Hastings
 
The cable broadband is very profitable for them and the more that people 
want to do high definition Skype and high definition Netflix, it's inevitable 
that there is going to be new high speed packages that are m
ore successful 
for those ISPs. And so they have got an incredibly profitable great business 
moving data, and that's great for them. It doesn't conflict with us. In fact 
where we like high definition Skype are the critical applications that help 
them drive 
more adoption of the higher end packages, and in that way we 
work really well with them.

Hi. Do you guys believe that Amazon was in their bidding for the Disney 
content and what's your appetite for chasing down Sony Pay 1?

Tony we don't know on Disney Amazon and Sony Pay 1, our appetite f
rankly 

out. There is no specific piece of content that we must have, and that's just 
the bidding negotiation.

Nathaniel H. Schindler 

 
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Yes, thank you. So if you look at your net sub adds, and then estimate some 
growth sub 
add that you had coming in for the quarter. In domestic 
streaming, you said in the past of 30% of those or third roughly you touched 
within the last year in our returns, has that number changed, and could you 
think that longer than a year, how much of your
 
market, the total market 
have you touched at this point, do you believe over the course of your 
business?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It all depends on, Nat on how you count an entity. You count a household 
where you will make out and they try both under separate email
. Lots of 
people have multiple email addresses and several of them are willing to 
enter multiple credit cards to get multiple free trials. So there's no clean 
motion of that. We can tell you how many email addresses have we touched, 
but mapping that into p
eople and households is pretty tricky.
 
Nathaniel H. Schindler 

 
Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
 
Makes sense, thank you.

Yes. And Nat on your first question, it stayed roughly, about the same in

Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Daniel Ernst with Hudson 
Square. Please go ahead, your line is open.
 
Daniel Ernst 

 
Hudson Square Research, Inc.
 
Thanks. Good evening. Thanks for taking my call. Three 
questions if I might, 
first kind of big picture on, how you're looking at the business and growth. 
Profitability has been reasonably above expectations in the last couple of 
quarters, and guidance for the coming quarter? Historically you guys have 
tended t
o manage perhaps not making too much profits and always willing 
to invest in growth, and how you are thinking about that in terms of new 
market rollouts or acquiring new content to really continue separate 
yourselves from the competition sort of or on inve
sting on your product 
expectations versus growth investments?
 
And then secondly in a related comment, back in the day, eight, nine years 
ago, we use to kind of get market
-
by
-
market updates, you are at X percent 
penetration in San Francisco and we got the p
rofitability in X number of 
months, can you give us some sort of directional color like that on some of 
the international markets in Europe and maybe an update on Latin America 
there?
 
And then third sort of viewership question, I know people asked of this 
before generally and could use a lot of color. But what kind of is the mix of 
viewing between connected devices to the TV, the Xbox, and there is an 
Apple TV and DVD players and TVs that have Netflix built in versus tablets, 
and I think computers and how t
hat looks domestic versus international, 
where perhaps all those devices are less connected to TVs in Europe or Latin 
America? Some color on how that, mix in usages fits. Thanks.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Daniel, you started pretty awfully nicely about talking about g
rowth of above 
expectations last year, but I think you were obviously confused with the 
different companies, since last year was difficult on that front. But in 
general, we are pioneering this new service, Internet TV as are other firms, 
and from a macro l
evel there is a lot of great growth factors because 
Internet makes certain user experiences, much more enjoyable at lower 
cost, and Netflix is propelling our growth, and we are very excited about the 
growth.
 
In terms of penetration, in the DVD days, we wer
e operating in the San 
Francisco Bay Area for several years with local delivery, before we were 


terms of DV


that way.
 
Then finally, your question was on viewership, and some nations are more 
Smart TV centric, and some are 
more PS3 centric, and Xbox centric. But 
overall, you see a lot of similar trends, which are tablets, are growing 
somewhat in the absolute and somewhat at the replacement of laptops. 
Smart TVs are selling to people who want to use and Netflix is the most 
im
portant application on a Smart TV. Then all of the individual devices like 
an Apple TV are really cool and doing well. So, the whole internet getting to 
every screen is just a big secular story that's happening and benefitting us.

All right, thanks. Really, but just to clarify, we were talking about the last 
couple of quarters being profits above expectations, and your guidance there 
for the next quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yeah, Dan let me take a stab at that, in your
 
part A. In the past Netflix has 
been very good about thinking about that net incremental $1 million or $5 

in improving, our interface and our products. We continue to do th
at. We are 
never perfect in sort of finding out that optimal frontier point, but we still 
continue to think like that in terms of that additional investment whether it's 
better place in an existing market in a near market and product or in our 
content offe
ring in the Netflix or international

Question

and

Answer Session
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The first question is from Youssef Squali of Jeffries. How imp
ortant is 
exclusivity of content in Netflix when doing digital deals?
 
Reed Hastings
 

other buyers are exclusive and I am interested in non
-
exclusive content. But 
we end up doing e
xclusive sometimes basically to play with the way that 

core strategy. Over a sufficient number of years, it could become a core 

 
De
borah Crawford
 
Second question from Youssef. What is the percentage of the subscriber 
base that get Blu
-
ray today versus one year ago?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 

 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Mike Olson at Piper Jaffray. What are your 
thoughts on pricing? I realize you are in grabbing share mode, but I think 

y impacted by a $1 per 
months price increase. And you could argue that higher pricing would allow 
you to spend more on new content, thereby attracting new sets and 
reducing churn. How are you thinking about this?
 
Barry McCarthy
 

evious calls in response to questions about 
pricing we had frequently reminded our listeners that we are testing all the 
time and some of you (inaudible) price test in the marketplace currently. 
Obviously, the pricing in Canada is working off for us and ma
y be that will or 

continue to update our thinking about pricing.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Mark Mahaney at Citi Investment Research. Would 
you expect the relat
ively higher mix of TV show consumption via streaming 
versus via DVD to continue going forward or do you expect it to come down 
as you build out more movie selection? Is there something about streaming 
usage that tends to lend itself more to quick TV show 
consumption?
 
Reed Hastings
 

opposed to trying to guide that and so we are trying to get a broad selection 
of content both in movies and in TV shows. And currently, the subscribers 
(in
audible) in about equal proportion and the way we measure it is by 

 
not 
by stream starts or session starts, but by total minutes watched. So, movies 
get a little bit of an advantage in minutes watched because they are longer. 
But we are not trying to driv
e it one way or the other. We are just trying to 
build out a whole lot of content that our subscribers want to watch.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Second question from Mark Mahaney. Are there earlier indications that 
recent free subscribers convert to pay subscribers 
at the same rate as they 
have for you historically?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sorry, is the question, is the P1 conversion rate whole and constant with 
historical levels, answer to that question is yes.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Our next question is from Steve Frankel at Dough
erty & Company. You 
commented that the increase in free subscribers was a reflection of both 
faster U.S. growth and the initial push into Canada. Do you expect free subs 
to remain at these higher levels relative to the historical norm or will it 
normalize 
in the next quarter or two?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, it may normalize eventually, but particularly in 

 
Q4 tends to be 
seasonally 

 
see fast subscriber growth around the holidays, which tends to 
be back end loaded and Q1 tends to be front
-
end loaded. So for 
at least Q4, 
that trend likely continues.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question from Steve Frankel. Can you clarify for me what your current 
operating margin goals are and do you anticipate that expansion beyond 
North America in the back half of 2011 would at lea
st in early going drop 
operating margins materially below that level?
 
Barry McCarthy
 
Yes, you can infer from our guidance forecast for Q4 based on the mid
-
point 
of earnings that the operating margin come in pretty roughly 12.5%, so 
slightly higher than the
 

commentary you know that for 2011 we are guiding towards a 12% on the 
North American business and that we 

 
if we continue to track in Canada on 
the current trend line to move towards additional investments inte
rnationally 
and in his commentary Reed spoke about a $50 million investment to 
support that expansion.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
One final question from Steve Frankel. Reed commented that the company 
spends $500 million per year in postage. This is down from the $6
00 million 
figure the company has mentioned in the past. Has the increase in 
streaming already scaled back the postal expense by that amount?
 
Reed Hastings
 

so my comments in to

 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Nat Schindler, BofA
-
Merrill Lynch. Several years ago 
when the two
-
out
-
at
-
a
-
time option was your most popular, you said that the 
average user rented about five DVDs per month on avera
ge. Now, with the 
one
-
out
-
a
-
time option becoming dominant, where has this number gone?
 
Also, have you seen a change to the average DVDs rented by customers as 
you add additional streaming content?
 
Barry McCarthy
 

 
for quite some time reported on 

have been two principal drivers, one, of course, is the mix change in the 
business with the increased popularity of one unlimited subscribers. And
, 
secondly, it has been the growth in streaming and the substitution behavior. 

unlimited, one unlimited plan, if you looked at usage year over year for just 
DVD, you would see 
a decrease on average for paying subs.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next questions are from Ryan Hunter at Wedge Partners. First, can you talk 
about the penetration rate for the Wii?
 
Reed Hastings
 



-
centric than the more 

 
Deborah Crawford
 
The second question, what is the subscriber count for Canada?
 
Reed Hastings
 
On Canada, we 
are not releasing subscriber count, but I can tell you our 

of our numbers and we are on track to be profitable in Canada late next 
year. So, really just a super performance living up
 
to our high expectations.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Jason Cheu at ABR Investment Strategy. Would 
you be willing to offer some color on the video game console opportunity? 

the next 
subscriber opportunity for Netflix? How often can you market to that install 
base and what have been the net subscriber yield?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Jason, most subscribers watch content on a multiplicity of devices, they will 
watch on their PCs, they wil
l also watch on an iPhone, they will watch on a 

influenced by a single device, especially with multiple TVs in household. 
There will be a Blu
-
ray player in on room that runs Netflix
 
and a video game 
console in another. That being said, to answer your question on marketing 
opportunities with both PS3 and Xbox we advertise on the screen in various 

get dir
ected to sign up right there on the screen.
 
He had one additional question. Are you experiencing an acceleration in net 
sub adds from consoles that now that no disk is required?
 
Reed Hastings
 
That only 

 
the no disk requirement is only lifted three 
four days ago, so we 

that next quarter.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next couple of questions are from George Askew at Stifel Nicolaus. The 
streaming
-
only test in the U.S. offers a strea
ming
-
only plan for $7.99 per 
month and a streaming plus DVD plan at $9.99 per month. Other than price, 
is there a difference between the $9.99 plan you are testing and the existing 
$8.99 streaming plus DVD plan?
 
Also, if you launch the streaming only servi
ce, does that mean the $8.99 
price plan will go away?
 
Reed Hastings
 

$7.99, the $9.99, various 

 
and to answer your precise question, the $9.99 
in that test sell is the same as $8.9
9 today.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Second question from George Askew. An important driver of growth has 
been the consumer electronics partnership. At this point, with the exception 
of Android, Netflix seems to be on most major connected platforms. What 
platform or 
devices are yet to be penetrated by Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 

integrated. The big push over the next two years will be as more and more 

ll march along with that. 


upgrading the user interfaces on all of these devices really at Web speed
 
in 
the search of what the best user interface is or TV and that will vary 

program across all of those platforms.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Ben Rose at Battle Road Rese
arch. How does 
Netflix think about the cable service providers? Are they long term 
collaborators or adversaries?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, there is two parts to cable service, or at least two parts 

 
three parts: 
voice, data and video. To the video side, we are 
mostly competitor except 
that we are at a very different price point with a very small fraction of their 

But on balance, we are competitive. To data, we are a huge ally, drives a l
ot 
of data adoption, larger plans, so, very aligned. And voice, no interaction 
with them.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer. Among the 

movies
, broadcast TV shows or Pay TV shows like Showtime? What is the 
average number of minutes per streaming session, and do people tend to 
come back and finish the movie and show if interrupted?
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
well greater demand for 

We are just looking for great shows that we can license to our subscribers. 

And, y
es, lots of people come back to finish movies and TV shows. So if you 
are watching on the television and then they are in the car and they finish 
on an iPod and such or the iPhone and there is all of those different 

 
and 
they move to a different room and 
then they get to restart and of course our 
software is smart enough to restart them in the right place, so that all works 
very well as you would expect in Internet oriented service to work.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Daniel Ernst at Hudson 
Square Research. Do you 

on their televisions or through their PC?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Daniel, for us they are all just screens. There is four inch screens that are 
mobile phones. There i
s nine inch screens on iPad, 12 inch screens on 
laptops, and then a wide variety of television size screens from 20 to 100 

can give any more color on.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Second que
stion from Dan Ernst. Do you have a sense for what percentage 
of subscribers in the quarter or perhaps year
-
to
-
date that are returning 
subscribers, i.e., previous subscribers who have come back to Netflix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Actually that percentage historicall
y has been running about third, slightly 
higher and the deceleration in growth that percentage is falling a little bit.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Brian Fitzgerald at UBS. How do you think about 
streaming content cost per user in the 
future in light of the recent and 
upcoming content deals? Will it be pretty balanced in terms of streaming 
content cost being offset by analogous postal increases? Or will it be lumpy 
as present deals come in or may be builds on inflection point?
 
Reed Hast
ings
 

smooth. EPIX is great example of our stepping forward on that one and 

that will smooth out. But, i
n terms of the long term margin structure, we 
would 

 
like to try to keep it between 30% and 35% gross margin replacing 
the postal cost with content cost.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Another question from Brian Fitzgerald at UBS. There are now 200 plus 
Netbook enable
d products that will result in 60 million plus devices sold in 
2010. Could you give a rough rate the percentage that is may be exclusive 
and maybe a rough estimate of what these numbers look like for 2011? Any 
rough thoughts on TV/set
-
top boxes versus tabl
ets versus PC versus mobile 
phones?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 
there is no material set of the devices that are 
exclusive basically that would 

 
Soft Square [ph] tends to application store 
architectures and so none of the devices 

 
at least t
here is no material ones 
that I can think of that are exclusive. In terms of the number of devices, 


 
big 
change over the next two years is WiFi getting built into more TVs. And as 


 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next few questions are from Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest. Do any of 

have to renegotiate for each geography?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Hi, Andy, the general pattern is per geography (
inaudible) mirrors the other 
distribution channels.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question from Andy Hargreaves. Are the majority of the streaming 
deals you are signing still fixed?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Andy, we like to think of them as fixed because they 
generally are in 
the short term, but then when it comes to renegotiation time, it ends up in 
some long term basis sharing our upside with the content owners as we 
grow.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
And the final question from Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest. Can you 
explain in more detail the music rights impact? Where, why were you paying 
$3.5 million for music rights before?
 
Barry McCarthy
 
I am not sure if the question is 

 
requires an explanation of what music 
rights are as the public performance rights for the not
es and the words 

we distribute or stream over the Internet. There is public performance rights 
required from one of three rights societies, ASCAP, SESAC, BMI. Two of 
those, ASCAP
 
and BMI involve rate courts for the setting of grades, rates or 
in dispute and so as a consequence we through time have made estimates 
about the rates to our expectations for license fees associated with the 
public performance of the music and did get som
e recent decisions in the 
courts, which have caused us to rethink the amount of money we had set 

eventually when the license is struck the 

 
an exchange of monies and 

 

 

 
Reed Hastings
 
And coming back to an earlier question I referred to starting to target 30% 
to 35% gross margin that is as new content deals replace the postage, and 
that is true in North Americ
a. If we do global aggressively you know in the 
short term as we launch that would be different. But that is 

 


 
goal statement is true in the long term globally and on an ongoing basis in 
North America.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is fr
om Wayne Chang at Canaccord Genuity. Could you 
talk about the level of adoption or activation levels you are seeing with the 
variety of Web
-
enabled devices in the marketplace such as Web
-
enabled 
TVs, Apple products such as the iPad or other tablet
-
like dev
ices and even 
gaming consoles and mobile handsets becoming a key driver to driving new 
subscriber activations or does the opportunity remain still relative early?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Wayne, for music services mobile is the core and then the more living room 
base

[ph]. So the living room formats and the laptop formats and iPad formats 

modest.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question
 
is from Jim Friedland at Cowen regarding Canada 
streaming. In the comments you indicated that the Canadian business is on 
track to breakeven in the second half of next year. Does that imply that your 
Canadian content deals scale with subscriber growth or 
are paying big 
upfront fees to streaming content regardless of the number of subscribers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Jim, that would be the latter.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
And the second question from Jim Friedland at Cowen with regards to U.S. 
streaming. Do you think the 
long term operating margins of a digital
-
only 
business are similar to the margins of the business today around 12% plus?
 
Barry McCarthy
 
You know, the long term margins are really driven by competition because 
that really influences the pricing. So you woul
d have to tell me what the 
competitive environment is to guess what the operating margins are. It will 
be again significantly influenced by the amount of competition, and at this 

 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is 
from John Blackledge at Credit Suisse. What was 
changed in disk shipments per sub per month in Q3 2010 on a year
-
over
-
year basis? I think in Q2 2010 disk shipments were down about 20% year
-
over
-
year, thus wondering if you would expect the decline to accele
rate in 
the near term or stay around Q2, Q3 levels?
 
Barry McCarthy
 
John 

 
as I said in a 

 
in answer to an earlier question, we are not breaking 
out the disk usage per sub per month. I think the only color commentary we 

dible) these shipments had grown on a 
year
-
over
-
year basis by about 10%.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Barton Crockett at Lazard Capital Markets. Impact 
on other forms of entertainment consumption. Our young children love 
Netflix, watching som
ething on the iPad. For that reason, we are not inclined 
to buy more fixed DVDs. They get more than enough content from the Pixar 
and Disney movies and PBS shows on Netflix. Are there other Netflix 
subscribers like us? Do you see any evidence that people a
re buying fewer 
DVDs as they stream more Netflix content? Could you also update us on the 
chord
-
cutting question? Do you still profess to see no evidence that Netflix 
subscribers are cutting the chord?
 
Reed Hastings
 
On the latter part none, chord cutting, 
we still see no evidence that our sub 

something we survey on, now and then on. On your personal experience, 


 
the 
streaming stimulates their usage in other formats, others for 

 
like you 
said that streaming meets most of their entertainment needs. So, quite a lot 
of variety with 17 million members.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next two questions are from Michael Pachter at We
dbush. The press 
release says that in Q4 a majority of Netflix subscribers will watch more 


sessions than DVD transaction
s?
 
Reed Hastings
 


 
the 
hours.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Second question from Michael Pachter. Also, the following sentence says that 
the business will have transitioned from mostly DVD to mostly str
eaming. If 
more than 50% of users consume more than 60% of their content via 
streaming, I can see how you could say mostly streaming for those 

streaming get 100% of their content via DVD, so 

conclude that more than 50% of content is streaming. Would you please 
clarify what you are talking about and give us the split in terms of hours 

 
And the second sentence implies that over half of all 
hours spent are spent 

 
Reed Hastings
 

and we track that (inaudible) and we make an assumption that each DVD is 
watched 
once. But you could say some are never watched and some are 
watched twice. But we assume watched once. And then we look at the 
streaming hours that we are delivering and compare those. So, we are 
seeing two things, which are independent. One is that the to
tal number of 
minutes of entertainment delivered by Netflix is higher on streaming than on 
DVD.
 
Second, a majority of our members, or more than 50% in Q4 will watch a 
majority of their content, by minutes, on streaming than on DVD, which 
basically gives yo

10% of the streamers are watching an enormous amount of content and 

streaming. And from a subscriber view, a majority of our s
ubscribers 
consume a majority of their content on streaming than DVD.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Doug Mitchelson at Deutsche Bank Securities. How 
much of your churn comes from subscribers that are on free promotions? 
Asked another way, how 
well is your churn rate on core Netflix subscribers, 
say those who have been subscribers for over three months or six months or 
one year, however you measure it? The obvious reason for the question is 
we do not typically see consumer subscriber businesses 
grow so fast while 
sustaining such a high churn rate. If you settle down to a lower level to the 
extent you are offering a good price value.
 
Barry McCarthy
 

growth businesses grow 
this fast. So, there are two cohorts essentially to 
focus on with respect to churn that free trials is kind of gives you a fair deal. 
And you see a slightly lower 

 
well we anticipate we are seeing slightly lower 
conversion rates in Canada than we see in t
he U.S. so let me just tell this 
one on the U.S. where we have a rich history and we said repeatedly 
through time and it remains true today that that nine in 10 subscribers who 
take a free trial become a paying subscriber.
 
So, great conversion rate. But th
at implies one in 10 free trial subscribers 

 
As it relates to the paying subscribers, the churn declines over time and as 

subscribers have been here for more than 12 months and your churn rate is 
in the 2% range or lower.
 
So, not terribly dissimilar from churn rates for basic cable, which is in the 
what, 1.5% range. And, of course, whether or not that churn rate is 
substantia
l from a financial perspective also depends on what the acquisition 
cost is and of course we are at historical low acquisition cost because 

And then I suppose (inaudible) IP well how 
does retention rates for 
streaming customers compare with retention rates on DVD only customers. 

streaming service, we can now say that actually retention for streaming 
customers has just cro
ssed over the retention for 

 
I am using the word, 
yes, retention, has just crossed over retention for DVD only customers. So, 

because the majority of the growth is streaming relate
d.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Edward Williams at BMO. As subscriber growth has 
grown due to streaming, how has the demographics of the Netflix subscriber 
changed?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not significantly. We are still pretty much the broad Internet 
demographic 
has cut a chord.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next couple of questions are from Scott Devitt at Morgan Stanley. Given 

seeing opportunities to continue to aggressively invest in di
gital content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Scott, we are pretty spent up for Q4 that we are three weeks into the 

opportunity next year as the subscriber base continues to grow.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
S
econd question from Scott Devitt. With the rollout of the new disk free 
applications on Wii and PS3, you seem to be focusing a lot on reducing 
friction, improving the user interface, and increasing search functionality. 
Are there any other areas you hope t
o focus on in order to differentiate your 
streaming products from other video applications from a technology 
standpoint?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not particularly, Scott. I would say that any technology advantage quickly 
gets copied. And so we try to do great work an
d improve any if you like but 
obviously all the great work that we do there will be quickly copied within a 
year or two by anybody who wants to.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next questions are from Eric Wold at MCF. In the prepared remarks, you 
state that Q4 will 
experience year
-
over
-
year reductions in marketing 
spending. Are you referring to the overall dollar amount or SAC?
 
Barry McCarthy
 
Both.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Second question from Eric Wold. The DVD shipments continue to flow or 
even decline in certain markets l
ike the Bay Area. At what point would you 
consider closing distribution centers or would those always need to stay in 
place for the next day delivery benefit?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Mostly the latter, Eric. You know, over a sufficient number of years, as the 
volume
 

probably many, many years out.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Tony Wible at Janney Montgomery Scott. Do you 
believe MSOs will move to (inaudible) as part of the STC debate over title 
sha
ring? Do you see an opportunity to use compression techniques to 
minimize bandwidth if that is the case?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, that is a key question, Tony, and a good one. We have some 
vulnerability depending on cap [ph] usage and what happens. Comcast has a
 

unlimited experience and it gives us plenty of room to deliver a high
-
def 
stream. On the other hand, AT&T Mobile data on an iPad is now capped at 
two gigabytes, so not enough room to del
iver hours and hours of high
-
def. 
There is a not a lot of improvement in compression techniques. But what we 
can do is just deliver a lower bit stream, a lower quality video experience. 
So, for example, not too high
-

ially 
mitigate that impact. But we are definitely sensitive as you pointed to 

 
in 
the long term as most of the industry end up at 250 gigabytes or two at the 
other extreme.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Arthur Mangriotis at Fox Point Capital.
 
Please 
elaborate on your comment that the international competitive window will 
only be opened temporarily.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Arthur, broadband is growing rapidly across the world and that creates 
an opportunity for us and potentially for others and 
five or ten years from 


 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Doug Anmuth at Barclays. Is SAC down more 
because you deliberately pushed market
ing dollars towards content cost or 
as a result of the strong subscriber growth, i.e., if you go into the quarter 
intending to spend a bit less on acquisitions?
 
Barry McCarthy
 
We spent to our plan. Marketing spending as a percent of revenue was up 
slightly
 
on Q
-
over
-
Q basis and on a year
-
over
-
year basis. And the decrease 
in SAC reflects the increase in the organic growth, which is a function of the 

content. So, historically, you have heard 
me talk about the inter
-
relationship 
between gross margin SAC and churn and the way in which we play one off 
against the other in order to increase the overall growth rate and enterprise 

e at 
play here.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And as Barry mentioned in written comments, as part of absorbing the EPIX 
lump, we will be spending lighter on marketing in Q4 than historically we 
would and that will have therefore lower gross margins and lower SAC than 
you 
are used to seeing from us.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Another question from Doug Anmuth at Barclays. What are you doing 
differently in terms of distribution centers as you prepare for overall disk 
shipments to the clients? I know you are focused on continuing autom
ation 
and efficiency, but do you have broader plans yet on how you ultimately 
scale back these facilities over time?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, nationwide, our DVD shipments are still growing about 10% year
-
over
-
year. So, right now we are trying to figure out how t
o handle the increased 
load and get our new automation to work quickly and so I am sure someday 

term?
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Another question from Michael Olson at Piper Jaffray. Question 
for Barry. 
Does your comment in the prepared remarks regarding Q4 guidance where 
you say year
-
over
-
year reductions in marketing spending will mostly fund 
increased content spending implies [ph] that Q4 marketing spend on a dollar 
basis will that be down ye
ar
-
over
-
year in Q4 or are you saying it will be 
down year
-
over
-
year as a percentage of revenue?
 
Barry McCarthy
 
It will be down as a percentage of revenue and it will be down Q over Q.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Doug Robinson [ph], a private
 
investor. When will 
the Android cell phone be supported for streaming app?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Doug, we are working on the Android now, and as soon as we have 

 
Barry McCarthy
 
All right. I would like to supplement my pre
vious answer as it relates to 
marketing spending to make a slightly different point. I want to remind 
everyone on the call that earnings is a managed outcome. And so there has 
been many quarters in the past by way of example, the fourth quarter of last 
yea
r if memory serves me, during the quarter because the business was 
much more profitable than we forecasted we are going to be, we allocated 
during the quarter an additional spending to marketing of something like $6 
million. But we delivered earnings never
 

deliver and we were also able to deliver more growth in part because we are 
able to invest in more marketing dollars. So, if 

 
as Q4 unfolds, similar 
dynamic occurs relative to our forecast and we have the wind at our back, 
and we would be anxious to invest additional money in marketing because it 
will further accelerate our growth. But base on our plan, we are expecting 
the answer I gave, which is the decrease both on a percentage basis and a 
decrease Q over Q in terms of ab
solute dollars spent on marketing.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Another question from Barton Crockett at Lazard with regards to the Starz 
deal. Starz receive net affiliate fees of close to $2 per subscriber per month 
for providing its (inaudible) on per package to 
cable. In my observation, the 
line
-
up of Starz content on Netflix is better than on cable due to more title 
availability, (inaudible), et cetera. In the renewal talks with Starz, is it 
conceivable that Netflix could say rate per sub for Starz content compa
rable 
to what cable pays? Can you comment generally on your optimism or 
skepticism about a successful renewal of the Starz deal?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Bart, obviously I can't comment on the specifics, and I am optimistic in 
the long term that is we have mone
y to pay and they are in the business of 
collecting money. So you know there is no reason in the long term 

-
ups 
along the way like we see in so many content supplier relationships, tha
t 

forward to working on that deal.
 
Deborah Crawford
 

declined precipitously, you are really saying that 
overall consumption of 
entertainment is up a lot. DVD usage is down a little, and streaming up a lot. 

you confirm that I am reading the response correctly?

Michael, the only thing that I heard in that question was that DVD down, but 
DVD is actually up. It emphasizes your theme that DVD is growing slowly for 
us, DVD shipments, and streaming is growing rapidly. But I am not sure, 
Deborah, I heard the question 

 
Deborah Crawford
 

 
Barry McCarthy
 
You are really saying that overall consumption is up a lot, so 

 

usage per sub down a little, and streaming up a lot.
 
Reed Hastings
 
DVD usage.
 
Barry McCarthy
 
DVD usage on a per sub basis down.
 
Reed 
Hastings
 
But subs growing overall.
 
Barry McCarthy
 
Yes, right, right.
 
Reed Hastings
 

 
Barry McCarthy
 

seeing greater consumpti
on, are you seeing greater consumption of 
entertainment? And I think the answer to that is yes. So, said differently, 
subscribers are extracting more value from the service than they have 
historically, which I think explains in part one, the increased orga
nic growth 
and the decline in subscriber acquisition cost, and two, the continued 
decrease in churn.
 
Deborah Crawford
 

like to turn the call back over to Reed for any brief closing
 
remarks.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Thanks for joining us today. Hopefully, we answered all of your questions 
efficiently. There is a lot to talk about this quarter. The year
-
over
-
year 
subscriber growth at 52% and accelerating, more content, more device 
partnerships, 
our entry into Canada, and by any measure, our evolution to a 

evolution even more clearly when we report our fourth quarter results. And 
look forward to talking with you then. Thank you.

7/26/11,Netflix,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Netflix Third Quarter 
2012 Earnings Q&A Session. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a 
question
-
and
-
answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a 
reminder, this 
conference call is being recorded.
 
I would now like to introduce the host for today's conference, Ellie Mertz, 
Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Third 
Quarter 2012 
Earnings Q&A Session. I'm joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO; and David 
Wells, CFO. We announced our financial results for the third quarter at 
approximately 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. The shareholder letter and the 
Q3 financial results and 
the webcast of this Q&A session are all available at 
the company's Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.com.
 
As is our standard practice, we will begin the call with questions received via 
email. Please email your questions to ir@netflix.com. After ema
il Q&A, we 
will also open up the phone lines for additional questions not covered by the 
email Q&A or the letter. The dial
-
in number is within our investor letter, but 
let me repeat it now. Please call (760) 666
-
3613 if you'd like to get in the 
queue.
 
We m
ay make forward
-
looking statements during this call regarding the 
company's future performance. Actual results may differ materially from 
these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A 
detailed discussion of such risks and uncer
tainties is contained in our filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report 
on Form 10
-
K filed with the Commission on February 10, 2012. A 
rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 
6:00
 
p.m. Pacific Time today.
 
Now, let's move directly to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Ellie Mertz
 
As is our standard practice, we've organized the email questions by topic 
after we received them this afternoon. So let's start with questions on 
domes
tic subscribers.
 
Question one. Your original thesis was 3 years for full brand recovery. Is this 
still the case? Can you recover faster?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's Reed here. I'd say the 3
-
year model is consistent with what we're 
seeing. We've made substantial pro
gress. As you can see, in the 
engagement metrics, we feel really good about the originals, particularly 
Arrested Development, because of its broad existing reputation in terms of 
burnishing our reputation. But 3 years is still the right timeframe.
 
David We
lls
 
And this is David. I would add, like I've said before, that we are seeing 
recovery in our brand reputation metrics the likelihood to recommend, but 
it's not at the level that it was pre
-
price change in July of last year. So 
there's still some room for 
recovery, but we've seen it trend in the right 
direction.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What changed, as you move through this year, that has caused you to miss 
your earlier guidance of 7 million net domestic streaming guidance by so 
much?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we were within
 
the range of our guidance from 90 days ago, but not 
within the annual guidance that we gave at the end of Q1. And roughly, I 
think we're feeling our way along as the streaming market grows, and we 
miss
-
predicted, but I would call that more of a forecastin
g error than 
anything else. When we think about growing 5 million net additions in this 
year, if we had predicted 5 million, I think we'd all be feeling good, that 
that's great growth. So we own it in terms of a bad forecast. But in terms of 
actual perform
ance of the business to grow 5 million net adds, domestic, is 
substantial, and we feel good about that and about the growth next year.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Follow
-
on question. What does the new subscriber guidance of 5 million 
compared to the prior guidance of 7 mi
llion suggest about the addressable 
market opportunity you have?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think it makes it all a little bit harder. We think harder about the 60 
million to 90 million, and we'll approach it not as fast as we would have if we 
had done 7 millio
n this year. But the long term of every household becoming 
an Internet video household, I mean, that's definitely happening and going 
to happen. People are using Internet video in huge numbers, and that's only 
spreading. And we continue to lead the market 
in a big way. So I'd look at 
the long
-
term picture as very strong and not changed.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You predicted that the London Olympics might dampen subscriber additions 
and/or engagement in the third quarter. Did that play out in your actual 
data?
 
David Wel
ls
 
Yes, it did. We had a strong July, a soft August, and then a slower bounce 
back in September.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How can you improve involuntary churn rates in more mainstream, lower 
income households? Why don't I take this one?
 
Some of the color that 
we've seen in terms of trends over the last couple of 
years is an increased use of debit cards and prepaid cards over credit cards. 
And the unfortunate thing about these different payment methods is that 
they have lower approval rates. And so what we've be
en doing is looking at 
a host of different things to improve those approval rates, and, in particular, 
looking to recover as many sale transactions as we can. So we're hopeful 
that there's a little bit of room that we have there to improve the overall 
invo
lved churn rates.
 
Let's move to questions about content. You have the advantage of perfect 
information on what your consumers watch. You have licensed a wide range 
of content, some of which is not viewed all that much. With this information, 
how do you int
end to handle negotiations when deals come up for renewal? 
Would you pay less for a certain content or pay the same or more but 
require programmers to provide you with newer, fresher or better content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't get the luxury of requiring pro
grammers to do anything. We 
certainly look at the viewing as an indicator, and that limits what we're 
willing to pay for certain content. And if it doesn't present a clearing price 
and there's someone else willing to pay that much for the content, then the
 
programmer will go to someone else. So I would say it's an informed auction 
market. We do have a lot of data that's very helpful in our overall 
programming. But it's a pretty straightforward auction, highest bidder gets 
the contents kind of market.
 
Ellie 
Mertz
 
Question on the streaming hours. You have not talked about monthly or 
quarterly streaming hours since your comment about June 2012. Could you 
update us on recent activity?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, sure. We were over 3 billion hours in Q3, which we feel gre
at about, 
and it's continuing to grow.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
With 2/3 of viewing now television, are you limiting the size of the audience 
that you appeal to by not having the more in
-
demand or on
-
demand film 
content that help build your DVD and then streaming busin
esses? How would 
that impact your cost of content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think we're expanding our market with our TV series. If you look on 
cable or satellite, what gets watched more 
--
 
I mean, TV shows get watched 
a lot more than movies. So I think there
's a big expansion in addressable 
market, both in the sense for any consumer's time and in terms of people 
who are interested in the Netflix service. And we're trying to be very strong 
both in movies and in TV shows, and we're only getting stronger as we g
row.
 
David Wells
 
Just a reminder here, too, that even in our DVD business, about 1/3 of the 
DVD shipments were new releases and 2/3 were things that didn't fall into 
any release category or older content. So many subscribers just want 
something good to wat
ch, and they're less engaged in terms of caring about 
the freshness of the data or the content.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Next, a question on fixed versus variable licensing. [indiscernible] some of 
its recent deals a ethic [ph] to have a variable component on pricing b
ased 
on subscribers. Given the lack of visibility you now have on future subs, is 
this something you would be willing to do? You've always resisted and it has 
worked to your advantage as you grew faster than content providers 
anticipated.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Now
 
we're very happy with knowing exactly what our commitments are, and 
we don't have any plans to change our licensing structure. And the people 
that we generally bid against other networks are in the same model, where 
they're bidding fixed fee.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In terms of the goal to focus on licensing, only the contents of viewers, 
when you negotiate with these videos to license content, their goal is to 
bundle together as much as they can to maximize the value of the deal. How 
do you balance your desire for mo
re efficient spend with the studios' desire 
to bundle more content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We really look at packages as a whole, so we'll estimate for a given package 
how much viewing it will generate, which includes the stuff that's most 
appropriate for our membe
rs and the stuff that's less appropriate, and then 
try to figure out a clearing price for that set of content. And then, there's a 
back
-
and
-
forth of how well if you added this or took out this, depending on 
are they revenue
-
motivated or packaged
-
motivated,
 
and that's all part of 
the give
-
and
-
take across the hundreds of different agreements that we 
have.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Disney's current output deal with Starz ends in 2015 with the [indiscernible] 
through Starz until the end of 2016. Why should Disney choose Netf
lix 
versus renewing with Starz or starting their own streaming movie service?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think in each market and country, there's a different set of content at 
a different time. But in the U.S. context, the Disney deal comes up in 2015, 
so it's
 
a little premature. But we would certainly be bidders for that or other 
pay one deals as we have been in the past.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you discuss the device mix of content consumption? How are tablets 
and smartphones faring in terms of consumer hour 
streams?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Tablets are growing. And the smartphones are growing, you probably would 
expect that. Tablets are a little bigger than smartphones for us. But the big 
viewing is really on the television, smart TVs, game consoles, Apple TV, 
Heroku, B
lu
-
ray players, all the things that bring Netflix to the big screen.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions about original content. How do you quantify the success 
of proprietary content in terms of consumption and financial investment?
 
David Wells
 
Well, we look 
at originals like we do third
-
party license content in terms of 
how much it's going to be viewed or how much it is viewed relative to its 
cost. So that's the primary measure. And then outside of that, we do expect 
some ancillary PR value, public relations 
value, and subscriber excitement 
around the originals, but we don't rely on that in terms of the primary 
relative measure.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, so I think that's right. The base case is that it's good content that we're 
producing, and the upside is that it t
ransforms the consumers' relationship 
with Netflix because it's only available on Netflix, it's not also on cable and 
also on DVD and also on pay
-
per
-
view. It's really, fully, totally unique only 
on Netflix within our territories.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Investors are
 
quite surprised that you're releasing all the episodes of House 
of Cards at once, ensuring they will watch all the episodes over a weekend 
or 2 and then churn off. We're excited that Netflix is the first TV producer to 
put the consumer first and give them
 
the content the way they want to 
consume it. How do you look at the trade
-
off between churn and hooking 
people on Netflix's other content if you're willing to bomb through 13 hours 
of House of Cards?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we do want to hook people, but we w
ant to hook them for the long
-
term, and we hook them for the long
-
term by treating them right and 
making all those episodes available at once. And obviously, there's later 
Arrested Development and Hemlock and Orange is the New Black and then a 
season 2 of 
House of Cards. So if we do our job right, there's always a 
reason to be a Netflix member on the original side in addition to the license 
side. So I don't think that it will be material, they join only for House of 
Cards and then exit. And so that makes us
 
comfortable with this very 
consumer first trade
-
off.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
The original content efforts, to what extent you have ownership rights that 
could generate additional revenues, syndication, DVD, licensing, et cetera?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's a great discussion 
item for us over time. But on this first round, we're a 
licensee in a certain window and so we're not essentially a producer that 
then manages and profits from those ancillary rights.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions about international. Recently, you comme
nted that the 
Nordics have the most content of any international launch. Can you quantify 
the level of content and/or magnitude of that spend versus other regional 
launches?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. We've been very successful in the Nordics. We're very happy with
 
that, 
but I don't have any specific quantification in terms of dollars or title count 
that would be helpful. We do feel like, market by market, we are learning 
and getting better at the right content mix, both to attract the subscribers 
and economically, 
and we look forward to having a fuller update for you on 
Nordics once we're a quarter in, in January.
 
David Wells
 
And I'd say that the basis for making those statements is an amalgam of 
metrics, it's not any one particular title count or dollar spend. Our 
experience has been, when we look at box office or Nielsen ratings or other 
types of metrics, that it's a combination of all of those in terms of the 
subscriber perception of content quality.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In its early years, Netflix incurred significant los
ses in starting up its DVD
-
by
-
mail service. As you look at international streaming, do you see parallels 
to the startup of DVD, or are you encountering significantly more 
challenges?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think it parallels with DVD or parallels with any s
uccessful business, 
which is you establish a new market and there's losses for some time period. 
And then, the key thing is the durability of the profit stream after that. We 
never invested in having DVD expand around the world because, number 
one, of the 
mail system's difficulty; but two is the profit stream wasn't going 
to be that long. In contrast with streaming, if we're able to establish a 
significant market share and franchise in a market and we manage that well, 
that should be a multi
-
decade profit s
tream, and so the DCF on that is 
enormous, which is why it gives us the confidence to make these big and 
aggressive investments in establishing our leadership in these markets.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Have you considered taking on partners and structuring JVs in 
certain 
countries? It appears like it could have 3 benefits: gain traction in countries 
where you have no brand equity; minimize the level of investment; and 
could accelerate Netflix's global ambition.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, it's definitely a factor, for exam
ple, when we look at Asia and some of 
the more challenging markets where U.S. firms have had a tough time and 
had progress in that. In Europe, most of the consumer firms have really 
been able to execute much better, faster, by keeping those wholly
-
owned, 
a
nd that's our model for now.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Assuming that you are able to maintain positive consolidated earnings in 
2013, what would be the maximum number of countries or regions you 
would consider launching them to?
 
David Wells
 
I'm not sure I would approach
 
that in terms of a maximum number. I mean, 
we look at a territory launch, it could have 4 countries in the case of the 
Nordics, but it's sold as a content block. So I think what we've said is we're 
focused on global profitability, but also on a path to pr
ofitability for our large 
existing markets. And so those are the 2 gating conditions that we'll be 
looking for in terms of finding that next market.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
With regards to Latin America, what steps are you taking to improve 
payments? Have you consider
ed withdrawing from any markets within Latin 
America? Have you considered bundling your offerings other than that 
market to improve your ability to collect?
 
Second answer, on the payment side: On the payment side, we've been 
looking across a host of option
s to expand our ability to collect payments 
from subscribers, so let me we give you some examples of things that we're 
doing. In Mexico, what we found is that not all debit cards are accepted for 
e
-
commerce, and so we've been working directly with the bank
s to allow 
them to, at the 
--
 
I should say, allow us to accept debit cards online. And in 
Brazil, what we're looking to do this current quarter is to expand the 
payment methods that we offer, including things like direct debit 
[indiscernible] expand the ad
dressable market of folks who have the ability 
to pay for our service.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And then in terms of bundling, that's not something that we're actively 
engaged in. We are looking at payment with other subscription services and 
trying to think that thr
ough. And then in terms of withdrawing, we're not 
thinking about that. All of our content agreements cover the entire region 
and are long
-
term in nature. So we're making great progress on the revenue 
side. So we're continuing to invest on that basis.
 
Ellie
 
Mertz
 
If you return to profitability for the overall 
--
 
if the return to profitability for 
the overall business takes 3 quarters or more, is there a risk that you'll miss 
an opportunity to have first mover advantage in continental Europe? Or does 
first mo
ver advantage not matter since [indiscernible] had first mover 
advantage in the U.K. and you came later and surpassed them?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's a matter of debate for us. Certainly, first mover helps, but it really 
depends on how big a scale you get. So 
if a competitor gets to great scale in 
one of those markets before we do, we would tend probably to focus on 
other markets. So it's 
--
 
there's no easy answer to that one. It's something 
we try to balance, which is our rate of investments on the current bus
iness 
versus the risk of competitors getting ahead. So far, we'd like the set of 
trade
-
offs that we've made.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions about the product. How do you think about improving 
the platform from here to stay ahead of where the competition i
s going?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're making a great progress on the algorithms that drive the 
merchandising, and I know they're invisible to all of you just like the Google 
Search algorithms are invisible. The UI is not the main focus because it's 
pretty easy to c
opy, and our main focus is showing the right content to the 
right person. When you turn on Netflix, whether that's on an iPad or a PS3, 
you could see 15 or 20 block shots, and if those are the right 15 or 20 block 
shots for you, for your mood for the time 
of the day, we're very likely to get 
a play. If those aren't the right block shots, then we're much less likely to 
get a play. And then that builds our engagement, and the more people 
watch, the more they retain. And so that's really the importance of the 
algorithm development and testing that we do.
 
David Wells
 
I would also say that, for some subscribers, we're constantly testing user 
interfaces. There's a lot of exciting user interfaces coming up enabled by 
devices that enable gesturings, voice and other 
things. You'll see us continue 
to experiment and play with those types of interfaces in tests. And if we find 
one, then we'll continue to innovate in those areas.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Amazon's Web Services had another significant outage this week. Did this 
impact N
etflix in any way? If not, was that due to Netflix's planning for 
random outages or due to not using effective services in the first place? Do 
these events affect your confidence in using services like Amazon's AWS for 
critical infrastructure and customer
-
facing functions?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Okay. AWS has done a great job for us as they have for other customers by 
having an architecture that isolates faults, and so it's built upon the notion 
that occasionally data centers will go down, and they give you the 
comp
onents to build around that. That would be true if they were our own 
data centers or if they were AWS. And in recent outage that they had, our 
customers were not materially affected. The traffic switched over smoothly, 
as it's designed to, to other Amazon 
data centers. So we're extremely happy 
with the decision to expand within the Amazon Web Service's footprint.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Next, some questions on competition. Can you compare the value 
proposition of your streaming offering to that of Amazon today? Is the 
gap 
closing?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Amazon as Prime is 2 different markets that we compete with Amazon 
in, and one is in the U.K. and there are 
--
 
there's almost no content that's on 
both services. So think of it as 2 really different services in terms of 
content. 
And we believe our viewing is higher. We think our content is better. We're 
growing faster, but it's a real head
-
to
-
head battle. We're both at the same 
price point, roughly speaking, within 20% of the 
--
 
in standalone services. In 
the U.S., Amazon
 
is bundled with Prime and it's got a subset of our content. 
And then depending on how you want to think about the price of Prime as an 
annual $79 payment or free, with free shipping, you get 2 different views on 
it. But as we said on the letter, most of o
ur subscribers want us to have 
more content. They're not particularly motivated by a service that has a 
significant subset of our content. So at this point, it's not in anything that we 
can measure affecting us directly.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Somewhat a related ques
tion. Reed Hastings recently stated in an interview 
that Amazon had thus far not had much of an impact on Netflix's growth 
trajectory. Yet given what we're seeing now, in terms of slowing subscriber 
growth and lower guidance, does this change Netflix's vie
w at all in terms of 
how many customers may be choosing alternative providers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we ask ourselves the same question, obviously. But in every data 
source that we look at, unrelated. I think as Amazon builds out their original 
content, whic
h they're very actively engaged in and they'll get exclusive 
deals against us, they'll more and more be a different service than ours. And 
then, many subscribers, potentially, will subscribe to both. So I think that's 
the way that it evolves over time, lik
e it has in the U.K.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Now a few questions on the financials. Will the company be disclosing its 
obligations related to original content production costs?
 
David Wells
 
Well, yes, we are in the sense that the obligations that we've signed up for 
on
 
originals are included in our streaming obligation tables. So they are 
already in there. We don't break them out. We'll provide more color as they 
get more and more material.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You talked about your expectations for negative free cash flow for t
he next 
several quarters as you ramp spending on originals. But eventually, you 
expect to return positive 
--
 
return to positive free cash flow. What gives you 
the confidence that you'll be able to return to positive free cash flow? Is it a 
slowdown in cont
ent spend or an acceleration in subscriber growth, or both?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I wouldn't characterize either of those that way. I would say that we're 
focused on 3 things from a cash flow perspective: One is our growth in 
profitability in the U.S. and what
 
that looks like; the second is our 
international investments and the losses related to those and how they play 
out over time; and then, the third is our growth in originals, which takes 
more cash than ordinary types of content deals. So we put all 3 of th
ose 
together, and we want to maintain a comfortable margin. And I think those 
statements are based on the fact that I think that we were in a position 
where we can grow next year under various scenarios and expand our 
content expense, not slow it down, but
 
just slow down the acceleration of 
the content expense in addition to funding our international investment in 
originals.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you help us quantify the original content cash outlays in 2013, 
understanding that they will be higher than the P&L ex
pense?
 
David Wells
 
Well, what we said about those before is we do have some output style deals 
that have more cash than expense, and those are 
--
 
have been about 10% 
in terms of content cash relative to the expense. Originals only need that, 
that ratio goe
s up anywhere from 10% to 20%, but probably not more than 
20%.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
20% in excess of the P&L?
 
David Wells
 
Correct.
 
David Wells
 
How might we think of content spend growing year
-
over
-
year in 2013?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Hopefully, content spend will grow subst
antially as we continue to make our 
service better, and that's built into our plan, but we don't believe that we're 
overcommitted. We have some flexibility, though, depending on what the 
growth is because we're very conscious of the variability in our grow
th 
outcomes. And you can see that in the fact that while we're short on total 
subscriber growth this year, we are hitting our contribution margin targets. 
And so that's a demonstration of the flexibility that we have on the cost side.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
On CapEx,
 
what was the driver of the uptick in the acquisition of PCNEs 
[ph]?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's cash boxes related to our Open Connect program.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
And finally, there has been increasing talk that Netflix will eventually have to 
raise prices to 
increase ARPU. We've heard from management that this 
option is off the table, with the brand seemingly recovering from 2011's 
event. Is this something that is being discussed? Would it be unrealistic to 
expect an increase before 2014? Obviously, it cannot 
stay $7.99 forever.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we're very excited about the $7.99 price point, and we have no plans 
to change that. Consumers valued the incredible bargain that, that is and 
that helps our growth. So we see increased monetization from increased 
gr
owth rather than any change in price.
 
Ellie Mertz

Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
As the usage model switches more and more towards TV viewing, could you 
talk about the impact that could have on the business model in terms of 
margins, visibility into revenue and into profits, and maybe any pricin
g 
options that, that would give you?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Mark, there's no fundamental difference in the way that we license TV shows 
from the way that we license movies. In other words, it's a fixed payment 
per year or per time period. The only difference, I sup
pose, is we'll do a 
contract that will have, if there's a Season 3, Season 4, Season 5 that's built 
in. So I suppose there's a little bit of difference there. But fundamentally, it's 
content over some time period. And 
--
 
but the great experience about the 
TV shows in discovering them is being able to go all the way back to the 
pilot and really get a lot of fantastic viewing out of it, which creates a 
differentially better experience than any other provider. So that's the big 
asset of it.

Our next q
uestion comes from Scott Devitt from Morgan Stanley.
 
Scott W. Devitt 
-
 
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
I had a couple. First on the domestic streaming subs. You mentioned the 
Olympics as a factor. You also mentioned the change in seasonality earlier in 
t
he years, so I was just wondering, given the way that you exited 3Q and 
the very back
-
end loaded nature of 4Q, how you approach the fourth quarter 
guide for streaming subs? And on that topic, as it relates to early 2013 as 
well as more of the originals in 
the U.S. market, House of Cards and 
Arrested Development start to flow through potentially. Do you anticipate 
that, that drives subs above seasonal trends or is content and original 
content not necessarily a direct driver of subs? And then secondly, Fox I 
think recently opted to renew with HBO with an exclusive long
-
term deal. I 
don't know, it's like 2 to 3 years ahead of the renewal. Just wondering why 
you think they would opt to do that rather than giving Netflix a chance to bid 
for the rights?
 
David Well
s
 
Scott, I can 
--
 
this is David. I can take sort of Part A and B, and I'll let Reed 
take the Part C. Part A, the seasonal pattern is still in place. That is that we 
still see greater sub additions in the fourth quarter and first quarter than in 
the second 
quarter and the third quarter. So I think even our midpoint of our 
guide implies that seasonal pattern will still be in place. The Olympics sort of 
affected the monthly progression of the acquisitions through Q3, but overall, 
seasonality of net additions i
s still in place. And then your Part B on originals 
and content, the originals we're very excited about we think that they will 
drive a lot of consumer excitement in it. But on a grand scheme, it's likely to 
be less than 
--
 
certainly less than 10% of hours
 
viewed next year and maybe 
even less than 5% of viewed. So in terms of our planning, I don't expect 
that to drive a ton of additional adoption.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Scott, it's Reed here. You're very gracious because I imagine what you really 
feel is why do we m
ake seasonality excuses and not Olympics excuses and 
aren't you getting tired of it. We are tired of making those excuses as 
opposed to getting back to our track record. On the seasonality 
--
 
or the 
originals, like David said, we may have upside from it, b
ut we're not going to 
bake that into our spending plans. We're getting into unknown territory in 
terms of how many people come to us for House of Cards or Arrested or 
others. So we'll gain some experience in that, and then that will help us 
understand how 
much more investment we should do in originals after that. 
But at this point and in Q1, we will think of it just as upside. And then in Fox 
and HBO, I'm not sure. Maybe the deal from HBO is good enough, but I 
think you'd really have to ask them or Fox, and
 
we'll take it from there.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
 
If I could squeeze one last one. The social integration update, and talked 
about historically there are restrictions in the U.S. Is there any update to 
that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, t
here's a bill in Congress now that is pending before the Congress, and 
it's anybody's guess if they're going to pass it in a lame duck session. And 
then that would enable all different types of consumer permissions for 
sharing, which would be useful in a F
acebook context but also useful in any 
kind of meta
-
browse various types of scenarios where people want to allow a 
feed to go to a service to help them. So we're optimistic, but when we come 
to the Congress, it's hard to predict. And then in terms of outsi
de the U.S., 
we're continuing to learn on our international markets. We've seen some 
nice take
-
up in Brazil, which is a very social place, obviously, as well as in 
the U.K. So we're continuing to work on it, but no one yet has correct 
formula, us or anyone
 
else, in terms of real explosive generator. So it's in 
the category of a little bit positive, and we're continuing to work on it.

Our next question comes from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald.
 
Youssef H. Squali

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.,

A couple of questions. The 
--
 
I want to go back to the one of the first 
questions that was asked about the 3 years needed to restore your image. 
How did you get to that determination that it should take you guys about 3 
years? And why isn
't it taking shorter since you guys have basically, 
arguably after a year, I think people start forgetting, and to the extent that 
the quality of content keeps improving, it would kind of get restored faster 
than that. And then I have a follow
-
up.
 
Reed Has
tings
 
Let's 
--
 
Youssef, let's hope you're right, but it's not something we wanted to 
count on. 3 years was something we felt comfortable we could deliver on in 
terms of our reputation. And some people do forget in 1 year, other people 
take a longer time. W
e're just going to have to work really hard on providing 
a great value and stick to our knitting, and then the brand will steadily 
recover. And if it's sooner than 3 years, that's great.
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division
 
But yo
u don't think that's an indication rather of just maybe perceived lower 
quality of content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. The best indicator of our perceived quality of content is how much we're 
getting viewed, how often 
--
 
you go home, it's Wednesday night, and you 
w
ant to pick something to watch and you have to decide whether you're 
going to pick up your cable or satellite remote or you're going to put on a 
DVD or you're going to watch Netflix. And the more of those moments of 
truth that we win, the more people are e
ngaged with our service and the 
more they retain and the more they tell their friends about Netflix. And so 
our primary driver is winning those moments of truth, which, if you think 
about it, is based upon your expectation of finding something good. And th
e 
better that those first 20 titles are for you, the more likely you are to turn it 
on, Netflix first, as opposed to one of the other entertainment options first. 
And so because our engagement is higher than it's been in the past, we're 
really confident su
bstantially up over 30%, we feel really good about that in 
terms of our content mix getting better and better.
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division
 
And, David, if I just may, can you maybe just talk about trends of usage and 
consu
mption of exclusive versus nonexclusive content, and maybe parlay 
that with the mix in your content cost between the 2?
 
David Wells
 
We're seeing engagement across both exclusive and nonexclusive 
categories. So in some cases, the exclusive content may cost 
more, but it's 
viewed more because it's worth more. The consumer doesn't 
--
 
isn't able to 
get that somewhere else. So you can infer from that, and some exclusive 
categories have higher viewing. But we're seeing user hours across 
nonexclusive content as wel
l. In fact, at this point in time, there's more 
nonexclusive content on Netflix than there is exclusive content, and our 
hours continue to go up. And then your second part of your question was 
around cost, is that right, Youssef?
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Cantor
 
Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division
 
Right.
 
David Wells
 
In terms of 
--
 
there's an expectation that we'll move to exclusive over time, 
and that means that the cost will be 
--
 
will pay more for exclusive content.
 
Youssef H. Squali 
-
 
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., 
Research Division
 
But you feel that you're 
--
 
basically, if you look at ROI for exclusive versus 
nonexclusive, you don't think the ROI on the exclusive is lower just because 
you're paying more for it?
 
David Wells
 
No. I mean, we look for engagement across t
hat category of exclusive, so 
we look for deals and types of content that works well relative in that 
exclusive class. And we think that there is a point where we're not going to 
be 100% exclusive, but we'll move more and more towards exclusive 
content as 
a differentiator. And it is important for us.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And, Youssef, it's Reed. You really want to keep in mind how many different 
flavors of exclusive there are. There's exclusive for online, there's exclusive 
against DVD, there's exclusive 
against cable 
--
 
cable with TV Everywhere 
and without. So there's a lot of different options and degrees as opposed to 
a simple nonexclusive, exclusive.

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
 
Douglas Anmuth

JP Morgan Chase & Co,
 
Research Division
 
Just wanted to ask a couple of things. In your letter, you talked about the 
long
-
term domestic market opportunity potentially being 2x to 3x that of 
linear HBO. And I'm just curious how you get there. So if we think about 
broadband house
holds, it would seem that the number is approaching the 
number of cable households, but at the same time, there's still a limited 
amount of time in the day and a limited amount of disposable income. So 
I'm trying to understand how you get comfortable with 
that market 
opportunity being 2x to 3x. And then secondly, can you just update us 
where you are in terms of your personalized plans, what you might do 
around dual streaming?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. In terms of the 60 million to 90 million, we've got that onlin
e strategy 
deck, which outlines some of this. But I'll run through it quickly, which is if 
you think about us versus linear HBO, we're able to be consumed on 
multiple platforms: laptop, tablet, phone. We're purely on demand with an 
on
-
demand brand. We have
 
much broader content range, including a lot of 
kid's content, and we have a lower price than HBO. So it's extrapolating 
those factors that make us feel comfortable about the 2x to 3x, or 60 million 
to 90 million. In terms of broadband households, we do ha
ve the assumption 
that all households become broadband households, and that, that will 
happen over the next 5 or 10 years. And so that doesn't become a practical 
limiter in the same way that cable is in every household. And so that we'll 
equal, essentially
, HBO in terms of addressable market, but because of lower 
price and the other factors have a larger actual market. And then on the 
personal stream plans, that's still something that's in development. We've 
been prioritizing some other things because it's 
a fairly minor issue, so 
maybe sometime this quarter and next quarter.
 
David Wells
 
I think you'll see some testing this quarter, and then depending on the 
actual performance of that, we'll role that out accordingly.

Our next question comes 
from Richard Greenfield from BTIG.
 
Richard Greenfield

BTIG, LLC, Research Division
 
A couple of questions. One, just the explosion of tablets. Reed, you talked 
before about how TV is still the primary viewing place that you need to get 
to, to drive your b
usiness. But we just with such 
--
 
we're seeing so many 
different companies launch ever cheaper and smaller tablets to get them 
into more people's hands across the globe. I'm just wondering how you think 
that tablet rollout impacts Netflix's subscriber grow
th over the course of the 
next couple of years relative to the importance you've place historically on 
the TV? And then just, too, somewhat related, you resigned from the 
Microsoft board. I just guess it would be 
--
 
a lot of people are curious what 
should 
we read into that, if anything?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. On the Microsoft board, I'm on 6 different boards, and I felt like this is 
a good time, because Microsoft is strong coming out with Windows 8, for me 
to trim that back and to focus more on Netflix. So tha
t's the story there. In 
terms of the tablet question, it's definitely growing for us. The question is, is 
it a straight substitute for a laptop as it grows, in which case it doesn't 
particularly affect us, or is it a net addition because it's a better cons
umption 
device than a typical laptop? We think there's some truth to the latter. The 
other scenario where tablets are really interesting are choosing on the tablet 
and then consuming on a TV. So one
-
second screen scenario that people 
talk about is you watc
h on the TV and then all the supplemental information, 
the history, the actors, et cetera, is on your tablet. And that's nice. But what 
we see is a big opportunity in using the power of touch to really choose what 
you want to watch, and then to be able to 
select it and then it's 
automatically playing on your TV. We've got a demonstration of that now on 
iPad and Android with the PS3, and then that's something we're working 
with all the CE ecosystem to build in so that over the next several years, this 
become
s a general capability for Netflix's choosing, which is to be able to get 
used to the power of touch in intimacy but then be able to enjoy the large
-
screen audio and video experience.

Just wanted to ask on the international stuff. How long would you stay in the 
market before you decided the profit potential wasn't worth the ongoing 
investment if things aren't going th
e way you thought?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Andy, there's very little chance of that happening because we've got long
-
term content deals that we pay on, so it's not an active topic. As long as the 
revenue growth is good and there's no competitor ahead of us where we 
have to face a decision of doubling down or not, it's clearly the right 
economic course to push forward and to derive the benefit. And we look at 
Latin America will be an awesome profit source for us with a great service 
over time, like it is for DirecTV t
oday. And then in the U.K., you know it's a 
more competitive dynamic, but we're really making great progress. And so 
both are really important to us. And of course, Canada, already, is very 
successful.

Question about your comments about Hulu and the release, talked about it 
being a wildcard. And you said in terms of U.S. viewing, Hulu is your closest 
competitor. And so I just wanted to ask a little more a
bout that. Is there 
anything that you can add as to why Hulu's programming is more 
substitutable for Netflix than, let's say, Amazon or HBO? And what makes 
them a global wildcard?
 
Reed Hastings
 
What makes them the wildcard is the ownership owned by 3 of 
the largest 
content companies in the world. And in terms of their viewing, I think 
they're closest to us because they focus on television like we do now, so 
they've got a good match in that way. And then they have the 
--
 
in addition 
to some of the TV shows
, they have some current seasons in sort of catch
-
up mode, where they have last 5 episodes and then it falls off the service. 
But 
--

And then one more. Just back to, I guess, one of the earlier questions about 
the studio output deals. It does just seem as though, with Epix and Starz 
and Fox and Warner, that many o
f the majors are spoken for. And so is 
there anything you can add to the comment that you plan to bid for further 
deals? Is it 
--
 
can you talk about other deals that could be coming up? Are 
they more so smaller studio output deals? Is it 
--
 
are we talking,
 
I guess, 
Universal could be coming up? Can you just give us a little more in terms of 
elaboration on that comment that you wrote?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. There's small ones potentially. Again, if we're 
--
 
I think you're 
probably asking U.S. because that's our
 
biggest market. In the U.S., there's 
some smaller ones that we can work on. And then there's Universal, Disney, 
Sony, all of which come up over the next 5 years. But none of them are 
going to change, they wouldn't be live for us on the new movies in the n
ext 
2 years. So I don't think it's probably hugely material to your

guys seen any change in attitudes on the content producers in light of some 
of the recent ratings weakness? Have they bee
n more eager to cut digital 
deals to kind of fiddle what may be a revenue shortfall, or are they 
becoming a little bit more weary? Any color would be helpful.

Tony, in terms of the regional penetration, we used to do that because on 
the 
DVD side, we had several years of overnight delivery in the San 
Francisco Bay Area but not the rest of the country, so it was several years 
ahead. There's not an equivalent market where we had streaming before 
another market. So we don't, internally nor ex
ternally, focus on a sort of 
market
-
level prediction. In terms of the content producers, you got a wide 
mix. You get 
--
 
some of you are concerned for all the reasons that you 
addressed, and some that are more interested in the digital revenue. So the 
great
 
news for us is there's no single producer that's a material part of our 
content. There's many different producers for many different companies. 
And so that helps us, and they're all looking for the best dollar, and then 
we're a bidder for that content.

Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.

Just wondering if you could give us a bit of an update in terms of what 
you're seeing in the device ecosystem going into the ho
liday season. What 
kind of device penetration you're expecting, both television and as well as 
--
 
as well as to the extent that there's a mobile metric that you could provide, 
as well, relative to what we saw last holiday season, particularly for the 
remot
e Netflix buttons?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Heath, it's Reed. I mean, we'll have more Netflix buttons on more Smart TVs 
than we've ever had. Smart TVs, as you know, are becoming a larger 
percentage of all TVs. It's becoming pretty standard and built
-
in, so that's a 
s
ignificant positive. There's the Wii U releasing shortly, that's a new game 
console. And so we'll see if that takes off and provides us a special lift. And 
then mobile is 
--
 
been very strong for several years and continues to be 
strong. I don't see a huge,
 
like, CE
-
related hockey stick to that part of the 
business.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Okay, that's going to be the last question for today. Reed, would you like to 
provide any closing remark?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I just want to thank you all for the questions. We're continuin
g to work very 
hard and look forward to being in a better place relative to our guidance a 
quarter from now. We certainly try very hard every quarter, and it doesn't 
feel great to come in, in the lower half. But it is what it is, and we're moving 
forward.

Question

Answer Session
 
Elli
e Mertz
 
[Operator Instructions]
 
So we're going to start with questions about subscriber metrics and our 
guidance. First question. How closely tied are hours viewed per subscriber 
and your subscriber metrics especially churn? Has there been any material 
imp
rovement in customer churn in domestic streaming? If not, why does not 
the higher engagement reflected in the higher hours translate into improved 
churn?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well absolutely, viewing and retention are connected. The more a subscriber 
uses Netflix
, the more that they stay a subscriber as you would expect, and 
there's significant variation between those who watch an hour a month, 10 
hours a month and 50 hours a month. And so, we're always trying to 
improve the experience, more content, better viewin
g, better streaming to 
increase the amount of viewing because then, subscribers prioritize the 
$7.99 for Netflix above other expenses.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You said in the letter that Netflix's goal was to become the world's most 
popular TV and movie service. Presu
mably, you're defining success by the 
number of global streaming subscribers. The bears [ph] believe that Netflix 
cannot become this large because at $8 a month, the company cannot 
compensate the content providers enough. Can you comment on this?
 
Reed Hast
ings
 
Well, we've been charging $8 a month for streaming for several years and 
we've continued to grow the subscriber growth and to grow the content. And 
we're basically continuing to execute on that game plan, and that's helped 
us grow very considerably. S
o I don't see what the issue is per se with an $8 
service if you get a lot of members, and that's what we're focused on: to be 
able to continue to build out the content.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
On guidance, I'm curious about the Olympic impact comment. In previous 
Oly
mpics, how much did the games impact subscriber growth?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, it's hard for us to gauge the Beijing 2008 Olympics because we had a 
3
-
day DVD outage right at the same time. I would say that we did feel some 
impact and there's uncertainty aroun
d whether that impact is permanent, 
meaning it's just a permanent reduction in acquisitions or if it's just a 
deferral through the games. So I would say that through the first 3 weeks of 
2012, we would have expected to be above 2010 levels, and what we're 
seeing is that we're nearly at 2010 levels, so it gave us some more 
uncertainty in terms of what Q3 would look like in terms of being at a 2010 
level of 1.8 million net addition.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A related question. You talked about some of the headwinds you're
 
facing on 
subscribers, including the Olympics this summer. Given these headwinds, 
what will it take to reach your full year goal for net adds? Another question, 
what are the risks in Q4 net add guidance to make that 7 million number?
 
David Wells
 
Well, I t
hink there's a number of puts and calls. There's Netflix's reputation. 
As that continues to build back, there's improvements that we make 
between now and Q4. Then there's all the Smart TV sales that are 
--
 
all the 
manufacturers are very focused on Q4. So t
hose would be all the positives. 
Negatives would be if there's a substantial new competition between now 
and then, other factors like that. Economic issues don't tend to affect us 
much because we're so 
--
 
such a good value so I don't think we have much 
ris
ks on up and downs in the economy.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A question on devices. Does the slowdown in game console and DVD players 
sales impact new streaming adoption? What about the slate of low
-
end 
tablets in the back half? How are you thinking about the benefits f
rom 
smaller and cheaper tablets?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We'll see, take 
--
 
to that second part first, on tablets. They're mostly used at 
this point as a laptop substitute, and so we don't see it as net incremental 
availability because everyone who's got a tablet, a
lso has a laptop and 
could've been using us on a laptop. And then Blu
-
rays, the question asked 
about DVD slowdown, that's true. But Blu
-
rays haven't yet slowed down. 
Presumably, they will eventually and most Blu
-
ray players can play Netflix 
and then the bi
g category growth is in Smart TVs.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you give us some color on U.S. streaming growth adds and churn during 
the quarter? Were both metrics as you expected? Was there a seasonal pick 
up churn?
 
David Wells
 
We hit the 
--
 
basically, right 
about the midpoint of the range. So yes, both 
churn and gross additions were as expected. We saw a seasonal 
--
 
a small 
seasonal decline in retention, which we have seen before from Q1 to Q2. So 
we're right where we thought we were going to be.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions about content. Has there been a shift in content 
acquisition away from large
-
scale buys to a more focused, cost
-
effective 
approach that targets lucrative niche areas such as kids TV, past seasons of 
original series such as Mad Men, not 
to mention your original programming. 
It appears that a more streamlined focus strategy can help rein in content 
costs while quite possibly, improving the streaming selection. In other 
words, is this a focus on quality over quantity?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well one
, we're not trying to rein in content costs. We're continuing to invest 
more and more each year in content. Two, there's no shift. We're always 
focused on what does a piece of content cost versus how much we think it's 
going to get viewed. And so, where yo
u see us get small or interesting films 
or TV shows, it's because we think the economics work in the amount we 
pay versus how much we think it's going to get viewed. And that's been 
consistent for several years.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What are your release plans for 
original programming? While consumers 
would clearly love you to follow the all
-
at
-
once strategy to enable binge 
viewing, that strategy appears far from ideal vis
-
a
-
vis churn. As 
disconnecting and connecting Netflix is so easy, how do you balance those 2 
dy
namics?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we're fundamentally focused on making it a great consumer experience 
and we do think it's an improved experience that only an on
-
demand service 
like Netflix can offer to have all the episodes at once. And so, we're going 
down th
at path. And I don't think there's a negative churn implication to it. I 
think there's a positive implication because it's a better and unique 
experience. And the more we develop compelling experiences, the bigger 
our market opportunity is.
 
David Wells
 
I w
ould also add to that, that our expectation is, if we're successful with our 
originals, that we'll have multiple launches. So the availability of one season 
of one particular title might be followed up by another title that becomes 
available.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And as an example of that, Lilyhammer season 2 which I know all of you are 
hanging on, is going to be available next year.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Another question on originals. You indicated you would ""blow away"" already 
impressive streaming hours when originals lau
nch in 2013. What gives you 
the confidence that it will not simply be a substitute for existing Netflix 
content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think what we've seen is growth in viewing that's just huge over the last 5 
years and we expect that growth in streaming to con
tinue, including the 
originals. And we've been very happy relative to the investment on 
Lilyhammer, and so we're feeling quite good about the rise of Arrested 
Development season 4, House of Cards and our other originals.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A final question on ori
ginals. Why have originals slipped to 2013 from late 
2012? Is production on schedule?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Production's on schedule for first quarter 2013, yes.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Streaming consumption seems to have swung heavily toward TV shows, and 
Netflix is benefiti
ng from having some high
-
profile exclusive TV content like 
Mad Men. Is this a core strategy or at the right price, would you shift your 
content dollars more aggressively back towards movies?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're in the business of providing great entertainm
ent to our members at a 
very low price and part of that is the programming strategy which is to 
acquire content, that relative to the dollars we pay for, gets viewed a lot. 
And we're agnostic as to whether that's features, TV, kids TV, different kinds 
of e
pisodic. And so where you see dollars shifting around, it's because that's 
where there's value to offer our subscribers. So yes, we would be totally 
open to getting good value, either on the features side, or on the many 
different types of television side,
 
including originals.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
It sounds like you'll have nonexclusive Epix content for one more year. Are 
current discussions on potential exclusivity complete? Any chance of keeping 
the content beyond 1 year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think it's just 
great content and we have it for the next year 
guaranteed and then we'll go from there. Certainly, it's working very well for 
both Epix and us at this point.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Another question on that. How would you expect Netflix to be impacted by 
the likely ap
pearance of Epix movies on competing services?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We wouldn't expect to be affected significantly. Epix is not a particularly 
large source of total viewing. Much more of our viewing is on our exclusives 
as was referenced, Mad Men, Breaking Bad a
nd such shows.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Do you think the recent renegotiations between MSOs and cable companies 
will negatively impact your access to content or the price will be apt to pay 
going forward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, we don't have that expectation.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Qu
estion on HBO. So why did you comment 
--
 
in the letter, you commented 
on working together with HBO. How would you work together with HBO? 
Would you license HBO programming and/or co
-
finance programming? 
Potential timing?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'm not sure what we 
would do. My point is that we're just another network, 
and that when you have multiple networks, they often find ways of working 
together. So it's a general point that it's not a zero
-
sum game between HBO 
and Netflix. And that, in fact, there may be ways o
f working together. But 
there's nothing particularly pressing.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Leading to a question on competition. How does Netflix plan on competing 
with growing online streamers? For example, with Amazon, Hulu and 
Google?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we've been com
peting with 2 of those. Google doesn't really have a 
subscription premium TV service at this point. And so, with Google, we 
advertise a lot on YouTube and we're one of the biggest advertisers there, 
which is very successful for us and for Google. In terms 
of Amazon and Hulu 
Plus, if you look at the Sandvine data on streaming usage in the U.S., we've 
got a huge lead and that lead is only growing.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to questions on internationals. What gives you the confidence that 
you can achieve breakeven, 
let alone profitability, in international markets 
outside of Canada, arguably the 51st state?
 
David Wells
 
Well, we've seen increasing engagement in those markets outside of the 
U.S., and we've seen our ability to improve our losses from Q1 to Q2. Now, 
we'v
e made the decision to raise our content spend in the U.K. like we did in 
Canada because we are encouraged by the results, the early results we've 
seen. So I think it's the ability for us to demonstrate the growth in those 
markets quickly and in the engage
ment in those markets that gives us the 
confidence that we can.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Do it and get the profit to breakeven and it's not just to breakeven and to 
substantial profitability.
 
David Wells
 
Correct.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Some of these are related 
questions. What would cause the company to slow 
its international plans down and concentrate on growing consolidated profits 
instead?
 
Reed Hastings
 
When we have finished our international expansion, we would certainly do 
that. But until then, our model, as
 
we've explained, is to get back to 
profitability and then open a new market, get back to profitability, open a 
new market. And that's based on the view that there's an extraordinary 
once
-
in
-
a
-
lifetime or once
-
in
-
a
-
generation opportunity to build a franchi
se in 
many markets as we've been building. And we think that our U.K., Ireland 
and LatAm expansions to date will, over time, prove to be very valuable and 
we'll all be very happy that we've done it.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
So doesn't this mean that the street should n
ot assume meaningful growth 
in reported net income for the next few years, the profits from new market 
launches offsetting rising profits in the rest of the business?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, that's completely consistent with what we've been saying. As long as 
t
here are good markets to enter around the world, that we would take the 
U.S. profits or the global profits and put them into faster international 
expansion.
 
David Wells
 
And I'd say just to round that out, the 3 conditions for additional expansion 
that we'v
e said before were: one, that we would get back to global 
profitability to a breakeven level; two, that we are pleased with the progress 
that we're making in our existing markets; and three, that there would be an 
additional market identified that we think
 
represents a good opportunity to 
expand.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Given the capital needs for launching new markets, particularly for content 
acquisitions, is income statement
-
based profitability the right metric to use 
in determining new market launches or is 
there a component of cash flow or 
cash balance that you should also use to determine the timing and size of 
new market launches?
 
Reed Hastings
 
If international was a user of cash outside the P&L, that could be true, but 
it's not. It's substantially neutral
 
between cash and P&L on international. The 
only big cash uses relative to P&L are the originals and some of the movie 
output deals. Anything else, David on...
 
David Wells
 
No, I'd say that 
--
 
I mean, there's a small 
--
 
a minor thing in Q2 where we 
had cont
ent added in the U.K. to the site that came in mid
-
quarter that was 
a small use of cash. But other than the mid
-
quarter, that's correct. We're 
--
 
our cash 
--
 
our content expense is matching our content cash, other than 
those exceptions you mentioned.
 
Ellie
 
Mertz
 
Do you have enough data to discuss whether or not the usage trends in the 
international markets differ compared to the U.S. via TV shows versus 
movies, amount of time spent watching, et cetera.
 
Reed Hastings
 
There are many interesting similarities a
nd differences. For competitive 
reasons, I'm not going to go into them.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In your letter under the Latin American section, you've stated you've 
modified your sign
-
up flow to improve free trial to paid conversions. Can you 
flesh that out for us an
d tell us exactly what you mean by that? What do you 
mean by modified in your sign up flow?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Why don't you answer that, Ellie?
 
Ellie Mertz
 
One of the challenges we have in Latin America is that there's great 
popularity for trying a free trial,
 
yet a month goes by and we try to run your 
credit card, your payment method and we can't get the payment method to 
run. So what we've done in Latin America is increase our upfront checks to 
make sure that when that free trial comes to completion, we have 
a valid 
payment method on trial. And so what we've done is increase the validation 
and seeing the results through improved conversion.
 
Turning to some questions on marketing. Given the solid earnings results, I 
would like to know if you believe you might h
ave been able to dial up a few 
more subscriber adds with the somewhat larger marketing budget. In other 
words, why did you decrease marketing expense quarter
-
over
-
quarter with 
net adds volume?
 
David Wells
 
So narrowly, yes, we could have but that 
would've been inefficient spend. 
Typically, marketing goes down from Q1 to Q2 because it's a less attractive 
quarter to acquire new subscribers.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Why do you emphasize content titles so much in the investor letter but not 
in your marketing?
 
Reed 
Hastings
 
In our marketing, we're really focused on try Netflix for free and then a 
consumer gets to experience the content. And so, it's a little different with 
investors. They already know of the content, they're generally users and 
what the content in th
e latter helps do is flesh out the picture of the new 
things that they might not otherwise be aware of. So they're sort of 2 
different audiences.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Some questions on your DVD business. Redbox Instant by Verizon unveiled 
its management team this m
orning. Does the coming Redbox Instant 
subscription offering increase the importance of your Netflix DVD business?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Our Netflix DVD business is very important, both amongst its 9
-
plus million 
members and for the profit it generates. We don't s
ee any change in that. 
The Redbox Verizon streaming subscription service will have a long way to 
go just to break through the top 3. So we'll see what happens as they 
launch.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
We've heard and read increasing complaints about extended wait times 
for 
Netflix DVDs. We are curious how DVD inventory per subscriber compares to 
your historic metrics and whether you are using DVD inventory as a margin 
lever.
 
David Wells
 
So we measure something called first choice here and have a long time, and 
I would sa
y that metric was flat through the second quarter. There are 
certain titles that you get caught in between content negotiation deals. And I 
would say HBO, for the HBO titles, were one of the only places you can 
actually get HBO through physical delivery. S
o we may be seeing some 
concentration of demand on those titles. In general, it's not a large profit 
lever for us because most of our shipments are catalog and I would say that 
the profit characteristics of that from Q1 to Q2 were more driven by reduced 
us
age that's seasonal, seasonally low in Q2.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How sustainable are the contribution margins for the DVD business going 
forward especially beyond this year?
 
David Wells
 
So what we said in the letter, it would be flat going through this year. I 
would
 
say with the postal increases that we expect going forward, there'd be 
a slight decline.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Of the 850k domestic DVD subscribers lost during the quarter, how many of 
those just dropped the DVD subscriptions but kept streaming or dropped 
from DVD 
to streaming?
 
David Wells
 
The migration patterns stayed consistent through Q2. We've got a bunch of 
people that joined the streaming service, some leave and come back as 
rejoins and a smaller percentage joined DVD only.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Question on the service 
offering. It seems that you are now more 
consistently policing the policy of limiting to 3 simultaneous streaming 
devices. Do you see revenue with the opportunity for family plans or 
additional personalizations?
 
Reed Hastings
 
To clarify the premise of the 
question, there's no limit on devices. There is a 
limit for a standard Netflix streaming, $8 streaming account on 2 concurrent 
streams. So of a couple, you can each watch one different show at the same 
time or kids can watch one and adults can watch anothe
r. And that's been 
consistent for several years, so it's been quite a while.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Does Netflix plan on streaming current episodes that were aired a few days 
ago to its customers for a small premium?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. We're really focused on 
prior seasons and helping the current content 
developers build audiences. This is what we've done with Breaking Bad and 
Mad Men and other shows that are quite serialized. And that's a good way 
for us to build out the total ecosystem. The only shows that we
 
would have 
fully current, we would have current and exclusive, will be our original 
series, House of Cards, Arrested Development season 4 and similar.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A question on streaming delivery and Open Connect. Open Connect already 
serves some 10% of N
etflix's streaming traffic. Can you break out the cost 
of hardware deployment so far or characterize the expected long
-
term cost 
savings? What pace of transition from third
-
party CDNs do you expect?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The cost savings will show up in the P&L mo
re than on the balance sheet, 
and timing is of over 
--
 
it will just continue to grow. The 10% will continue to 
rise every quarter, and then it partially depends on the economics. I'm not 
sure about 2 years from now, what the ratio will be. But we'll just c
ontinue 
to invest in Open Connect. It's a more efficient, more tailored single
-
purpose 
CDN for our needs.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Has Netflix changed its position with respect to paying MSO and telcos for 
preferred data access? Do you think this will evolve differentl
y for wired and 
wireless?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't have a position on paying for preferred access and we don't pay for 
preferred access.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A few questions on the financial statement. Why did the fully diluted share 
count increase from 55.5 million 
in Q1 to 58.8 million in Q2, a 5.9% jump?
 
David Wells
 
Because we swung to a profit. GAAP accounting would have you bake in the 
fully dilutive effects of the convert we did in November and that's not the 
case when you're at a loss 
--
 
in a loss position.
 
Ell
ie Mertz
 
What is the balance streaming content as of 6/30/12 that are currently 
reflected on the balance sheet?
 
David Wells
 
I think I know what you're asking, which is what is the minimum streaming 
obligations that are reported in our commitments table. La
st quarter, in Q1, 
it was $3.7 billion of long
-
term liabilities and obligations not reflected on the 
balance sheet. That's $3.8 billion, so roughly flat. If you include the $1.2 
billion in short
-
term liabilities, the total is $5 billion, corresponding to a
 
$4.8 
billion total in Q1. So again, up slightly.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
At this time, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator and we'll begin 
taking call
-
in questions.
 
Operator
 
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente 
from Barcla
ys.
 
Anthony J. DiClemente 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
I have 2 questions. First, for Reed, you've talked in the past about how TV 
Everywhere authentication is potentially a big long
-
term competitor for you. 
In a lot of negotiations between the co
ntent programmers and the 
distributors, digital, I think, has come into play and I don't 
--
 
whether it has 
to do with ratings declines. You could argue that the presence of some 
programming on Netflix is having a little bit of an erosive effect on linear T
V 
ratings or whether it's just the digital rights themselves. I think some of the 
distributors would like to have them in the traditional multichannel bundle. 
You, I think 
--
 
I think you said earlier that those negotiations should not or 
you do not expect 
those to impact pricing or availability of additional 
content. And so, I just wonder why not and why wouldn't they?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Anthony, it sounded like just one question. Did you say you had 2?
 
Anthony J. DiClemente 
-
 
Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Yes, I wanted to also ask about a comment that you made about 
profitability. I think you said that it would be either a couple or few years 
before you stopped reinvesting profits or contribution margin from the U.S. 
business into international. And so, we
're just trying to model earnings going 
forward and it sounded like you'd mentioned the company would be 
operating at breakeven for the next couple of years. So I wanted to clarify 
that too.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, it's true that modeling earnings, global 
earnings for Netflix for the next 
couple of years is a relatively easy task because as the U.S. and our 
profitable international expansion become positive, we'll tend to turn that 
money around and invest in additional markets. Back to your first question, 
think of it as it's whoever pays the most money. So if a content owner wants 
to make money, the most money possible, they'll offer those digital rights 
both to us and to the existing distributors and sometimes exclusive, one or 
the other or sometimes nonin
clusive to both. And then it's just a matter of 
who bids the most for the different content sources. And so, they've been 
active bidders, all the networks have, and as well as Amazon, Hulu Plus and 
others. So that's why I say there's no particular effect t
o say the recent 
battles between programmers and distributors because for several years, 
programmers have wanted to get as much money as they can, which they 
should. So there's no particular climate change in the last 3 months.
 
Anthony J. DiClemente 
-
 
Barc
lays Capital, Research Division
 
Could one potential climate change be that now the distributors have their 
own broadband distribution solution, whether it's Comcast X1 or a different 
sort of Netflix
-
like service that's in the multichannel bundle that now, 
they're 
clearly are paying so much more in overall affiliate fees that they could 
integrate or bring in the digital rights as a holistic package with the content 
that they're buying already such that they get the hometown discount. I 
guess that's the conce
rn.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes, it's a concern but ultimately, the programmer, if we offer $10 million 
and the programmer will then use that as leverage against the other 
distributors and say, ""Hey, we want at least $10 million more."" And so, 
again if you look at i
t from the producer's standpoint, having more bidders 
than the other distributors is good for the content owner because then 
there's more bidders at the table. And we've said from the beginning that we 
think TV Everywhere and improving MVPD is our long
-
ter
m competition and 
that thesis remains intact.
 
Operator
 
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Citi.
 
Mark S. Mahaney 
-
 
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
 
I wanted to follow up on 2 things. First, Reed, I know somebody asked you 
earlier about tablets b
ut I wonder if I could draw you out just on the impact 
of smaller tablets. I know we've had very few in the market, but your 
thoughts on what kind of impact that could have, maybe overall, to video 
streaming. That would seem to be less cannibalistic or sub
stitutable, 
whatever the word is for laptops? And then secondly, could you just go over 
again the personalized plan options or the revenue opportunities new, if you 
have any, that come from the simultaneous 
--
 
the extensive simultaneous 
streaming you're cu
rrently seeing amongst your user base?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. On the smaller form factors, if they're Wi
-
Fi connected, they're used in 
the home in pretty similar situations to how a laptop might be used. And as 
they come in, it makes a better viewing experien
ce, the battery life is better, 
they're easier to hold so that would be a mild positive. There's certainly 
nothing negative about it. It's just not a revolutionary new way to watch. 
Whereas for example, a mobile phone when you can watch out of the home 
sub
ject to the data caps, that's more impactful. And then on personal 
streams, think of it as, let's see, today, what we offer is a 2 simultaneous

stream program and some large families, that doesn't work for. They'll have 
3 or 4 simultaneous streams going to
day, and what that family has to do 
today is get 2 Netflix accounts. And then they have to partition their devices, 
some set of TVs only work on one account and some set of TVs work on the 
other account. And ultimately, we want to help those families save 
money by 
being able to offer a family account, which has more than 2 simultaneous 
streams. So I wouldn't model it as a revenue opportunity. If anything, it 
would be a discount for those families in a lower price for more consumption. 
But in whether it's a 
slight reduction or slight increase, it's very much on the 
margin.

The next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer &

So you talked about streaming 
--
 
the increas
ed streaming usage helping to 
reduce or increase actually, member retention. I mean, can you talk 
directionally 
--
 
I mean, over time, one would imagine that we get to some 
type of 75% retention rate, which is typically what we see at subscription 
services.
 
If you could just talk about direction, are we going in the right 
place and do you see that as a potential level over time? And then secondly 
on the international front, you do talk a lot about the letter. Most of us know 
about the competition in the U.K.
 
but can you talk about the competitive 
environment in Latin America?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. In terms of retention, it'll sound strange but we really don't focus on it 
that much. We want to make it really easy for people to come in and out of 
the service, to g
ive consumers a sense of control. At a high income level, 
consumers don't care about that, they just leave it on. But at a lower income 
level, they really value that ability. And so what we focus on instead is total 
net additions in any period or any geogr
aphy. So that as there's more and 
more positive word of mouth about Netflix, we get more and more net 
additions. In terms of LatAm competition, there's a couple of streaming 
companies, one in Brazil, 1 or 2 in Mexico. Some of them do pay
-
per
-
view, 
some of 
them do subscription. Telefónica has an offering also. So there's a 
wide variety of competition. But none of it with the global scale and the 
ability to invest in the R&D to be able to have really incredible streaming and 
choosing experiences. So we think 
we have a really big advantage over any 
single nation firm that tries to compete.

I was hoping you could speak to the drop in 
amount of content acquisition in 
the cash flow. You alluded to earlier that the spread between you and 
Amazon is growing on title count and it does look like it's up substantially I 
guess, in the U.S. in the last 3 months. Are you just getting better terms
 
or 
can you discuss why you guys have seen such a nice improvement there?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I just want to correct you. There's been no reference to 
--
 
relative to 
Amazon in terms of title count. So the reference is in terms of viewing hours 
as judged by the S
andvine or other reports about Internet streaming. And 
then you want to handle the cash flow?
 
David Wells
 
I mean, in terms of the cash flow, basically, the increased commitments 
would indicate that we were adding content through the quarter, but that 
conte
nt was coming on the balance sheet and off the amount that wasn't 
recognized or net recognition criteria before. So I don't think you can 
conclude from the cash flow that we got better deals.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And then just adding on to my prior answer on LatA
m competition, piracy is 
one of the biggest competitors and I didn't mention that. In each country, 
there are pretty developed piracy networks and that's a significant source of 
competition.

Second question is you guys haven't acquired anybody in the past. What 
would it take for you guys to consider acquiring your way into new 
countries? And to flip that around, what triggers would you need to see to 
consider merging with somebody?
 
Reed Hastin
gs
 
We haven't given that a ton of thought. As you pointed out, in 14 years, 
we've never acquired anyone. I don't know that we would never do it, but it 
would be a pretty high bar for us to want to do that versus do what we do 
best and continue to grow orga
nically.

I wanted to make sure I was understanding what you said in your letter 
correctly about Epix. You said ou
r online exclusivity expires shortly. Does 
that mean you've decided not to pay more money to retain exclusivity for 
the balance of the contract? And if that's in fact, your decision, I was 
wondering if you could talk about why you chose to do that.

what we put in the letter.

Okay. Well if I could try one other question then. You spoke about the 
Beijing Olympi
cs. What about the Winter Olympics? Did that have any effect 
on subscriber growth a couple of years ago?
 
David Wells
 
It had a small negative effect in terms of as much as we could discern from 
it.
 
Reed Hastings
 
You can see, Barton, that people are viewing 
the Olympics impartially 
instead of viewing Netflix, which you 
--
 
it's harder to tell is do you make that 
up in the balance of the time period and sort of delay. But there's definitely, 
during those 10 or 14 days, people are shifting some consumption there
. 
And we saw that on a lesser level with Euro Cup. And when 
--
 
an interesting 
anecdote is when the U.K. was in the Euro Cup, our viewing was at a certain 
level, and then they got knocked out of the Euro Cup and Netflix viewing 
expanded sharply like the nex
t day. So that's to kind of give you an eye of 
the sort of substitutability of, I'm looking for entertainment, and if my 
nation's team is competing well, then there's less viewing.

It's working very we
ll for us in the U.K. We're continuing to learn and 
expand that approach around the world outside of the U.S. And then as you

JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
 
Just wanted to ask 2 things. I apologize if I missed this but on Amazon, 
you've talked in the past about them potentially be
coming more of a 
standalone competitor, breaking away sort of with prime video. Any updates 
there on your view? And then secondly, can you give us any kind of color on 
how we should think about content costs going forward given that you won't 
have the excl
usivity with Epix?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Doug, on the Amazon question, I assume that will eventually break it out of 
prime, but our view is that they would do that earlier this year hasn't yet 
proven to be true. So I don't have any further update on that. And then
 
any 
cost savings from going nonexclusive on Epix, we would tend to turn around 
and invest in other content to continue to have more content. And consistent 
with the 100 basis
-
point growth in contribution margin.

Our next question comes from Nat S
chindler from Merrill Lynch.
 
Nathaniel Schindler

BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Two quick questions. One, about a year ago, you guys were saying that 
exclusivity in content usually costs about 1.3x to 1.5x what just access to 
the content, nonexclu
sive rights costs. Is that holding true now that Amazon 
has become aggressive in buying and wouldn't you expect it to rise if 
Amazon is, in fact, buying a lot of the similar content that you are? And then 
I have another quick question after that.
 
Reed Hast
ings
 
Nat, yes, you're right. You would expect it to rise as there are more bidders 
and anecdotally, that can happen in some places and not in others. It really 
depends on the type of content.
 
Nathaniel Schindler 
-
 
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
 
Okay
, great. And the other quick question I had was a little bit on your 
decision on where and which countries to move into and when. I noticed that 
you're making a move into another European country in Q4, and you made 
the move 
--
 
the big move into the U.K. a
nd after earlier, had said that the 
U.K. probably wasn't one of the best markets for you to move into early on. 
As I look at both the U.K. and a lot of the other European markets, their 
viewing habits for TV content and their willingness to pay for TV cont
ent 
given 
--
 
based on their history of pay TV, are pretty light in compared to the 
U.S. and Canada. Wouldn't it make sense more to go after countries where 
they have a bigger history of that and a history of viewing more TV content 
in general, much more li
ke the U.S., maybe something like Australia?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We see a big opportunity in Europe to provide an on
-
demand service, the 
likes of which really have not been seen. It's very different than just another 
linear ad
-
supported network. And while Austra
lia is indeed a great 
opportunity, it's relatively isolated. And so for now, we're focused on Europe 
because we've been extremely pleased with the U.K. launch and with the 1 
million subs in the first 6.5 months. So we really are feeling quite good 
about ou
r competitiveness in Europe.
 
David Wells
 
And I would say, Nat, you were referencing earlier, anxiety or worries 
around the U.K. competitiveness balanced with the pros of it being a more 
developed market, more device penetration, more online viewing. And so
, 
that was the sort of debate we were having about developed versus 
developing markets and the relative pros and cons in going into each. And 
Europe obviously has more developed markets that have much more 
attuned factors for people to watch online viewing
.

I was wondering if you could give us a sense in the markets where you have 
been able to leverage Facebook 
integration and obviously realizing that 
those are all very early markets for you in general, what kind of response 
you've seen? And then within the U.S., has Facebook or even social in 
general, the Netflix Twitter account is particularly active, have thos
e become 
meaningful channels for either paid or pre

customer acquisition for you?

Heath, it's Reed and I would say social, around the world both on our efforts 
in the U.K. and Ireland and in terms of our usage of social media in the U.S. 
have
 
continued to expand like they have for all of our peer firms. So I don't 
think there's anything inconsistent or surprising in that, which is the society 
is evolving to becoming more socially

the Internet is becoming more social

Susquehanna Financial Group, LLL

Just wanted to clarify first, did I understand correctly that when you were 
answering Anthony's question, you said that you most likely will not be 
profitable on consolidated basis because of international investment for 
2013?
 
Reed Has
tings
 
We haven't guided to that. What I said is consistent with what we've said for 
the last about half dozen calls, which is our basic model is to become 
profitable again on a quarterly basis as we have last quarter, and expect to 
this quarter, Q3 and the
n to add an additional international market, which 
generally drives us negative slightly and then through growth in the profit 
streams, gets us back to positive. And that's what meters our rate of 
international investment, is to stay approximately breakeve
n or sort of in 
and out of profitability.
 
David Wells
 
And I've said earlier that the 3 conditions upon which we'd launch another 
market would be that global breakeven, that we were pleased with the 
progress that we're making in our existing international m
arkets, and that 
we'd identified a third market or an additional market. The third condition 
being we'd identified an additional market.

That would be 
--
 
would it be fair to say that yo
u have more than one target 
market in mind at this point?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Our basic view is that as the Internet becomes very global, and as an 
example of this, if you look at YouTube viewing around the world, that 
there's no reason why an on
-
demand service 
for movies and TV shows like 
Netflix shouldn't be highly successful. In general, China would be difficult for 
us as you would all appreciate. And then any nation that has extreme online 
piracy would be difficult. But outside of those 2 conditions, most of 
the world 
will have services like Netflix and we would like to be that service.

remarks?

1/27/11,Netflix,"Good day, everyone, and Welcome to the Netflix Fourth Quarter 2010 
Earnings Q&A Session. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I 
will turn the call over to Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor 
Relations. Please go ahead.
 
Erin 
Kasenchak
 
Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix Fourth Quarter 2010 
Earnings Q&A Session. We announced our financial results for the fourth 
quarter at approximately 1:05 p.m. Pacific time today. The shareholder 
letter and the Q4 financial r
esults and the webcast of this Q&A session are 
all available at the company's Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.com.
 
As is our standard practice, this call will consist solely of Q&A and we are 
going to conduct the Q&A via e
-
mail. Please e
-
mail your
 
questions to 
IR@netflix.com.
 
We may make forward
-
looking statements during this call regarding the 
company's future performance. Actual results may differ materially from 
these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A 
detailed 
discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report 
on Form 10
-
K filed with the Commission on February 22, 2010. A 
rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available
 
at the Netflix website after 
6:00 p.m. Pacific time today. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to turn the 
call over to Reed.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Thanks, Deborah. I'd just like to acknowledge that Barry McCarthy has been 
our CFO and my partner for the last 11 yea
rs, and there's no way we 
would've gotten to 20 million subscribers as fast as we did without his 
incredible work. And I'm thrilled to be able to introduce to you, David Wells, 
who's our new CFO.
 
David Wells
 
Great. Thanks, Reed. This is David. I'm glad to 
be joining on the earnings 
call this afternoon. I've got quite a legacy to follow. I've been part of the 
Netflix team for seven years and in the background of this call for many of 
those years. So I look forward to speaking to many of you in the coming 
wee
ks. But I know that you're here for Q&A, so let's get to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The first question is from Youssef Squali of Jefferies & Company. How should 
we think about overall content spend in 2011 versus 2010 mix of 
in
ternational and domestic digital rights?
 
David Wells
 
Youssef, I can actually take that. This is David. I think you should mostly 
think of it as domestic. If you think about the guidance that we gave for Q1 
and you scale that for Q2, and you think about the
 
$50 million operating loss 
we talked about in Q3 and 4, it's not hard to get to a position where most of 
that spend is domestic.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Arthuros Mangriotis at Fox Point Capital 
Management. Please elaborate on your decis
ion to reduce focus on churn. 
Even though net additions are ultimately the important statistic, I would've 
thought that managing churn would be a great way to make sure you are 
satisfying your customers.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Arthuros, it's Reed here. I guess, I'd
 
say, you don't really manage churn. 
You manage satisfaction. And then from higher satisfaction comes more 
word
-
of
-
mouth, driving SAC down and new starts up and churn down. And 
what I've come to realize over the years is that net adds is really the best 
in
dicator of that. And this evolution in our part reflects an internal evolution 
over the past couple of years, where I find myself not particularly paying 
attention to churn, in fact, and much more to net adds, which again is the 
best indicator of the satis
faction. And so that's the underlying reason for the 
evolution.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Heath Terry at Canaccord Genuity. How do 
marketing deals like the Netflix button on remote controls compare to your 
existing subscriber acquisition c
ost level?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Heath, we don't know for sure yet, because I guess we would say, we don't 
know the effectiveness of the buttons. It feels like a great option. And once 
they're in the market, which will be in the middle of this year and then more 
l
ater in the year, we'll be able to study really how much consumers use 
them. So we're optimistic on it. We think it's a great direction, but we don't 
have any hard evidence yet and we won't probably for a year.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Second question from Heath. 
Is the improving market for online advertising 
impacting your online SAC level?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Not substantially, Heath. It's been pretty steady for us. The big thing that 
improved SAC is that we didn't spend that much on marketing in the 
quarter, because i
t was earning so much on streaming. And when you spend 
less on marketing, you can think of it as skimming the market or you can 
think of it as we get the flow
-
over from the prior quarters kind of brand build 
up, it carries us. And when we go into Q1, we'll
 
spend a little more in 
marketing. In fact it'll be a little higher. So it's generally in the right direction 
but not as low as it was in Q4.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next set of questions are from Mark Mahaney at Citi Investment 
Research. First question, what
 
can you disclose about the overall usage 
patterns of streaming only or streaming mostly subscribers versus your 
DVD
-
rental subscribers? Do they end up consuming materially more video 
content or about the same?
 
David Wells
 
Mark, this is David. In 
general, we don't parse out the behavior. But you can 
imagine that people that are coming in streaming only or mostly interested 
in streaming will consume more than the folks on a hybrid plan. But I will 
say that across the board on those plans, people do 
tend to consume more 
video when they do participate in streaming. So for the folks that avail 
themselves of the streaming offering, their overall video consumption goes 
up.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
And the next question from Mark, can you provide more color on how
 
you 
were able to drive down SAC and whether you believe the current level is 
sustainable?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Mark, I think I just had that question before. So let's go to the next one.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Our next question is why would operating margins decline f
rom 15% Q1 
domestic items to 14% full year guidance?
 
David Wells
 
Mark, this is David. 14% is a target. So some quarters, it might be 13%, 
some might be 15%. I think we addressed in the earnings letter why we're 
going to be a little bit heavy in Q1. We've i
dentified a trend in our growth in 
shipments a little bit two
-
way to put that to work to streaming. And so we 
put a lot of it to work in marketing and we'll be a little bit heavy on income 
in Q1.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Ben Rose at Battl
e Road Research. Are the cable 
service providers diving into role of competitors or are other any scenarios 
under which you might partner with them?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The thing with the cable company, we've got a natural partnership with the 
broadband services
 
group, which is highly profitable and wants to increase 
their reach and the speed at which their consumers buy packages. So with 
the broadband side, there's a complete natural partnership. With the video 
side, we're a channel, we're sort of tolerated. We'
re not a big threat, but it's 
hard to see why it makes sense for them to help us grow.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from David Miller at Caris & Company. Reed, against the 
backdrop of other distribution services sitting up for the content in the 
strea
ming window, what is your feeling about either acquiring an equity 
interest in the studio or at the very least, starting one yourself? With 
creative financing, you could produce script
-
driven content on your own at 
very little cost relative to the size of 
your P&L?
 
Reed Hastings
 
David, generally, I'm a believer in circle of competance and it's really easy 
for companies as they grow to step out of that. And in particular, when we 
start taking creative risks, that is reading a script and guessing if it was 
go
ing to be a big hit and who might be good to cast in it, it's not something 
that as fundamentally a tech company or a company run by a tech CEO like 
myself is likely to build distinctive organizational competance in. And so we 
think that we're better off o
n letting other people take creative risks, get the 
rewards for when they do that well. And then what we do is focus on 
matching the different products that are made with the right consumers the 
sort of very technological aspect of matching it and streamin
g it. So I would 
say, that the scenario that you outlined would be quite a change in direction 
and quite unlikely.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next couple of questions are from Ryan Hunter at Wedge Partners. First, 
the latest report from the HIF Screen Digest say
s home video content, 
DVDs, DD and VOD, down about 4% to $18 billion in 2010 from $19.2 billion 
in 2009. Has this been the trend for the past few years 
--
 
this has been the 
trend for the past few years. At what point does the market opportunity 
contract an
d start to impact Netflix?
 
David Wells
 
I'd say in general, Ryan, that VOD space, we've gotten this question time 
and time again, there's a lot of competitors in the VOD space. We've seen it 
in the fourth quarter, as actually being a benefit through our 28
-
day deals. 
We've been a year with the 28
-
day deals. We've seen record, low churn, 
record low SAC and record growth for us. I think it's working for us. I'm sure 
you saw the Redbox announcement in the fourth quarter. They're a little bit 
new
-
release centric
. So I think it hit them disproportionately. But I think 
what you're seeing is that an increase in the VOD as a result of the dynamics 
of the marketplace today.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Second question from Ryan. How is a gift recipient accounted for in the 
subscr
iber count? What was the impact from the gift subscription promotion 
during the holidays? And what is the expected churn rate for these 
subscribers?
 
David Wells
 
Ryan, I can take that. This is David. Gift subscribers are accounted in the 
subscriber count at
 
the point where they actually enter the service, and once 
they actually redeem their certificate. The impact from gift subs relative to 
last year was relatively flat with 2009. So there's not a whole lot of impact. 
The majority of the growth that we saw i
n this fourth quarter was not related 
to gift subs. And then expected churn rate for these subs, we don't generally 
comment on different segments of the business. But as you can imagine, 
they're retained at slightly lower rates than somebody who comes in a
nd 
pays directly.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Nat Schindler of BofA Merrill Lynch. Has Amazon's 
acquisition of LOVEFiLM affected your plans to enter Europe? And what 
competitive advantages do you have over Amazon LOVEFiLM in the U.K. and 
Eur
ope?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Obviously, Amazon was in DVD rental 
before, sold that interest to LOVEFiLM, and then bought back the whole 
company. And I think we're just going to have to take a couple quarters and 
see what 
they plan to do with it. And in the meantime, it doesn't directly 
affect our plan. There's vigorous competition in all these markets. So we're 
full speed ahead on our plans.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Imran Khan at JPMorgan. Could you please gi
ve us 
some color on what percentage of streaming content consumption is 
television shows versus movies?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. What we said before is, it's roughly half
-
and
-
half now, and there's 
some variation quarter to quarter. But that's a rough range.
 
Deb
orah Crawford
 
Next one is from Ingrid Chung at Goldman Sachs. You've spoken about 
geographic expansion beyond Canada in the second half of this year. If you 
can't tell us which countries specifically are most interesting to you, could 
you tell us what some
 
of the characteristics are of an attractive market other 
than high broadband penetration? Would you want to be in a market with 
high or low pay
-
TV penetration, or does that matter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Ingrid, it's a more complicated question as you probably und
erstand than 
just pay
-
TV or not. It's really the best use of the dollars for building a 
business in a country that is likely to be a sustainable source of profit. And 
so that's a mix of how competitive it is, how good the broadband is, what 
content rights 
we can get, what's the economic growth rate, what's piracy. 
Boy, there's a whole ton of factors underlying that. What I would say is 
wherever we go next is just one building block, and our hope is to be able to 
go country by country and to expand quite rap
idly in 2012 and 2013, 
assuming we continue to see the kind of success that we've seen in Canada.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next couple of questions are from Brian Fitzgerald at UBS. Can you give 
us a sense of how the newer free subs are converting to paying su
bs from 
Canada or from most free subs that are part of the extended four
-
week 
offer? How does that differ from the historic conversion rate?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I would say, Brian, as we grow, we would expect 
--
 
and with streaming only, 
it's a little more casual
 
relationship that is it's easy to get in and easy to get 
out. And that, that is going to tend to inflate growth adds and inflate churn. 
Again, the net adds come out of the same place, but you get 
--
 
that's how it 
affects those two metrics.
 
Deborah Crawfor
d
 
And then the second question, any initial impact you're seeing to churn 
based on the recent pricing changes?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, nothing material.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Jason Cheu with ABR Investment Strategy. Generally 
speaking, what perc
ent of new sub adds in the quarter were driven by 
Internet connected video
-
game consoles versus mobile devices such as 
smart phones and tablets? How important are these devices for your 
international expansion?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Jason, we don't break out how 
-
-
 
which of those are driving our marketing. 
And I would say, they're all important in international expansion, 
proportional really to the size of their installed base in a given country.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Couple of questions from Daniel Ernst at Hudson Squa
re Research. In your 
letter to investors, you discussed the desire to work with studios to have 
content cash outlays, better matching expensing, which I presume would 
mean lower upfront cost and better scaling with usage and subscribers. Are 
there other ex
amples in content licensing that you can model that plan 
after? On the flip
-
side, TV syndication deals do require substantial upfront. 
Therefore, what is the prospect for getting content owners to cede upfront 
payment?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Almost all of our deals
, Daniel, right now, match cash with expense and you 
see that in our cash flow for Q4. So it's really just a question of each 
--
 
the 
two side's relative cost of capital. And most of the studios and content 
owners, they do with that lower cost of capital th
an we do. So it's not that 
hard an issue.
 
David Wells
 
If I can add something 
--
 
this is David. We have been able to get a number 
of deals, where the payment terms are matching the expense. So it's not 
like there's not a precedent out there. As you pointed 
out in the syndication 
market, we're evolving with that marketplace.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer & Co. In your 
comments, you talk about the current $7.99 per month plan. It's for one 
stream at a time even 
though today, the company does not limit concurrent 
stream. Is there any data you can share about what percentage of the 
households run concurrent streams today? Secondly, if you were to think 
about family
-
plan economics, what type of price points seem lik
e a fair value 
to you?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We don't have specifics on the number of concurrent streams, Jason. And 
think of it as if there's one concurrent instance in the year, that subscriber or 
that household is unlikely to spend to get a separate account. Th
ere has to 
be a pretty frequent conflict. And so it's not how many concurrent instance 
is. It might be related to for example, how many people have more than 
multi
-
concurrent stream per week or something that will affect how well we 
can drive the evolution
 
to individual accounts. And when you talk about 
family economics, we'll test a range of scenarios and try to figure out the 
consumers' view of what's a fair and appropriate option. But that will be 
second half of this year at earliest and may flip into 20
12 before we get into 
that.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question from Steve Rivers [ph] at Stifel, Nicolaus. Can you provide 
details on how many subscribers stream via Watch Instantly during the 
quarter? Can you provide any details regarding Watch Instantly util
ization in 
the Bay Area as well as the rest of the country?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We can tell you, Steve, it's continued to increase like it had in the prior 
quarters. There's been no real change in the trend. And that it's great in the 
Bay Area, great in the rest
 
of the country, and generally streaming has 
continued its tremendous growth for us.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Usually, you provide the stock comp expense associated with several 
categories of the P&L. You did not provide this information this quarter. Are 
you 
changing your reporting policies? And if not, can you provide that data?
 
David Wells
 
Steve, this is David. No, there's no cause for alarm. That information will be 
continued to report in the Q and the K in the footnote. It's just a matter of 
cleaning up th
e earnings release, trying to get in some real estate.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Doug Anmuth at Barclays. How would you potentially 
implement the shift from a household service to that of an individual 
subscriber? Is there any data you can sha
re with us on simultaneous 
streaming? And is this a good strategic thing to do in the face of potentially 
more streaming competition? What do you view as the core benefit to 
individual subscribers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
The question really is, Doug, is video natur
ally because of the portable 
devices, the laptops, the pads, the phones, an individual relationship like e
-
mails and individual relationship for mobile phone. And somewhat it is, and 
somewhat it isn't because of the use of the shared screens also. And so w
hat 
we have to do is try some things with subscribers to see how comfortable 
that notion of a personal subscription really is and what are the advantages 
in terms of increased personalization, better Facebook integration, some sort 
of a relationship compar
ed to the complexities of it. But we would certainly 
like to 
--
 
we'll be working towards having it evolve to be an individual 
relationship over time.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question from Doug. I understand the business is changing in realtime, 
but can you e
xplain in more detail why you're not guiding for the full year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
One, I think in general, we found our guidance from last year was so far off, 
that I'm not sure it's very relevant that, that business is moving so quickly. 
So we did give some g
uidance for the year that we expect net adds to 
continue to grow and margin. But how much it grows, I think, from last 
year, you can clearly see that we're not a distinguished authority. So that's 
really the reasoning behind it.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
And finall
y from Doug. Canada, do you believe usage
-
based pricing among 
broadband providers in Canada is having any impact on Netflix subscriber 
count for overall usage? Do people fully understand that they might need to 
pay more for broadband when using Netflix?
 
Re
ed Hastings
 
It's something, Doug, we're definitely worried about. And my sense is that 
those Canadians with capped and $1 or $2 per gigabyte overcharges, many 
of them probably don't understand their plan, and it will take a billing cycle 
or two for them, a
nd that is potentially a significant negative for Netflix. The 
shame of it is that the marginal cost, as we wrote in the letter to deliver a 
marginal gigabyte over wired network is extremely small, well less than a 
$0.01. So hopefully, we can work with the
 
different consumer groups and 
providers, and get a better costing structure, where if there are pay per 
gigabyte charges, they're more in the $0.01 range or they're bundled in with 
a much higher cap like exists in the U.S. and in many other nations.

Next question is from Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets, another 
Canadian question. Regarding Canada, how long will it take to get to 
comparable penetration rates in Canada as compared to the U.S.?
 
David Wells
 
Doug (sic) [Edward] this is D
avid. We don't talk specifics, but it's not hard to 
see from our guidance for Q1 that Canada is growing much faster than we 
did in the U.S. So in terms of putting an actual number out there, I don't 
think we'd be willing to talk to that. But suffice to say
, is we're going much 
faster in Canada than in the U.S.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Zachary Turnage at the Harbert Value Fund. Why 
did AP increase so much?
 
David Wells
 
Zachary, this is David. AP increase, if you look at the balance 
sheet and the 
cash flow statement, you'll notice that we had a significant increase in the 
investment in our streaming content library and so a couple of these were 
large payments that are at a short timing at the end of the quarter that 
should reverse the
mselves in Q1.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Richard Greenfield at BTIG. As you move away from 
your DVD buy
-
now business, what do you foresee as your greatest 
competitive advantage in streaming as we presume at some point, 
competition will actuall
y materialize and it does not appear that the vast 
majority of your content is exclusive?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Richard, it's Reed. I think our primary competitive advantage is the 
subscriber base, and that allows us to get more content on a fixed cost basis 
to do
 
more R&D, to market more. So there's a lot of virtual cycles around 
the subscriber base size that we referred to in the letter. And that's how I 
would look at the primary competitive advantages.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Doug Mitchelson a
t Deutsche Bank Securities. Do 
you believe that it will get harder to acquire incremental films and TV shows 
from major Hollywood studios? And where are you in quantity today? And 
where would you hope to be in a few years?
 
David Wells
 
Doug, no it's not got
ten harder. It's gotten easier as we pay more. Three or 
four years ago when we couldn't pay much, it was very hard. And now, 
because we got significant dollars to spend, we got people coming to us and 
that makes perfect sense. So we're feeling great about 
both our ability to 
make content owners a lot of money and get deals done and continue to fill 
out and improve our selection.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Another question from Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer. Do you think Netflix' 
success is what is hurting Redbox? Ar
e you willing to comment on what hurt 
consumer demand for their products in Q4? And does this make a Redbox 
partnership more or less likely?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I'm pretty confident that our success is not what's hurting Redbox, because 
DVDs were barely up for u
s. And I think the Redbox it was up 30% or 
something. So I think those are really unrelated issues. And of course, our 
streaming content is not the newest DVD releases and that's what Redbox 
focuses on, is the newest DVD releases. But I don't really have m
ore to say 
than that about Redbox. You also asked, does that make a partnership more 
or less likely. I don't think it was ever that likely. We are super focused on 
streaming and unlimited streaming. They're focused on new release DVD 
and they do a great jo
b at what they do.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question from Steven Frankel at Dougherty. What's the timing on 
introducing the Facebook innovation?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We'll be rolling that out in phases over this year, sort of quarter
-
by
-
quarter 
and month
-
by
-
month it
 
will get better and better and better.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
And second question from Steven Frankel, at 20 million subscribers and 
growing, you have the scale to compete head
-
to
-
head with the traditional 
pay
-
TV services for first
-
run movies. As the studio dea
ls with HBO and 
others expire, is that likely that Netflix competes for titles on an exclusive 
basis?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It certainly is possible that we would compete on an exclusive basis. We're 
willing to do that if we have to. But we think it can make more 
economic 
sense for us and pay television to share windows conceptually, each paying 
2/3 and the studio getting 1 1/3 of what they're getting in the past. So we 
tend to try to look for deals like that to make the content owners more 
money, and allow the oth
er aggregators to pay a little less. But we're 
basically very flexible and just trying to find good ways to expand the 
content.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
From Michael Olson at Piper Jaffray, where will most of the OpEx for 
international fall? Will it be in marketin
g for the Netflix brands that is less 
well known?
 
David Wells
 
Mike, this is David. I'd say that you can roughly 
--
 
I think, what we said in 
the past is that each international investment is split largely between 
marketing and streaming content and that wil
l hold in the future.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Barton Crockett at Lazard regarding international 
expansion. When you look at countries to expand into, do you see any 
desirable countries with meaningful incumbent providers of online 
subscription streaming services that you'd have to compete with? How does 
competition and the risk of losing Battle factor into your choice of countries 
to enter.
 
David Wells
 
Barton, as you would expect it's one of the factors. Typically in the markets 
tha
t are the biggest prize, already there's vigorous competition and so it's a 
trade
-
off there. So we'll try a variety of things over the years both in 
markets that already have competitors, also in the markets that don't of the 
type that you're describing. S
o I'd say, we tend to try to put our money in 
play, where we think it's got the best chance of a big sustainable return. And 
as I mentioned earlier to Ingrid, there's a lot of factors that go into that.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Jim Friedl
and at Cowen. Are you using AWS in 
Canada? Will you be able to use AWS in future international launches?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Sure. AWS is very global already, and we'll continue to use AWS.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Ken Johnson, an individual invest
or. What is your 
perspective on national growth in non
-
English speaking markets? Would 
Netflix consider licensing a significant amount of non
-
english content of 
streaming to countries like India and/or China, perhaps the Spanish
-
speaking world?
 
Reed Hastin
gs
 
Sure. We don't limit ourselves in terms of our circle of competence to 
English
-
language content. In fact, we're a very big licensor of foreign 
content already for the U.S. market. And we feel very comfortable licensing 
content for a variety of cultures 
and tastes. And really, it's our global 
process knowledge and our technology that's globally relevant. And by 
technology, I mean both on the streaming side and on the merchandising or 
matching, which people tend to like which titles.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next 
question is from Scott Devitt at Morgan Stanley. We estimate Netflix' 
domestic sales will surpass through HBO in 2012. Ted Sarandos recently 
suggested that Netflix would aggressively bid for Warner Bros content. And 
Warner's current arrangement with HBO ex
pired in 2014. Given that HBO 
and Warner Bros. are owned by the same parent, a parent that has made 
several negative public comments about your business, could you explain 
the dynamics here and how it is possible that by bidding for the content, you 
could 
either get it or force HBO to pay more for it?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I'm not sure I agree on the negative
-
comments aspect. The press 
makes a living out of blowing some things up, and we're nearly $100 million 
a year customer for Warner Bros, and both of us w
ould like to expand that, 
if it makes sense to. In terms of specifically bidding on the Warner Bros. 
content, that may be advantageous for us and maybe that we end up again 
doing a share, where Warner Bros. makes more money than they would 
have otherwise a
nd both HBO and us have content, it could be a range of 
options in that. And clearly, they will make a strategic decision based upon 
the different interests of the different divisions, but they're quite comfortable 
having us bid on it. They're not trying t
o exclude us in any way.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Tony Wible at Janney Montgomery Scott. Do you 
believe that the move to variable
-
based distribution cost i.e. the FCC usage
-
base billing that has prompted some ISPs to consider tolling web
-
service 
companies, and the push to price content on a variable basis will 
fundamentally change the way Netflix prices or tiers its service.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, Tony, it's a risk, particularly if pay
-
per
-
gigabyte, pay
-
a
-
dollar
-
per
-
gigabyte type model for IS
Ps took hold. And so we will be involved in that 
debate. And again, since the cost of delivering a gigabyte are less than a 
$0.01 and falling, we don't think it's terribly likely, but we don't want to be 
asleep at the switch and just let it happen.
 
Deborah
 
Crawford
 
Second question from Tony. Do you expect Google, Amazon and/or Apple to 
be a more formidable competitor in 2011?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Definitely, there's a lot of firms, including the ones you mentioned that could 
be more direct competitor with us. The 
internet is creating a ton of 
opportunity for a lot of firms and there's all different models between the 
pay
-
per
-
view models for new releases, the ad
-
supported model. So there's a 
lot of different companies with different strengths. But as you know, we've
 
been through a lot of competition in the past. We view that as a natural part 
of the process and we're just focused on building our business as best as we 
can.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from John Blackledge at Crédit Suisse. What was the 
decli
ne in disk shipments per subscriber per month in Q4 on a year
-
over
-
year basis. I think in Q3, disk shipments were down 24% year
-
over
-
year. 
Just wondering if the declines were around the same level or accelerating?
 
Reed Hastings
 
John, we don't publish shipm
ent information like that. I'm not sure where 
you got the Q3 quote. What we said in the letter and, I'll remind you is, disk 
shipments did actually continue to grow, they just grew a lower rate than we 
expected. And going into the fourth quarter, we alread
y knew that we're 
going to offer a price change and a new plan offering on the streaming
-
only 
plan starting in late November. There was some uncertainty around the take 
rate on that plan and how that would affect our disk shipments. And so we 
were a little
 
bit conservative in terms of planning out the number of 
shipments and I think you see that reflected in lower shipments.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Nat Schindler at BofA Merrill. The comments in the 
text about charging for multiple 
streams per account is somewhat confusing 
to me. Are you planning to only limit the $7.99 plan to a single stream? Or 
are you expecting to limit all plans to a single stream at a time?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Both the $9.99 1
-
out DVD and the $7.99 are one stream at 
the time. And 
the vast majority of subscribers are on one of those two plans. So you could 
think of it as a vast majority of subscribers are on a one
-
stream at a time 
plan. So as we develop models around upgrades and how do you get either 
multiple streams 
on an account or multiple accounts or subaccounts, those 
are the kinds of things that we'll be testing and evolving over the coming 
quarters.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Justin Patterson at Morgan Keegan. With regard to 
your experience in Ca
nada, how is the tracking versus your initial 
expectations? What's been your biggest challenge in the region? What 
lessons have you learned that you can take to additional international 
markets?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think the main lesson we've learned is confid
ence in the model. We were 
really unclear as to how well and aggressively priced on
-
demand Internet 
service would work. Without all the DVD and brand history, could we get a 
cost
-
efficient marketing and get subscribers to sign up? And in fact, we've 
proven
 
ourselves that at least within the conditions in Canada that, that is 
indeed very possible, and we've been very happy with the growth. And so 
then we'll take on a little bit bigger challenge and we've learned mostly to 
have confidence in the model of on
-
d
emand streaming.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is from Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities. How long do 
you expect fixed
-
price contracts to be offered? Do you foresee a migration to 
a cost per subscriber model much as is used by cable companies in deali
ng 
with content providers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Michael, that's a possibility but it's not very likely. I think what is happening 
is the contracts 
--
 
some of the contracts are short, a year or two. And so you 
can think of fixed cost for a year or two is really ju
st a high granularity 
variable contract based upon the size. And so, I would guess that it would go 
that way. We definitely agree with the model that as we grow bigger, any 
individual piece of content is more valuable to us and we'll end up paying 
more for
 
it. But I think the form will be upon renewals of shorter
-
term deals.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question from Youssef Squali at Jefferies. Could you speak to net 
neutrality in Europe?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Youssef, net neutrality is a pretty strong concept in 
Europe. So no, no 
significant risks there. The aspect of the open regional, no charges 
interchange, however, is less strongly accepted, and that's probably the big 
issue, which is can ISPs charge content providers like YouTube and Netflix 
and Amazon, a sig
nificant fee to serve their customers? And so that's 
probably where that interest and the friction will be?
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question from Peter Treadway at EMS Capital. What do you think the 
operating margin potential of the company is at maturity? H
ow do you think 
about the range of outcomes?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Peter, in prior calls, what I've said is the long term even maturity operating 
margins in an industry are really determined by the number of competitors. 
So if there's three or four roughly equal
-
s
ized competitors at maturity, you'd 
expect pretty low operating margins. If there's one firm that's the leading 
firm in the market, you'd expect higher operating margins. So it really 
depends upon the competitive climate as supposed to something inherent i
n 
the cost structure.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
The next question is from Andy Hargreaves at Pacific Crest Securities. As 
your subscriber base grows and subs stream more content, are you 
concerned about running into the limits of total bandwidth availability in a 
g
iven geography?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Oh, gosh. Not at all. We recently did a calculation about fiber optics and 
what we discovered is that a single fiber optic, about the size of a human 
hair, because of the advances in dense weight division multiplexing (sic) 
[d
ense wavelength division multiplexing] can now carry all 100% of the 
Netflix traffic. So if we had a single data center where all the bits came out 
of, it could comfortably go out in a single fiber. And furthermore, the 
improvements in the next three years
 
expected in fiber optics are increasing 
that number. So I would say the rate of innovation in data transmission, 
especially on fiber, is greatly outstripping any growth that we could possibly 
get to.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
Next question is a follow
-
up question 
from Brian Fitzgerald at UBS, following 
up on the declining disc shipment question. In the letter you say, and that 
you expect disc shipments to decline year
-
over
-
year in the coming quarters. 
Is this the first time you pointed to this? Did you move this in
flection point 
forward?
 
David Wells
 
Brian, this is David. Yes, it is the first time that we've talked about this. And 
it's largely a function of plan mix, the streaming offer, streaming
-
only plan 
offering and just the embrace of the streaming
-
only offering
 
service in 
general.
 
Deborah Crawford
 
That's the last question I have. We'd like to thank everyone for your time, 
and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

10/22/10,Netflix,"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Netflix First Quarter 2012 Earnings 
Q&A Session. Today's call is being recorded.
 
At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the 
call over to Ellie Mertz, Vice President of Finance and 
Investor Relations. 
Please go ahead.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to the Netflix First Quarter 2012 
Earnings Q&A Session. I'm joined here by Reed Hastings, CEO; and David 
Wells, CFO. We announced our financial results for the 
first quarter at 
approximately 1 p.m. Pacific Time today. The shareholder letter and the Q1 
financial results and the webcast of this Q&A session are all available at the 
company's Investor Relations website at ir.netflix.com.
 
As is our standard practice, 
we will begin the call with questions we received 
via email. Please email your questions to ir@netflix.com. After email Q&A, 
we will also open up the phone lines in queue for additional questions not 
covered by the email Q&A or letter. The dial
-
in number i
s within our investor 
letter, but let me repeat it now. Please call (760) 666

to get into the queue.
 
We may make forward
-
looking statements during this call regarding the 
company's future performance. Actual results may differ materi
ally from 
these statements due to risks and uncertainties related to the business. A 
detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties is contained in our filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report 
on Form 10

with the commission on February 10, 2012. A 
rebroadcast of this Q&A session will be available at the Netflix website after 
6 p.m. Pacific Time today.
 
Now let's move directly to questions.
 
Question
-
and
-
Answer Session
 
Ellie Mertz
 
[Operator Instructions] For
 
the first topic we'll take questions on is domestic 
streaming. First question. Why are you so confident that gross add trends 
result from seasonality and not slowing growth? How can you be confident in 
7 million net additions for the year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
W
ell, we had a fantastic Q1, adding nearly 3 million members to our global 
subscriber base. We had strong results in all of our territories, including the 
U.S. Our gross adds are consistent with our historic patterns. Our churn is 
consistent with our histor
ic patterns, and we're feeling very good about the 
year. If you look at adding 7 million net adds, which is our target for the 
year, and you compare that to 2010 where we also added 7 million net adds, 
in 2010, that was 7 million on top of 12 million start
ing members. This year, 
that 7 million on top of 22 million starting members. If the mathematical 
effect, if that's true, with steady churn, that in adding 7 million on top of 12 
million versus 7 million on top of 22 million, that there will be a significa
ntly 
increased seasonality of net additions. So the business is performing exactly 
as we had hoped. We are continuing to execute on all of the key dimensions. 
But the artifact of having 7 million net adds on 22 million increases the 
seasonality relative to
 
2010, and we tried to demonstrate that or illustrate 
that in our appendix showing this phenomenon. So everything is consistent 
with what we've been hoping for, and so that's why we feel good about the 
year, continuing like this. It's probably secondarily 
all of the macro factors 
are very good, which is broadband is continuing. We're getting better and 
better content. Viewing is at record levels, and consumers want click and 
watch on
-
demand Netflix Internet television.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
A follow
-
up question to th
at. What will be the earliest indicators that you can 
or can't achieve that 7 million net U.S. streaming subs goal for 2012?
 
David Wells
 
I think the earliest indicators will be our net additions in Q2 going into Q3. 
So when looking at as we continue to see
 
the same net addition rate both 
with the strength of the new members that we're bringing on to the space 
and the user engagement that we see both with new members and existing 
members, if those trends continue forward, we would expect to be 
continually co
nfident in our ability to add 7 million members.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can you discuss the rate within the quarter of subscriber additions or their 
seasonality within the quarter?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Those seasonality, if you want, there's variation month
-
to
-
month, week
-
t
o
-
week that follows pretty typical patterns. And all of those patterns have 
stayed consistent 
--
 
are going consistently. And again, the main 
consternation that we picked up is while the growth adds are steady and 
following the traditional seasonal patterns
, why is the net adds different? 
Why are the net adds diverging? And the answer is just a factor of, I'll 
slightly repeat myself of the math of, it's on top of 22 million instead of on 
top of 12 million that we tried to demonstrate in the appendix the way 
that 
works. Do you want to add anything in?
 
David Wells
 
No.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
We got another question on that. Churn spiked after the price increase but 
remains above historic levels. Will churn come down or is streaming
-
only 
structurally higher churn? Please ex
plain your rationale.
 
David Wells
 
Just on the prior question, too, I think the prior question asks narrowly what 
the seasonality in Q1. It follows the prior seasonal pattern, so just to make 
sure we answer that question. And then could you ask that questio
n one 
more time.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Sure. Churn spiked after the price increase but remains above historic levels. 
Will your churn come down or is streaming
-
only structurally higher churn? 
Please explain.
 
David Wells
 
What we said before is 
streaming
-
only does have a slightly higher churn rate 
than our DVD service did and sort of part of our legacy. It's easier to come 
in and out of that service than the DVD having the DVDs at home and 
having to mail them. We would anticipate that, that need 
continues forward. 
But we do retain subscribers that have been with us longer at higher rates 
than subscribers that join our service. So as the base ages, the retention 
rate 
--
 
the overall retention rate improves. Therefore, as the age basis, that 
retentio
n rate will improve just like it did with our DVD service.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How should we think about 2Q seasonality this year relative to last year 
when you added 1.8 million subscribers on a similar overall base?
 
Reed Hastings
 
In last year 2011, we were on tr
ack for 11 million or 12 million arguably net 
adds on a starting base of 19 million. And so that roughly parallels the 7 
million net adds on 12 million from 2010. And it's the ratio of net adds to a 
starting base that's different this year, and that's what
 
creates the variation 
in net additions. So this year, we're at 7 million 
--
 
targeting 7 million net 
additions on 22 million, and that's what's different from last year. So again, 
it comes back to the essentially these unintuitive math effects if you got 
c
onsistent churn across the year that the net adds seasonality increases. 
Again, the easiest way to see that is in the 3 tables at the very end of the 
letter where we've abstracted some examples to try to get comfortable with 
that phenomena. So we feel very
 
much that we're on track for the 7 million 
net additions for the year.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What's sort of the upside in contribution margins for the U.S. streaming 
business? Was there a timing issue associated with content cost?
 
David Wells
 
We talked about in the
 
letter streaming content costs were lower, some 
customer service costs were lower and the delivery costs were lower. On the 
content side, we actually were pretty close to what we expected in terms of 
expense. But because it's such a large number, if you'r
e slightly under that, 
it can be meaningful in terms of contribution margin. And most of what I 
saw was several small deals got pushed into Q2 or didn't close as of the end 
of the quarter.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Is the domestic streaming outlook tied at all to H.R. 2
471? Meaning, do you 
assume passage of this amendment at some point?
 
David Wells
 
H.R. 2471 is our bill to amend and improve and modernize the VPPA, and 
no, there's no assumption built into the numbers of that passing.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
At current churn levels, o
ver 20 million people will turn off the U.S. 
streaming service at some point. Are you concerned that the large number 
of people that are trying Netflix and unsubscribing will ultimately prevent 
you from reaching your target of 60 million to 90 million U.S.
 
subscribers? 
So alternatively, how much is churn if people are turning the service off and 
on repeatedly?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Lots of churn is people turning to service on and off. In other words, you join 
for 3 months, then you're not using it or you run out o
f money, so it's off for 
3 months, then it's back on. Because we only offer a free trial to new 
members, subscribers particularly who are economically sensitive, price 
sensitive, had an incentive to them to start Netflix again under a different 
email addre
ss than they've had before. So there's no real clean counting of 
that dimension. What we feel great about is the very strong growth adds, 
the churn that's in line with our historic trends. So we're feeling quite good 
about the numbers.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Question
 
on domestic cost. You priced your Q4 2012 domestic streaming 
contribution profit assumption to 17%. What's the biggest driver of that? Is 
it streaming content cost coming in lower than anticipated? Do you expect 
continued contribution margin expansion in 
2013?
 
David Wells
 
The biggest driver are deals that we thought would close slightly earlier than 
they did and that has a carryforward effect from Q1 to Q2. So I'd say that's 
the largest driver of that contribution margin outperformance.
 
Reed Hastings
 
And i
n terms of 2013, we haven't given any guidance. We would like to see 
100 basis points per quarter go on for as long as we can. But we're going to 
have to feel our way through that year
-
by
-
year.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In January 2012, Netflix indicated that over 2 bil
lion hours of content have 
been streamed globally in Q4. You alluded to continued growth in Q1 2012. 
Can you provide any more color as to the increase in streaming hours per 
sub per quarter sequentially?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There's a reasonable amount of seasona
lity in viewing times in the Northern 
climates due to long nights, so we really compare this on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis as opposed to sequentially. But I can tell you that Q1 was all
-
time 
record for us in total viewing and in viewing per members. But in Q2 
because of the seasonal, again, we'll compare that on a year
-
over
-
year 
basis.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
And then 2 question on profit outlook. Do you still anticipate net income 
losses for all of 2012, i.e., will losses in the fourth quarter international eat 
up the 
surprisingly high profit delivery in Q2 2012 and presumably through 
3Q 2012? Do you expect to lurk around breakeven in 2013 as you would 
reinvest domestic profits into international expansions?
 
David Wells
 
So I think we addressed this in the letter, but in
 
terms of Q2 profit 
expectation, if you take the midpoint of guidance, there's a modest net 
income profit. What we said is we would continue to launch international 
markets and stay about roughly breakeven. So with the Q4 launch, we 
would probably be facin
g a small loss rather than breakeven and then work 
our way back to breakeven.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Let's take the questions on content. Do you expect to slow the growth in 
U.S. streaming content spend? And do you believe there's a certain terminal 
amount of content
 
that is needed to sustain any number of subscribers, 
whether it be 25 million or 40 million subscribers? Said another way, do you 
think Netflix has to spend considerably more on content to grow from 25 
million to 40 million subscribers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
We'r
e growing content spend and content offering very aggressively going 
forward. And revenue is growing faster than that, so that's where we get the 
widening margin. But we have fractured 
--
 
a smallest fraction of the total 
amount of content that we would lik
e to eventually have. So we will continue 
to grow the investment in content quite aggressively, slightly less than the 
rate of revenue growth.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You secured the DreamWorks Animation output deal well before the 2013 
start date. Are there other stu
dio output contracts that are coming up for 
renewal such as Fox, Universal, Disney and Sony? Are these all beginning 
2014 or '15? Will they similarly be bid out well before the start date? Do 
existing pay cable channels have right of first refusal?
 
Reed Ha
stings
 
It's highly variable by deal 2014 to 2015 when most of them come up. And 
as far as I know, no one else has right of first refusal.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What is the current status of Epix content as it relates to exclusivity and 
what you intend to do going fo
rward?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Epix is on cable, and it's on EpixHD, which is a TV Everywhere extension of 
Epix and it's on Netflix. That's all that it's on right now. And then as we go 
forth with Epix, we're in a broad range of discussions with how to operate 
most 
effectively for both of us.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Here's a handful of questions about originals. How significant to overall 
views are exclusive or original content?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, the exclusive and original are 2 different things, so Breaking Bad's 
exclusive bu
t not original as an example. Originals are just beginning, so all 
we've got up is Lilyhammer. So it's not yet hugely significant. But as we add 
in the next couple originals coming later this year, that will builds to a nice 
percentage of our total viewing
.
 
David Wells
 
And I would say we look at the performance of those pieces of content like 
any other pieces of content in terms of cost per hours viewed and its 
efficiency. So across that class of content, we would expect to compare it 
against other like con
tent.
 
Reed Hastings
 
We think we can produce contents at no greater cost than that per hour of 
viewing essentially than it would cost to get license, and then we have the 
advantages of the brand halo as well as the defensive hedge if we need it 
over time.
 
E
llie Mertz
 
Can you discuss how successful Lilyhammer was? Maybe helping to place it 
in perspective for its views versus other shows?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It was quite successful for the amount that we invested in and the amount of 
the cost. And it parallels some 
of the other premium exclusive content which 
we've got, like the Breaking Bad, in terms of its ratio of cost to viewing. So 
we feel really good about that of our first shot out. And as House of Cards 
and the other originals that we have come forth next yea
r, we'll be very 
excited about those also.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Is the cost associated with originals will ramp in 2013? Any way we can 
quantify the impact of that?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's really just part of content cost, that is we'll spend in the 
neighborhood of 
single percentages of our total spending content spending for next year on a 
P&L basis with the originals. So for us, it's just another source of content.
 
David Wells
 
And I think what we said in the letter was that free cash flow, the cash 
will 
actually ramp as originals ramp into 2013. So the costs are already baked 
into our assumptions around content expenses. It's the cash that we'll ramp 
noticeably in the back half of the year.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Here are some more questions. Netflix appears in
creasingly focused on 
exclusivity, especially compared to 12 to 18 months ago. Should we expect 
the vast majority of your content to be exclusive by year end 2013? In turn, 
is it reasonable that content spending will continue to move notably higher 
next ye
ar, as well as due to healthy sub growth?
 
Reed Hastings
 
As we move up in the content buying economic strata, you start off with the 
kind of low
-
end, nonexclusive content. And then as you want to get shows 
like Mad Men, you have to outcompete with other cab
le networks to get 
those shows in syndication and those are exclusive licenses. And so we 
started doing more and more of those. As we want to do direct deals with 
movie studios, like DreamWorks Automation, that the other bidders will not 
take that content 
if we also have it. So those are de facto exclusive. So this 
exclusive trend has been going on towards more and more exclusive and will 
continue as we climb the economic strata and have better and better 
content. It's a natural outcome of us being a networ
k like other cable 
networks, all of which are exclusive against each other. I don't think we'll 
have all of our content exclusive really at any point in time because we'll 
continue to also have a broad range of nonexclusive content. But certainly, 
there'll
 
be more and more that is exclusive.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Can Netflix survive as a middleman? I define middleman as an intermediary 
between content owner and end user. Is the company's largely middleman 
status the reason for its apparent evolution to, at least in 
part, original 
programmer? How long do you think it will take to become a credible peer to 
HBO, which has had smash hit originals such as The Sopranos and Sex in 
the City?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, there are lots of middleman that are hugely successful in many 
d
ifferent industries. And sometimes, they verticalize the production and they 
have store brands for various items, and it doesn't mean that they're 
middleman or retail status is weakened. They do that to strengthen 
themselves. And if you think about HBO, in
itially it was on almost all licensed 
content and then they grew in as they gain scale to also doing produced 
content. But still, a majority of HBO's budget is on content produced by 
others, by the major studios. So yes, we feel very comfortable about bein
g 
an aggregator that packages together an incredible set of content to provide 
a great value for consumers and that's a great position to be in.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
What is the balance of streaming content as of 3/31/2012, that are not 
currently reflected on the b
alance sheet?
 
David Wells
 
I think that's referring to the content and contractual obligations. And at the 
end of Q1, that was $3.7 billion, which compares to $3.9 billion as of the end 
of 2011 and $1.8 billion a year ago. So it's down slightly from the end
 
of the 
year as we moved content from that table on to the balance sheet, and that 
it became a window essentially in that asset recognition criteria.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Now just as a follow
-
up to that. If you include what's in that note to the 
financials, if you 
add up the accounts table, you'd see that our total 
minimum commitment for streaming content is flat quarter
-
over
-
quarter.
 
The biggest complaint I hear is that Netflix has a weak library of streaming 
content. While keeping pricing low is a strategy that se
ems to be working 
well, it prohibits this very common complaint from being addressed. Has 
Netflix proposed the idea of a tiered subscription plan for online access? Is 
silver, gold and platinum plan, which would open up a increasingly larger 
and more popul
ar library, could both address this issue and increase 
profitability? Has this ever been considered?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. We're very focused on keeping our proposition extremely simple. We 
think that, that is the right strategy when we're in this rapid phase 
of growth 
of the market, to have a single, paid dollar unlimited product in the 
marketplace. Eventually, in the next curve model, in the tail phase when the 
market matures, then you'll look to segment in various ways. But knock on 
wood, we're a long way fr
om that, and we'll continue to focus for the 
foreseeable future on a clean, simple proposition.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Cable ratings from many networks have declined this year. Do you believe 
networks are attributing this to Internet TV? And could it impact pricing o
n 
renegotiating TV content deals?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, I'm not sure why cable network ratings are 
--
 
some are up and some are 
down. I think it's mostly due with the individual programming. If you've got 
incredible programming, there's several examples where t
he ratings are up. 
And in terms of how it affects us, we've got the ability to pay because we've 
got a larger subscriber base than anybody else. So to the degree that the 
prices are higher, we're still able to deliver on the consumer proposition.
 
Ellie Mer
tz
 
Well, just some questions about competition. Are you still thinking Amazon 
will do a stand
-
alone streaming product outside of Prime?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Our understanding is that it will still happen, yes. In terms of particular time 
frame, we're not sure 
on what that might be.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
You talked a lot about net neutrality. What do you see is the most realistic 
and/or likely path towards enforcement of net neutrality?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I'm not sure at this point. I think we're broadly socializing the 
idea of 
what's neutral and what's not, and we documented one clear example where 
we think this is not at all neutral. And we're engaged in a public discussion, 
essentially, of the issues. So we'll see how that plays out.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Three related questions
. Why are you so concerned about Comcast and 
bandwidth caps? If 1 hour of streaming time takes up a mere gigabit of 
bandwidth, and the Comcast monthly bandwidth cap is 250 gigabit, implying 
8.3 hours per day of viewing time. Why the concern, especially if 
you believe 
that the Netflix streaming product is vastly superior to Xfinity?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think the concern we have is with the principles of net neutrality. 
Obviously, with a high enough cap, it kind of doesn't matter. But if 
something is accept
ed with one cap, we may find the next year that the cap 
is much lower. And so I think we have to really start to figure out the 
principles and advocate for those upon which we're all operating. I would 
agree. It's not a near
-
term issue with the 250 gigabyt
e cap. But the core 
principle is important anyway, which is the cap should be applied equally or 
not at all.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
I was wondering what Netflix will do to increase and hold existing subscriber 
base in the U.S. and elsewhere with so many other compani
es entering the 
streaming video business.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, I think what's happening is everyone's realizing that consumers want 
click and watch on
-
demand, and so there is a lot of announcements of 
everything from start ups to large companies. And we've 
been focused on 
this market for a very long time and have some substantial advantages 
because of that in terms of the breadth of our integration in the various 
devices, in terms of our on the remote control buttons that we have on 
Smart TVs, in terms of ou
r integration into all of the game consoles. We 
have big advantages in terms of the development of our website in the core 
service, the algorithms and the personalization. We have incredible content. 
It's not as broad as we'll eventually have, but it's muc
h broader than any 
competitor. So often what happens is when there's a lot of attention on the 
market, there are new competitors, but the leader gets the majority of the 
benefit of that and it's our job to continue to deliver for consumers so that 
we're ch
osen more often than anybody else.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Let's turn to questions about international. What have you learned from 
existing market launches that you apply to as thought process of selecting 
your next international market that you've indicated will laun
ch in Q4 this 
year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, we've been really happy with the U.K. and Ireland, just great results 
there. We've got great results in Canada. And in Latin America, we'll get 
there eventually, but it's going to be long going harder than we initial
ly 
thought. So we'll tend to be more towards developed markets that are more 
like Canada, U.K. and Ireland than strong emerging markets like Latin 
America.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Your international expense guidance on January's Q4 call forecast $5 million 
for subtitl
ing. Yet your release today, only months later, says your incentive 
capitalized such expenses. Why change from passive media expensing to a 
more aggressive income presentation?
 
David Wells
 
The costs were immaterial in the past. They rose in Q1 as we talked
 
about in 
the letter, getting more towards 100% of our offering in Latin America 
subtitles. So we faced increased cost in Q1. And the prospect as we launch 
additional non
-
English markets is that these costs will be material. So from 
an accounting standpoin
t, when your low, it don't matter. You don't have a 
policy. When they become material and in bulk, they are material and they 
stay material, there's more argument that they'll be capitalized. And we look 
at this and we needed to create a policy in Q1, and 
we didn't have that 
accounted in our forecast.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Question on Latin America. Latin America, we fully understand the 
limitations of infrastructure, credit cards and broadband hindering uptick. 
What I would like to know is what about the progress th
ere that gives you 
confidence that it will succeed, albeit at the slower pace than you had 
initially expected as opposed to not work at all?
 
Reed Hastings
 
In Latin America, we're seeing a very nice revenue growth. It's just not as 
fast as we anticipated in
 
terms of catching up to the content. So if there was 
a situation where we didn't have revenue growth, that would worry us, but 
that's not the situation that we have. We're seeing very nice revenue 
growth, and we're continuing to improve whether it's payme
nt, whether it's 
the streaming delivery, all the other systems. And second, there's no 
competitor that's ahead of us. If we were would then be beaten in some 
nation by some other competitor, that would have us maybe rethink how 
long would it take us to get
 
to profitability. But again, that hasn't happened. 
So for now, we've got a rapidly growing business. It's still running at a loss, 
and it's going to take longer, we think, than 2 years to get there. But the 
vectors are all in the right direction.
 
Ellie Me
rtz
 
Could the iTunes integration be extended beyond Apple TV to iPhones and 
iPads, too, in order to ameliorate the e
-
commerce payment problems in 
Latin America and elsewhere?
 
Reed Hastings
 
There's a number of integrations we could do. One would be in 
the iTunes 
aspect, others would be with ISPs, others would be with cable companies. So 
we're looking at those broadly, and each one will have small, positive 
effects. There will be no one breakthrough or silver bullet.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
I would just add, as we s
ay in the letter, we're obviously opened to other 
people billing on our behalf. But also in Latin America, we're looking to 
improve the payment options that we offer to the consumers and solve the 
problem ourselves.
 
The letter said you were looking to expa
nd into additional European markets 
beginning in Q4 of this year. If you can't be more specific, can you talk 
about the characteristics of that market?
 
Reed Hastings
 
I think that's probably just a duplicate question, so let's just go to the next 
one.

What is the incremental impact of your decision to enter another 
international market on the expected full year results for 2012 on a 
consolidated basis? Should we see an investment along the lines of Latin 
America and the U.K. or smaller?
 
David Wel
ls
 
We haven't provided guidance on that. What I said earlier was that we would 
be looking to fight back to a global consolidated breakeven after the market 
launch in Q4.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
How are you funding the entry and expansion into each country? And how 
man
y additional countries planned for this year and next?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well fundamentally, we're funding it with the domestic profit stream. So our 
domestic business is showing great new growth in both revenue and 
contribution margin. And so we're using thos
e profits to fund the 
international expansion, and it's needed by that by our view of staying 
approximately breakeven on a global basis.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Has your view of international competition changed in recent months?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, not particularly. We
 
anticipated that in markets that we don't get to for a 
few years, there will be stronger local competition than in markets we get to 
soon. So I think that's probably pretty obvious. That's really the only aspect 
of it.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Do you expect to see any
 
different seasonal patterns in international 
markets? I know they're not showed today because of the high
-
growth 
phase you're in. But I would still like to know if there are any quarters with 
tailwinds or headwinds?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well, from a diversificat
ion standpoint, if we were as big in the southern 
hemisphere as northern, they would balance each other. So it's definitely 
linked to the length of the winter, length of the night. And it would be 
--
 
and 
is reverse seasonality from the northern hemisphere 
and the southern. But 
on a practical basis, with the U.S. just under 90% of the business, it's the 
dominant aspect of the U.S. seasonality.
 
David Wells
 
And I would say that the pronounced weather pattern is one aspect of it. But 
as we contemplate other mar
kets, we look at the seasonal TV viewing 
behavior, the seasonal rental behavior on video
-
on
-
demand and things like 
that. I mean some of these countries are tropical. They don't have a 
pronounced winter or summer, and they may follow the same pattern in 
ter
ms of the northern hemisphere, but it's early to tell.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
While the sub trajectory in the U.K. appears far better than in Latin America 
initially, can you give us a sense of what usage looks like? How much time 
are U.K. subscribers spending with t
he service?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Usage has been very strong. I don't want to give, for competitive reasons, 
specific numbers. But we've been very pleased with the active usage and 
growing usage as we add more and more content and continue to flush out 
the 
devices in particular to getting on the Smart TVs.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to some questions on DVD. Why are you so confident that the DVD 
will not fall off as fast going forward as it is in the past couple of quarters? 
Even if churn is going down, is it not ge
tting hard to find new gross additions 
for DVD films?
 
David Wells
 
We're confident because the retention of those subscribers are 
--
 
is 
improving from Q4 to Q1, and we may see some seasonality around Q2. But 
in general, the number of subscribers we're losin
g on the hybrid side are not 
the step change that we experienced from Q4 to Q1, largely because people 
were deciding whether or not they wanted to pay $16 for a hybrid service 
when we made the changes in July and they sort of rationalize those 
decisions ov
er Q3 and Q4. So increasingly, fewer and fewer people are 
having to make that decision or have already made that decision about 
whether it's a value to them to pay $16 for the service, and that's what 
drives largely the sort of decreasing rate of decline.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
With the Qwikster episode fresh in mind, but also considering the high 
overall cost of DVD shipping, would you consider spinning off or selling the 
DVD division? The cash could be put towards faster overseas expansion, 
maybe the DVD and streami
ng services could still be tightly coupled with the 
right contracts in place?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No, we're not thinking of that.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Moving to some miscellaneous questions. Are the terms of your Apple TV 
deals, the new member sign
-
ups, similar to the 30
% revenue Apple has with 
other content providers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Those type of contracts we're prevented from commenting by confidentiality, 
so we can't say.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
In late November, you announced the closing of $200 million worth of 
convertible notes,
 
and those could be converted after 6 months assuming 
certain conditions were met. The 6th month anniversary will end during the 
second quarter. Given that the shares appeared to be above the conversion 
price, do you expect these shares to be converted? An
d if so, when?
 
Yes, so the first convertible, 6 months after its issuance which was 
November, which places us in May, the company has the option of 
converting those shares at 30% over the conversion price, which is about 
$11. And the earliest we could do..
.
 
Reed Hastings
 
$111.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
$111. Thank you. The earliest we could do that would be July if the stocks 
had stayed above that price for 50 of the prior 65 trading days.
 
What should we assume for forward tax assumptions?
 
David Wells
 
Around 38%.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
And higher in Q2?
 
David Wells
 
Correct, sorry. It'll play a little bit as we...
 
Reed Hastings
 
We should be so lucky to be paying taxes.
 
David Wells
 
I was just about to say that, that rate moves around a little as we come 
from a loss into a 
profit perspective at around 38%.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Great. That's all we have right now for email questions. So at this time, I'd 
like to turn it back over to the operator and we'll begin taking live call

I'll ask 2 questions and I'm not sure what was hit. With respect to what you 
talked about with Apple TV now taking sign ups from the TV,
 
should we 
assume that you're paying similar 30% revenue share with Apple and that's 
kind of taking into account when you think about adding customers that 
way? And then my second question, you kind of had a positive take on the 
social integration, the U.K
. and Ireland, but didn't give any specific metric. 
I'm wondering if there's any other type of metrics you can give out for us 
and maybe what percent of users are uptaking the social functions?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Jason, it's Reed. We did just answer the Apple q
uestion, which was no 
comment. And then on the U.K. Facebook success we've had, we haven't 
characterized any specific metrics, and for competitive reasons, we're not 
further elaborating.

And th
en maybe one other follow
-
up. That functionality offering in the U.K., 
is that more a passive functionality? So does it seem like a Spotify or is an 
active sharing functionality with users prompted each time to decide whether 
or not they want to share thei
r viewing habits?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's passive in the way that you used that word like Spotify U.S. if you're 
using that where your viewing history is optionally shared with your friends.

Two questions. I think, Reed, last fall in reaction to some of the controversy, 
I think you made a statement that you think it might take a while for the 
brand and the relations and the trust with consumers to buil
d back up. When 
you think about your DVD, streaming net adds goal of 7 million for the year, 
what you've done year
-
to
-
date, do you think you've already overcome some 
of those concerns that backlash from the fall of last year? Or do you think 
that that's st
ill a subdued growth number that you could do better once 
you've regained the full trust of consumers? And then could you just quickly 
talk about usage on tablet devices and if that's had a material impact on 
those overall viewing minutes?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Th
e brand recovery is partway complete. We had said it would probably take 
3 years with the bulk of the recovery in the first year. That still seems to us 
to be the correct model. So we're feeling good about the progress we've 
made. We do 
--
 
we are conscious
 
that it's tender and that we have to be 
extremely diligent and thoughtful in the way that we act as we build back 
our brand reputation. And then in terms of tablet, it's a great and growing 
viewing source for us, but we haven't characterized with any spec
ifics any of 
the particular devices, again, for competitive reasons. We are on both 
Android and iPad.

Next questioner in queue is Richard Greenfield with BTIG.

With consumers using Netflix so much,
 
I think the numbers you broke out 
essentially equate to over an hour per day actually now. Shouldn't churn be 
going down meaningfully? When you made that comment about in 2012, if 
you added 7 million subs assuming flattish churn, why shouldn't we see 
chur
n go significantly down now that usage per customer per month or even 
per day just continues to scale upwards? And if just as a follow
-
up to that, 
can you just give us some sense on where subscribers canceling now, what 
is the main reason people are cancel
ing the streaming
-
only service?
 
Reed Hastings
 
So Rich, the average consumer is watching, as you said, nearly an hour a 
day, and then they're not canceling. So the cancelations is amongst the 
people who aren't watching much. So our job is to get those light
 
users that 
are not very active to be watching more. And the other phenomena is as the 
service gets better known and more popular, that expands the circle of 
people who join it, who maybe aren't as much in entertainment as the initial 
20 million or 25 mill
ion. And so it's natural that as the service expands its 
reach, that there is continued churn as people try it, figure out if it's for 
them right now and if not, they get off. So that's where that phenomena is 
from.
 
Richard Greenfield

BTIG, LLC,

Does that imply that the median is dramatically above the mean in terms of 
usage?
 
Reed Hastings
 
No. It's just that it's 
--
 
it's not exactly a bell curve because it's got the skew 
on the big end. But it's the median is not wildly different
. It's just that there 
will be 20% of people that don't watch much, and most of the churn will 
come from them. And you asked the question, when people quit, what do 
they cite? And the 2 big ones are not watching enough and don't have any 
money, which we se
e also.
 
Richard Greenfield 
-
 
BTIG, LLC, Research Division
 
And when you say not watching enough, is that just because the 
programming, they can't find something they like? Or there just isn't enough 
content in total?
 
Reed Hastings
 
It's a mix of those. If yo
u think about the moments of truth for a member, 
at any point in time, they can watch Netflix or they can watch cable or they 
can watch their DVR, they can watch a DVD or they can watch Hulu. And we 
have to win enough of those moments of truth to keep the 
subscriber active. 
And one of the ways we win is that a really broad selection, personalization, 
ease
-
of
-
use and otherwise it's just a habit, like being able to see the red 
Netflix button on the remote control.

DiClemente with Barclays.

Barclays Capital, Research Division
 
Reed, you just mentioned that one of the big reasons for churn is people not 
having any money. So I wonder if you would consider that if extreme picks, 
for example, of $4
.99 and let's say Amazon comes out with a carve
-
out 
prime streaming service at something lower than $7.99, have you thought 
about or would you consider adjusting your price point? And then the second 
question would be, I think Mark asked about usage on tab
lets. And I would 
just ask, has the subscriber acquisition channel changed with the explosion 
in mobile? Is that something that you can comment on in terms of where 
you're getting gross add connects from? That would be great as well.
 
Reed Hastings
 
We're fe
eling great about our $8 dollar price because we can then get lots 
and lots of content for our subscribers, so no anticipated changes there. And 
then in terms of subscriber acquisition, mobile is a good source for us. Video 
is disproportionately watched on
 
television. So things that are TV
-
based 
sign
-
up, like on the game consoles, like Apple TV are really the brand center 
and the biggest drivers of potential opportunities.
 
David Wells
 
Anthony, this is David. That hasn't changed, right. That's consistent wit
h 
what we've said in prior quarters, and that's not a big acquisition driver. It's 
a big value driver for our subscribers.

I w
as just wondering if you could give us a sense of what, just purely on a 
relative basis, if you see any difference in the levels of churn between your 
users that are engaging you through multiple devices like connected 
television sets, tablets, handsets ve
rsus your more PC or kind of game 
console customers?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Yes. It's exactly is your intuition is probably leading you, which is if you use 
Netflix on lots of devices and if you use it for lots of time, you're more 
engaged with the service and you 
are less likely to churn. So that's definitely 
an indicator.
 
David Wells
 
Heath, this is David. Teasing out people who don't use it a lot but have a lot 
of connected devices, that's probably not a common case. So people who 
use a lot of devices tend to watc
h a lot of hours.

Just wanted to ask about the deleverage in the DVD business. I mean is that 
just purely about the declining sub numbe
rs, or is there anything else we 
should be thinking about here? And how are you thinking about distribution 
centers going forward? And any other costs you may be able to take out of 
the business along the way?
 
David Wells
 
This is David. I'll take that 
one. I would say that in general in the DVD 
business, the big driver is the rate of subscriber decline. There's some other 
smaller things out there like postage rates and the fact that we would expect 
an annual postal increase going forward, which we have 
in the past. I would 
say the other aspects are there's some minor things on just as you reduce 
shipments, you lose some scale advantages, but those are small relative to 
the subscriber decline. And that's why we put in the letter that we would 
expect that 
the margin would stay relatively flat through 2012.

Two questions. The first one is, do you feel like the 7 million net domest
ic 
streaming add guide is a comfortable target? And did you guys consider 
maybe giving a range for the year similar to the range that you gave on a 
quarterly basis? That's one. And then the second one is, what's the demand 
for personalized accounts domesti
cally, and is that something we may see 
introduced at some point?
 
Reed Hastings
 
John, yes, we're feeling comfortable on the 7 million, and you could put a 
range on it if you want, but it doesn't really change the goal. So we were 
just being straightforward
 
about what our goal is. And in terms of the 
personalized accounts, that's something that we're developing a number of 
versions of. We'll be doing some consumer testing with different versions of 
that going forward. But there's unlikely to be any revenue a
ssociated with 
that, and that is we're most focused on how do we improve the experience 
and we'll see that in retention and acquisition at this point.

Just wanted to ask the 7 million sub question a different way. When you go 
back to 2010 when you added the 7 million subs you had 2 things, the 
bundled product at $9.99 and pretty significant distribution tailwind because 
of mostly the ga
me consoles that were coming online and just starting to 
benefit the business. So when you look at that 7 million number for '12, 
what are you thinking are the comparable catalysts that give you the 
comfort to get to that type of sub numbers for the year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Scott, I would say it's mostly based on how we did in Q1 and then which 
helps us feel good about being on track for that 7 million. And then 
secondarily, in terms of the macro climate, it's the increased integration with 
Smart TVs. So if you 
go into a Best Buy today, we've got a stronger 
presence than we've ever had in the integration with both Smart TVs and 
Blu

One quick one and then one broader. To understand the net income view for 
the balance of the year, when you talked about global breakeven with the 
fourth quarter launch of an international market, is that breakeven for the 
fourth quart
er or breakeven for the year?
 
Reed Hastings
 
You can think about it as breakeven on some rolling basis or approximately 
breakeven on some rolling basis, or it's 
--
 
we'll go under and then come up 
and go under and then come up. But ordinarily and when I made
 
that 
comment, it was on the quarter.
 
Barton E. Crockett 
-
 
Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division
 
Okay. So you're not saying breakeven for the year. You're not really saying 
anything about the year, I guess, at this point?
 
Reed Hastings
 
That's corre
ct.
 
Barton E. Crockett 
-
 
Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division
 
Okay. And then I was also wondering, the surge in streaming usage, you 
guys ever have had your 
--
 
a very significant share of prime time hours 
streaming content. Are you seeing any noti
ceable deterioration in quality of 
service to consumers? There are cable companies that warned about 
brownouts in hours as you see video surge. There's another streaming 
services coming up. Do you see any negative performance to the quality of 
your service
, or do you anticipate anything as your usage ramps as others 
ramp?
 
Reed Hastings
 
Barton, the technology underlying the Internet and fiber optics is absolutely 
mind blowing. So you can take our peak viewing on a Saturday night, 100% 
of our global 
viewing, and it can still fit into a single fiber optic. So I don't 
anticipate any brownouts. I anticipate continued growth of the broadband 
power being released as more and more become 
--
 
we become a fiber optic 
nation and a fiber optic world.
 
David 
Wells
 
I would add to that, Barton, that you're starting to see the ISPs compete on 
speed. It's in their ad 
--
 
prominently featured in their advertising. So it 
would feel a little inconsistent to be trying to advertise and compete on 
speed at the same time 
warning your consumers that you're going to face 
shortages of the product.
 
Ellie Mertz
 
Great. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'm going to turn it 
back over to Reed Hastings for some closing remarks.
 
Reed Hastings
 
Well thanks, everyone. As
 
I've said in the beginning, we had a great Q1. We 
were thrilled by it in terms of our U.K. launch, in terms of our growth around 
the world, in terms of getting to great viewing records in Q1, and we're on 
track for breaking those records in Q2 on a year
-
o
ver
-
year basis, so we're 
excited about that. The odd thing about our numbers, I realized, is that with 
stable seasonality in gross adds, we see increased seasonality in net adds, 
and that is this mathematical artifact that we try to document. I know it's 
g
ot some people concerned, but we feel great about our progress and being 
on track for our 7 million net adds for the year.
 
With that, I want to thank everyone for being on the call and look forward to 
catching up with you.
